Page finding Rodriguez ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under former Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed in 1996). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">On September 11, 1996, Rodriguez pled guilty to criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree, for which he received a sentence of two-to-four-years\u2019 imprisonment. At the time of his guilty plea, the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), signed into law on April 24, 1996, barred aliens convicted of an aggravated felony from eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief from deportation. <em>See </em>AEDPA \u00a7 440(d). However, the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d did not encompass Rodriguez\u2019s conviction. On September 30, 1996, soon after Rodriguez pleaded guilty, the President signed into law the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (\u201cIIR-IRA\u201d). IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a)(3) amended the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) to include theft convictions for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year, thus encompassing Rodriguez\u2019s conviction. Rodriguez argues that retroactive application of IIRIRA\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to preclude him from eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief under AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) violates due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review this question of law <em>de novo. See Evangelista v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 145, 154 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">To the extent Rodriguez argues that retroactive application of IIRIRA\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d is unconstitutional because he lacked fair notice of the consequences of his conviction at the time of his plea, the argument is without merit. Rodriguez recognizes, as he must, that the amended definition of aggravated felony is explicitly retroactive. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 321(b) (making the amended definition applicable \u201cregardless of whether the conviction was entered before, on, or after the date of enactment of this paragraph\u201d). In <em>Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93 (2d Cir.2001), we declined to address the alien\u2019s argument that retroactive application of IIRIRA\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>set his expectations because \u201cCongress has made explicit that the new provisions of IIRIRA should apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111. We further concluded that application of IIRIRA\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to make an alien removable for an offense that predated the statute\u2019s enactment does not violate due process or the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12. In <em>Brown v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 346, 353 (2d Cir.2004), we extended <em>Kuhali </em>to permit retroactive application of the amended definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to an alien\u2019s convictions by guilty plea in 1994, two years before IIRIRA was enacted, for purposes of determining his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief subject to restrictions contained in the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978. As in <em>Kuhali </em>and <em>Brown, </em>we conclude that the BIA did not err in applying IIRIRA\u2019s amended definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to Rodriguez\u2019s September 1996 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">To the extent Rodriguez argues that retroactive application of the amended definition to deny his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief lacks rational basis, this argument is also unavailing. <em>See Kuhali, </em>266 F.3d at 111 (\u201cCongress has a legitimate interest in protecting society from the commission of aggravated felonies ... and legislation that deports aliens who presently commit or who have committed those acts in the past is a rational means of furthering that interest.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cCongress also has a narrower and equally legitimate interest in expeditiously removing dangerous aliens from the country, and uniform application of the new statute to remove <em>all </em>aliens convicted of certain offenses rationally furthers that purpose as well.\u201d); <em>see also Rojas-Reyes v. INS, </em>235 F.3d 115, 122 (2d Cir.2000) (stating that \u201cthe purpose need only be rational\u201d for retroactive application of an immigration statute to be constitutional under the due process clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. Section 304(b) of IIRIRA also repealed former INA \u00a7 212(c) entirely. However, the Supreme Court concluded that, in contrast to IIRIRA \u00a7 321(b), Congress did not unambiguously indicate its intention for the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) retroactively. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). It therefore held that \u201d\u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens, like respondent, whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 319 &amp; n. 43, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (recognizing that \u00a7 321(b) makes the amended definition of aggravated felony explicitly retroactive and stating that it \"deal[sj with subjects quite closely related to \u00a7 304(b)\u2019s elimination of \u00a7 212(c) relief for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
