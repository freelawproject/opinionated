Domenico does not appeal his conviction, nor does he raise an issue under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The district court imposed a sentence enhancement for a prior \u201ccrime of violence\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Domenico claims his prior conviction in August of 2004, under Montana\u2019s Partner or Family Member Assault statute, Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-206 (2004), for an altercation involving his spouse, is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). We review the district court\u2019s determination that Domenico\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence <em>de novo. Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>United States v. Hermoso-Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In reviewing whether an offense constitutes a crime of violence, we first use a categorical approach. <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 600-02,110 S.Ct. 2143. Under this approach, Domenico\u2019s 2004 conviction for Partner or Family Member Assault qualifies as a crime of violence only if the full range of conduct covered by Montana Code \u00a7 45-5-206 (2004) falls within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">(a) The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-13\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-14\">(2) ... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">Domenico\u2019s 2004 Montana conviction was for Felony Partner or Family Member Assault. The governing statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC-\">(1) A person commits the offense of partner or family member assault if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-16\">(a) purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to a partner or family member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-17\">(b) negligently causes bodily injury to a partner or family member with a weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-18\">(c) purposely or knowingly causes reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in a partner or family member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-19\">Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-206 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-20\">There is no case directly on point. We need not decide, however, whether a conviction under the Montana statute is categorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). In cases where, as here, the full range of conduct covered by the statute of conviction includes conduct that may not fall within the meaning of a crime of violence, we employ the modified categorical approach. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19-21, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-21\">Under this approach, we may consider \u201cthe statutory definition, charging docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>ment, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Here, the judicially noticeable documents in the record are the information and the transcript of plea colloquy. During the plea colloquy, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">The Court: All right. The Information states that on or about June 1st, 2002, that you purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to Nita Davis, partner or family member, by pushing her against the wall and grabbing her by the neck. How do you plead \u2014 guilty or not guilty? Domenico: Guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">On appeal, Domenico argues that because he later denied grabbing his wife by the neck, and said he only grabbed her by her shirt, his conviction cannot be a crime of violence. Importantly, however, Domenico never recanted his plea of guilty to \u201cpurposely and knowingly causing] bodily injury\u201d to his wife. It is irrelevant whether he caused such bodily injury by grabbing her neck or her shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Conduct that actually causes another bodily injury necessarily involves \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d and is thus a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>Cf. United States v. Havier, </em>155 F.3d 1090, 1091-93 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b732-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
