Bolanos argues that the district court erred in applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), based on the determination that his 2001 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constituted a conviction for a crime of violence. We review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Vargas-Duran, </em>356 F.3d 598, 602 (5th Cir.2004)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Bolanos recognizes that this court has previously held that an offense committed under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), the statute of his conviction, is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, but he argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), overrules this circuit\u2019s precedent. His argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">In <em>United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 n. 1 (5th Cir.2007), this court held that the analysis in <em>James </em>expressly does not concern enumerated offenses and pertains only to a residual provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(I), which \u00a7 2L1.2 does not contain. Consequently, <em>James </em>is not dispositive of this case. Because this court has repeatedly held that an offense under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339, 344 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Bolonas also maintains the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
