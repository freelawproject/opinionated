Tillett appeals his sentence of forty-six months that the district court imposed following his plea of guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>tribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846. On appeal, Mr. Tillett argues that his sentence is both procedurally unreasonable due to the district court\u2019s alleged failure to address his request for a below-Guidelines sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) and substantively unreasonable under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We exercise jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and AFFIRM Mr. Tillett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">A New Mexico Motor Transportation Division officer stopped a white tractor-trailer driven by Mr. Tillett for exceeding the forty-five miles per hour construction-zone speed limit on Interstate 40. Mr. Tillett got out of the truck and approached the officer at the rear of the trailer. A passenger, Steven C. Hadley, was in the trailer\u2019s sleeper compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The officer requested Mr. Tillett\u2019s driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration, bill of lading, logbook, medical examiner\u2019s certificate, and his state registration form. Mr. Tillett provided all documents except for the medical examiner\u2019s certificate. During the safety inspection of the vehicle, the officer noticed some inconsistencies between the logbook and the bill of lading. Consequently, the officer cited Mr. Tillett for speeding, a logbook violation, and failure to have a medical examiner\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The officer then told Mr. Tillett that he wanted to verify that the bill of lading accurately reflected the contents of the trailer. After opening the door to the trailer, the officer detected a strong odor of marijuana and noticed that the front wall did not appear to be factory-made. On closer inspection, the officer noticed a small gap between the plywood front wall and the factory wall, through which he observed a cardboard box and smelled a strong odor of raw marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The officer then arrested both Mr. Tillett and Mr. Hadley, placing them in handcuffs. The two men and the trailer were taken to the Santa Rosa State Police Office. After privately conferring with each other, both men agreed to answer questions and signed a written consent form authorizing a search of the trailer. The search revealed twenty-four boxes of marijuana with an approximate gross weight of 692.65 kilograms. The men and the trailer were turned over to the Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d). Mr. Tillett told the DEA agents that he owned the trailer and that he was transporting the marijuana from Tucson, Arizona, to Columbus, Ohio, in exchange for $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Mr. Tillett and Mr. Hadley, charging them with (1) conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846 (Count I); and (2) possessing with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B) (Count II).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Mr. Tillett was released from custody pending further proceedings. While released, he was arrested by Ohio state authorities for marijuana trafficking. A police officer stopped Mr. Tillett\u2019s vehicle while it was traveling through Ohio and found approximately 10 pounds of marijuana in the vehicle. Ohio authorities subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>quently surrendered Mr. Tillett to federal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Mr. Tillett entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count (Count I) in exchange for the government dismissing the substantive drug count (Count II). The government agreed that Mr. Tillett had demonstrated acceptance of responsibility within the meaning of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1) and, consequently, was eligible for a three-level reduction in his base offense level. It also acknowledged that Mr. Tillett may be eligible for a two-level reduction in his base offense under the safety-valve provisions of the Guidelines (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (statutory safety-valve provision); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7) (cross-referencing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and providing for the two-level adjustment in drugtrafficking cases).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Based on the quantity of marijuana and Mr. Tillett\u2019s eligibility for the safety-valve reduction, the PSR calculated the advisory Guidelines range to be forty-six to fifty-seven months. Mr. Tillett filed a motion requesting the district court to impose a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range. Mr. Tillett argued that his military service, family circumstances, future deportation, and ineligibility for a halfway house at the end of his sentence (because of pending deportation) warranted a sentence below the Guidelines range. In particular, in light of the allegedly onerous nature of the latter two factors, Mr. Tillett argued that imposing a Guidelines sentence on him would lead to an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and that of otherwise similarly-situated United States citizen defendants. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (requiring sentencing courts to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">At the sentencing hearing, after Mr. Tillett made a brief statement apologizing for his conduct, the district court determined that Mr. Tillett\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was forty-six to fifty-seven months of imprisonment, based on a total offense level of twenty-three and a criminal history category of I. The district court thereafter announced its sentence: Mr. Tillett would be required to serve forty-six months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Mr. Tillett at that juncture reminded the Court of the arguments that he previously had advanced in writing and reiterated his request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>lower sentence. After listening to the government\u2019s contrary contentions, the district court adhered to its sentence. The court commented that \u201c[w]hen I read the presentence report, I increased it to 52 months\u201d and, finishing its thought, stated \u201c[s]o I\u2019ve already given [Mr. Tillett] all the credit I\u2019m going to give him, with 46.\u201d R., Vol. Ill, Tr. at 10 (Transcript of Sentencing Hearing, dated Oct. 25, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Mr. Tillett appeals, arguing that these statements are insufficient to meet the requirements of \u00a7 3553(c) and that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the factors of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We review a federal criminal sentence for reasonableness, giving deference to the district court under \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); see <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 805 (10th Cir.2008) (noting that it is now \u201cwell settled that we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions solely for abuse of discretion\u201d). Reasonableness \u201chas both procedural and substantive components.\u201d <em>United States v. Atencio, </em>476 F.3d 1099, 1102 (10th Cir. 2007); <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (noting that a reviewing court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error\u201d and then it should \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The procedural component relates to the manner in which the district court calculated and explained the sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (noting as examples of \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d a district court\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range\u201d and \u201cfail[ure] to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d); <em>United States v. Romero, </em>491 F.3d 1173, 1176 (10th Cir.2007) (treating as a claim of procedural unreasonableness defendant\u2019s allegation that the district court failed to explain its reasons for rejecting an argument for a below-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">The substantive component relates to the length of the sentence: \u201cIn evaluating the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we ask whether the length of the sentence is reasonable considering the statutory factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d 1209, 1217-18 (10th Cir.2007); <em>see Atencio, </em>476 F.3d at 1102 (\u201cA substantively reasonable sentence ultimately reflects the gravity of the crime and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as applied to the case.\u201d). \u201c[W]e accord a properly calculated Guidelines sentence a presumption of substantive reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>509 F.3d 1290, 1298 (10th Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and noting that the Supreme Court has \u201crecently upheld as constitutional\u201d the Tenth Circuit\u2019s \u201capproach\u201d to the appellate presumption of reasonableness); <em>see Gall, </em>128 S Ct. at 597 (\u201cIf the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">Mr. Tillett challenges his sentence on both procedural and substantive grounds. We review each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">A. Procedural Reasonableness Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\">Because Mr. Tillett did not object at sentencing to the district court\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 3553(c), we review for plain error. <em>See Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d at 1218 (\u201cBecause [defendant] raised no contemporaneous objection to the court\u2019s explanation of the method of determining his sentence, we review only for plain error.\u201d); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number><em>Chavez-Calderon, </em>494 F.3d 1266, 1268 (10th Cir.2007) (same); <em>see also Romero, </em>491 F.3d at 1178 (alleviating \u201cconfusion\u201d caused by Tenth Circuit precedent by concluding that where a defendant \u201cdid not object on procedural grounds under \u00a7 3553(a) or (c) after the district court imposed his sentence, he has forfeited his right to appeal this issue and our review is only for plain error\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">To secure relief under the demanding plain error standard, Mr. Tillett \u201cmust show: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If he satisfies these criteria, this Court may exercise discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Goode, </em>483 F.3d 676, 681 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>335 F.3d 1132, 1141 (10th Cir.2003)). Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Mr. Tillett has established the first two components of the plain error standard, we conclude that he has not satisfied the third. Accordingly, he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Mr. Tillett has failed to make an adequate showing that the district court\u2019s alleged failure to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)\u2019s requirements affected his substantial rights. To affect substantial rights, \u201cthe error must have been prejudicial.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>491 F.3d at 1179 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis standard requires the defendant to show a reasonable probability that, but for the error claimed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Avalos, </em>506 F.3d 972, 979 (10th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Corchado, </em>427 F.3d 815, 818 (10th Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Mr. Tillett makes no contention of prejudice \u201cand we will not supply such an argument for him.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>491 F.3d at 1179. Furthermore, although we need not decide on these facts whether it would be determinative, the district court\u2019s statement that \u201cI\u2019ve already given [Mr. Tillett] all the credit I\u2019m going to give him, with 46 [months],\u201d calls into serious question Mr. Tillett\u2019s ability to demonstrate a reasonable probability he would receive a different (i.e., lighter) sentence on remand. <em>See United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2006) (holding third prong of the plain error standard not satisfied where the \u201crecord indicates no frustration on the part of the district court with the severity of the Guidelines sentence, nor did the district court indicate a desire to impose a lesser sentence\u201d). <em>Cf. United States v. Moreno-Trevino, </em>432 F.3d 1181, 1189 (10th Cir.2005) (under fourth prong of plain error review, where defendant received low end of Guidelines range, seeing \u201cno evidence\u201d indicating that district court would have given defendant lighter sentence, where district court noted that it gave him low end \u201cbecause he was facing prosecution and sentencing for a new criminal charge\u201d). Therefore, Mr. Tillett has not carried his burden as to the third prong and he is not entitled to relief under the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">B. Substantive Reasonableness Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Mr. Tillett also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>der \u00a7 3553(a). When a defendant argues for a lower sentence before the district court, we do not require him to lodge \u201ca formal objection\u201d to the sentence\u2019s length to avoid plain error review. <em>United States v. Mancera-Perez, </em>505 F.3d 1054, 1059 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201cclarify[ing]\u201d Tenth Circuit case law as \u201callowing for reasonableness review\u201d even in instances of \u201cunpreserved substantive sentencing challenges\u201d so long as the defendant has \u201cat least made the argument for a lower sentence before the district court\u201d); <em>see United States v. Garcia-Castaneda, </em>255 Fed. Appx. 316 (10th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (noting that \u201cexception\u201d to plain error review as to substantive challenges \u201capplies only when the defendant has already made an argument for a lesser sentence during pre-sentence arguments\u201d), petition for certiorari filed Feb. 19, 2008 (No. 07-9540).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">After reviewing the record, including Mr. Tillett\u2019s sentencing memoranda, we are unable to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of forty-six months in the circumstances of this ease. Mr. Tillett has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded to his properly calculated, within-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Mr. Tillett\u2019s offense of conviction ordinarily carries a mandatory minimum sentence of sixty months. The absence of any significant aggravating factors in this case related to the offense or to Mr. Tillett was in large measure taken into account in the sentence reduction that Mr. Tillett received under the safety-valve provision. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 (allowing for safety-valve where a defendant did not, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cuse violence,\u201d \u201cpossess a ... dangerous weapon,\u201d or \u201chave more than 1 criminal history point\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Furthermore, the district court was required to balance Mr. Tillett\u2019s military service, family circumstances, future deportation, and ineligibility for a halfway house due to pending deportation with other sentencing variables under \u00a7 3553(a), including the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the crime and promote respect for the law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). First of all, it is doubtful that Mr. Tillett\u2019s future deportation and ineligibility for a halfway house could give rise to unwarranted sentencing disparities because these are direct, legal consequences of Mr. Tillett\u2019s unlawful alien status. <em>Cf. United States v. Martinez-Trujillo, </em>468 F.3d 1266, 1268 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe cannot say that a disparity is \u2018unwarranted\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(6) when the disparity is specifically authorized by Congress....\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">In any event, the district court has a wide range of discretion in striking that balance among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Smart, </em>518 F.3d at 808 (\u201cWe may not examine the weight a district court assigns to various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and its ultimate assessment of the balance between them, as a legal conclusion to be reviewed de novo.\u201d). And we cannot conclude here that the district court abused that discretion. Cf<em>. United States v. Galarza-Payan, </em>441 F.3d 885, 887, 889-90 (10th Cir.2006) (upholding substantive reasonableness of fifty-seven month sentence for reentry after deportation despite defendant\u2019s contentions that \u201cevidence of his cultural assimilation,\u201d including his residence in the United States since he was twelve and his family\u2019s presence in the United States, \u201crebut[s] the presumption of reasonableness\u201d). Mr. Tillett\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">Because any procedural error by the district court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) did not affect Mr. Tillett\u2019s substantial rights and Mr. Tillett\u2019s substantive argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ments do not rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded to his properly calculated, within-Guidelines sentence, Mr. Tillett\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-9\">. Mr. Hadley ultimately pleaded guilty to Count I of the indictment, and the district court sentenced him to a prison term of twenty-one months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">. Mr. Tillett\u2019s sentence was computed by referencing the 2004 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The parties do not question the use of that edition. Accordingly, we use that edition in our analysis and our citations to the Guidelines are to the 2004 edition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">. Mr. Tillett also filed a sealed pleading in support of a sentence below the Guidelines range. There, he made one additional argument, an argument that he maintains on appeal. Mr. Tillett alleged that public disclosure of the argument would put his life and that of his family at risk. Apparently in recognition of the argument\u2019s sensitivity, the district court did not conduct the sentencing in a courtroom open to the public and sealed the sentencing transcript. Still concerned about public disclosure of this argument, Mr. Tillett moved this Court to permit filing his opening brief and all other briefs in this case under seal and we granted the motion. In considering the merits of Mr. Tillett\u2019s appellate challenge to his sentence, we have thoroughly considered all documents related to that argument. However, in order to dispose of this case, we need not expressly discuss the argument. Even taking it into account, along with Mr. Tillett's other substantive sentencing contentions, we ultimately conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to vary from the Guidelines and imposing a low-end Guidelines sentence on Mr. Tillett.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. At oral argument, defense counsel, who had represented Mr. Tillett during the sentencing proceedings, conceded that although he raised an objection to the Guidelines sentence and argued for a downward variance, he did not specifically object to the district court\u2019s alleged <em>procedural </em>error in failing to state on the record its reasons for imposing the particular sentence of forty-six months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
