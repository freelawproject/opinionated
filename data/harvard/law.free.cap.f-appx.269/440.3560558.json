Aldaz argues that the district court abused its discretion by upwardly departing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 based on a finding that his criminal history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>was substantially under represented. He also contends that the district court erred in imposing a six-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2)(B) based on a finding that he was responsible for 25-99 fraudulent documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The district court imposed an \u201calternate non-guidelines sentence\u201d by stating that it would impose a 33-month sentence even if the Guidelines were misapplied. <em>United States v. Antuna-Moran, </em>488 F.3d 1048 (5th Cir.2007). The district court cited case specific reasons for the imposition of Aldaz\u2019s sentence and considered proper factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 525-26 (5th Cir.2006). Because Aldaz\u2019s alternate non-guidelines sentence is reasonable, it is unnecessary to determine whether the district court erred in its application of the Guidelines regarding either the upward departure or the six-level adjustment. <em>See id.; see also Antuna-Moran, </em>488 F.3d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
