On appeal, Flores argues that the district court erred in determining the quantity of cocaine used to determine his offense level, erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm and finding him ineligible for the \u201csafety valve,\u201d and erred in denying his motion for a downward departure. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">We review a sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence within a correctly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence). In considering the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-23\">Flores first argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by determining his base offense level using a quantity of cocaine that was greater than the quantity charged in the indictment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>admitted by Flores in his plea. This argument is meritless. Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court has stated that, in addition to making the Guidelines advisory, <em>Booker </em>\u201calso recognized that when district courts impose discretionary sentences, which are reviewed under normal appellate principles by courts of appeals, such a sentencing scheme will ordinarily raise no Sixth Amendment concern.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2467. In this case, the district court specifically noted the advisory nature of the Guidelines and heard argument regarding the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). We therefore conclude that the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination did not violate Flores\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights. To the extent that Flores\u2019 argument can be construed as a factual challenge to the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination, the evidence produced at sentencing amply supported the court\u2019s finding, which is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Flores next argues that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm. He asserts both a Sixth Amendment argument and a factual challenge. We reject the Sixth Amendment argument for the reasons discussed above. The Guidelines provide for a two-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The Commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 states that \u201c[t]he adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 3. \u201cIn order to prove that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that the weapon was possessed during the relevant illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s determination that a firearm or other weapon was present and justifies the enhancement is a factual question that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 914 (4th Cir.1990). Our review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing convinces us that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Flores possessed firearms in connection with cocaine trafficking, and properly applied the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Flores also asserts error in the district court\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d to reduce his sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(f) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007); USSG \u00a7 5C1.2 (2006). The district court correctly determined that Flores possessed a firearm in connection with the distribution of cocaine, and thus properly denied application of the safety valve in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Finally, Flores argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure. He also argues that the factors he identified in support of a departure justified a lesser sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). Because the record reflects that the district court recognized its authority to depart but concluded that a departure was not warranted on the facts of this case, the court\u2019s decision is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). Moreover, contrary to Flores\u2019 suggestions on appeal, the record indicates that the district court considered the information provided by Flores and concluded it did not justify a lesser sentence. We find no abuse of discretion in that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Flores\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
