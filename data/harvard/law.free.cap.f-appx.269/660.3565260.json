We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">As an initial matter, the government contends this appeal is barred by the written appeal waiver in Rodriguez-Morales\u2019 plea agreement. This contention is unpersuasive, because the district court advised Rodriguez-Morales at the change of plea hearing that he could appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917-18 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Armenta, </em>400 F.3d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">Rodriguez-Morales contends his sentence was unreasonable. We conclude the sentence was not unreasonable in light of the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-19\">Rodriguez-Morales also raises a variety of contentions relating to the scope and continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). As Rodriguez-Morales concedes in his brief, these contention are foreclosed by existing precedent. <em>See United States v. Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d 748, 751 n. 3 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
