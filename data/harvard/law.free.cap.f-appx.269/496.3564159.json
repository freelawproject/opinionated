The magistrate judge who presided with the consent of the parties concluded that Nicholson\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. This ruling is not addressed by Nicholson on appeal so that issue is deemed to be abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Even though we liberally construe the pleading of pro se litigants, they still must identify errors and brief the relevant issues, which Nicholson has failed to do. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25. Accordingly, we dismiss Nicholson\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-22\">The dismissal of Nicholson\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal count as separate strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We caution Nicholson that if he accumulates one more such strike, he will not be entitled to proceed in forma pauper-is in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
