Schoppert, which denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Huiru Weng, </em>No. A97 517 511 (B.I.A. Apr. 27, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 517 511 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 1, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case, as well as the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In a hearing before the IJ, Weng testified that she had been arrested and physically mistreated for her practice of Falun Gong, and that she would not be able to continue her practice freely if she were to return to China. The IJ found Weng incredible and denied relief. Specifically, the IJ pointed to three inconsistencies: 1) the fact that Weng did not record having joined an official Falun Gong organization in October 2003 in her asylum application; 2) discrepancies as to whether Weng continued to practice Falun Gong with others after she was arrested, or whether she only practiced alone; and 3) Weng\u2019s failure to mention her purported arrest and detention during her airport interview. The BIA affirmed, emphasizing the two latter inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201cWhere, as here, the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we will review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or, more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cWe review an IJ\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard,\u201d <em>id., </em>and afford \u201cparticular deference to the credibility determinations of the IJ.\u201d <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997). However, we will vacate and remand for reconsideration if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">We find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence. As to Weng\u2019s failure to mention her arrest during her airport interview\u2014 the strongest ground for the IJ\u2019s credibility determination \u2014 a complete review of the transcript suggests that the airport interview was less than completely reliable. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 180 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[i]n all'cases, the BIA and reviewing court should use the airport interview in judging the alien\u2019s credibility only after examining the record of the airport proceeding as a whole ... \u201d). The interview, conducted on the same day that Weng (who was then seventeen) arrived in the U.S., was very brief and included only a few superficial questions regarding her asylum claim. <em>See id. </em>(finding \u201cless reliable\u201d airport interviews \u201cin which the questions asked are not designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim, or the INS officer fails to ask follow-up questions that would aid the alien in developing his or her account.\u201d). Furthermore, before the interviewing officer elicited any information about Weng\u2019s claim, he asked her, \u201c[h]ave you ever been arrested anywhere at any time for any offense?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Weng testified that she answered in the negative because she was \u201cvery nervous\u201d and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cmind was completely blank,\u201d and that \u201cI thought if I answered yes he would send me back to China.\u201d Given the circumstances, the cursory nature of the interview, and the wording of the arrest question, we do not find that Weng\u2019s failure to mention her detention in China constitutes substantial evidence supporting an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Finally, we find that the other two discrepancies upon which the IJ relied constitute only minor inconsistencies. \u201cInconsistent testimony ... need not be fatal if it is minor and isolated, and the testimony is otherwise generally consistent, rational, and believable.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 395 (2d Cir.2005). For example, it is not completely clear from the record that Weng actually was inconsistent as to whether she practiced collectively or alone after her 2003 arrest, or whether she simply misunderstood some of the questions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, Weng\u2019s asylum application clearly indicates that her claim was based on her practice of Falun Gong, even if she neglected to mention formally joining a Falun Gong organization in October 2003. Finally, Weng\u2019s overall narrative, supported by corroborating letters, was consistent and believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Accordingly, the petition for review is hereby GRANTED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings on Petitioner\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding relief consistent with this order. Any pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">. In fact, this question immediately followed the officer's query as to whether Weng or any of her family members had any petitions pending with US CIS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">. When asked why she initially testified that, after her arrest, she only practiced Falun Gong alone, Weng responded, \"Yes, that\u2019s true but we would practice together and they would notify me where we would practice and we would practice together.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
