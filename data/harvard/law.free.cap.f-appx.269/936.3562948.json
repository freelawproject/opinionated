Wakefield appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the City of Pembroke Pines\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying his cross-motion for summary judgment as to his <em>pro se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Wakefield\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is based on two separate instances, during which he alleges that City police officers unjustifiably pointed their guns at him. According to Wakefield, the officers\u2019 actions constitute excessive force and were the result of the City\u2019s policy and custom of arresting and abusing African-Americans. The first instance allegedly occurred on December 24, 2002,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at which time Wakefield claims that Officer Richard Barber pulled him over for running a red light and, without justification, held him at gunpoint. The second incident occurred in January 2004, after Wakefield called the police to request assistance in recovering some personal property from a self-storage business. According to Wakefield\u2019s complaint, Officers Barber and Desilva arrived and, without justification, pointed their guns at him for some time before eventually escorting him to the storage facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In December 2004, Wakefield submitted a complaint regarding the 2002 traffic stop to Sergeant Jacob. Wakefield could not name the officer involved in the 2002 incident at that time, nor did he mention the January 2004 incident. Jacob consulted the City\u2019s database that logs traffic stops and found that it did not indicate any query for Wakefield occurring during the relevant time period. Jacob also showed Wakefield a book containing photographs of City police officers, and Wakefield identified one officer who was not employed by the City at the time of the alleged incident and another officer who did not match the description Wakefield had initially provided. Wakefield later reported to Jacob that he believed that the officer involved in the 2002 traffic stop could have been \u201cKeegan, Barber, or Light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">In February 2005, Wakefield also filed a complaint against Officers Barber and Desilva regarding the January 2004 incident at the storage facility. At that time, he also indicated that Officer Barber was the one who had initiated the 2002 traffic stop. After confirming that Officer Barber was not on duty on December 24, 2002, Sergeant Jacob informed Wakefield that the department did not plan to entertain either of his allegations and referred Wakefield to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Jacob later received calls from two FDLE agents, who informed him that they did not plan to pursue Wake-field\u2019s complaints either.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Wakefield filed a complaint against the City in federal court, alleging that the officers\u2019 conduct \u201cwas clearly excessive in light of the circumstances existing at the time of the arrest\u201d and seeking damages in the amount of $353,009,407.44.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>extensive discovery, the City filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it could not be held liable under a theory of respondeat superior because Wakefield had failed to show that the incidents resulted from an officially adopted policy or custom. Wakefield responded to the City\u2019s motion, and also moved for summary judgment, alleging that the City had an illegal policy and custom of authorizing the use of excessive force against African-Americans, had improperly trained its officers, was grossly indifferent to police officers\u2019 abusive conduct, and had failed to take corrective actions upon learning of incidents of excessive force. Although the district court assumed that the incidents occurred as Wakefield alleged for purposes of deciding the motion, the court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Wakefield\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Wakefield reasserts his claims on appeal regarding the two alleged incidents with City police officers and contends that the incidents were driven by an official policy and custom authorizing the use of excessive force. He further argues that the City is not entitled to summary judgment because the police department failed to investigate and discipline officers who used such force. According to Wakefield, Sergeant Jacob misled him by telling him that Officer Barber did not work for the police force during the relevant time period, which caused him to incorrectly identify the officer involved in the 2002 traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Mercado v. City of Orlando, </em>407 F.3d 1152, 1156 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate when the \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In making this determination, we view all of the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Mercado, </em>407 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">A municipality is subject to liability under \u00a7 1983 \u201cif the plaintiff shows that a \u2018custom\u2019 or \u2018policy\u2019 of the municipality was the \u2018moving force\u2019 behind the constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Sewell v. Town of Lake Hamilton, </em>117 F.3d 488, 489 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting <em>Monell v. N.Y. City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-94, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)). This Court has defined a \u201cpolicy\u201d as \u201ca decision that is officially adopted by the municipality, or created by an official of such rank that he or she could be said to be acting on behalf of the municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201ccustom,\u201d on the other hand, \u201cis a practice that is so settled and permanent that it takes on the force of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish the liability of a municipality based on a custom, \u201cit is generally necessary to show a persistent and widespread practice. Moreover, actual or constructive knowledge of such customs must be attributed to ... the municipality. Normally, random acts or isolated incidents are insufficient. ...\u201d <em>Church v. City of Huntsville, </em>30 F.3d 1332, 1345 (11th Cir.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">The Supreme Court has also made clear that \u201cthe inadequacy of police training may serve as a basis for \u00a7 1983 liability.\u201d <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). However, such liability attaches \u201conly where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>Id. </em>This Court similarly has recognized that a municipality is liable under \u00a7 1983 if the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by a \u201cpattern of improper training\u201d of police officers, of which the municipality was aware and deliberately indifferent. <em>Mercado, </em>407 F.3d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">We conclude that the district court properly granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Even assuming, as the district court did, that the incidents occurred and that the officers\u2019 conduct constitutes excessive force, Wakefield has failed to create a genuine issue of mateiial fact concerning the City\u2019s liability under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Wakefield failed to submit any evidence that the City had an officially adopted policy authorizing the use of excessive force against African-Americans. In fact, the record demonstrates that the general orders of the police department instruct officers to \u201cuse the minimum amount of force necessary to control the subject,\u201d and to use deadly force only \u201cas a last resort\u201d if the offender poses a grave threat. The department\u2019s general orders further state that officers should draw them firearms in the line of duty only when necessary and should use reasonable care when doing so. Thus, despite Wakefield\u2019s assertions to the contrary, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether an official policy was a \u201cmoving force\u201d behind his alleged constitutional deprivations. <em>See Sewell, </em>117 F.3d at 489 (quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690-94, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-38).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">Similarly, Wakefield failed to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether there was a \u201cpersistent and widespread practice\u201d of City police officers using excessive force. <em>See Church, </em>30 F.3d at 1345. While Wakefield asserts that such a custom indeed exists, he principally replies upon his own two instances of alleged excessive force to support that assertion. Two incidents, occurring approximately thirteen months apart, are insufficient to establish a custom. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cNormally, random acts or isolated incidents are insufficient....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Nor is Officer Barber\u2019s involvement in a use of force violation in 1995 during a police shooting sufficient by itself to establish a \u201cpersistent and widespread practice\u201d in the police department as a whole. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, it is noteworthy that following the unrelated 1995 shooting incident, the City rejected the first recommended sanction of 120-hour suspension for Officer Barber and insisted on a harsher penalty. Furthermore, Wakefield\u2019s assertion that the City police department employs substantially more Caucasian than African-American employees is not evidence that a custom of using excessive force against African-Americans exists. Because Wake-field failed to establish \u201ca practice that is so settled and permanent that it takes on the force of law,\u201d see <em>Sewell, </em>117 F.3d at 489, the district court properly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a City custom authorizing the use of excessive force against African-Americans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Nor has Wakefield created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alleged incidents were the result of a \u201cpattern of improper training\u201d of police officers. <em>See Mercado, </em>407 F.3d at 1161. The record establishes not only that the City had a formal policy concerning the use of excessive force, but also that Officers Barber and Desilva were aware of that policy. Furthermore, in its answer to interrogatories, the City stated that all of its officers receive mandatory use of force training and must complete extensive psychological and background checks. Thus, Wakefield has failed to put forth evidence of a \u201cpattern of improper training\u201d to which the City was deliberately indifferent. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Finally, Wakefield\u2019s claims that Sergeant Jacob failed to adequately investigate his complaints and misled him concerning the identity of Officer Barber are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the City\u2019s liability under \u00a7 1983. The record demonstrates that Jacob conducted a preliminary investigation of Wakefield\u2019s complaints and, based on the fact that Officer Barber was not on duty at the time of the first alleged incident and that there was a lack of evidence regarding the second alleged incident, decided not to pursue a formal investigation. The same conclusion was later reached by two FDLE agents to whom Wakefield complained. In any event, Wakefield provides no evidence at all that any alleged failure by Jacob to sufficiently investigate was the result of a policy or custom of the City for which it can be held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Because Wakefield failed to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether the two alleged incidents occurred as a result of an official policy or informal custom of the City, the district court property granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. Wakefield has apparently been inconsistent in reporting when this incident occurred, alleging at various times that the traffic stop was in November or December 2002. His second amended complaint, however, alleges that the traffic stop occurred on December 24, 2002, the day on which he was out shopping for a DVD that had been released for sale on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-15\">. Wakefield also named several City police officers as individual defendants in his \u00a7 1983 complaint. The district court, however, dismissed the individual defendants because Wakefield failed to serve process on them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>The City is, therefore, the only remaining defendant in the lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b968-7\">. Wakefield's brief to this Court also contains a chart, purporting to show that Officer Barber was involved in a number of complaints for misconduct during his nineteen years of service. Because Wakefield never submitted this evidence to the district court, however, it is not properly before this Court. <em>See Selman </em>v. <em>Cobb County Sch. Dist., </em>449 F.3d 1320, 1332 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIn deciding issues on appeal we consider only evidence that was part of the record before the district court.\u201d). In any event, the mere fact that nine complaints were made against Officer Barber over the course of nineteen years is not sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>to establish \"a persistent and widespread practice\u201d of the City. <em>See Church, </em>30 F.3d at 1345.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
