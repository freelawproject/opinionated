The district court dismissed several of his claims prior to sei-vice upon the defendants and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the remaining claims. Amir-Sharif now moves this court for authorization to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) on appeal from the dismissal of his suit. A movant who seeks authorization to proceed IFP on appeal must demonstrate that he is a pauper and that his appeal involves nonfrivolous issues. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Amir-Sharif s motion and brief to this court focus exclusively on the district court\u2019s determination that the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment should be granted because Amir-Sharif had failed to properly exhaust his claims. Amir-Sharif has failed to brief, and has thus abandoned, any claims he may have had concerning the propriety of the district court\u2019s initial determination that some of his claims should be dismissed prior to service upon the defendants. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Amir-Sharif has likewise failed to brief, and has thus abandoned, the district court\u2019s alternate determination that the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment should be granted because he had failed to show genuine issues of material fact concerning the merits of his claims. Failure to address this alternate determination has the same effect as if Amir-Sharif had not appealed the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Amir-Sharifs motion to proceed IFP is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Amir-Sharif has filed numerous frivolous actions in this and other courts. We have warned him that he would likely be sanctioned if this pattern of behavior continued. Amir-Sharif disregarded our warning. We now order him to pay $100 as a sanction to the clerk of this court. Amir-Sharif is barred from filing any civil appeal in this court, unless the district court certifies the appeal is taken in good faith, until the total amount of the sanction is paid. We warn Amir-Sharif that any future frivolous filings may result in additional sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION IMPOSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
