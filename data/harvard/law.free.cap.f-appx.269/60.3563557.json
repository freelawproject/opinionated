Creditor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Appellee RM 18 Corporation, the successor corporation to Malease 18, appealed to the District Court. On September 26, 2006, the District Court, 351 B.R. 34, issued a memorandum opinion and order reversing the June 28, 2005 order and remanding the matter back to the Bankruptcy Court. Appellant Aztex Corporation, and creditors-appellants J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A and Aztex Associates, L.P, now petition our Court to (1) reverse the September 26, 2006 order of the District Court and (2) affirm the June 28, 2005 order of the Bankruptcy Court. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Appellants propose that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Specifically, they contend that the District Court\u2019s order of September 26, 2006 is final because it disposed of the legal issue at the heart of this case, leaving the Bankruptcy Court to perform a solely \u201cministerial task.\u201d Following oral argument, we ordered the parties to submit letter briefs on the relevance of <em>In re AroChem Corp., </em>176 F.3d 610 (2d Cir.1999) and <em>In, re Penn Traffic, </em>466 F.3d 75 (2d Cir.2006) to the theory of jurisdiction advanced by appellants. Having now received letter briefs from both parties, we set forth our analysis of this issue below.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Our circuit\u2019s test for finality in the context of bankruptcy appeals is well-established. Where the decision of the bankruptcy court is final, we look to \u201c \u2018whether the district court\u2019s disposition independently rendered the matter nonappealable.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re AroChem Corp., </em>176 F.3d 610, 620 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>In re Palm Coast, Matanza Shores Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>101 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir.1996)); <em>accord In re Penn Traffic Co., </em>466 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2006); <em>In re U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>216 F.3d 228, 233 (2d Cir.2000); <em>In re Kurtzman, </em>194 F.3d 54, 57 (2d Cir.1999). The answer to that question \u2014 and, hence, to the question of our subject matter jurisdiction\u2014 \u201cturns on whether the District Court\u2019s remand was one contemplating \u2018significant further proceedings\u2019 in the Bankruptcy Court.\u201d <em>In re Penn Traffic Co., </em>466 F.3d at 78. This is because an order contemplating significant further proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court will be appealable once these further proceedings have been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">As we explained in <em>Penn Traffic Co., </em>we have, in the past, \u201cfound appellate jurisdiction lacking, and the proceedings contemplated on remand \u2018significant[ ]\u2019... where the district court\u2019s remand decision contemplated the presentation of additional evidence.\u201d <em>Id, </em>(citing <em>In re Chateaugay Corp., </em>838 F.2d 59, 62 (2d Cir.1988)). We have also held that remands \u201ccalling for the exercise of judgment and discretion by the Bankruptcy Court\u201d are not ministerial in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In the instant case, appellants challenge an order in which the District Court required the Bankruptcy Court to determine \u201cwhether the Kmart settlement as a whole was reasonable.\u201d Special Appendix 22. This undertaking amounts to more than a mere ministerial task. <em>Cf In re Penn Traffic Co., </em>466 F.3d at 78 (taking note of the First Circuit\u2019s observation, in <em>In re Gould &amp; Eberhardt Gear Mach. Corp., </em>852 F.2d 26, 29 (1st Cir.1988), that \u201cwhen a remand leaves only ministerial proceedings, for example, computation of amounts according to established formulae, then the remand may be considered final\u201d). As the District Court itself recognized, the remand contemplates that the Bankruptcy Court will hear and consider additional evidence relating to, <em>inter alia,, </em>\u201c(1) the probability of success in the litigation; (2) the difficulties that may be encountered in collection; (3) the complexity of the litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tion and the attendant expense, inconvenience, and delay; and (4) the paramount interest of the creditors.\u201d Special Appendix 22-23 (internal quotation marks omitted). For this reason, although the decision of the Bankruptcy Court was final in nature, the disposition of the District Court clearly was not. We therefore lack jurisdiction to hear the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Accordingly, we DISMISS this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and REMAND to the District Court for further proceedings in keeping with the content of this order and the District Court\u2019s order of September 26, 2006.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
