We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">Murillo claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorneys failed to file a notice of an alibi defense. We review both a district court\u2019s denial of a federal prisoner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition and an ineffective assistance of counsel claim de novo. <em>See United States v. Rodrigues, </em>347 F.3d 818, 823 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">The district court properly denied Murillo\u2019s claim. To establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Murillo must first demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). While \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, \u201cdefense counsel must, \u2018at a minimum, <em>conduct a reasonable investigation </em>enabling [them] to make informed decisions about how best to represent [their] client.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rios v. Rocha, </em>299 F.3d 796, 805 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Sanders v. Ratelle, </em>21 F.3d 1446, 1456 (9th Cir.1994)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">Here, the decision by Murillo\u2019s attorneys not to file a notice of an alibi defense resulted not from insufficient investigation, but from a reasonable evaluation of the information available to them at the time. Counsel conducted a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d by deputizing their experienced lead investigator to interview all four of the potential alibi witnesses Murillo named. They then called the two witnesses whom they deemed credible and useful to Murillo\u2019s defense to testify. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>However, counsel made a conscious decision that the witnesses\u2019 information did not amount to an actual alibi, and thus that they were not required to file a notice of an alibi defense under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.1. Instead, they made a strategic choice to use the testimony to attempt to impeach the government\u2019s only eyewitness to the murder. Under these circumstances, the district court correctly concluded that defense counsel\u2019s decision was a strategic choice made after an adequate investigation which cannot be considered deficient performance under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Even if Murillo could establish that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, Murillo must also show that he was prejudiced by that performance. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To do so, Murillo must demonstrate that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We have previously held that \u201c \u2018ineffective assistance of counsel claims ... must be considered in light of the strength of the government\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hart v. Gomez, </em>174 F.3d 1067, 1072 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The district court properly concluded that Murillo failed to establish that counsel\u2019s decision not to file a notice of an alibi defense prejudiced the outcome of his trial. First, even without the notice of an alibi defense, the jury heard Mary Perez and Rochelle Del Carmen\u2019s testimony. Second, Murillo was not prejudiced because of the \u201coverwhelming\u201d strength of the government\u2019s case against him. <em>See id. </em>The so-called \u201calibi\u201d evidence would not have accounted for Murillo\u2019s whereabouts after</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">3 a.m., during the period the evidence indicated the murder occurred. Additionally, the government introduced physical evidence and the testimony of co-conspirators to corroborate Diana Hironaga\u2019s eyewitness testimony that Murillo was the killer. Given the strength of the government\u2019s case against Murillo, the district court correctly concluded that Murillo had not demonstrated <em>Strickland </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
