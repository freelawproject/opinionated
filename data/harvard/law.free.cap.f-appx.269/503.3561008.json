Renteria argues that the district court erred in applying the 16-level drug trafficking enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) to his offense level calculation, and he also raises an admittedly foreclosed challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">Renteria\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, which the Government seeks to enforce. Although the district court at sentencing purported to give Renteria the right to appeal its application of the drug trafficking enhancement, this \u201cdoes not affect our determination\u201d as to whether Renteria\u2019s waiver of appeal rights \u201cwas voluntary, knowing, and permissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 568 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez, </em>259 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir. 2001). Our review is <em>de novo. See Melancon, </em>972 F.2d at 567-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-25\">Renteria acknowledges that, by its terms, the appeal waiver included in his plea agreement precludes his appeal of the 16-level enhancement issue, but he contends that the waiver should not be enforced because he did not knowingly and voluntarily agree to it. To the contrary, the record reveals that Renteria\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary; the district court fully advised Renteria of the consequences of both his plea and the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Santa Lucia, </em>991 F.2d 179, 180 (5th Cir.1993). The district court\u2019s statements during sentencing regarding Renteria\u2019s right to appeal did not negate an otherwise knowing and volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tary waiver. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>259 F.3d at 358. We therefore enforce the waiver and do not reach the merits of Renteria\u2019s challenge to the 16-level drug trafficking enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In light of <em>Appr&amp;ndi, </em>Renteria challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
