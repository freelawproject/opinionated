We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir. 2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ma\u2019s motion to reopen to reissue its earlier decision. The presumption that the BIA mailed its decision to Ma at his address of record on March 1, 2005, as indicated on the BIA\u2019s cover letter accompanying its decision, was not rebutted where Ma did not submit any evidence to the contrary. <em>See Singh, v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1172-73 (9th Cir.2007). The record before us does not indicate that Ma submitted the required change of address form to the agency and the BIA was alerted to Ma\u2019s new address only after Ma filed his motion to reopen in April 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
