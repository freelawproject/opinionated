We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">The IJ concluded that Pena was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal, based on her testimony that she provided money to assist her sons to enter the United States without inspection. The agency did not have the benefit, however, of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201cthe alien-smuggling provision ... does not operate to deny the applicant statutory eligibility ... for cancellation of removal ... because the Attorney General may waive the applicability of the alien-smuggling provision\u201d when the applicant assisted his or her spouse or child to enter the United States in violation of the law). Under <em>Moran, </em>Pena may be eligible for a family unity waiver, and the agency improperly pretermitted her application for cancellation of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">In accordance with <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam), we remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b808-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9lh Cir.
