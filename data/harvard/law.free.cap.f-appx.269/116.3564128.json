We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and asks whether the district court properly concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Even if, despite the district court\u2019s views to the contrary, Carpenter alleged facts that give rise to an inference of discrimination sufficient to satisfy her prima facie burden, Carpenter has failed to rebut defendants-appellees\u2019 legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her termination: that she was an unsafe driver who had gotten into an accident and failed to pass a mandatory retraining test. Because Carpenter has failed to produce evidence that would cause a reasonable factfinder to determine that the proffered reasons for her termination were pretextual, her claim of race discrimination fails as a matter of law. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
