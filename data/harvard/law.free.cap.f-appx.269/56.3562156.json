The Honorable Brian M. Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Appellants Bico Stupakoff and Russell James appeal from a February 26, 2007, 2007 WL 656902, decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Buchwald, J.) affirming three decisions of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Lifland, J.). On August 16, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying Appellants\u2019 motion for a continuance of the hearing on a motion filed by Peter Rosenbaum Photography Corporation or, in the alternative, for a declaration of the Court that any ruling on Rosenbaum\u2019s motion would have no application to any motion or pleading that might be filed by Appellants in the future. On November 1, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court denied Appellants\u2019 motion to modify Spiegel\u2019s bankruptcy reorganization plan (\u201cPlan\u201d) to allow them to participate in a class action lawsuit filed by Rosenbaum as untimely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The Court also dismissed Appellants\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment that they are not bound by the Plan as untimely and, in the alternative, because it failed to state a claim. Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">We affirm the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision that Appellants\u2019 motion to modify the Plan was untimely under Rule 60(b). \u201cMotions under Rule 60(b) are addressed to the sound discretion of the ... court and are generally granted only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Mendell v. Gollust, </em>909 F.2d 724, 731 (2d Cir.1990). Review of a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is subject to an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>732 F.2d 253, 257 (2d Cir.1984). Appellants claim that the Release and Injunction in the Plan are not enforceable as to them because proper notice of the disclosure statement and Plan was not provided to them. Their request is likely governed by subsection (3) of the Rule, which allows a court to \u201crelieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d because of the \u201cmisconduct by an opposing party\u201d among other reasons. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). A \u201cmotion [governed by Rule 60(b) ] must be made within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>reasonable time \u2014 and for reason[ ] ... (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Because Appellants\u2019 motion was made more than a year after the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan, the Court correctly found that it was untimely under Rule 60(b)(3). Even if the Appellants\u2019 motion is properly governed by 60(b)(5) \u201cand/or\u201d (6) as Appellants allege \u2014 which we doubt \u2014 and the motion\u2019s timeliness is thus examined under 60(b)\u2019s \u201creasonable time\u201d provision, the Court\u2019s alternative holding that Appellants\u2019 seven-month delay in filing after becoming aware of the Plan\u2019s existence was unreasonable is still well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We likewise affirm the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision that Appellants\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment was untimely. \u201c[Decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions ... should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 289-90, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). Though Appellants claim that the abuse of discretion standard does not apply in this appeal, both of their arguments fail. First, the Court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 request as untimely is no different for the purposes of our review than if the Court had explicitly declined to hear Appellants\u2019 request as untimely. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[Cjourts\u2019 decisions about the propriety of hearing declaratory judgment actions, which are necessarily bound up with their decisions about the propriety of granting declaratory relief, should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d). Second, the language from <em>Wilton </em>which Appellants interpret as limiting abuse of discretion review to cases in which there is a parallel state proceeding does no such thing, nor do any of this Court\u2019s cases. <em>See id. </em>at 290 (declining \u201cto delineate the outer boundaries of [a court\u2019s] discretion\u201d in cases arising in different procedural context, not questioning whether courts still <em>have </em>discretion in other contexts). The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Appellants\u2019 request as untimely because it was \u201c[essentially ... a collateral attack on [the] Plan\u201d and Appellants are \u201cprecluded from seeking to modify the Confirmation Order and Plan ... under Rule 60(b) ... [because Appellants] have not brought their request ... in a reasonable time\u201d is well within its discretion, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Moreover, Appellants\u2019 claim that <em>Whelton v. Educational Credit Management Corp., </em>432 F.3d 150 (2d Cir.2005), \u201cbears striking ... similarities\u201d to this case does nothing to help their cause. That case held that Rule 60(b)\u2019s time-limits applied to a request to \u201cdeclare one of the provisions of a confirmed plan void.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156 n. 2. In addition, <em>Whelton </em>does not hold, as Appellants would have it, that a bankruptcy court <em>must </em>find that filing a Rule 60(b) motion within two years is reasonable. As in <em>Whelton, </em>we are only concerned here with whether the bankruptcy. court acted within its discretion. We find that it did, and nothing in <em>Whelton </em>requires otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Finally, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling that Appellants\u2019 appeal from the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s August 16th order is moot. Appellants themselves concede that if this Court rules against them on their other two grounds for appeal, as we have, their appeal on this point is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
