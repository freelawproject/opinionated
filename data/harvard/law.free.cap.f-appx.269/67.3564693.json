Cogan, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b95-24\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b95-25\">Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-26\">In June 2005, Defendant-Appellant Peter Wilmer Sanders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been serving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>term of supervised release in the Southern District of New York for a prior conviction when he attacked two women, one of whom he was dating. After his incarceration, Sanders was arrested for writing to the woman he was dating, in violation of a court order. Sanders pleaded guilty to third degree assault and second degree criminal contempt of a court order in New York State Supreme Court and was sentenced to twelve months and three months of incarceration for these offenses, respectively. The offenses served as the basis for \u201cspecifications\u201d noted in an Amended Request for Court Action filed in the district court by the Probation Office. After Sanders admitted to the specifications, the district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to eighteen months of incarceration and five years of supervised release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">On appeal, Sanders challenges his sentence on two grounds, alleging: (1) that the court considered the seriousness of the offenses that led to revocation of his supervised release, even though \u201cseriousness\u201d is not listed among the factors that district courts are permitted to consider in rendering sentences pursuant to revocations of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); and (2) that the district court failed to offer specific reasons under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) \u2014 either in its in-court statement, or in writing \u2014 for' the revocation sentence it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><em>United States v. Williams, </em>443 F.3d 35, 47-48 (2d Cir.2006) refutes Sanders\u2019 first claim. There, we rejected an argument materially indistinguishable from the one Sanders advances here, holding that even though \u201cseriousness of offense\u201d is not among the enumerated factors that district courts are instructed to consider under \u00a7 3583(e), district courts are not <em>precluded </em>from considering the seriousness of such offenses in issuing revocation sentences. <em>Id. </em>We reached that conclusion through examination of the factors that \u00a7 3583(e) (by reference to other sections of Title 18) permits courts to consider in issuing revocation sentences \u2014 among them, \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to afford adequate deterrence,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to protect the public,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). <em>Williams, </em>443 F.3d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">As we concluded in <em>Williams, </em>since district courts may consider these factors, it is also permissible for them to consider the seriousness of the offense leading to revocation. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, we concluded that it is rather difficult to imagine how courts could <em>not </em>also consider seriousness while considering several of the factors contemplated by \u00a7 3583(e). <em>Id. </em>Unsurprisingly, we found that legislative history also supports that sensible conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">Accordingly, we conclude that it was not error for the district court to consider the seriousness of Sanders\u2019 offenses in determining an appropriate revocation sentence. Furthermore, after review of Sanders\u2019 revocation sentence under the standard of reasonableness that we have said applies to such sentences, <em>see United States v. McNeil, </em>415 F.3d 273, 277 (2d Cir.2005), we also conclude that the sentence was reasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Sanders\u2019 second argument \u2014 one he admittedly failed to raise before the district court \u2014 is that his case should be remanded for resentencing due to the district court\u2019s failure to state its specific reasons for the revocation sentence \u201cin open court\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 3553(c), and in wilting, pursuant to \u00a7 3553(c)(2). The government asserts that the district court\u2019s stated reasons in open court \u201cwere more than sufficient,\u201d but consents to a remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to state the specific reasons for its sentence in writing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Section 3553(c) requires a \u201ccourt, at the time of sentencing, ... [to] state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). Furthermore, if such sentence is beyond the advisory guidelines range, \u00a7 3553(c)(2) requires that the court provide \u201cthe specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that described\u201d by the guideline range, and \u201cwith specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3553(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Prior to rendering its sentence, the district court noted Sanders\u2019 failure to change his behavior after a \u201clong period\u201d of prior incarceration, the seriousness of the underlying state crime that precipitated revocation proceedings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Sanders\u2019 substantial criminal history (involving ten prior convictions). We agree with the government that the district court\u2019s open court statement \u2014 brief though it was \u2014 was adequate for \u00a7 3553(c) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">We agree with Sanders, however, that, because the district court\u2019s sentence was outside the advisory guideline range of seven to thirteen months,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u00a7 3553(c)(2) required that the district court\u2019s specific reasons for departing from that range be recorded in writing. In view of the government\u2019s concession to a limited remand in order to allow the district court to correct this error, and the small effort to which it will put the district court upon remand, we see no need to determine whether Sanders\u2019 failure to raise this issue below was \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court and REMAND for the limited purpose of affording the district court an opportunity to record its specific reasons for the revocation sentence in writing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-27\">. Sanders is also sometimes referred to in court documents as \"Wilmer Peter Sanders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">. The eighteen month sentence was five months above the advisory range of seven to thirteen months established by the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and six months below tire twenty-four months recommended by the Probation Office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-15\">. Because Sanders' original conviction for his first term of supervised release was for a Class A felony, the district court was permitted by statute to sentence him to a maximum of five years\u2019 incarceration, upon revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. The government, in fact, takes the position that remand is \"required,\u201d Appellee's Br. at 14 and is \u201cnecessary,\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">. We note that there is some ambiguity in the district court\u2019s observation that Sanders \u201cgot into this serious problem and ... lost control.\u201d J.A. at 29. The \u201cserious problem\u201d to which the district court referred may have been Sanders' drug use, which apparently led to the initial violent conduct that prompted revocation proceedings, rather than the charged revocation conduct itself. As we have discussed above, however, even if the \"serious problem\u201d <em>was </em>Sanders\u2019 offense conduct, <em>Williams </em>clearly permitted the district court to take this into account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b97-17\">. This range was established by virtue of Sanders' Grade C violation of the conditions of his supeivised release, and his criminal history category of V. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b97-18\">. Although we are informed by Sanders\u2019 counsel\u2019s brief that Sanders has submitted additional <em>pro se </em>arguments, we have received none, despite our prior order permitting such submission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
