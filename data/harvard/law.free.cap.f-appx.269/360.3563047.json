Lopez-Cortez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on the determination that his 1991 conviction for indecency with a child under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-23\">Sexual abuse of a minor is an enumerated offense which qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>601, 604-05 (5th Cir.2000), held that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a) is sexual abuse of a minor as that term is used in its \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d As such, the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202-03 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Lopez-Cortez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Toyres v. United. States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
