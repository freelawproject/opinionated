We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-27\">Romero-Sanchez contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>dismiss the indictment, because the entry of the underlying deportation order was fundamentally unfair. To sustain a collateral attack on a deportation order in a subsequent criminal proceeding, a defendant must demonstrate that his due process rights were violated by defects in the underlying deportation proceeding, and that he suffered prejudice as a result. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d); <em>United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1047-48 (9th Cir.2004). To establish prejudice, a defendant must only show that he had a plausible ground for relief from deportation. <em>See id. </em>at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The district court found that the deportation proceedings did not violate Romero-Sanchez\u2019s due process rights. However, we conclude that Romero-Sanchez suffered a due process violation when the Immigration Judge ruled that he was not eligible for relief from deportation at the time of the deportation proceedings in April, 1997. See <em>United States v. Leon-Paz, </em>340 F.3d 1003, 1006-07 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (holding that \u00a7 212(c) relief remained available for aliens who pleaded guilty at a time when their plea would not have rendered them ineligible for such relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The district court properly found that Romero-Sanchez did have a plausible ground for relief, and could therefore establish prejudice. <em>See Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1050. We conclude that entry of the underlying deportation order was invalid, and cannot be used as an element of Romero-Sanehez\u2019s conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d); <em>Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1051. We therefore reverse the conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. <em>See Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
