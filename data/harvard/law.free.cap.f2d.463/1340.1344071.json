BROWN, Chief Judge, and WISDOM, GEWIN, BELL, THORNBERRY, COLEMAN, GOLDBERG, AINSWORTH, GODBOLD, DYER, SIMPSON, MORGAN, CLARK, IN-GRAHAM and RONEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1431-11\">JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge, with whom WISDOM and GOLDBERG, Circuit Judges,</author>\n<p id=\"AjO\">join, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-12\">If a Deputy United States Marshal, after discovering a tubercular prisoner\u2019s critical physical condition, nevertheless decided to consign that individual to the custody of State authorities in a county jail without first determining whether the facilities provided adequate treatment for tuberculosis victims, and without even attempting to find out whether the conditions of confinement reasonably assured continued survival, I have difficulty believing that the Government\u2019s liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act for death resulting from lack of proper medical attention or from an unsanitary environment could be avoided with the bland assertion that the Marshal had no authority to convert the jail into a hospital. Since the facts of the present case are not materially different, I suggest that this serious and previously unresolved problem involving the care of Federal prisoners temporarily confined under contract with State officials is of sufficient importance to merit en banc reconsideration by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-16\">No one disputes that the Marshal was explicitly charged by law with an affirmative duty to provide for the safekeeping, care and protection of persons in his custody accused of Federal offenses, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4042. No one suggests that the Marshal was not given more than fair warning of his prisoner\u2019s unmistakably suicidal tendencies as a result of his initially unsuccessful but obviously serious attempt to take his own life. No one asserts that the Marshal made any reasonably diligent effort to assure proper supervision of the prisoner while he was confined alone in his cell or that the same tragic result would have transpired if Logue had remained in a hospital equipped to providq the necessary surveillance. The only justification advanced for overturning the District Court\u2019s finding of negligence on the part of the Marshal is the conclusion that the record provides no basis for holding that he \u201chad any power or authority to control any of the internal functions of the Nueces County jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-17\">Without initiating an extensive discourse on the state of the evidence\u2014 which seems to offer at least some tangible support for the theory that the Sheriff and his deputies were subject to the Marshal\u2019s control because they frequently complied with his informal instructions or suggestions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 I need only point out that the question of the Marshal\u2019s authority to effect changes in the conditions of confinement is actually irrelevant here. The breach of the statutory duty of care occurred when Logue was confined under circumstances which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>the Marshal knew were inherently dangerous in the absence of special precautions, regardless of what he may or may not have been empowered to do about the situation. Once the Government undertakes performance of an act entailing a duty of ordinary care it may not thereafter avoid liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act simply by abandoning the undertaking and attempting to attribute the responsibility to someone else. Indian Towing Company v. United States, 1955, 350 U.S. 61, 69, 76 S.Ct. 122, 126, 100 L.Ed. 48, 56; United States v. Gavagan, 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 319, cert. denied, 1961, 364 U.S. 933, 81 S.Ct. 379, 5 L.Ed.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">Rather than providing for Logue\u2019s safety, the Marshal simply abandoned him, thus breaching the duty of care which, \u201cin the case of a mental patient, * * * must be reasonably adapted and proportioned to his known suicidal, homicidal, or other like destructive tendencies.\u201d United States v. Gray, 10 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 239, 242. In this respect the present case is equivalent to Underwood v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 356 F.2d 92, in which liability under the Act resulted from the Air Force\u2019s negligence in permitting a mentally deranged Airman to return to unrestricted duty and to draw from the armory a pistol he subsequently used to kill his wife. There was no suggestion that liability was contingent upon the exercise of \u201cauthority\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d by the Government at the time of the shooting, since liability arose only from the initial failure to utilize ordinary care. The same is true here \u2014 the Marshal\u2019s purported inability to arrange for the continuous observation of the prisoner does not excuse the earlier breach of the duty to provide a reasonably safe place of confinement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">The Court also reasons that the negligence of the State authorities in failing to keep Logue under constant scrutiny cannot be attributed to the United States because the Nueces County jail was a \u201ccontractor\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2671. Of course I do not dispute the axiomatic proposition that ordinarily such a \u201ccontractor\u201d is not an \u201cemployee\u201d for whose negligence the Government is liable under the Act. Emelwon, Inc. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 9, cert, denied sub nom. Florida v. Emelwon, Inc., 393 U.S. 841, 89 S.Ct. 119, 21 L.Ed.2d 111. However, here the plaintiffs rely primarily upon that portion of the Act defining \u201cemployees\u201d as \u201c * * * persons acting on behalf of a federal agency in an official capacity, temporarily or permanently in the service of the United States, whether with or without compensation.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2671. Since under the contract arrangement State authorities perform all functions incidental to the confinement of Federal prisoners that would otherwise be performed by the United States Marshal, the theory is that the Marshal\u2019s office is a \u201cfederal agency\u201d on behalf of which State jailers act \u201cin an official capacity, temporarily * * * in the service of the United States.\u201d In effeet, the Nueces County Sheriff and his deputies become surrogate Marshals for purposes of Federal tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-12\">While passing no final judgment at this stage, I do point out that this argument was barely mentioned in the panel\u2019s opinion, much less refuted by it. The Government contends that a Marshal has no authority to appoint a State law enforcement officer to act on behalf of or in the service of the United States, yet under the literal wording of the statute the absence of such authority would appear to be irrelevant. Moreover, when the Government decides that a particular individual should assume obligations and responsibilities virtually identical to those of a salaried Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>employee, there may very well be some persuasive basis for the suggestion that such an individual\u2019s breach of a specific statutory duty owed by the salaried employee to a specific class of persons should visit identical liability upon the United States. Obviously there is more than a subtle distinction between a \u201ccontractor\u201d who breaches a duty of reasonable care owed to the world at large and a \u201ccontractor\u201d who performs specific custodial functions that under a plain Congressional mandate would ordinarily entail a definite obligation of due care owed to a discrete (and particularly vulnerable) class of people. If only for the sake of uniformity and the avoidance of formalistic legal distinctions totally divorced from the realities of the situation, further consideration of the problem might inevitably lead to the conclusion that the Sheriff and his deputies were \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of the Act, particularly in light of the principle that \u201cthe Government\u2019s liability is no longer restricted to circumstances in which government bodies have traditionally been responsible for misconduct of their employees. The Act extends to novel and unprecedented forms of liability as well.\u201d United States v. Muniz, 1963, 374 U.S. 150, 159, 83 S.Ct. 1850, 1856, 10 L.Ed.2d 805, 813. As has long been recognized, \u201cthe Federal Tort Claims Act waives the Government\u2019s immunity from suit in sweeping language.\u201d United States v. Yellow Cab Company, 1951, 340 U.S. 543, 547, 71 S.Ct. 399, 402, 95 L.Ed. 523, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">Apart from the difficulties posed by this case in isolation, its implications within the broader context of modern-day prison administration are even more disturbing. Overcrowding and substandard physical facilities inevitably have a progressively detrimental impact on the administrator\u2019s ability to insure the health, safety and welfare of those in his custody. Increasingly we are being forced to confront undeniable evidence that the inmates of many institutions routinely subject other prisoners to varieties of subhuman treatment that no citizen of a civilized nation, whatever his transgression against society, should be compelled to endure. That such outrages are inflicted upon those serving sentences following conviction is disgraceful. But when the victim charged with a Federal offense is merely confined temporarily in a State jail while awaiting transfer or release on bond, I hardly think we provide an acceptable answer when we tell him or his family that restitution for death or injury resulting from his custodian\u2019s culpable neglect is unavailable because the responsible official was wearing a State rather than a Federal badge. In such circumstances I cannot concede that despite the constable\u2019s blunder the Government must go free.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1431-13\">. The panel\u2019s opinion supports this position by stating that the Nueces County authorities complied with the Marshal\u2019s request that Logue be placed in a cell stripped of all items likely to prove injurious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1432-7\">. The Government attempts to distinguish <em>Underwood </em>by implying that here its statutory responsibilities were somehow \u201cdelegated to the Sheriff and his deputies. Neither the statutes nor the case law sanctions such a \u201cdelegation.\" Indian Towing Company v. United States, <em>supra,; </em>United States v.
