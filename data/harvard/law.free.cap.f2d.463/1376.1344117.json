(Bulova), appellant, seeks to prevent Albert J. Miller (Miller), appellee, from registering the trademark UNITRON for \u201cwatches and clocks\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the grounds that it so resembles Bulova\u2019s registered trademark ACCUTRON for watches as to be likely, when applied to Miller\u2019s goods, \u201cto cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). On a Joint Stipulation of Facts, with certain Exhibits, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> found that Bulova\u2019s ACCUTRON mark and Miller\u2019s UNITRON mark \u201cviewed in their entireties * * * do not look alike or sound alike or have similar connotations.\u201d Accordingly, the board found no likelihood of confusion or mistake, and dismissed the opposition. We agree with the board and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-24\">Bulova registered its ACCUTRON trademark in 1960, some five years before Miller\u2019s application date. Bulova\u2019s use and promotion of its mark are set out in Bulova Watch Co., Inc. v. Waltham Watch Co., 408 F.2d 1062, 56 CCPA 1048 (1969). It appears from the factual recitation in that opinion, and the Joint Stipulation filed here, that Bulova'sold about $75 million of ACCUTRON watches during the period 1960-1968. During that period it also expended some $11 million in promoting the sale of the ACCUTRON.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-25\">Both of the ACCUTRON. and UNI-TRON marks here are identified with a particular type of watch, i. e., an electronic one. ACCU, Bulova says, suggests \u201caccuracy\u201d and the commonly used suffix TRON means \u201cthrough electronics.\u201d Analyzing Miller\u2019s UNITRON in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>like manner, we have the prefix UNI which the dictionary gives the meaning \u201cone\u201d and the identical suffix TRON connoting \u201cthrough electronics.\u201d Miller claims his mark\u2019s prefix UNI suggests the manner in which his watch indicates the time in units through small windows on the face of the watch rather than in the conventional manner around the edge of the face by the use of \u201chands.\u201d The common meaning, as well as the connotation, of the two marks is entirely different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has written a very concise and erudite opinion in this case in which it points out that there is no issue as to the priority of use or the type of goods involved here. Bulova\u2019s ACCUTRON is prior and both marks are used on electronic watches. Nor is the applicable standard in dispute; i. e., that the marks must be viewed in their entireties in determining the likelihood of confusion. The board found that the suffix \u201cTRON\u201d is a dictionary term, and is somewhat suggestive when applied to horological devices as it often has been in the past as shown by several third party registrations of record. It concluded that any similarity would not be such as to lead to confusion or mistake or deception. We place great weight on the board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\"> Bulova urges that the case is controlled by Bulova Watch Co., Inc. v. Waltham Watch Co., supra. We think not. The marks there involved were \u201cACCUTRON\u201d and \u201cAUTOCHRON.\u201d They have a marked resemblance in sound as well as in form that is not present in UNITRON and ACCUTRON. What the court did there, where there was serious doubt of dissimilarity present, was to apply the well-established principle of trademark law of resolving the doubt in favor of the first user. Here, there being no doubt, that rule has no application. Nor is the TIMEX-TELIX principle of United States Time Corp. v. Tennenbaum, 267 F.2d 327, 46 CCPA 895 (1959) apposite. As the court pointed out therein, the marks \u201cboth begin with the letter \u2018T\u2019 and end in \u2018x;\u2019 they both contain the same number of letters; they both contain the same number of syllables.\u201d Here the words look different, as they begin with different letters and contain a different number of letters. In pronunciation the words are of entirely different sound and have different connotations. As the board said, UNITRON and ACCUTRON just do not look alike, sound alike or connote alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">The dismissal of the opposition is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1466-18\">.
