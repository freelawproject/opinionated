At trial, the Assistant Vice-President and Manager of the Wilmington Office of the Delaware Trust Company testified that he was custodian of the charters of the bank, and that on the critical date, March 14, 1969, the bank was a member of the F.D.I.C. His testimony was not contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-22\">We hold that the uncontradicted testimony was sufficient to sustain the government\u2019s burden. United States v. Phillips, 427 F.2d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 867, 91 S.Ct. 108, 27 L.Ed.2d 106 (1970); United States v. Safley, 408 F.2d 603, 605 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 983, 89 S.Ct. 2147, 23 L.Ed.2d 772 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">The judgment of conviction will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
