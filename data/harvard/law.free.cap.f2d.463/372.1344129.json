Defendant-appellant was convicted on the first three counts involving possession of unregistered firearms in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), on count five charging him with transporting firearms in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) \u2014 count four alleging a violation of this section having been dismissed by the court at the conclusion of the government\u2019s case \u2014and on count six involving a violation of 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a), which section proscribes possession of firearms that have been \u201cin or affecting interstate commerce\u201d (United States v. Tuck (4 Cir. <em>slip </em>opinion #71-1977, 3/8/72 by one having been previously convicted of a felony. The defendant was sentenced to a term of eighteen months on each count, said sentences to run concurrently. On Motion of the parties, the questions raised in this appeal were submitted to the court on briefs without oral argument. We affirm the convictions on counts one, two, three, and five of the indictment and we reverse the conviction on count six.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-20\">On March 16, 1970, defendant, who was then a licensed firearms dealer, pled guilty to one count of an earlier indictment which charged him with the sale of a firearm to a person known by him to be a non-resident of his home state of Virginia, this sale being in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b) (3). As a result of that felony conviction, defendant was thereafter prohibited from possessing any firearms and his license as a firearms dealer, which expired a few months later, was not renewed. On September 21, 1970, a search warrant was obtained from a United States Magistrate and was executed at the residence of the defendant, resulting in the seizure of sixty-two firearms from defendant\u2019s automobile, garage, house, and briefcase. It was upon such seizures that the indictment here involved was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Defendant urges reversal of his conviction on the five counts of the indictment and posits his contentions on various theories, the most substantial of which are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">1. That the trial judge 'erred in refusing to grant defendant\u2019s Motion for Transfer in that said trial judge, having presided at defendant\u2019s earlier guilty plea proceeding, should have recused himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">2. That the search warrant which was obtained on September 21, 1970, was defective for failure to set forth facts sufficient to constitute probable cause and, therefore, the fruits of that search should have been suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">3. That count five of the indictment should have been dismissed because the Essex frames, which were seized in the search of September 21, 1970, wei\u2019e not firearms within the meaning of the governing statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">4. That the conviction based on count six should be reversed because the government failed to allege or prove that the firearms found in defendant\u2019s possession were in or affecting interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">Since we deem all other grounds and objections raised by the defendant on this appeal to be insubstantial and without merit, we find nothing to warrant reversal or remand based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Considering defendant\u2019s arguments in the order above set forth, we perceive no evidence of prejudice or bias on the part of the trial judge and we are not persuaded that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying defendant\u2019s Motion for Transfer. United States v. Ramsey, (4th Cir. slip opinion #71-1716, 4/21/72).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Defendant contends, since the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not allege that the firearms purported to be in defendant\u2019s possession had at any time been in or affecting interstate commerce, that this search warrant was improvidently issued and the weapons\u2014 the evidence obtained pursuant to the execution of the warrant \u2014 were illegally seized and, therefore, should not have been admitted at the trial. The search warrant, however, comported with the law as it existed at the time of its issuance and, as such, was clearly valid. (United States v. Hanon (8 Cir.) 428 F.2d 101, cert. den. 402 U.S. 952, 91 S.Ct. 1608, 29 L.Ed.2d 122).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Defendant next contends that the Essex frames which he transported from Virginia to Maryland are not firearms within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) (3) (A) and (B). We find, however, ample evidence in the record, when such record is viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilty on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">Finally, defendant urges reversal of his conviction on count six of the indictment because the government did not allege or prove that the possession of these firearms was in or affecting interstate commerce pursuant to the requirements of United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1972). Since it is obvious that the government failed to prove the requisite nexus with interstate commerce, and this the government admits, we reverse the conviction as to count six. United States v. Tuck, <em>supra, </em>United States v. Martin (4 Cir. slip opinion #71-2122, 3/27/72).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
