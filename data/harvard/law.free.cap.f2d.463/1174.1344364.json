Appellants, who are private plaintiffs-intervenors, contend that improper criteria were thereafter used by the School Board in connection with the retention, promotion, and demotion of school principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">Amended nonracial objective criteria for employing, dismissing, transferring, promoting and demoting teachers and staff members in compliance with Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir., 1970, 419 F.2d 1211, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1032, 90 S.Ct. 612, 24 L.Ed.2d 530 (1970), were finally developed in a conference held on August 6, 1971, between the Trial Judge and all parties, including the United States, the National Education Association, plaintiffs, and the appellants. Neither the United States nor the National Education Association has appealed. On this appeal appellants object to the'criteria insofar as they provide that \u201cComparable scores on the National Teachers Examination will be a factor for consideration in determining employment or promotion of teachers and principals.\u201d The Board\u2019s use of the National Teachers Examination as one of the factors for consideration in the nonracial objective criteria was not improper. Cf. United States v. Texas Education Agency, 5 Cir., 1972, 459 F.2d 600, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">Appellants\u2019 appeal is also directed to the order of the District Court dated August 20, 1971, which overruled appellants\u2019 motion to reconsider a prior order of the District Court dated June 23, 1971. The prior order held that two black teachers who had been promoted to the principalship and assistant principal-ship, respectively, of formerly all-white Livingston High School were promoted in compliance with <em>Singleton </em>standards and that the principal claims for relief as to which evidence was offered have been met. In their motion for reconsideration of the June 23, 1971 order, appellants contended that \u201cthe defendant school board had never evaluated the qualifications of all of the principals in the system in light of non-racial objective criteria.\u201d They also complained that certain principals were unconstitutionally demoted and entitled to back pay. On appeal, they contend that a white assistant principal was unconstitutionally promoted to principal in violation of <em>Singleton. </em>The record filed herein is devoid of any evidence on these issues. And it is not clear whether the Board\u2019s action in appointing school prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>cipals after the desegregation order first referred to herein, occurred in accordance with the nonracial objective standards of <em>Singleton. </em>As an appellate court we cannot operate in a vacuum. We must learn the facts. If they have not so far been elicited in an adversary hearing, they must be, though on this record we cannot say one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Accordingly, the cause is remanded to the District Court for an evidentiary hearing and entry of appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of whether the Board has violated <em>Singleton </em>standards pertaining to nonracial objective criteria, in employing, dismissing, transferring, promoting, or demoting principals and staff in the system after implementing the Terminal Desegregation Plan. Cf. <em>Singleton, </em>supra; United States v. Texas Education Agency, 5 Cir., 1972, 459 F.2d 600; Horton v. Lawrence County Board of Education, 5 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 793; Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 5 Cir., 1971, 453 F.2d 1104. We intimate no view on the ultimate merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Affirmed in part, vacated and remanded in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
