They appeal from an order of the District Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> following trial, dismissing their complaint on the alternative grounds that their action was precluded by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or that the time periods involved were so short as to fall within the <em>de minimis </em>rule noted by the Supreme Court in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since we concur that the Portal-to-Portal Act applies here, we affirm the order of the District Court on that basis without reaching the question of the application of the <em>de minimis </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">In each of the three lockage areas of the Panama Canal vessels transiting the locks are guided and assisted by electrical towing locomotives moving along the walls of the lock chamber. Appellants here are operators of these locomotives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">The Canal is never closed, so the operators work eight-hour shifts that begin and end with the relief on the locomotive itself of the operator who worked the prior shift. Since any locomotive might be at any point along the chamber wall at the end of a shift, and since the operators are not permanently assigned to a specific locomotive, each shift begins with each operator checking an assignment board located near the gate to the lockage area to learn which locomotive he is to operate and where it can be found. He must then walk to the locomotive and be ready to assume control when the shift begins. Depending on the lockage area and the distance of the locomotive from the gate at that particular time, this entire process, including the walk to the locomotive can take as little as two minutes or as much as fifteen minutes. In order to assure that the operators are on their assigned locomotives at the beginning of the shift, the Company expects them to check in at the lockage area gate sufficiently ahead of the time their shift begins to enable them to note the assignment board and walk to their assigned locomotive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Operators are not required to punch a time clock and no formal time record is kept of the time they report and are relieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">For several years prior to the initiation of this suit, appellants unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Company that they were entitled to compensation for the time spent in checking the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>signment board and walking to the locomotives from the gate. Since they work a full eight-hour shift on the locomotive,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this extra time would have to be compensated at overtime rates. The issue in this suit is whether the operators are entitled to overtime compensation pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544 for the time spent in cheeking the assignment board and walking to their locomotives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">The basic legal problem confronting us on this appeal is the reconciliation of two closely related but separate bodies of federal legislation concerning employment compensation. In the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as amended and as modified by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, Congress has enacted an extensive scheme of regulation of wages and hours to govern a broad portion of the private employment relationships in the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Through an even more complex body of legislation, of which Section 5544 is only a small part, Congress explicitly provides for the compensation and regulation of the terms of employment of various groups of employees of the Federal Government. Since the enactment of FLSA, both Congress and the courts have often looked to that body of employment regulations for guidance in analyzing and interpreting similar provisions in the complex of regulations governing federal employment. We continue that process here and conclude that the congressional policies behind the two acts require that the Portal-to-Portal Act provisions should apply to these federal wage board employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">A. <em>The Relationship of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Portal-to-Portal Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">There is little room for question that if the Panama Canal Company were a private employer meeting the jurisdictional requirements of the FLSA,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the appellants\u2019 suit would be precluded by the Portal-to-Portal Act. If the Company were covered by the FLSA, the locomotive operators would be entitled to the protection of Section 7(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-12\">[N]o employer shall employ any of his employees . . . for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-14\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a) (1) (1970). The hours to be included in any \u201cworkweek\u201d receive only a limited, exclusionary definition in the statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(o) (1970), so the initial question would be whether the time spent in checking the assignment board and walking to the locomotives constituted part of the \u201cworkweek.\u201d In Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>tery Company, 328 U.S. 680, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515 (1946), the famous ease that launched the Portal-to-Portal legislation, the Supreme Court was called upon to determine this question in a factual setting quite similar to the present case, and they found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-4\">Since the statutory workweek includes all time during which an employee is necessarily required to be on the employer\u2019s premises, on duty or at a prescribed workplace, the time spent in these activities must be accorded appropriate compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-5\">[T]he time necessarily spent by the employees in walking to work on the employer\u2019s premises, following the punching of the time clocks, was working time within the scope of \u00a7 7(a). . . . Such time was under the complete control of the employer, being dependent solely upon the physical arrangements which the employer made in the factory. Those arrangements in this case compelled the employees to spend an estimated 2 to 12 minutes daily, if not more, in walking on the premises. Without such walking on the part of the employees, the productive aims of the employer could not have been achieved. The employees\u2019 convenience and necessity, moreover, bore no relation whatever to this walking time; they walked on the employer\u2019s premises only because they were compelled to do so by the necessities of the employer\u2019s business. In that respect the walking time differed vitally from the time spent in traveling from workers\u2019 homes to the factory. ... It follows that the time spent in walking to work on the employer\u2019s premises, after the time clocks were punched, involved \u201cphysical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business.\u201d . . . Work of that character must be included in the statutory workweek and compensated accordingly, <em>regardless of contrary custom or contract.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">328 U.S. at 690-692, 66 S.Ct. at 1194 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). It is clear to us that this test of the \u201cworkweek\u201d would encompass the activities of the locomotive operators bringing the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-11\">The congressional reaction to the Mi. <em>Clemens Pottery </em>decision was strong and quick, resulting in passage of the Portal-to-Portal Act at the very next session of Congress less than a year later. Focusing on the final clause of the quoted portion of the decision, Congress found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVB\">that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, has been interpreted judicially in disregard of long-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees, thereby creating wholly unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation, upon employers with the results that, if said Act as so interpreted or claims arising under such interpretations were permitted to stand, ... a substantial burden on commerce and a substantial obstruction to the free flow of goods in commerce [would result].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM7q\">Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, \u00a7 1(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-12\">The operative provisions of the Portal-to-Portal Act which reversed the <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery </em>decision are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-13\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the [FLSA] on account of the failure of such employer to pay an employee . overtime compensation, for or on account of any of the following activities of such employee .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-14\">(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform,, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-15\">(2) activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time ... at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-4\">(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section . the employer shall not be [relieved from liability] if such activity is compensable by either\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-5\">(1) an express provision of a written or nonwritten contract in effect, at the time of such activity, between such employee, his agent, or collective-bargaining representative and his employer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-6\">(2) a custom or practice in effect, at the time of such activity, at the establishment or other place where such employee is employed, covering such activity ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\">The \u201cprincipal activity\u201d of the appellants is the operation of the towing locomotives and the \u201cactual place of performance\u201d of this activity is the locomotive itself. Checking in at the assignment board is an activity \u201cpreliminary to\u201d that \u201cprincipal activity,\u201d and the daily walk to the locomotive certainly constitutes \u201cwalking . to . the actual place of performance of the principal activity.\u201d In addition, there is neither \u201can express provision of a written or nonwritten contract in effect,\u201d nor \u201ca custom or practice in effect\u201d under which the operators were being paid for these activities. Accordingly, we find that if the Canal Company were a private employer subject to the FLSA, the Portal-to-Portal Act would block the locomotive operators\u2019 attempt to recover overtime compensation for the time spent in checking the assignment board and walking to the locomotives prior to the commencement of their \u201cprincipal activity\u201d in operating the locomotives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">B. <em>Applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Portal-to-Portal Act to Federal Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABAJ\">As initially enacted, the FLSA expressly excluded all employees of the Federal Government from its coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In recent years, however, there has been a growing congressional concern to ensure that federal employees do not lose, in the maze of statutory and regulatory provisions governing government employment, the advantages of basic compensation principles developed within the private employment sector. One of the most dramatic expressions of this concern was passage of the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that contained, <em>inter alia, </em>a statement of congressional policy that \u201cFederal salary rates shall be comparable with private enterprise salary rates for the same levels of work.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The principle of \u201ccomparability\u201d with salaries of private enterprise, first expressed in this Act, has since motivated three specific statutory provisions involved in this action. It is from these statutes, and their legislative history, that we derive our conviction that the Portal-to-Portal Act applies to the claim that appellants make here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-16\">1. <em>The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-17\">The District Court relied principally on Section 306 of the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966 for its finding that the Portal-to-Portal Act applies to these locomotive operators.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>provision added a new subsection to the FLSA that explicitly brought federal wage board employees and two other classes of federal employees within the minimum wage and overtime compensation requirements of the FLSA. Appellants argue that this amendment should be construed narrowly. They quote a sentence from the Senate Report on the bill, that \u201c[t]his provision has been added to the act to affirm that no employee of the Federal Government . should receive compensation at rates less than those prescribed by the Federal act for private employment,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as standing for the proposition that only the imposition of a minimum floor for federal wages was intended. They argue that the Portal-to-Portal Act is one of the \u201cother provisions of the act\u201d to which this amendment was intended not to be subject.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We find no such intent to exempt the federal employees brought within the coverage of the FLSA by this amendment from the effect of the Portal-to-Portal Act on their rights to overtime compensation. Rather, we find in the legislative history of the amendment a clear indication that Congress intended to apply the principle of comparability \u2014including an explicit attempt to bring the compensation of these federal employees in the Canal Zone within the same body of regulation as is applicable to private enterprise employees in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">In 1965 congressional hearings were begun in both houses on a myriad of separate bills to amend the FLSA both to extend its coverage and to raise the mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>mum wage rate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In the early stages of the House hearings, during the testimony of Secretary of Labor Wirtz, Representatives James Roosevelt and Augustus Hawkins raised the question of federal payment of wages below the FLSA\u2019s minimum rates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-4\">Mr. ROOSEVELT. . . . I am shocked by the fact that the Government itself violates this principle of minimum wages as much as anybody else. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-6\">It is our understanding that civilian contractors with the U.S. Government can pay less than a minimum wage if they are not covered by the [FLSA] or the Davis-Bacon Act or the WalshHealy Act. This means that the United States can be a party to the payment of a subminimum wage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-7\">Now, for the Government to be a party to that kind of thing, and at the same time to have you come before us and ask us to extend the general application to the rest of industry, it seems to me is absolutely inexcusable, and I would ask that the Department look into this situation and report to this committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-8\">Mr. HAWKINS. Would you add to that, Mr. Chairman, also the employees, as I understand, here in the Capitol? Some investigation should be made of them. I understand that there are many of them that are working at $1 an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-9\">Mr. ROOSEVELT. If it is possible, Mr. Secretary, for you to give us information as to anywhere in the Government service where people are legally working on Government payrolls at less than the minimum wage, we would like to have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-12\">[W] e had better drop this entire bill . if the Government can\u2019t apply the same standard it is applying to other people, to itself, [because] then we don\u2019t have much basis for what we are doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-13\">House Hearings, pt. 1, at 59-60. Secretary Wirtz agreed to provide the requested information, but he expressed some concern about Mr. Roosevelt\u2019s apparent view that the Government was obliged to pay the FLSA minimum wage rate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-14\">[I]t should be made quite clear that the question is whether the Government should do voluntarily, and in the absence of legal obligation, that which the Congress has required in certain areas. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-15\">Now, I agree with the point, Mr. Chairman, but the Government does, in its administrative capacity, already go beyond what the Congress has required of industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-16\">I hope especially in view of your admonition, I can expand the area of that, or be helpful in expanding the area of that voluntary action but it is not that we act in a way which is different from what is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-18\">The bill that emerged from the Committee\u2019s deliberations contained two sections dealing with the problems discussed above. One of these required that \u201cevery employer providing a contract service under a contract with the United States, or any subcontract thereunder, must pay\u201d the FLSA minimum wage rate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The second required payment of FLSA minimum wage and overtime rates to \u201ccertain Federal wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>board employees and employees in non-appropriated fund instrumentalities of the Armed Forces, e. <em>g. </em>post exchanges,\u201d but, only to those employees working within the United States.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The House passed and sent to the Senate the bill containing these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">In its provision concerning federal employees, the Senate bill differed in three respects from the House version: (1) another class of employees was added, (2) the geographical limitation was dropped, and (3) <em>a specific provision dealing with federal employees in the Canal Zone was </em>added.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The language dealing with the Canal Zone employees was added to the bill in committee by Senator Morse.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Since this language had been added after closing the hearings, Senator Morse inserted a personal statement and all the correspondence received by the committee into the <em>Congressional Record </em>to serve as the legislative history behind the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">Opposition to the proposal<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> centered on increased operating costs resulting from higher wage rates, with the resultant possibility that these might lead to higher tolls on ships using the Canal. Another rationale for opposing the bill was that it would increase an already large wage differential between Panamanian citizens employed in the Canal Zone and in the Republic of Panama itself.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This differential, it was argued, would impede the integration of the Canal Zone into the Panamanian economy and might serve to intensify political frictions with the government of Panama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-14\">This last fear was laid to rest by a letter from the Minister of Foreign Relations of the Republic of Panama, dated May 30, 1966:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-15\">I am of the opinion that an argument of this type would be totally unfounded. In effect, the different administrations that the Republic has had have always defended in favor of the Panamanian worker in the service of the Government of the United States of America in the Canal Zone and of the private enterprises that work for it, <em>their right to earn, equal with the United States worker, the same salary for the same work.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-16\">112 Cong.Rec. 20833 (1966) (emphasis added). It would seem from this letter that the most likely source of political friction with the Panamanian government was the wage differential between American and Panamanian Canal workers, rather than between Panamanians working in the Canal Zone and in the Republic. Senator Morse recognized this as the critical problem,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and while acknowledging that his amendment would surely lead to higher costs and possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>to higher canal tolls,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> he stated the basic purpose of his amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-4\">What is at issue here is whether the Canal Zone government is going to pay Panamanian nationals \u2014 for it is they who are at the bottom of the wage scale and hold most of the jobs that would be affected \u2014 a statutory minimum wage which must be paid to Americans elsewhere, and <em>which must be paid to American and Panamanians alike in the Canal Zone if they are employed by private employers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 20830 (emphasis added). The purpose of this legislation, then, as stated by the author, was to achieve wage comparability for Government employees\u2014 both comparability between Panamanian and American nationals, and comparability between Government employees and employees of private enterprises working in the Canal Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">The Conference Committee adopted the Senate version of the bill, with Senator Morse\u2019s Canal Zone amendment intact. Presenting the Conference bill to the Senate, Senator Yarborough, the Floor Manager, described the federal employee provision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-7\">The bill would incorporate in a new section 18(b) of the [FLSA] the policy of paying minimum wages and overtime pay as <em>required by the act </em>to certain Federal wage board employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">112 Cong.Rec. 22651 (1966) (emphasis added). Coupled with the operative provisions of Section 18(b), that these employees would have their wages and overtime compensation set at rates no lower than those provided in Sections 6 &amp; 7 of the FLSA, we find in such statements a convincing repudiation of the appellants\u2019 theory that this act was intended to import only minimum wage rate provisions of the FLSA into federal employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">Under Section 18(b) the minimum wage and overtime compensation requirements of the FLSA were imposed upon the Panama Canal Company to require it to pay its employees according to the prescribed statutory schedules of rates and hours for the regular and overtime hours that they worked. But the Portal-to-Portal Act applies to all pay schedules under the FLSA and explicitly relieves the Company from \u201cany liability . under the [FLSA]\u201d for certain specifically enumerated activities. In other words, the Portal-to-Portal Act operates to deprive employees covered by the FLSA of any cause of action against their employer for either minimum wage or overtime compensation under the FLSA for the activities specified in the Portal Act. Although the appellants here were brought within the coverage of the FLSA by Section 18(b), the Portal Act denies them a cause of action against the Canal Company for overtime compensation under FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-13\">The purpose of the Morse amendment, to achieve comparability of treatment between federal and private employees in the Canal Zone, would be defeated if only the benefits of FLSA <em>(e. g. </em>its minimum rates) and not its limitations <em>(e. g. </em>the Portal-to-Portal Act definition of noncompensable activities) were held to apply to appellants. The limitations of the Portal-to-Portal Act are an integral part of the overtime compensation prescribed by the FLSA. If these limitations were to be ignored, what started out to provide for equality between private employees who were under FLSA and these Canal employees who were not covered, would end up by placing the Canal employees in the superior position. However, since Congress merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>intended to provide for equality of treatment between the two groups, and since those private employees are subject to the limitations of the Portal-to-Portal Act, we believe Congress intended those federal employees (including these Canal Company employees) brought within the FLSA by Section 18(b) to also be governed by the Portal-to-Portal Act provisions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">2. <em>1967 enactments relating to 5 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>55U.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">Although appellants are explicitly within the category of federal employees described in Section 18(b) of the FLSA, to which section we believe the Portal-to-Portal Act clearly applies, they chose to bring this action under a section of the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Appellants argue that regardless of our view of the applicability of the Portal-to-Portal Act to FLSA \u00a7 18(b), that Act cannot be construed to limit their entitlement to compensation under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544. Their argument has some merit, for the operative scheme of the Portal-to-Portal Act is to exempt employers from liability under the FLSA and two other specifically enumerated acts not including the FEPA. Strict adherence to the old maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>or a mechanical application of the rule that the role of the court \u201cis to construe what Congress has written . . . neither to add nor to subtract,\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> would preclude our extending the applicability of the Portal Act to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">But rigidly technical application of such rules has been frequently and authoritatively repudiated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-15\">The maxim invoked expresses a rule of construction, not of substantive law, and serves only as an aid in discovering the legislative intent when that is not otherwise manifest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-16\">Much of our national legislation is embodied in codes, or systematic collections of general rules, each dealing in a comprehensive way with some general subject, . . . and it is the settled rule of decision in this court that where there is subsequent legislation upon such a subject, it carries with it an implication that the general rules are not superseded, but are to be applied in its enforcement, save as the contrary clearly appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK1q\">United States v. Barnes, 222 U.S. 513, 519, 520, 32 S.Ct. 117, 118, 56 L.Ed. 291 (1912).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-18\">However well these rules may serve at times to aid in deciphering legislative intent, they long have been subordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>nated to the doctrine that courts will construe the details of an act in conformity with its dominating general purpose, will read text in the light of context and will interpret the text so far as the meaning of the words fairly permits so as to carry out in particular cases the generally expressed legislative policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">SEC v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corporation, 320 U.S. 344, 350-51, 64 S.Ct. 120, 123, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The general rules embodied in the FLSA are those concerning the establishment of minimum allowable wage rates that an employer may pay his employees for the hours they work. The general rules embodied in the Portal-to-Portal Act are that certain employee activities, which the Supreme Court had found compensable under the FLSA in the <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery </em>case, were not entitled to compensation when performed at specified times and places. The operative scheme of the Portal Act \u2014 relieving employers from liability for compensating employees for these activities \u2014 required express enumeration of the statutes under which, <em>at that time, </em>the employer\u2019s liability could be incurred. Subsequent legislation either providing new bases for employers\u2019 liability, or bringing new groups of employers within the coverage of existing liability provisions, should not be construed to supercede the general rule of the Portal Act defining non-compensable activities \u201csave as the contrary clearly appears.\u201d Considering both the text of the Portal Act and the context of the legislative policy applied therein to free employers from the obligation to compensate their employees for certain activities, we find that the interpretation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544 advocated by appellants would wholly abrogate that legislative policy. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-11\">Yet we need not take this step on our own, relying solely on the legislative policy of the Portal-to-Portal Act. For in its policy of wage comparability between federal and private employees, as expressed in two separate enactments in 1967, Congress has provided us with a clear demonstration of their intent that these federal (Canal Company) employees should receive wage and hour treatment substantially equivalent to their counterparts in private enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\"><em>Act of September 11, 1967.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This Act, titled \u201cAn Act to amend titles 5, 14, and 37, United States Code, to codify recent law, and to improve the Code,\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> contains a superficially minor technical revision to the 1966 amendment which added Section 18(b) to the FLSA. This revision, however, reveals a great deal about Congress\u2019s concept of the relationship between the FLSA and the FEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">In Section 1(97) of the Act Congress incorporated a direct cross reference to the minimum wage provision of FLSA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a) (1)) into 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5341(a) \u2014 the basic provision of the FEPA covering compensation of wage board employees. Section 8 of the act amended Section 18(b) of the FLSA, in the words of both the House and Senate Reports accompanying the bill, \u201cto reflect the codification of that part of section 18(b) (1) that applies to Federal employees described in 5 U.S.C. 5341(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>by section 1(97) of this bill.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>It seems beyond question that the intent of these two sections is to import the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage provisions explicitly into the FEPA section covering compensation of wage board employees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">The committee reports explain why the FLSA\u2019s overtime provision was not similarly transposed into the FEPA: \u201cThe provisions of section 18(b) relative to overtime compensation are omitted as unnecessary in view of 5 U.S.C. 5544(a).\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> From this it is apparent that Congress considered 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544, a special provision relating to overtime compensation of wage board employees, to already be equivalent to Section 7 of the FLSA. In effect, this constitutes a declaration that the portion of Section 18(b) dealing with overtime compensation for wage board employees had been redundant with the previously existing Section 5544. We conclude from this that Congress intended that Section 5544 should operate for federal wage board employees in precisely the same manner as FLSA Section 7 operates for private employees. We thus conclude that the limitations of the Portal-to-Portal Act affect both provisions equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\"><em>The Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act \u2018of 1967. </em>Appellants place great reliance on the final sentence of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544(a), which was added by Section 222 of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967:<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-6\">Time spent in a travel status away from the official duty station of an employee subject to this subsection is not hours of work unless the travel (i) involves the performance of work while traveling, (ii) is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling, (iii) is carried out under arduous conditions, or (iv) results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">They argue that:<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-11\">Had Congress intended the Portal to Portal Act to apply to federal wage board employees, it would not have been necessary for it to have added the above quoted language to 5 U.S.C. Section 5544, especially after it had amended Section 18 of the FLSA [in 1966].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-12\">Accordingly, it is the travel time language of 5 U.S.C. Section 5544 to which the district court should have looked for guidance and not the Portal to Portal Act. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">This whole approach belies the ordinary meaning of travel \u2014 to go on a trip, tour, or journey (Websters 3d New International Dictionary) \u2014 and furthermore the legislative history of this amendment directly refutes the interpretation appellants seek to place on it. To begin, appellants\u2019 reference to \u201cSection 18 of the FLSA\u201d is surely misguided, since, as we have just shown, the overtime reference in Section 18(b), as it applied to wage board employees other than those working in the Canal Zone, was removed three months prior to this act in the belief that it was redundant with Section 5544. As we shall demonstrate below, the travel time language was added to Section 5544 to <em>ensure </em>that <em>redundancy </em>\u2014 i. <em>e. </em>to make explicit the identity of operation Congress was seeking between Section 5544 and the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">The travel provision began as an amendment to the House bill during House consideration of the measure. Among the many compromises accompanying passage of the House bill was a reduction in the proposed salary increase for classified employees. Representative Udall, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>ported to the House that to compensate for this reduction \u201cwe consulted with these people to find out which fringe benefit amendment they feel is the most urgent, which would cost the least, and which would give justice to their people.\u201d 113 Cong.Rec. 28641 (1967). The travel pay provision, proposed as an amendment to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542 (the general overtime authorization for classified employees), was described by Mr. Udall as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-4\">This amendment picks up the fair labor standards provisions that apply <em>in private enterprise </em>and attempts to make a beginning to link the Government treatment of overtime and premium pay for overtime involved in the cost of travel to <em>private enterprise standards.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The intent to attain comparability with FLSA standards could hardly have been expressed more clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">The House bill was considered by the Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee, which chose to expand on the \u201cbeginning\u201d made in the House by extending the travel provisions to include wage board and postal field service employees as well as the classified service.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This extension was accomplished, <em>inter alia, </em>by the Senate adding to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544(a) the precise language that was subsequently adopted. Identical language was added to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542 and 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571 to cover classified and postal employees. The Conference Committee\u2019s substitute bill adopted the Senate version of the travel provision,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and was enacted as Section 222 of the Postal Revenue and Federal Salary Act of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">In addition to Representative Udall\u2019s statement concerning the intent to make these provisions comparable to private enterprise standards, we find other indications that this amendment to Section 5544 was designed to compensate travel different in both type and extent from that for which appellants are seeking overtime pay. Appellants have focused on the Company\u2019s inability to predict the location of the locomotives from shift to shift to support the contention that their \u201ctravel\u201d is compensable because it \u201cresults from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.\u201d Mr. Udall\u2019s formulation of this particular provision had read: \u201c[time spent in travel outside the regularly scheduled workweek] is hours of work, if \u2014 (1) the employee is required to travel for a substantial distance because of an emergency arising from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively. . . . \u201d 113 Cong. Rec. 28640 (1967). Admittedly, the Senate\u2019s, and the final statute\u2019s, abbreviation of this highly specific provision might be construed as an attempt to make it more broadly inclusive of other situations than those covered by Mr. Udall. But the Senate Report belies such a liberalizing intent and indicates an intent more in keeping with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201ctravel.\u201d In 1965 an act had been passed directing agencies to schedule travel away from the official duty station within the regularly scheduled workweek \u201c[t]o the maximum extent practicable.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Senate Report notes <footnotemark>38</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-13\">We are not satisfied with the progress agencies have made to comply with the 1965 act. An employee should not be required to travel on his offday in order to be at work at a temporary duty station early Monday morning to attend a meeting. It is an imposition upon his private life that should not be made. . Proper scheduling and administrative planning is the answer to the problems of travel pay in many cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>When emergencies occur or when events cannot be controlled realistically by those in authority, traveltime must be paid for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">The extent of the travel so referred to, from Sunday to Monday, indicates that Congress in this portion of the report was referring to travel more in the sense of a journey. It is clear to us that the \u201ctraveltime\u201d made compensable under Section 5544 by events not capable of administrative scheduling or control was not intended to encompass the appellants\u2019 daily two to fifteen minute walks to their locomotives from the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">Finally, we find in the structure of the 1967 travel pay provisions further reason to believe that Congress intended to equate federal and private enterprise employees\u2019 compensation in regard to travel time. The Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor has promulgated regulations pursuant to the FLSA to explain and illustrate the application of that act to various travel situations. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 785.33-.41 (1971). An examination of these regulations reveals a striking parallel between the descriptions of compensable travel time included therein and the enumerated categories of compensable travel found in the 1967 Act\u2019s amendments to Section 5544. Each example of compensable travel time in the FLSA regulations is included within one of the compensable categories of the 1967 Act, and the 1967 Act contains an additional category not included in the regulations.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Equally significant is that \u00a7 785.34 of these regulations describes the \u201c[ejffeet of section 4 of the Portal-to-Portal Act\u201d on compensation for travel time. If, to paraphrase the appellants\u2019 contention, Congress intended the Portal-to-Portal Act <em>not </em>to apply to federal wage board employees, we submit that they would have so indicated by inserting <em>another </em>additional category of compensable travel expressly providing for portal-to-portal payment. We consider their failure to do so to be a further reflection of their intent to pursue the policy of wage comparability between federal and private enterprise employees.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">In Abbott v. United States, 151 F.Supp. 929 (Ct.Cl.1957), ship pilots employed by the Panama Canal Company successfully sought overtime compensation for return trips to their home base after piloting a vessel through the Canal. The practice of the Company had been to consider these trips as working time and compensable when completed during the pilot\u2019s normal working hours, but non-compensable when made after the regular workweek or on the pilot\u2019s day off. The Court of Claims found this to be an irrational distinction, and since the normal custom was to compensate for these trips the court ordered that the pilots should be compensated whenever such trips occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">The Canal Company presently compensates locomotive operators called in on an emergency or stand-by basis from the moment they enter the gate to the lockage area, and the appellants argue by analogy to <em>Abbott </em>that the refusal to pay for similar activity incident to regular working hours is also an irrational distinction which requires that compensation be paid on a daily basis from their initial entry into the lockage area. The District Court distinguished <em>Abbott </em>by finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-6\">[T]he emergency call-in for a locomotive operator creates an entirely different work situation than the normal scheduled work day. An emergency operator is in a stand-by situation without a particular duty station to report to immediately. Since he does not have an assigned duty station, and since he is present primarily for the benefit of the Company, a different standard must be used to fix his compensation and he is paid from the time he enters the main gate <footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6u\">We concur that <em>Abbott </em>does not apply here. The place, manner and circumstances of reporting for an emergency call-in all differ from what occurs in the daily routine and it appears that the Canal Company has properly treated all the employees\u2019 activity of such character as compensable. The nature of such emergency call-ins, if travel could be said to be involved, seems to fit the intent expressed in condition (iv) of the travel pay provisions of Section 5544. The irregular and isolated nature of emergency call-ins seems to \u201cresult from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively\u201d while the regular daily reporting practices do not fall within such definition.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">We thus conclude that the congressional policy of the Portal-to-Portal Act to preclude compensation for activities such as those performed by these appellants, the policy of Section 18(b) of the FLSA to ensure equal compensation for private and federal employees in the Canal Zone, and the general policy of salary comparability between federal and private enterprise employees which is implicit in this legislation would all be thwarted were we to adopt appellants\u2019 position on this appeal. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"Aur\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544(a) contains the basic provisions for payment of overtime to federal \u201cwage board\u201d employees. It provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-8\">(a) An employee whose basic rate of pay is fixed and adjusted from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates by a wage board or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose is entitled to overtime pay for overtime work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. However, an employee subject to this subsection who regularly is required to remain at or within the confines of his post of duty in excess of 8 hours a day in a standby or on-call status is entitled to overtime pay only for hours of duty, exclusive of eating and sleeping time, in excess of 40 a week. The overtime hourly rate of pay is computed as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-9\">(1) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a basis other than an annual or monthly basis, multiply the basic hourly rate of pay by not less than one and one-half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-10\">(2) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on an annual basis, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,080, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-15\">(3) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a monthly basis, multiply the basic monthly rate of pay by 12 to derive a basic annual rate of pay, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,080, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-16\">An employee subject to this subsection whose regular work schedule includes an 8-hour period of service a part of which is on Sunday is entitled to additional pay at the rate of 25 percent of his hourly rate of basic pay for each hour of work performed during that 8-hour period of service. Time spent in a travel status away from the official duty station of an employee subject to this subsection is not hours of work unless the travel (i) involves the performance of work while traveling, (ii) is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling, (iii) is carried out under arduous conditions, or (iv) results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-17\">The Supreme Court in United States v.

However, since the assigned locomotive may be located the maximum distance from the assignment board, <em>the operator of necessity must check the hoard at least 15 minutes before the start of his eight hour shift </em>to arrive at his locomotive on time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-15\">314 F.Supp. at 387 (emphasis added). Appellants urge that this finding that there is \u201cno requirement\u201d to report early \u201cwas against the weight of overwhelming evidence to the contrary . . . . \u201d Brief for appellants, at 5. The evidence cited does not reveal any formally published regulation or requirement, but rather an informal expectation on the part of both the operators and Company officials that the operators would report early enough to check the assignment board and get to their locomotives. This expectation thus seems to fall within the common rubric of \u201can established custom or practice\u201d made necessary by the requirement to be on the locomotive at the start of the shift (see emphasized portion of finding) rather than a formal requirement to report early. At any rate, the existence <em>vel non </em>of such a requirement would not affect our determination, of the case; the critical factor for that determination is the requirement to be present on the locomotive, prepared to begin the operators\u2019 \u201cprimary duties\u201d at the start of the shift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">. Actually, the Company has long acquiesced in the practice of permitting the relieved operators to leave the locomotive at the time of their relief. Thus, if the oncoming operator relieves him on the locomotive before the beginning of the shift, the relieved operator is permitted to leave the lockage area as much as 20 minutes before the end of his shift. This early relief practice is indicative of the informal timekeeping practices of the Company. In this regard the District Court found: \u201cPrior to January 1, 1968, locomotive operators were required to check in and out with a timekeeper at the main gate of the lock area <em>merely for the purpose of determining their presence in the loch area, not for the purpose of timekeeping.\u201d </em>314 F.Supp. at 388 (emphasis added). Since 1968, even that practice has been discontinued, and the operators merely check in with the security guard at the gate and mark their own name on the assignment board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1382-16\">.

Correspondence in opposition to the Morse amendment came from the Under Secretary of the Army (the Department of the Army is directly interested in the Panama Canal Company), the Intercoastal Steamship Freight Association and the American Merchant Marine Institute (both associations composed of users of the Canal). <em>Id. </em>at 20831.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1387-11\">. The American Merchant Marine Institute so contended. <em>Id. </em>Senator Morse explained his rationale for equality of wages in the Canal Zone and in the U.S. :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-12\">We should be doing everything we can to impress upon Panamanians and Ba-tin Americans everywhere that the Canal is a boon to private enterprise and that its fruits can and will be shared on a basis of <em>full equality.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 20830 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1387-19\">. But I assure Senators that disparity among Panamanians is not the source of dissent. Dissension arises from the disparity in wages paid to Americans and Panamanians who each work for the United States in the Zone, and despite all the assurances that the pay is equal, the fact is that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-20\">The American worker doing the same work as a Panamanian receives in theory the same wage. But on top of it he receives what is called a \u201ctropical living allowance\u201d which the Panamanian does not receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-21\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1388-9\">. I am concerned about the possibility that paying Panamanians a minimum wage will result in some increase in canal tolls. The canal is self-supporting. It does not receive appropriations.

Appellants argue that the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this Act ... or any other law . . . \u201d language at the beginning of \u00a7 18(b) explicitly excludes Portal-to-Portal Act application to the federal employees covered therein. We do not believe this exclusionary clause operates so broadly. To begin, its principle purpose was clearly to avoid the \u00a7 3(d) definition of \u201cemployer\u201d that excluded the United States as an employer from coverage under the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(d). Next, as noted in the Senate Report, the clause operates to exclude \u201cthe industry committee procedures of section 6(c) [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(c)] . . . with respect to Federal employees employed in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1487, <em>supra, </em>at 34, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, p. 3036. Finally, the statute of limitations for the FLSA is contained in Section 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255, and this very section was amended by Section 601 of the act we are examining here. Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, Pub.L. 89-601, Title VI, \u00a7 601, 80 Stat. 844. We cannot assume that, having both Acts before them and considering amendments to both Acts, Congress intended in its \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause to provide that the statute of limitations did not apply to wage claims under this one section of the FLSA. And since the limitation statute applicable to the FLSA wage claims is a part of the Portal-to-Portal Act, we cannot assume that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause can be said to have excluded portions of that Act while retaining others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1389-20\">.

Thus even this condition reflects the comparability between the respective FLSA and FEPA provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1393-14\">. Although we have concluded above that <em>Congress </em>intended the Portal-to-Portal Act limitations on compensable overtime to apply to federal wage board employees covered under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544(a), we believe that the same result could have been reached as to these Canal Zone employees by a different route. Because of the parties\u2019 stipulation below that these employees were within the coyerage of \u00a7 5544, that issue was not litigated here. We note, however, that \u00a7 5544 derives from the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1935, cli. 102, Title II, \u00a7 23, 48 Stat. 522. Insofar as this statute relates to overtime compensation for Canal Company employees it was impliedly amended by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, Pub.L. 89-601, Title III, \u00a7 306, 80 Stat. 841 \u2014 the statute which explicitly applies the FLSA overtime compensation provision (with its Portal-to-Portal Act limitations) to wage board employees in the Canal Zone. As a later enactment, and as a specific enactment, the new Section 18(b) of the FLSA would seem to take precedence over the earlier, generally applicable, Section 5544. (Significantly, even the codification of \u00a7 5544 in its present location in the United States Code preceded enactment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>Section 18(b) by 17 days, <em>compare </em>80 Stat. 486 <em>with </em>80 Stat. 841, and Section 18(b)\u2019s specific reference to Canal Zone employees was reiterated tbe following year, 81 Stat. 222.) We do not believe the enactment of the travel time provision in Section 5544 (81 Stat. 641) subsequent to the enactment of Section 18 (b) affects this analysis at all, since such amendment does not alter the principal statutory language dealing with overtime compensation and it covers factual situations different from those under consideration here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">. 314 F.Supp. at 388 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b1394-12\">. We also reject appellants\u2019 argument that they fall within the scope of Anderson v. Panama Canal Co., <em>supra </em>note 39. As suggested above, we find the determinative issue in <em>Anderson </em>to have been that the employees there were expected to perform arduous tasks under unpleasant and often dangerous conditions during the course of their travel. These circumstances are, we believe, incorporated within the third category of compensable travel under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5544. Appellants have made no claim under this category for their daily walk to the locomotives.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
