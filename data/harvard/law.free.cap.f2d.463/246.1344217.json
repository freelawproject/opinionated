We vacate the district court\u2019s order of dismissal and remand the case for an evidentiary hearing on the allegations contained in Willis\u2019s petition. Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">Willis alleges (1) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at his state criminal trial in 1936 and (2) that members of his race were systematically excluded from the grand and petit juries that indicted and convicted him. Because of the nature of these allegations and the apparent inability of the petitioner to prepare or try this cause, we suggest that the district court consider the appointment of counsel for Willis.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
