We hold that the court did err and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-12\">Panzeca was indicted for \u201csubmitting a false and fraudulent statement\u201d to his draft board in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462, and for conspiring to do so in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. After pleading guilty, he received a suspended sentence and was placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-13\">Panzeca\u2019s probation was conditioned upon his reporting \u201con November 20, 1970 at 6:15 in the morning to the Receiving Station\u201d of the army. On February 26, 1971 the government, with notice to Panzeca\u2019s attorney, moved to revoke probation on the ground that the condition of probation had been violated. The motion was continued to Monday, March 1, 1971. Panzeca was not in court on March 1, but his attorney was present and engaged in a colloquy with the judge, the opposing attorney, and the probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-15\">During the colloquy it developed that Panzeca had reported to the army receiving station pursuant to the probation condition, but had been rejected because of his conviction and probation. The prosecution claimed that the condition of probation was violated because the judge intended that Panzeca not only report, but actually enter the army on the day specified. Panzeca\u2019s attorney argued that the condition required only that he report and, having done so, there was no violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">The judge concluded the March 1 colloquy stating: \u201cI do revoke [the probation] . . . and a warrant will be issued for the arrest\u201d of Panzeca. The court ordered the government attorney to see that the arrest of Panzeca be expedited, and told Panzeca\u2019s attorney to \u201ccome in with him\u201d on Wednesday, March 3, 1971, and \u201cI will hear you fully.\u201d The criminal docket entry reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A70\">3/1/71 Defendant fails to appear. On motion of the government. Probation revoked and Bench warrant to issue. Cause continued to March 3,1971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-19\">The government argues that the revocation took place, not on March 1, but on March 3 when petitioner was sentenced. It further claims that even if revocation was on March 1, Panzeca was present on March 3 at the \u201cplenary hearing\u201d which then took place, and that any deficiency in the procedure of March 1 was cured. The implication is that petitioner was not prejudiced by his absence March 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-20\">We disagree that the \u201cplenary hearing\u201d on March 3 was with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>the revocation order. The transcript of the March 1 hearing and the criminal docket entry disclose that revocation occurred on that date. Furthermore, the transcript and docket sheet for March 3 clearly show that the latter hearing was effectually limited to sentencing. The judge began the March 3 hearing with the statement that probation \u201chad been revoked\u201d and then permitted counsel for the government and counsel for Panzeca to set forth the \u201cunderlying facts\u201d which prompted the hearing. Subsequently the court interrupted Panzeca\u2019s attorney and again stated that \u201cprobation has been revoked\u201d and further that \u201cnow I will hear you ... on the question of sentence.\u201d The attorneys spoke briefly in mitigation. The court then asked Panzeca whether he had anything to say before sentence was pronounced. Panzeca said that he had performed the condition of probation. Sentence was imposed and the docket entry reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-4\">3/3/71 Defendant George Anthony Panzeca committed to the custody of the U.S. Attorney General for imprisonment for a period of three (3) years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">We conclude that the record shows that Panzeca\u2019s probation was revoked on March 1, in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">We hold that the revocation order must be reversed because petitioner\u2019s due process right to be present at the revocation hearing was violated. Hahn v. Burke, 430 F.2d 100 (7th Cir. 1970), cert. den. 402 U.S. 933, 91 S.Ct. 1522, 28 L.Ed.2d 868; Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 492-495, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">The probation statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3653, provides that \u201c[a]s speedily as possible after arrest the probationer shall be taken before the court. . Thereupon the court may revoke the probation. . . . \u201d Under a similar predecessor statute the Supreme Court in <em>Zerbst </em>held that probation could be revoked only before the court which had granted the probation, and the Court stated that \u201cclearly the end and aim of an appearance before the court must be to enable an accused probationer to explain away the accusation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 55 S.Ct. at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-12\">The Court in <em>Zerbst </em>did not place the right in the Constitution. But this court in <em>Hahn </em>held that revocation without a hearing violated \u201cbasic requirements of due process.\u201d p. 103 of 430 F.2d. Panzeca\u2019s plight was no less grave than Hahn\u2019s, since proceeding to revocation in his absence denied him an opportunity to \u201cexplain away the accusation.\u201d That his attorney argued in his behalf March 1 does not bar Panzeca\u2019s claim, and what occurred March 3 is of no consequence since it was not a revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">The government relies on footnote 6 in <em>Hahn.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The footnote is of no avail to the government because obviously here the circumstances do not show that a \u201chearing was not immediately possible.\u201d Nor is this court\u2019s interpretation in Hansen v. Burke, 437 F.2d 829, 832 (7th Cir. 1971), helpful to the government. This court noted there, at 832, that Hansen had the \u201copportunity to be confronted with his probation violation and to be heard,\u201d citing <em>Hahn </em>at 104 of 430 F.2d. Here Panzeca was denied that opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-14\">The revocation judgment and sentence are vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1307-21\">. We deem it unnecessary to determine the question whether the condition of probation was violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">. Footnote 6 reads as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-9\">This is not to deny that probationers could not be (sic) detained where circumstances required and a hearing was not immediately possible. We need not now explore the specific procedural characteristics which revocation must have. 430 F.2d 100, 105, n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
