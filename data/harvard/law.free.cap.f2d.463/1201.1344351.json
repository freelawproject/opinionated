Appellant was observed tearing papers and stuffing the shredded pieces into his mouth. Appellant raises these questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-7\">1. That 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2232 is void for vagueness because of the language \u201cbefore, during, or after seizure,\u201d and the words \u201cgoods, wares, or merchandise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\"> The statute is not vague. It is merely all inclusive. Any destruction at any time to prevent a lawful seizure is prohibited. No one is left in doubt as to what may not be done.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-9\">2. That the information, in the language of the statute, is unduly vague because it doesn\u2019t specify the nature of the \u201cgoods\u201d which were destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-10\">The information identifies the time and place of the offense and the elements of the offense. It will protect the appellant from being placed in jeopardy for any destruction of goods which took place at that time and place. It is sufficient. Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427, 431, 52 S.Ct. 417, 76 L.Ed. 861 (1932); United States v. Kenny, 462 F.2d 1205 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-12\">3. That in the execution of the search warrant the officers did not comply with the strictures of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109, and the resulting evidence should have been suppressed. <em>See </em>Sabbath v. United States, 391 U.S. 585, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828 (1968); Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-13\">The record reveals that there was compliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109. This being the case we need not reach the issue whether unlawful execution of a valid warrant can, by virtue of a suppression motion, afford a defense to the resort to self help permitted by \u00a7 3109. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Ferrone, 438 F.2d 381 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 1008, 91 S.Ct. 2188, 29 L.Ed.2d 430 (1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-14\">4. That the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-15\">This was a non-jury trial. Whether judged by a clearly erroneous standard, or looked at in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding of guilty. <em>See </em>United States v. Delerme, 457 F.2d 156 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">The judgment of the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1292-17\">. The District Court opinion on pretrial motions is reported. United States v. Gibbons, 331 F.Supp. 970 (D.Del.1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
