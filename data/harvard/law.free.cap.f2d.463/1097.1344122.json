Cornell Remsen, Jr., New York City, attys. of record, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1187-21\">Before WORLEY, Chief Judge, and RICH, ALMOND, BALDWIN and LANE, Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1187-22\">BALDWIN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1187-23\">This is an appeal from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sustaining the opposition of appellee International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., to appellant\u2019s application for registration of the mark TWIN FLO, for \u201cindividual room heaters for use with forced hot-water heating systems.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-24\">The opposition was based on a previous registration of the mark DUO-FLO, for \u201cbalancing and purge valve for use in hot water heating systems for balancing flow in the circuits of the system and for purging or venting air from such circuits.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The mark was assigned to appellee in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-25\">Both appellant\u2019s TWIN FLO heaters and appellee\u2019s DUO-FLO valves are marketed through plumbing and heating wholesalers and are advertised in trade publications and in other similar media. Appellee\u2019s priority of its mark is not contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-26\">Before us, appellant contends that only limited protection should be extended to appellee\u2019s mark in view of its descriptive nature. Appellant points to 160 cited third party trademark registrations, 105 of them dealing with FLO and the remaining 55 dealing with DUO and TWIN. In appellant\u2019s view, these registrations indicate that FLO lacks trademark significance, and \u201cillustrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1098\">*1098</page-number>common acceptance and recognition by the Patent Office and merchants that \u201cDUO\u201d and \u201cTWIN\u201d are used by different parties in conjunction with purely suggestive or descriptive suffixes on competitive or intimately related goods without confusion.\u201d Appellant points to the differences in sound and appearance between the marks, the differences in the goods and the fact that there is no evidence of actual confusion and urges that there is no likelihood of confusion. Appellant also contends that the board erroneously resolved doubt in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">We disagree with appellant and find that the board correctly held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-6\">While the goods here involved are specifically different they are both used in hot water heating systems and move through the same channels of trade to the same class of purchasers and must be considered as closely related in kind, [citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-7\">Regarding the marks, while we must agree with applicant that opposer\u2019s mark is highly suggestive as applied to its valves, applicant\u2019s mark is also suggestive of its goods and the two marks have substantially the same suggestive connotations and create similar commercial impressions. The third-party registrations are of little value in determining the question of likelihood of confusion since we must decide this issue on the marks of the parties as considered in their entire-ties regardless of the use by others of various components thereof. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">The marks are both highly suggestive, are essentially identical in meaning, and are applied to closely related goods. Considering the marks DUO-FLO and TWIN FLO in their entireties, as applied to the respective goods, we feel that they are so similar that they would be likely to cause mistake, confusion or deception of purchasers as to the source of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1187-15\">. 161 USPQ 313 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1187-16\">.
