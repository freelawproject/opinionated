width=\"537\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">The opposition was based on appellant\u2019s prior use and registration of the mark ALL in connection with household cleansing products. The mark has been used by appellant or its predecessor in title, Monsanto Chemical Company, since as early as 1948. \u201cAdvanced ALL\u201d has been used since 1948, \u201cFluffy ALL\u201d and \u201cDishwasher ALL\u201d since 1955 and \u201cCold Water AI L\u201d since 1963. Testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses shows that the products were sold through such outlets as supermarkets, department stores, hardware stores, variety stores and some drug stores. There have been sales of appellant\u2019s products in all 50 states and through overseas outlets all over the world. Advertising of the products by appellants has been extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-8\">Appellant has always displayed the mark ALL in distinctive, stylized, lower case letters. Although the word ALL has been displayed on packages in association with another word such as \u201cAdvanced,\u201d \u201cFluffy,\u201d etc., the word ALL is printed in substantially larger sized letters and has been emphasized in the display of the marks on the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">Appellee\u2019s application for registration as amended states that the mark is for \u201chousehold cleaner for windows, mirrors, chrome, enamel, and tile, distributed as a household item in retail grocery and department stores.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">The board held that the marks as applied to the goods were not so similar as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-13\">* * * [CJonfusion as to source is not likely to occur merely because of the inclusion in applicant\u2019s mark of the word \u201call\u201d. In arriving at this conclusion, we have not overlooked the fact that the designation \u201call\u201d for detergent products has achieved a considerable degree of commercial success and recognition and that opposer, by reason thereof, possesses a substantial good-will and property right therein. But, we do not believe that opposer\u2019s rights in \u201call\u201d are such as to preclude the subsequent registration of marks comprising this term where the combination has a well known meaning which would be likely to be recognized as such by the average purchaser. * * * [T]he commercial impression engendered by applicant\u2019s mark is derived not from the component words \u201call\u201d or \u201cclear\u201d, per se, but rather from the mark as a whole. When the term \u201call clear!\u201d is encountered in the market place in connection with a house hold [sic] cleaner, the average purchaser will recognize it as a play on the expression \u201cALL CLEAR\u201d popularized in connection with air raid drills, and used by applicant to suggest that the use of its product will produce entirely clear or clean surfaces. We are not persuaded, as opposer urges, that it would suggest \u201cone more preparation for cleaning which originates from the same source as the other \u2018all\u2019 products long marketed and popularized by op-poser\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>We agree with the board. While appellant points out some similarities between the word ALL as it is used by both parties, inspection of the two marks also shows some obvious differences. Considering appellee\u2019s mark <em>in its entirety, </em>we are convinced that there is no likelihood of confusion. Accordingly, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AWS\">Affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">.

Moreover, applicant\u2019s product as described in its application and opposer\u2019s detergent products are distributed as household items through the <em>same channels of trade </em>to the same classes of purchasers and are recommended for <em>similar cleaning uses. Under these circumstances, the marketing of these products under the same or similar marks would be likely to cause confusion or mistake as to source. * </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">I respectfully suggest, however, that the board erred in holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-11\">* * * [Cjonfusion as to source is not likely to occur merely because of the inclusion in applicant\u2019s mark of the word \u201call\u201d. * * * we do not believe that opposer\u2019s rights in \u201call\u201d are such as to preclude the subsequent registration of marks comprising this term <em>where the combination has a well known meaning which would be likely to be recognized as such by the average purchaser. </em>* * * [T]he commercial impression engendered by applicant\u2019s mark is derived not from the component words \u201call\u201d or \u201cclear\u201d, per se, but rather from the mark as a whole. <em>When the term \u201call clear!\u201d is encountered in the market place in connection with a house hold cleaner, the average purchaser will recognize it as a play on the expression \u201cALL CLEAR\u201d popularized in connection with air raid drills, </em>and used by applicant to suggest that the use of its product will produce entirely clear or clean surfaces. We are not persuaded, as opposer urges, that it would suggest \u201cone more preparation for cleaning which originates from the same source as the other \u2018all\u2019 products long marketed and popularized by opposer.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-16\">I am unable to find any evidence in this record to support the board\u2019s assumption, to which it attaches unduly critical significance, that the average purchaser will recognize \u201call clear!\u201d as a play on an expression used to denote cessation of air raid drills, an assumption I suggest is tantamount to taking judicial notice of a supposed set of facts clearly incapable of justifying application of that judicial doctrine. I trust I am not compounding the error of the board in also suggesting that, while the board\u2019s assumption might have been tenable with respect to other generations in other parts of the globe, it becomes tenuous in light of the current crop of consumers, many of whom were born during or aft\u00e9r World War II \u2014 thus it is at best speculative whether they would necessarily recognize the supposed play on words. Is it not also just as reasonable to suggest that the average purchaser would associate \u201call clear!\u201d with a change in the weather? Appellant\u2019s suggestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>that the average purchaser would mistakenly associate \u201call clear!\u201d with the product \u201call\u201d and its manufacturer appears eminently reasonable as well. The trouble is no one, absent appropriate evidence, can say with certainty just how the average purchaser will react under the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">It seems clear to me, however, that when \u201call\u201d and \u201call clear!\u201d are applied to the same products, competitive in both price and purpose, and are sold over-the-counter through the same channels of trade, the average purchaser as well as the registrant are denied the protection Congress intended the Lanham Act to provide. Aside from that, the board virtually ignores the rights which have vested in opposer by virtue of its having sold well in excess of two billion pounds of its \u201call\u201d products and having spent more than 100 million dollars in advertising them. The newcomer has incorporated the mark \u201call\u201d in its entirety, including lower case type style, as part of its own mark, a practice this court has often viewed with disfavor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It would seem that a party genuinely concerned in distinguishing its product from those of others, and in developing its own good will under its own mark, could have chosen a different trademark for its product without risking unnecessary encroachment on opposer\u2019s mark, and has acted at its peril here in not doing so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any doubt on the matter should be resolved against the newcomer in favor of the prior user.
