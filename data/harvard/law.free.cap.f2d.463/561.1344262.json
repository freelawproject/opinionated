The District Court adjudged Knox bankrupt and appointed Lines as trustee. As the trustee, Lines was required, by Bankruptcy Gen. Order 17,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to prepare a complete inventory of Knox\u2019s property and to report to the court which assets were exempt and thus set off to the bankrupt. In making this report, on June 23, 1969, Lines disallowed Knox\u2019s claim for a homestead exemption on certain property.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">Under General Order 17, Knox had \u201cten days after the filing of the report, unless further time [was] granted by the court\u201d, to object to Lines\u2019 report. The ten-day period expired on July 3d, but no objection was filed until the next court day, July 7th. At that time, Knox challenged the denial of the claimed homestead exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">On September 8, 1969, a hearing before the bankruptcy referee was held to consider Knox\u2019s objection. During the hearing, Lines moved to dismiss the objection. He argued that his report became final on July 3d and that the objection, since it was not timely filed, should not be considered. The referee granted the motion to dismiss, the District Court affirmed the dismissal, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">Knox contends that the referee and the District Court should have considered his objection to the denial of the homestead exemption claim. He argues that they not only have jurisdiction to consider objections filed after the ten-day period, but also that, in the exercise of their discretion, they must look to Rule 60(b) Fed.R.Civ.Proc. when deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>whether to accept an untimely objection. We agree and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">A bankruptcy court is a court of equity. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 60 S.Ct. 238, 84 L.Ed. 281, (1939); 1 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 2.09. Its equitable powers are, however, limited. They may be exercised only within the limits established by the Bankruptcy Act and the General Orders promulgated by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Collier, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, before we can consider whether it would have been equitable to consider Knox\u2019s objection, we must determine if General Order 17 foreclosed any power to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Because the language of General Order 17 is ambiguous, there is no absolutely clear answer. A court clearly has discretion to grant \u201cfurther time\u201d for the filing of an objection, but it is not certain that it may do so if one who objects does so only after the expiration of a prescribed period. If it may, then the referee and the District Court erred, for Knox was then entitled to a decision by them as to whether equity would be served by the receiving and consideration of his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-19\">When the referee considered this question, he concluded 'that Knox was not entitled to any relief because both he and the District Court judge<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were \u201cwithout jurisdiction\u201d to consider objections filed after the ten-day period specified in the General Order. The District Court expressly disagreed with the decision in In re Tognetti, 57 F.Supp. 286 (N.D.Cal.1944), and affirming the referee\u2019s Order, relied upon Matter of Malley, No. 105701 (N.D.Cal., Nov. 20, 1968).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not find that either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>bare conclusion of the referee <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or the authority cited by the District Court is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><em>Malley </em>is distinguishable, for there, the court did not expressly consider the scope of its power to permit tardy filings under General Order 17. The issue in that ease was whether the ten-day filing period runs from the date of a trustee\u2019s original report or the date of his amended report. The bankrupt there argued that under Rule 15(a) Fed.R. Civ.Proc.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he could file within ten days of the amendment. After discounting the significance of the fact that the trustee filed an amended report, and thus deciding that the period commenced with the original filing, the court concluded that the bankrupt\u2019s contention was meritless. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cRule 15(a) F.R.Civ.P., is inconsistent with General Order 17. Under Rule 15(a) it is possible for the bankrupt to file an objection to the trustee\u2019s determination more than ten days after the filing of the report without leave of court, and solely because the trustee has chosen to file an amended report . Under General Order 17, the bankrupt cannot file objections to the trustee\u2019s determination more than ten days after the filing of the report of exempt property without leave of court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">We see nothing in that holding to suggest that a bankrupt can obtain the desired leave of the court only within the ten-day period. As far as we can perceive, the <em>Malley </em>decision merely affirms an obvious proposition, which Knox does not here challenge, that any late filing must be approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">The fact that the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Malley </em>was misplaced does not mean that <em>Tognetti </em>should have supplied the basis for a contrary decision. <em>Tognetti </em>'has no more relevance to the present case than does <em>Malley. </em>That is because <em>Tognetti </em>concerned a bankrupt\u2019s petition for relief under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 67(c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> not General Order 17. The court therefore made no effort to define its power to grant relief under the General Order. It merely noted that General Order 17 permits \u201cexceptions to the trustee\u2019s reports to be filed with the referee,\u201d that Mrs. Tognetti had npt filed such an objection, and that her failure to do so was insufficient reason to imply a waiver of her rights under \u00a7 67(c). Whatever the case may reveal as to relief available under \u00a7 67(c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it affords no enlightenment concerning the effect of General Order 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>In citing <em>Malley </em>and <em>Tognetti, </em>the District Court was not widely astray, for we have found no authority interpreting that portion of General Order 17 which is here at issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The proper resolution of the present case depends upon the application of pertinent decisions and doctrine developed in other contexts, There is some such persuasive authority which was apparently not drawn to the attention of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Prior to 1960, that section of the Bankruptcy Act discussed in <em>Tognetti, </em>\u00a7 67(c), was written in terms similar to those currently employed in General Order 17. Section 67(c) provided that relief from a referee\u2019s order could be sought \u201cwithin ten days after the entry thereof or within such extended time as the court may * * * allow.\u201d General Order 17 provides for the right to seek relief from a trustee\u2019s report \u201cwithin ten days after the filing [thereof] unless further time is granted by the court.\u201d We think that the linguistic similarities between these provisions reflect a congruence of purpose. When the Supreme Court amended General Order 17 in 1933 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and gave it its present form, the Court must have intended to afford bankruptcy courts power to permit tardy objections to trustees\u2019 reports commensurate with their power to recognize untimely motions to review referees\u2019 orders and most other untimely motions. See Rule 6(b) (2) Fed.R.Civ.Proc. Otherwise, there would be an anomalous disparity of power. For example, if General Order 17 were interpreted more strictly than \u00a7 67(c), a district judge administering an estate himself without the aid of a referee would have less power to review a trustee\u2019s decisions than he would if he had appointed a referee and thus could, under \u00a7 67(c), review the orders of the referee affirming or reversing those same decisions. Perceiving no valid purpose which would support such a distinction, we conclude that these two provisions should be given the same interpretation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">The common meaning of General Order 17 and \u00a7 67(c) was established when, in 1942, the Supreme Court decided Pfister v. Northern Illinois Finance Corp., 317 U.S. 144, 63 S.Ct. 133, 87 L.Ed. 146 (1942). The Court therein defined the power of bankruptcy courts, under \u00a7 67(c) to review referees\u2019 orders made pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 203. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-22\">\u201cCourts of bankruptcy are courts of equity without terms. . . . The entire process of rehabilitation, reorganization or liquidation is open to reexamination out of time by the District Court, in its discretion, and subject to intervening rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-24\">* * -X- -X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-25\">\u201c[Section 67(c)] was [not] intended to be a limitation on the sound discretion of the bankruptcy court to permit the filing of petitions for review after the expiration of the period. The power in the bankruptcy court to review orders of the referee is unqualifiedly given in [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 11]. The language [of \u00a7 67(c)] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>a limitation on the \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 to file such a petition as a matter of right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARY\">We hold that the views expressed in <em>Pfister </em>are fully applicable to General Order 17 and reveal its proper interpretation ; consequently, parties have a right to file objections within the ten-day filing period and, thereafter, a court may grant a later request for review if it concludes that equitable considerations so require.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We are not persuaded that this interpretation of General Order 17 will lead to chaos, as Lines suggests, even though the interpretation is applicable to creditors as well as to bankrupts. The possibility of review subsequent to the expiration of the filing period will not upset or inhibit the settlement of estates because this type of review will be available only when equity requires it. Thus availability of review to an untimely applicant may depend upon (1) the absence of prejudice to the nonmoving parties resulting from delayed review, and (2) acceptable justification for the applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the ten-day filing rule. The existence of sufficient justification for delayed filing could be determined by a variety of standards. We think, however, that in most cases, as the bankrupt here suggests, it should depend upon compliance with Rule 60(b) Fed.R.Civ. Proc. which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; . or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to bankruptcy proceedings if they are consistent with the Act and the General Orders. Bankruptcy Gen.Order 37. We see no inconsistency between our interpretation of General Order 17 and Rule 60(b); hence, Rule 60(b) is applicable to motions for extended time under General Order 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The question thus becomes whether Knox met the test we have attempted to formulate. As to the first issue, the existence of prejudice caused by the delay in seeking review, there is little room for debate, for the circumstances of this case compel the conclusion that equity required the referee and the District Court to consider Knox\u2019s objection. Knox\u2019s delay in filing was insignificant and inconsequential. It spanned a four-day period which included a holiday and a weekend. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that any of Knox\u2019s creditors were in any way prejudiced by the delayed filing or, in fact, that between the third and the seventh of July anyone relied upon the fact that no objection had been filed within the ten-day period. Given the well established policy of the Bankruptcy Act to favor property exemptions, <em>see, e.g., </em>Matter of Dudley, 72 F.Supp. 943 (S.D.Cal.1947), aff\u2019d 166 F.2d 1023 (9th Cir. 1948), the significance of a minor delay in the proceedings, such as the one in this case, is minimal. It is far more equitable to impose a harmless period of uncertainty upon creditors than it is to deny a bankrupt\u2019s claim to a possibly valid homestead exemption because of such a slight procedural error as was here committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Unfortunately, the record does not reveal whether Knox had a valid excuse for not making a timely objection. If, upon remand, he is able to present a reasonably satisfactory excuse, under Rule 60(b), for his slight delay, the merits of his claim for a homestead exemption should be reviewed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-14\">. It provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATi\">\u201cThe trustee shall make report to the court ... of the articles set off to the bankrupt or debtor by him . . ; and any creditor or the bankrupt or debtor may file objections to the determination of the trustee within ten days after the filing of the report, unless further time is granted by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\">. In many areas, including this one, the District Court judge and the referee have similar powers.

On January 11, 1968, the trustee filed an amended report of exempt property On January 18, 1968, the bankrupt filed objections to the trustee\u2019s determination .... On February 28, 1968, the Referee issued an order in which he held that the bankrupt\u2019s objections were not filed within the time provided in General Order 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, and that, therefore, he did not have jurisdiction to determine their merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-12\">\u201cGeneral Order 17 of the Bankruptcy Act provides in pertinent part as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-13\">\u2018 * * * the bankrupt or debtor may ' file objections to the determination of the trustee within ten days after the filing of the report (of exempt property), unless further time is granted by the court.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-15\">\u201cIn the present ease, the bankrupt did not file objections to the trustee\u2019s determination . . . within ten days of the filing of the trustee\u2019s report of exempt property. Nor did he apply to the court for additional time to do so. Therefore, the time for filing objections to the trustee\u2019s determination passed. When the trustee thereafter filed an amended report of exempt property, he did not make a new determination . . ., but merely restated his prior determination with respect <em>thereto. </em>Therefore, the bankrupt\u2019s objections, which were subsequently filed, were not filed within the time provided in General Order 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-22\">\u201cThe bankrupt essentially claims that the trustee\u2019s amended report of exempt property should be treated as an amended pleading; that under Rule 15(a) F.R.Civ.P., a response to an amended pleading may be made within ten days after service of the amended pleading; that the bankrupt filed his objections to the amended report within ten days after it was filed; and that, therefore, the Referee liad jurisdiction to hear and determine the merits of his objections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-23\">\u201cAlthough the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are generally applicable to bankruptcy proceedings, they are only applicable insofar as they are not inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Act or the General Orders.

Under Rule 15(a) it is possible for the bankrupt to file objections to the trustee\u2019s determination more than ten days after the filing of the report of exempt property without leave of court, and solely because the trustee has chosen to modify the report of exempt property by filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>an amended report instead of an amendment to the report. Under General Order 17, the bankrupt cannot file objections to the trustee\u2019s determination more than ten days after the filing of the report of exempt property without leave of court.

This is true as to the 1933 version of General Order 17.
