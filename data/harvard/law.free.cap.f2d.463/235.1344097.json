S.C. \u00a7 2111. The Government and Hill presented their witnesses on November 22, 1971, and on the same date both sides rested their cases. On the morning of November 23, 1971, the date set for argument of counsel to the jury, the Government presented a motion to reopen the ease on the grounds that one Alyce Williams who knew Hill and had some knowledge of the case, had presented herself to an FBI agent requesting that she be allowed to testify. The motion was granted. Alyce Williams was allowed to testify that, although Hill had been with her for much of the evening when the robbery was allegedly committed, he had left her home for approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>mately one and a half to two hours at the critical time, the time of the alleged robberies. Williams\u2019s home was only two blocks from Fort Sam Houston, where the crimes allegedly took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In Hill\u2019s previous trial for murder, of which Hill was acquitted, Williams had testified as an alibi witness in Hill\u2019s behalf. Williams testified that Hill was with her the entire night when the murder was alleged to have been committed. Hill\u2019s only contention on this appeal is that the prosecution improperly offered Williams\u2019s testimony with full knowledge of her incompetency and unreliability. Hill asserts that the Government\u2019s decision to call Williams to the stand violated his Fifth Amendment rights of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We disagree. The only evidence of Williams\u2019s incompetence was defense counsel\u2019s own self-serving testimony that he \u201cfrankly thought that there was something mentally wrong with her.\u201d Nor is there any basis for concluding that the Government intentionally elicited false testimony, or testimony which the Government should have known was false. There is no reason to suppose that Williams\u2019s testimony was false except for its departure from her earlier testimony to the contrary. As the Government states in its brief, it believed at the time of trial and continues to believe that Williams\u2019s testimony at the robbery trial was the true version of the crucial events.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Because the Government has no reason, even now, to concede the falsity of Williams\u2019s testimony, Hill\u2019s reliance on Imbler v. Craven, C.D. Calif. 1969, 298 F.Supp. 795, is wholly misplaced. In <em>Craven, </em>the prosecutor presented obviously false testimony and the court found that \u201c[t]he prosecutor either had reason to believe or in fact knew that each item of evidence . . . was untrue.\u201d 298 F.Supp. at 808. Equally in-apposite are McCloskey v. Boslow, 4 Cir. 1965, 349 F.2d 119, and Smith v. Warden, Md. Penitentiary, 1966, D.Md., 254 F.Supp. 805. Like <em>Craven, McCloskey </em>involved the degree of a prosecutor\u2019s accountability for testimony which the record revealed to be untrue. In <em>Smith, </em>the Court stated that it had no reason to inquire into a prosecutor\u2019s responsibility for introducing false testimony \u201cbecause, even if the less severe burden applies, petitioner has not proved any such perjury as would bring the rule into play.\u201d 254 F.Supp. at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">There was, of course, inconsistency between Williams's testimony at Hill\u2019s first trial and her revised version of the events of the same evening offered against Hill at the trial for robbery. It was, however, the jury\u2019s province, and not ours, to evaluate Williams\u2019s change of heart and to weigh her testimony as it saw fit. Unlike Gordon v. United States, 1953, 344 U.S. 414, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447, the jury in the present case had the full story of witness Williams\u2019s discrepant testimony laid before it. Fully informed, the jury heard Williams testify about Hill\u2019s activities on the night when the crime was committed. There was no denial of due process in allowing the jury to consider Williams\u2019s testimony, for the traditional safeguard of our legal system is to expose a wavering witness to thorough cross-examination of the kind ably provided by defense counsel in this case, and then to allow the jury to decide whether or to what extent it chooses to credit the witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
