Peters and Henry Sassone, two of the Foundation\u2019s trustees, appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Harold R. Tyler, Jr., J., dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint against General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Co. and American Motors Sales Corp. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of \u201cthe population of the United States residing in the metropolitan areas of the United States, amounting to approximately 125,000,000 persons.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amended complaint contains three counts: Count 1 alleges that defendants have committed antitrust violations by conspiring to suppress the development of motor vehicle pollution control devices; jurisdiction is grounded on the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 15. Count 2 purports to add another cause of action \u201cpursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to common law principles of liability\u201d; jurisdiction is based on \u201cthe \u2018general welfare\u2019 provisions of the Constitution of the United States . . . Count 3 asserts that the \u201cUnited States Government is significantly involved in the production, manufacture and distribution of motor vehicles by' reason of . . . [its] substantial purchases of motor vehicles . . . \u201d and that such \u201ccontinued purchase and operation of present motor vehicles ... is adversely affecting the environment of the United States\u201d; jurisdiction for this \u201cclaim\u201d is premised on the \u201cEnvironmental Quality Act,\u201d not otherwise identified. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages of \u201cone hundred twenty five trillion dollars (trebled to three hundred and seventy five trillion dollars with respect to Count One)\u201d and an attorney\u2019s fee of $3,000,000. Judge Tyler dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it failed to state any claims upon which relief could be granted and that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm on t5ie former ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Counts 2 and 3 of the complaint do not allege the essential elements of any cause of action. The purported jurisdictional basis for the former \u2014 the \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d clause \u2014 is frivolous. As to count 3, plaintiffs now claim that \u201cthe sufficiency of this count need not be considered at this time\u201d since count 2 \u201cis also specifically bottomed on the \u2018Clean Air Act.\u2019 \u201d This assertion is typical of the sloppy, scatter-shot manner in which this complaint was thrown together. Count 2 does not mention the \u201cClean Air Act.\u201d Neither does count 3 for that matter. The latter does refer to the \u201cEnvironmental Quality Act,\u201d which Judge Tyler understandably took to mean the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 4371 et seq. Plaintiffs now tell us they really were referring to 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1857, which the complaint nowhere mentions and which requires, in any event, allegations as yet unmade. Plaintiffs also now argue that count 2 is actually a nuisance or negligence action based upon diversity, allegations that they never bothered to make in the complaint. Even under the liberal Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is a limit to how much a court may be called upon to divine in assessing the sufficiency of the complaint before it, particularly when the plaintiff is represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">As to count 1, it was well within the district court\u2019s discretion to dismiss the claim since no facts are alleged supporting an antitrust conspiracy. Although the Federal Rules permit statement of ultimate facts, a bare bones statement of conspiracy or of injury under the antitrust laws without any supporting facts permits dismissal. See generally, 2A Moore, Federal Practice fl 12.08 (2d ed. 1968). This is particularly true when, as here, the original plaintiff has already amended his complaint once with the approval of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">We are aware that a number of cases are now pending in the District Court for the Central District of California in which the plaintiffs, mostly political entities suing <em>parens patriae </em>on behalf of their citizens, are charging these defendants with antitrust violations in connection with the development of air pollution control devices. At least one of these actions was transferred to that court from the Southern District of New York. See In re Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Equipment, 311 F.Supp. 1349, 1352 (J.P.M.L.1970). We certainly express no view as to the merits of those cases or of any action that might be brought by any private party proper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>]y alleging common law negligence or nuisance. We hold only that the amended complaint before us was so insufficiently and frivolously drawn that Judge Tyler could properly dismiss the action without granting plaintiffs further opportunity to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AB\">.
