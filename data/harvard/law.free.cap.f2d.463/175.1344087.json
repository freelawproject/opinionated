He assessed a fine of $200 on each of the counts for a total of $1,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-22\">On appeal, Sawyer admits \u201cthat a comparison of the driver\u2019s daily logs . and a certified copy of official records of the State of Wisconsin . makes it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the drivers logs in [the counts under which they were found guilty] were demonstratably [sic] and clearly false as found by the trial court.\u201d The only issue, couched in the language of appellant, \u201cis whether or not the evidence was sufficient to establish that Sawyer knowingly and willfully permitted drivers to file false daily logs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-23\">Our examination of the record convinces us that the evidence fully justified the district court in finding guilty knowledge on the part of the appellant. <em>See </em>Riss and Co. v. United States, 262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>F.2d 245, 250 (8th Cir. 1958). The record demonstrates discerning judgment on the part of the trial judge, as manifested by his judgment of acquittal on twelve of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We affirm on the basis of Judge Ne-ville\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-17\">. The regulations here violated were promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission and contain the following provisions: \u00a7 395.1 compels all motor carriers to comply with the various regulations enumerated, and \u00a7 395.8 mandates specifically that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsE\">every motor carrier shall require that a driver\u2019s daily log . . . shall be made in duplicate by every driver used by him or it ... . [Falsification of entries . . . shall make both the driver and the carrier liable to prosecution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-26\">. The statute provides criminal penalties for carriers which \u201cknowingly and willfully keep any accounts, records, or memoranda contrary to the rules, regulations or orders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
