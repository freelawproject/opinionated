Appellants Sherman A. Berry and Rudolph E. Somers were convicted of operating a lottery in violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1501. They were also convicted, along with appellants Paul Gray and Shirley F. Spearman, of maintaining gambling premises at 3416 Eads Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., in violation of 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 1505. Appellant Bessie L. Berry and all of the heretofore named appellants were convicted of possessing num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>bers slips in violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1502. The appeals from these convictions have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">Prior to trial appellants moved to suppress evidence seized from them on the ground that there was not probable cause for the issuance of the warrants and hence that the searches and seizures were unlawful. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding the affidavit in support of the search warrants sufficient to constitute probable cause for the searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">Having received information that \u201cRudolph E. Somers was picking up numbers . . . and taking them to 3416-Eads Street N.E., which is the numbers office of Sherman A. Berry, who is a well known area gambler,\u201d two officers of the Metropolitan Police Gambling Squad initiated an investigation entailing daily surveillance of the address, 3416 Eads Street, Northeast, from Wednesday, October 15, through Wednesday, October 22, 1969, excluding the intervening weekend. On October 23, search warrants for the Eads Street address and for 721 46th Street, Southeast were obtained, the premises were entered, the defendants were arrested, and certain gambling paraphernalia were seized as physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">Appellants have challenged the validity of the search warrants on the ground that the affidavit in support of the warrants is lacking in the fundamental requirements enunciated in Aguilar v. Texas,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Spinelli v. United States,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and United States v. Long<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in that (1) the affidavit failed to set forth factual circumstances from which a magistrate could appraise the informant\u2019s credibility; (2) the affidavit did not sufficiently state the underlying circumstances upon which the informant based his conclusion; and (3) the informant did not describe the accused\u2019s criminal activity in sufficient detail to show the magistrate that he is relying on something more than rumor. Further, appellants contend that, viewed in the entirety, the affidavit falls short of the standards of probable cause enunciated by the Supreme Court in its decisions in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-14\">Appellants have seized upon the first paragraph of the affidavit, which is reproduced in full in the Appendix to this opinion, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-15\">\u201cDuring the month of October 1969, information was received in the office of the Gambling Squad, Morals Division, Metropolitan Police Dept., that Rudolph E. Somers was picking up numbers in the District of Columbia and then taking them to 3416-Eads Street N.E., which is the numbers office of Sherman A. Berry, who is a well known area gambler. As a result of this information Pic. Matthew C. Rettew and Officer George A. Woo were assigned to conduct an investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-16\">Finding nothing regarding the credibility of the informant, no statement of underlying circumstances upon which informant based his conclusions, and no description by informant of the accused's criminal activity in sufficient detail to show that he was relying on something more substantial than rumor, appellants contend that the affidavit, according to the teaching of <em>Aguilar, Spinelli </em>and <em>Long, </em>is fatally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-17\">In the <em>Aguilar </em>affidavit the informant\u2019s tip alone was intended to provide the basis for probable cause. In such a situation, the Supreme Court held it essential that the affiant state some of the underlying circumstances necessary to enable the magistrate independently to judge the validity of the informant\u2019s conclusion as well as the affiant\u2019s conclusion that the informant was \u201ccredible\u201d or his information \u201creliable.\u201d The rationale here is that if the magistrate is not to become a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>police, he must have a basis for assessing the probabilities of truth as to a purely hearsay statement made by a person unknown to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">That these requirements regarding an informant could be mitigated, depending upon other facts which might be included in the affidavit, such as corroboration of the tip by police investigation, is implicit in the Court\u2019s statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq8u\">\u201cIf the fact and results of such a surveillance had been appropriately presented to the magistrate, this would, of course, present an entirely different case.\u201d 378 U.S. at 109, note 1, 84 S.Ct. at 1511.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">The <em>Spinelli </em>affidavit relied upon an informant\u2019s tip, but it also included the results of an FBI surveillance in an effort to corroborate the tip, thus presenting the question as to how the <em>Aguilar </em>test was to be applied in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">Although United States v. Long, <em>supra, </em>had not been decided at the time the district court denied the motion to suppress, it lends no support to appellants\u2019 contentions. The <em>Long </em>affidavit relied on information from the \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of two confidential informants and an independent FBI surveillance report. Finding this situation quite similar to <em>SpineUi, </em>we followed its guidelines in deciding <em>Long.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">Clearly these decisions are grounded on affidavits where the basis for probable cause lies primarily on the informant\u2019s information. However, we find nothing in the aforesaid cases to support a conclusion that an independent police investigation could not make a sufficient showing of probable cause, even where the investigation began with a tip from an anonymous informant whose credibility, reliability and source of information were questionable or unknown. In DiPiazza v. United States,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Sixth Circuit pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-9\"><em>\u201cSpinelli </em>is no authority for the proposition that the search warrant is invalid because an investigation is begun as a result of a tip. Weak, anonymous and even untrustworthy information may serve as the opening clue to uncovering criminal acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">We also agree with the District Judge who first considered appellants\u2019 argument on their motion to suppress and concluded \u201cthis is surely not the teaching of <em>SpineUi </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>for it would lead to absurd results in cases such as this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">The affidavit before us does not depend on the tip as the basis for probable cause. The impact of the first paragraph is that the \u201cinformation received\u201d triggered the investigation by Pic. Rettew and Officer Woo. These officers then set out in nine full paragraphs the details and results of their investigation. It is primarily from this data that probable cause will stand or fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">We turn now to the affidavit, viewed in its entirety, to determine whether, as appellants contend, it falls short of the standards of probable cause enunciated by the Supreme Court in its decisions in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">In <em>SpineUi </em>the Supreme Court was face to face with the situation it had anticipated in <em>Aguilar </em>and how the so-called \u201ctwo-pronged test of Aguilar\u201d was to be applied. The affidavit showed that the FBI was relying on information received from a \u201cconfidential, reliable informant\u201d that Spinelli was operating a handbook and accepting wagers and disseminating wagering information by means of the telephones whose numbers were WYdown 4-0029 and WYdown 4-0136. The affiant had offered no reason in support of his conclusion that the informant was credible, his information reliable, nor the underlying circumstances upon which informant had based his conclusions. So far as the tip was concerned, the affidavit failed the <em>Aguilar </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">Focusing then on the FBI investigation, the FBI had kept track of Spinelli\u2019s movements for five days in August 1965. On four of the five days Spinelli crossed the river from Illinois to St. Louis between 11:00 and 12:00 noon; he parked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>his car in a parking lot of a certain apartment house between 3:30 and 4:45 p. m.; on one day he was seen entering a particular apartment in that building. The telephone company verified two telephones assigned to that apartment\u2014 WYdown 4-0029 and WYdown 4-0136\u2014 listed under the name of Grace P. Hagen. The Court found this to be innocent-seeming activity and data, and emphasized that this information alone would not establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">The Court then t\u00e9sted the informant's information against the FBI investigation. It refused to give any weight to an assertion in the affidavit that \u201cSpinelli was \u2018known\u2019 to the affiant and to other federal and local law enforcement officers as a gambler and an associate of gamblers\u201d, dismissing this as a \u201cbald and unilluminating assertion of suspicion.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a 5-3 decision, the majority of the Court concluded that the \u201cinvestigation\u201d did not corroborate enough of the \u201ctip\u201d to meet the reliability test of <em>Aguilar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">This decision brought forth one of Mr. Justice Black\u2019s most scathing dissents. Taking issue with the majority\u2019s refusal to give weight to Spinelli\u2019s reputation as a gambler he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-6\">\u201cAlthough the statement is hearsay that might not be admissible in a regular trial, everyone knows, unless he shuts his eyes to the realities of life, that this is a relevant fact which, together with other circumstances, might indicate a factual probability that gambling is taking place.\u201d <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJL\">And, after pointing out the salient information contained in the affidavit, considered in its entirety, Mr. Justice Black concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-7\">\u201c[t]he foregoing facts should be enough to constitute probable cause for anyone who does not believe that the only way to obtain a search warrant is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant is guilty.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av7\">The affidavit in <em>Long </em>asserted that two unnamed <em>confidential informants </em>had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d that Long was engaged in a numbers operation in Russ Cecchini\u2019s apartment. There were statements that these confidential informants were well acquainted with gambling activities in the Washington (D.C.) area and had furnished information on numerous occasions in the past that was either verified as correct through independent sources or FBI observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">Following the edict of <em>Spinelli, </em>we found that this did not meet the <em>Aguilar </em>test. Even if there was no dispute as to informants\u2019 reliability, the affidavit failed to assert the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d upon which the informants based their conclusions. It was our opinion that a mere statement that the information was based on the informants\u2019 \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d was no more than a conclusion, insufficient for a magistrate to infer that the information was gained in a reliable way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">The affidavit contained a statement that Russ Cecchini, 2338 24th Street, S. E., Washington, D.C. had been convicted in 1968 on gambling and numbers charges. This was followed by the observations of the FBI of Long\u2019s movements in entering and leaving the Cecchini apartment, for nine days between August 15 and September 10, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">The report showed that on five of these days Long left 5231 Devonshire Drive, Oxon Hill, Maryland (hereafter the \u201cMaryland address\u201d) in his automobile between 10:00 and 11:00 a. m., and between 11:00 and 12:00 noon he parked car in front of 2338 24th Street, S.E. (hereafter the \u201cSoutheast Address\u201d); on three of these days Long was seen entering the building numbered \u201c2338\u201d ; on one day Long was seen entering apartment number \u201c1604\u201d ; on two days Long left the Southeast address in his automobile around 7:00 p. m. and drove to the Maryland address; on two occasions it was averred that Long looked about, as if to see if he was being watched.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>While considerable detail was presented in the affidavit regarding the FBI\u2019s observations of Long\u2019s comings and goings, we found that the actions of Long observed and reported were entirely innocent ones which might be performed by any citizen going about his normal activities. As to the statement that Long looked about to see if he was being watched, we considered this conclusory and insufficient to support a probability that Long was engaged in some sort of illegal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">There was no statement in the affidavit that Long had a prior criminal record nor that he was known to law enforcement officers as a gambler. Comparing the investigation with the tip, we could not find Long\u2019s entering and leaving the Cecchini apartment, without more, corroborated the conclusion that Long was engaged in a numbers operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">Shortly after our decision in <em>Long, </em>the Supreme Court handed down United States v. Harris,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> involving the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting a search warrant, the execution of which resulted in the discovery of illicit spirits. The affidavit stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Harris had a reputation with the investigator for over four years as being a trafficker of nontaxpaid distilled spirits. The Sixth Circuit had found this affidavit inadequate, having relied on <em>Spinelli </em>in giving no weight to affiant\u2019s assertion concerning Harris\u2019 reputation. In a 5-4 opinion the Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">Acknowledging that in <em>Spinelli </em>it had rejected as entitled to no weight the \u201cbald and unilluminating\u201d assertion that the suspect was known to the affiant as a gambler, on the authority of Nathan-son v. United States,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-15\">\u201cBut a careful examination of <em>Nathan-son </em>shows that the <em>Spinelli </em>opinion did not fully reflect the critical points of what <em>Nathanson </em>held since it was limited to holding that reputation, <em>standing alone, </em>was insufficient; it surely did not hold it irrelevant when supported by other information. This reading of <em>Nathanson </em>is confirmed by Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), in which the Court, in sustaining a finding of probable cause for a warrant-less arrest, held proper the assertion of the searching officer that he had previously arrested the defendant for a similar offense and that the defendant had a reputation for hauling liquor.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">In contrast to the different function of a criminal trial, the Court emphasized that <em>before </em>the trial we deal only with probabilities, which, in the words of Mr. Justice Rutledge, \u201care not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In applying these principles to <em>Harris, </em>the Chief Justice, writing for the majority, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-17\">\u201cWe cannot conclude that a policeman's knowledge of a suspect\u2019s reputation \u2014 something that policemen frequently know * * * \u2014is not a \u2018practical consideration of everyday life\u2019 upon which an officer (or a magistrate) may properly rely in assessing the reliability of an informant\u2019s tip. To the extent that <em>Spinelli </em>prohibits the use of such probative information, it has no support in our prior cases, logic, or experience and we decline to apply it to preclude a magistrate from relying on a law enforcement officer\u2019s knowledge of a suspect\u2019s reputation.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>With this background and the <em>V-entres</em>ca<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> admonition that affidavits are \u201cnormally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation,\u201d and they \u201cmust be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion,\u201d we turn to the affidavit at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">The magistrate had before him the sworn statement of the two officers who conducted a six-day investigation, that Rudolph E. Somers, convicted the preceding year for possession of number slips and maintaining gambling premises, regularly entered the premises of 3416 Eads Street, Northeast, between 2:20 and 2:-30 p. m. carrying a small package; that on four of these days Sherman Berry, three-times arrested for gambling offenses and once convicted for possession of numbers slips, entered the premises of 3416 Eads Street, Northeast, between 6:-10 and 6:30 p. m. and departed between 7:00 and 7:10 p. m.; that Somers, regularly left the Eads Street premises between 7:35 and 7:50 p. m. carrying a small package, which he delivered to 721 46th Street, Southeast, which premises were the subject of a raid in May of 1963 from which a large quantity of gambling paraphernalia had been seized and which resulted in the aforesaid arrest and conviction of Sherman Berry for possession of numbers slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">The report in the affidavit of the investigation involves no element of \u201chearsay.\u201d This is not a case of arrest or search either on the say-so of \u201cfaceless informers\u201d or with significant reliance on their assertions. The observations of the officers in their sworn affidavit form a reliable basis for a warrant applied for by them.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">We find a good deal more here to refute a conclusion of \u201cinnocent acts that might be performed by any citizen going about his normal activities.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The magistrate was told that Berry and Somers had <em>prior convictions </em>of violation of the gambling laws \u2014 an element totally absent in <em>Long, </em>and, we think, even stronger than the \u201cknown reputation\u201d, struck down in <em>Spinelli, </em>but resurrected in <em>Harris. </em>We have the additional fact of a \u201csmall package\u201d being delivered to 3416 Eads early in the afternoon, which becomes significant when a like \u201csmall package\u201d is being delivered in the early evening to premises which have been established by <em>police record </em>to have recently housed a gambling operation, and directly connected with the arrest and conviction of Berry, one of the subjects of the present investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-10\">The clincher, of course, would be the officers\u2019 own knowledge that the \u201csmall package\u201d being delivered by Somers contained <em>numbers slips. </em>As Mr. Justice Black dryly pointed out in his dissenting opinion in <em>Spinelli, </em>\u201c[o]f course it would strengthen the probable-cause presentation if eyewitnesses could testify that they saw the defendant commit the crime * * * [but] [n]othing in our Constitution * * * requires that the facts be established with that degree of certainty and with such elaborate specificity before a policeman can be authorized by a disinterested magistrate to conduct a carefully limited search.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">We think the magistrate could reasonably infer from the facts presented that there was probable cause to believe the \u201csmall packages\u201d contained numbers slips. The affidavit contained the uncorroborated information that Somers was delivering \u201cnumbers.\u201d However, as the <em>Harris </em>Court pointed out</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-12\">\u201cIt will not do to say that warrants may not issue on uncorroborated hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>say. This only avoids the issue of whether there is reason for crediting the out-of-court statement.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">The affidavit also contained direct information that Somers was seen by the two investigators delivering \u201csmall packages.\u201d The investigation not only verified the tip in substance, but revealed considerably more facts giving rise to the probability that Somers and Berry were involved in illegal conduct in the premises named in the affidavit. It was the belief of these two trained and experienced officers, based upon their knowledge as to how the \u201cnumbers game\u201d lottery operation is conducted, the methods employed by persons engaged in such an operation, the time of day such activity is usually carried on, that the \u201csmall packages\u201d which they saw Somers delivering contained numbers slips and related records used in the operation of the lottery. It would have been helpful if the investigating officers in their affidavit had elaborated on the <em>modus operandi </em>of the numbers operation, in particular regarding the significance of the time of day they observed Somers and Berry arriving and departing the Eads Street address.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the nature and physical characteristics of the \u201csmall packages\u201d were such as to be typical of those used in gambling operations, though innocent in outward appearance, that fact should have been stated. But we must take into account that a magistrate, experienced in these matters, is entitled to draw inferences from acts which to the uninitiated and unskilled would be seemingly innocent acts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">We find the affidavit before us to be sufficient. The judgments of the district court are</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-13\">AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">Affidavit supporting the request for United States Magistrates Search and Arrest Warrants for the below described premises and persons for violations of the Lottery Laws of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">SEARCH WARRANT: 3416 \u2014 Eads Street N.

Somers was picking up numbers in the District of Columbia and then taking them to 3416 \u2014 Eads Street N.E., which is the numbers office of Sherman A. Berry, who is a well known area gambler. As a result of this information Pic. Matthew C. Rettew and Officer George A. <em>Woo </em>were assigned to conduct an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">About 2:30 PM, Wednesday, October 15, 1969, Pic. Matthew C. Rettew and Officer George A. Woo were in the vicinity of 3416 Eads Street N.E. Washington, D.C. and observed Rudolph E. Somers drive up and park a Cadillac, bearing D.C. Tags 553-450 in the 3400 block of Eads Street N.E., get out carrying a small package in his hand, and then walk to and enter the front door of 3416 \u2014 Eads Street N.E., Washington, D.C. About 7:00 PM, the same date, the Officers were again in the vicinity of 3416 Eads Street N.E. and observed Rudolph Somers depart the front door of this premises, carrying a small package in his hand, get into the Cadillac 553-450 and drive out of the area. The Officers followed the Cadillac to the 700 block of 46th Street S.E. where Somers parked the auto, got out carrying the small package in his hand and then walk to and enter premises 721 \u2014 46th Street S.E., Washington, D.C. carrying the package in his hand. About 7:35 PM, the same date, the Officers observed Rudolph Somers depart 721 \u2014 46th Street S.E., minus the small package he had been carrying previously, get into the Cadillac 553-450 and drive out of the area. The Officers then departed the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">Investigation reveals that Rudolph E. Somers was arrested on February 21, 1968 on charges of Operating a Lottery, Maintaining a Gambling Premises and Possession of Numbers Slips, was convicted of Maintaining a Gambling Premises and Possession of Numbers Slips and was sentenced to $100.00 or 30 days on each of these charges.
