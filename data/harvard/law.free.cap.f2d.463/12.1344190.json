Court of Claims, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-8\">DYER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">In this diversity case a jury found Deseret Pharmaceutical Company liable for the manufacture of a defective intracath needle which caused a catheter to break off in a vein in Vergott\u2019s arm. The jury also found that the negligence of the nurse that performed the procedure, an employee of Mercy Hospital, a third party defendant, was not a proximate cause of Vergott\u2019s injuries. The court directed a verdict for Bard, the other third party defendant, who purchased and distributed the intracath needle, and denied Deseret\u2019s pleas for contribution. Deseret appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">While Mrs. Vergott was a patient in Mercy Hospital in Brownsville, Texas, it became necessary to give her fluids intravenously. To accomplish this a registered nurse used a Bardic-Deseret intraeath which had been assembled by Deseret and packaged and distributed by Bard. As the needle of the intracath was being extracted a portion of the catheter broke off in Vergott\u2019s vein and was carried through the veinous system until it lodged in the right atrium of her heart causing serious injury that necessitated open heart surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">An intracath unit consists of a needle through which a plastic catheter is inserted into the vein once the needle punctures the skin and protrudes into the vein. Once the catheter has been threaded into the vein, the needle is extracted so that only the catheter is left in the patient\u2019s arm. The catheter is then connected to a tube from a bottle of solution which allows the fluid to flow through the catheter directly into the vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">The administering nurse did not follow the sequence of steps as shown and explained in the instructions. She attached the tube from the I.V. bottle to the intracath device prior to extracting the needle from the patient\u2019s vein. When she observed that the solution was running into the vein she removed the needle and a portion of the catheter by applying slight pressure with a sterile cotton pledget over the puncture with her left hand and gently withdrew the needle with her right hand. While the needle was being withdrawn the catheter parted.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">Vergott brought suit in the state court against the Sisters of Mercy of the Union in the United States of America, Province of St. Louis, Inc. d/b/a Mercy Hospital, alleging that the nurse had negligently allowed the catheter to break in her arm. The Hospital removed the case and filed a third party complaint against Deseret, Bard, and the American Hospital Supply Corp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vergott then joined Deseret, Bard, and American Hospital as defendants. After extensive discovery Vergott dismissed Bard, Mercy Hospital, and American Hospital but Deseret kept Mercy Hospital and Bard in the case as third party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">At trial Vergott contended that the heel of the needle was too sharp, that it was unreasonably dangerous, and that it was not reasonably fit for the purposes intended. Deseret alternatively defended on the ground that there was no de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>feet in the needle\u2019s physical qualities, that Bard was negligent in failing to include adequate instructions in its distribution of the intracath, and that the negligence of the nurse was the proximate cause of the catheter breaking. It also contended that if there was a defect in the needle it was caused by Bard\u2019s mishandling.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">At the close of all the evidence the district court granted Bard\u2019s motion for an instructed verdict, finding no evidence that Bard mishandled or in any other way caused the defect in the needle or that the instructions were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The jury, in answer to special interrogatories, found that the intracath was not reasonably fit for its intended use and that this was the proximate cause of Vergott\u2019s injuries. It found the nurse negligent in her use of the intracath but exonerated her employer, Mercy Hospital, by finding that the nurse\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of the injuries. Thus the full award of damages was visited solely upon Deseret.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We are faced with an avalanche of errors asserted by Deseret, some of which were raised below and many of which are raised for the first time on appeal. In essence the claimed errors are: (1) the directed verdict in favor of Bard; (2) the failure of the court to hold that the nurse\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause as a matter of law; (3) the failure of the court to hold Bard and Mercy Hospital jointly liable under the strict liability doctrine of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A; (4) the failure of the court to grant a new trial to Deseret because the alignment of the parties denied it a fair trial; (5) the error of the court in admitting into evidence over objection drawings of the intracath needle; (6) the prejudicial demeanor of the trial judge prevented Deseret from obtaining a fair trial; and finally (7) Deseret\u2019s liability for the amount of the judgment should be credited with any amounts paid by Mercy Hospital and Bard to Vergott to prevent a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">\n<em>The Directed Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Deseret\u2019s third party action against Bard had a two prong premise; that Bard mishandled or somehow caused the needle to become defective, and that it failed to include adequate warnings or instructions with the intracath unit. The record is bare of any evidence to support these contentions. Consequently, the district court did not err in granting the motion for a directed verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no evidence upon which reasonable men could arrive at a contrary finding. Alman Bros., etc. v. Diamond Laboratories, Inc., 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 1295, 1298; Boeing v. Shipman, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 365, 374 <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">\n<em>The Nurse\u2019s Negligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">Deseret argues that, as a matter of law, the negligence of the nurse was a proximate cause of Vergott\u2019s injuries. This, of course, is tantamount to saying that the evidence was insufficient to take the case to the jury. The short answer to this is that we will not review the sufficiency of the evidence when no motion for a directed verdict was made in the trial, court. Hommel v. Jackson-Atlantic, Inc., 5 Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 307, 309; 9 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2536, p. 593 (1971). Deseret made no such motion below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Applicability of </em>\u00a7 <em>402A to Mercy Hospital and Bard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Deseret contends that Mercy Hospital and Bard are liable as joint tort feasors because in Texas \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts is applicable under McKisson v. Sales Affiliates, Inc., Tex.1967, 416 S.W.2d 787. Section 402A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">(a.) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">(2) The rule stated in subsection (1) applies although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Although we are not at all sure that this contention was presented below in the pleadings, pre-trial order, during the course of the trial, or in the motion for new trial, we resolve the doubt in favor of Deseret and hold that the point was sufficiently raised in the court below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\"><em>McKisson </em>cannot be read to compel an application of \u00a7 402A to hold Bard and Mercy Hospital liable as third party tortfeasors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming its applicability for the purpose of determining indemnity or contribution issues among the third party plaintiffs and defendants, Deseret stands to gain nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-17\">Neither Bard nor Mercy Hospital breached a duty that either owed to Deseret. Deseret is therefore not entitled to indemnification. Wheeler v. Glazer, 1941, 137 Tex. 341, 153 S.W.2d 449, 451-452. On the contrary, Deseret breached a duty it owed to Bard and Mercy Hospital to sell them an intracath unit that was reasonably fit for its intended use. <em>See </em>Jacobs v. Technical Chemical Co., 472 S.W.2d 191, 200 (Tex. Civ.App.\u2014Houston 14th Dist. 1971), rev'd on other grounds, Tex.1972, 480 S.W.2d 602; <em>See also </em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. of Houston v. Hobart, 423 S.W.2d 118, 125 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Houston 14th Dist. 1967, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-21\">Parallel reasoning also bars Deseret\u2019s claim for contribution. Under Vernon\u2019s Tex.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2212 (1971) contribution is not available to Deseret because Bard and Mercy Hospital would be entitled to indemnification at common law against Deseret.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Renfro Drug Co. v. Lewis, 1950, 149 Tex. 507, 235 S.W.2d 609, 622-623; Austin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Road Co. v. Pope, 1949, 147 Tex. 430, 216 S.W.2d 563, 565. Deseret is solely liable for the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\n<em>Admission of the Drawings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Vergott introduced a large drawing of the intracath needle and two other \u201cblow up\u201d drawings. Deseret objected to the basic drawing on the ground that it incorporated some specification modifications, dated October 1970, that were made after the injury occurred. The court admitted the drawings, but only after granting Deseret the opportunity to show in what respect the drawings did not conform to the specifications in existence at the time of the injury. Deseret made no such showing. The drawings were properly admitted over this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">On appeal Deseret argues that the drawings were erroneously admitted for the additional reasons that they were prepared after the injury, that they incorporated post accident safety measures, and that they portrayed a perfectly rounded beveled heel while the specifications do not call for this. The short answer is that we decline to entertain or pass upon errors not presented to the trial court and which are raised for the first time on appeal. Jenkins v. General Motors Corp., 5 Cir. 1971, 446 F.2d 377, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\n<em>Posture of the Parties and the Fairness of the Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">This issue came to light for the first time in Deseret\u2019s motion for a new trial. We consider it but find that it lacks merit. Deseret claims that counsel for Vergott, Bard, and Mercy Hospital ganged up on Deseret and were hostile. This is evidenced, Deseret argues, by the fact that all three opposing counsel cross examined each witness in an effort to create a factual atmosphere as prejudicial as possible to Deseret. Our review of the record convinces us that this specification of error is without merit. After Vergott dismissed Bard and Mercy Hospital they remained in the case as third party defendants to Deseret\u2019s claims against them. Deseret did not move for a continuance, seek a severance of the third party claims from the case in chief, dismiss its own third party claims, or object to a single question propounded by counsel for Bard or Mercy Hospital on the grounds of double teaming or that it was being denied a fair trial. We have searched in vain to find interrogation by counsel for Bard and Mercy Hospital that was not relevant to protecting their positions as third party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Deseret\u2019s reliance upon Palestine Contractors, Inc. v. Perkins, Tex.1964, 386 S.W.2d 764, 774, and McMullen v. Coleman, 135 S.W.2d 776 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Waco 1940, writ ref\u2019d n. r. e.) is misplaced. In <em>Palestine </em>the issue was not discussed and the error, if any, was regarded as harmless. In <em>McMullen </em>the court found that the presentation of the case to the jury was manifestly unfair because plaintiff\u2019s attorney argued that he was convinced that the settling co-defendant was not guilty of negligence and urged the jury to acquit him of any negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">\n<em>Trial Judge\u2019s Questions and Remarks</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Deseret complains, for the first time on appeal, that the trial judge\u2019s examination of the witnesses and remarks so prejudiced it in the eyes of the jury that it was denied a fair trial. We reiterate, we decline to review errors not presented to the trial court. Dennis v. Central Gulf Steamship Corp., 5 Cir. 1971, 453 F.2d 137, 141; Louisiana &amp; Arkansas Ry. Co. v. Johnson, 5 Cir. 1954, 214 F.2d 290, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">\n<em>Double Recovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">We need not pause long concerning the oblique argument Deseret makes that a settlement was allegedly made by Vergott with Bard and Mercy Hospital, and therefore the judgment against it must be credited with the settlement amount. Unless this is required, Deseret argues, Vergott will enjoy a \u201cdouble <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>recovery.\u201d Again, this specification of error is raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">There is nothing in the record pertaining to a settlement or agreement except a motion in limine by <em>the plaintiff </em>that this was irrelevant to Deseret\u2019s liability and a remark by the court that \u201cthis is some side deal that you all had that I have no control over or anything to do with.\u201d These vague references are insufficient to establish the existence of a settlement much less the terms or amounts involved that would establish a double recovery. The burden is on one seeking credit to show what was received by the plaintiff in settlement with another defendant. <em>See </em>Harrington v. Texaco, Inc., 5 Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 814, 820. We cannot act on the appellate level without a record or an objection. We have neither here.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The judgment of the district court is in all respects affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-17\">. American Hospital Supply Corp. was the party that sold the intracath to Mercy Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">. AVe also agree with Bard that Deseret\u2019s counsel waived any contention that Bard failed to include adequate instructions. Laird v. Air Carrier Engine Service, 5 Cir. 1959, 263 F.2d 948, 953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. We are unimpressed with Deseret\u2019s argument that Mercy Hospital is bound by the testimony of one of its experts, Flanagan, the thrust of which was that a minor rearward movement, such as the one that cut the catheter here, was not at all uncommon when using an intracath. Deseret maintains that this proves proximate cause as a matter of law. We cannot be sure whether a rearward movement or a reversing of two steps in the instructions was the negligence found by the jury. In any event, there was other expert evidence that a rearward move<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ment would not linve caused the catheter to part if a good needle had been used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-13\">. Deseret made no attempt to have the factual issues upon which this theory is bottomed, submitted to the jury, i. e., were Bard and Mercy Hospital engaged in the business of selling the product and that the product was expected to and did reach the user in the condition in which it was sold. Even if these issues were uncontroverted or the evidence conclusively established them, Deseret made no effort to have Bard or Mercy Hospital included in the judgment under this theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b106-14\">. Even if \u00a7 402A is applicable, a hospital is not a seller engaged in the business of selling the product. <em>Cf. </em>Perlmutter v. Both David Hospital, 1954, 308 N.Y. 100, 123 N.E.2d 792.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b106-24\">.
