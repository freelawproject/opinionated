BROWN, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">Dow Chemical Company brought an action in admiralty against Dixie Carriers for damages to the fender works resulting from three separate collisions between barges under tow by a Dow tug demise chartered to Dixie and a railroad bridge fender system constructed by Dow on its barge canal at Freeport, Texas. Both parties appeal from the District Court\u2019s $17,055 judgment in favor of Dow, 330 F.Supp. 1304. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">Dixie\u2019s primary argument is that the terms of the time charter generously provide it with absolute immunity against all liability for collision damage, including that resulting from its own negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But that sort of extraordinary exemption from legal responsibility \u201ccan arise only from the plainly expressed intention of the parties, manifested by language couched in unmistakable terms,\u201d not from \u201cthe unilateral contention of one party that it meant to impose unlimited liability on the other side.\u201d Lanasse v. Travelers Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 1971, 450 F.2d 580, 584, cert. denied Chevron Oil Co., California Company Division v. Royal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Insurance Company, 1972, 406 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 1779, 32 L.Ed.2d 120 and cases cited therein. Given the equivocal language here, and reading it \u201cagainst the background of other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we must conclude that the District Court\u2019s interpretation (that Dixie was exempt from all liability for collision damage <em>except </em>that resulting from \u201cnegligence of the master, crew or other servants of Dixie\u201d) is the only reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Dixie also challenges the finding that Dow\u2019s failure to secure approval from the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Engineers for construction of the fender system, while technically violative of sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 402, did not cause or contribute to any of the collisions. Baldly stated, the contention is that Dow is liable if the fenders \u201ccaused\u201d the collisions and that they were a \u201ccause\u201d since the barges collided with them. However, unlike the cases cited by Dixie,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there is no proof in the record here that the fender system actually obstructed navigation, that it was inherently hazardous, or that any change in its design or placement would have prevented the collisions. More importantly, as found by the District Court, Dixie\u2019s crew was familiar with the peculiar characteristics of the canal and had navigated through the bridge opening and fender system in both directions on many previous occasions. Clearly the Court concluded that the collisions would not have occurred if Dixie had not been negligent \u2014 and that conclusion inescapably involved an assessment of navigation in the face of well-known conditions imposing no extraordinary hazards or difficulties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record refutes any suggestion that the fender system \u201ccaused or contributed to\u201d the collisions simply by being there.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Finally, Dixie maintains that many of the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the negligence of her crew in operating and maintaining the vessel are erroneous, particularly the refusal to characterize a malfunctioning generator as a \u201clatent defect\u201d within the meaning of the charter terms (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>This is merely one more instance for the application of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a) in its seagoing form \u2014 the findings are not clearly erroneous and must be affirmed. Lanasse v. Travelers Insurance Co, <em>supra </em>; Ohio Barge Line, Inc. v. Oil Transport Co, 5 Cir, 1960, 280 F.2d 448, 1961 A.M.C. 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Dow\u2019s appeal \u2014 if it really is an appeal from a judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> rather than a disagreement with the Trial Court\u2019s opinion \u2014 results primarily from the determination that its private barge canal constitutes \u201cnavigable water of the United States\u201d subject to regulation under the Rivers and Harbors Act. Like the District Court, we conclude that the characterization of the canal as \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d is irrelevant. McKie v. Diamond Marine Co., 5 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 132, 135; Dagger v. U.S.N.S. Sands, S.D.W.Va., 1968, 287 F.Supp. 939, 942; Guilbeau v. Falcon Seaboard Drilling Co., E.D.La., 1963, 215 F.Supp. 909, 911. The evidence relating to Dow\u2019s use of the canal for the purpose of transporting substantial quantities of shell, chemicals and finished products to and from its two plants on a daily basis provides more than ample support for the conclusion that the canal was an instrumentality of interstate commerce subject to Congressional regulation under the Act. Leovy v. United States, 1900, 177 U.S. 621, 20 S.Ct. 797, 44 L. Ed. 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Dow also maintains that it was entitled to prejudgment interest computed from the date of the collisions, contending that the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny such interest must be based upon the existence of peculiar circumstances. Alcoa Steamship Co. v. Charles Ferran &amp; Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 1971, 443 F.2d 250, 256, cert. denied Underwriters at Lloyds London v. Alcoa Steamship Co., 404 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 98, 30 L.Ed.2d 94; American Zinc Co. v. Foster, 5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 1100, cert. denied Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Systems, Inc. v. American Zinc Co., 404 U. 5. 855, 92 S.Ct. 99, 30 L.Ed.2d 95; Sinclair Refining Co. v. SS Green Island, 5 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 260. Granting the soundness of this principle as a general rule, we nevertheless believe that the circumstances of this case \u2014 including the serious and genuine dispute regarding ultimate liability contested in good faith by Dixie and the relative uncertainty of many of the legal and factual issues to be resolved, added to a mutual fault finding as to one of the collisions \u2014provided the experienced and capable District Judge with an adequate basis for awarding interest only from the date of judgment.

Dixie\u2019s argument confuses negligence with causation.

Troop, 1874, 19 Wall. 125, 86 U.S. 125, 22 L.Ed. 148, that rule cannot \u201cbe pressed to such an extreme as to justify a division of damages when the accident was undoubtedly due to the negligence of an offending vessel whose actions could not be anticipated.\u201d Webb v.
