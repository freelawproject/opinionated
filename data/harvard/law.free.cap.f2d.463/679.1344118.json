At that time appellant was serving part of a jail sentence which was imposed by the Municipal Court of Dade County, Florida, for traffic violations. In December of 1968 and January of 1969, appellant was convicted of three traffic offenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to a jail term of 60 days, to fines totaling $520.00, to court costs of $50.00, and to additional jail time of 58 days if the fines were not paid. It is undisputed that appellant was indigent at the time of his conviction, that he was not advised of his right to counsel, and that counsel was not provided for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">Appellant\u2019s petition for habeas corpus alleged that he had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to advice of counsel because counsel had not been appointed in his misdemeanor or petty offense trials, which carried the threat of and eventually resulted in a jail sentence. The district judge denied appellant\u2019s writ, and this court remanded for clarification of some apparent inconsistencies in the record regarding the maximum penalty that Matthews could expect. Matthews v. State of Florida, 5 Cir. 1970, 422 F.2d 1046. In February of 1970, after appellant filed his petition in January of 1969, the municipal court judge released appellant from custody, apparently after he had served only about 34 days of his sentence. Appellant paid all of his fines before he was released. Pursuant to the remand by this court the district court held an evidentiary hearing in order to clarify the inconsistencies and contradictions in the previous record on appeal. The district court then dismissed appellant\u2019s petition on two grounds: (1) that he was not entitled to counsel in a misdemeanor or petty offense case that could involve jail time, and (2) that the case had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>mooted by appellant\u2019s release from prison and payment of his fines. This court held appellant\u2019s appeal from the denial of his petition, pending decision of Argersinger v. Hamlin, 1972, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530, by the Supreme Court. <em>Argersinger </em>concluded that the failure to grant counsel to Matthews was constitutional error, and this appeal concerns only the question of whether or not Matthews\u2019 case is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"Azg\">We conclude that appellant\u2019s case is not moot, and that the order denying his petition for habeas corpus must be vacated and remanded. The question of mootness in a habeas corpus situation turns on the substantiality of any \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d that may have befallen the appellant during the time in which his or her appeal was pending. <em>See </em>Carafas v. LaVallee, 1968, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554. While <em>Carafas </em>involved a convicted felon, we conclude that the rationale of <em>Argersinger </em>requires that <em>Carafas </em>apply to a situation in which a jail term was levied and served and fines were assessed and paid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\"><em>\u201cWe </em>must conclude, therefore, that the problems associated with misdemeanor and petty offenses often require the presence of counsel to insure the accused a fair trial. . . .We need not consider the requirements of the Sixth Amendment as regards the right to counsel where loss of liberty is not involved, however, for here, petitioner was in fact sentenced to jail. And, as we said in Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. [66], at 73 [90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437]: \u2018[T]he prospect of imprisonment for however short a time will seldom be viewed by the accused as a trivial or \u201cpetty\u201d matter and may well result in quite serious repercussions affecting his career and his reputation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Argersinger v. Florida, 92 S.Ct. at 2012. In the instant case Matthews paid almost $600.00, served about one month in jail, and lost \u201cpoints\u201d on his driver\u2019s license. In addition to the actual financial loss and the precarious position in which his driver\u2019s license has now been placed, Matthews may very well have sustained the same \u201crepercussions affecting his career and his reputation\u201d that compelled the Supreme Court to reach its conclusions in Argersinger.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court\u2019s order must be vacated, with directions to ascertain whether or not appellant\u2019s failure to obtain counsel was the result of a voluntary waiver, Argersinger v. Florida, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-16\">. Twice for driving without a valid driver\u2019s license and once for making an improper start.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">. Westberry v. Keith, 5 Cir. 1971, 434 F.2d 623, is inapposite. In a pre-<em>Argersinger </em>situation, this court concluded in <em>Westberry </em>that appellant, who had been deprived of her driver\u2019s license and forced to pay several fines for various traffic violations, was not entitled to bring a petition for habeas corpus. However, the rationale of that decision was simply that appellant was not \u201cin custody\u201d at the time of the filing, and <em>that the </em>\u201ccollateral consequences\u201d analysis of Carafas v. LaVallee, <em>supra, </em>did not create the requisite \u201ccustody\u201d to maintain appellant\u2019s habeas corpus petition. In the instant case Matthews was indisputably \u201cin custody\u201d at the time his petition was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b771-12\">COLEMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AuY\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">I think -the disposition of this case is controlled by our prior decisions in Taylor v. United States, 1969, 410 F.2d 392 and Wade v. Carsley, 1970, 433 F.2d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The <em>Taylor </em>case is brief and to the point. I quote it in toto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-15\">\u201cOn June 16, 1967, the appellant, a practicing attorney, was fined $500.00 by the District Court upon adjudication of guilty of contempt of court for failure to appear as counsel in a scheduled criminal trial after being retained as counsel. The sentence provided that in lieu of payment of the fine the respondent stand committed for a period of five days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-16\">\u201cThe appellant paid the $500.00 fine in question to the Clerk on the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the fine was imposed. On July 17, 1967, he filed his notice of appeal to this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4S\">\u201cPointing out that the sentence of the court was fully executed by the payment of the fine, the appellee has moved for a dismissal of the appeal as moot. We find that the appellee\u2019s motion is well taken. We have no power to decide moot questions and we cannot give advisory opinions which cannot in any way affect the rights of litigants. We therefore do not reach the merits of this controversy. The controlling cases are St. Pierre v. United States, 319 U.S. 41, 63 S.Ct. 910, 87 L.Ed. 1199 (1948) ; Murrell v. United States, 5 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 267, cert. den. 358 U.S. 841, 79 S.Ct. 65, 3 L.Ed.2d 76; Tessmer v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 306, 307; United States v. Lee, 5 Cir., 404 F.2d 68 [November 15, 1968].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\u201cThe appeal is \u201cDismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">What we said in Wade v. Carsley is similarly terse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cCase No. 27,953, Wade v. Carsley, is moot. Wade\u2019s additional imprisonment for inability to pay a $500.00 fine was fully served before this suit was brought initially. Wade pled guilty in state court to the offense of breach of the peace and was sentenced. She does not here attack the plea of guilty or the right of the court to impose sentence. She attacks only the length of the sentence imposed, i. e., the additional six months served for inability to pay the fine. The application of <em>Williams </em>[Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586] will not invalidate the conviction marked against Wade\u2019s record and there is simply no other relief available to Wade at this time. We obviously cannot turn back the clock. Neither can we find any collateral consequences that arise here from a fully-served sentence for inability to pay a fine. Wade\u2019s misdemeanor conviction has not caused her to lose the right to vote, to hold public office to join a union, or to engage in a particular business, as was the case in Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968). No. 27,953 is accordingly dismissed for mootness.\u201d 433 F.2d at 70.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Both these cases were decided after the Supreme Court decided Carafas v. LaVallee.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">The facts of this <em>traffic case </em>were that while he was a \u201cjail trusty\u201d Matthews was twice arrested for driving without a license and for making an improper start (running a stop sign). He pleaded guilty to the charges, but without counsel. This is now the case before us for habeas corpus review, although Matthews has long since paid his fine and been released from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The majority says that Matthews\u2019 driver\u2019s license has been placed in a \u201cprecarious position\u201d and that this constitutes a substantial collateral consequence. I look upon this with considerable skepticism because Matthews had no driver\u2019s license when arrested and thus had no license to lose. Even more convincing, to me, is that the point system apparently applies only to those who have driver\u2019s licenses. See 13 Florida Statutes Annotated, Motor Vehicles, \u00a7 322.27. Moreover, twelve points are required for a thirty day suspension, and an improper start conviction costs only three points. Of course, the statute provides no points for driving without a license. To cap it off, all points are automatically cancelled in thirty six months, so any points assessed against Matthews expired on January 20,1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">As to \u201crepercussions affecting his career and his reputation\u201d, if that be a substantial collateral consequence, [See Note, 9 A.L.R.3rd at 474], Matthews made no point of this in the District Court and there are no findings with reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">In any event, counsel for Matthews stated below that the purpose of the habeas corpus was to obtain a federal court order requiring that Matthews\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>fine be refunded. This, of course, the District Court could not order. If Matthews\u2019 original pleas of guilty are invalid, our jurisdiction in habeas corpus would be to direct his release, but ordinarily he could be tried anew, with counsel representing him. I doubt that Matthews wants that to happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">I agree with the District Court that Matthews\u2019 ease was moot and I would affirm the dismissal entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
