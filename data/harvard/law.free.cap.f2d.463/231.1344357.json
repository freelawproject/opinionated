Byrne, Sr., United States District Judge, Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-5\">BARNES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Appellant was convicted by a jury of one substantive count of smuggling an alien, one Filimon Garcia-Quesada, into this country from Mexico (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a) (1)), and acquitted of a conspiracy to smuggle aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">She now raises six alleged errors. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">1. <em>The reference to Agent Acuna's belief </em>that appellant\u2019s original statement was corroborated by Garcia-Quesada.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">This was permitted in evidence only for the limited purpose of indicating the state of mind of the witness when he went back to take the statement of the defendant. [R.T. p. 132] The objection as to relevancy was overruled. The jury was properly instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">2. <em>The release by the United States Magistrate of the smuggled alien </em>(permitting him to return to Mexico) over the objections of <em>both </em>defendant and the government. At the trial the defendant introduced the deposition of Garcia-Quesada as part of her case. [R.T. 214] It supported defendant\u2019s trial testimony, but contradicted both his and the defendant\u2019s earlier statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Appellant relies largely on the case of United States v. Mendez Rodriguez, 450 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1971) wherein the factual situation and the procedural questions raised were entirely different. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">3. <em>The references to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper argument </em>were not objected to at the trial, and were ordinary and usual jury arguments of a particularly mild type.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">4. <em>The verdicts were inconsistent. </em>Where there is proof of smuggling but no proof of a conspiracy with anyone else, the conviction on the substantive count may be valid, while the acquittal on the conspiracy to smuggle may be just as valid. That is the case here and there is no inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">5. <em>Error in Instructions. </em>The government\u2019s proposed instructions were not objected to. [R.T. p. 233] Certain homely examples were recited by the trial judge to explain his instructions. To not one of these to which appellant objects does her counsel cite a case (Appellant\u2019s Br., pp. 23-27) to support his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">6. <em>Opinion evidence as to Filimon\u2019s nationality was allowed in evidence in error. </em>The fact had already been established by Filimon\u2019s own testimony in the deposition introduced by appellant\u2019s own counsel at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">We find no error in any of appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">We affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
