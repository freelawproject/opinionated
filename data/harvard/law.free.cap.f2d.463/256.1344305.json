We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">\n<em>Facts and Prior Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-25\">In J. M. Huber Corp. v. Denman, 367 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. 1966), the court agreed with landowners that the particular oil and gas leases they executed required the gas-producer lessees to make royalty payments based on the current \u201cmarket price\u201d of the gas and not, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>lessees contended, on the actual price received by the producer for the gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The market price was not determined because the lessor\u2019s claim, for a royalty based on a market price of 23^ per mcf for gas run since 1946, presented \u201ca serious question whether a Court, state or federal, either initially or ultimately, may allow any amounts fixed by jury, court, or both as increased royalty payments without express prior approval of the Federal Power Commission if, as would these, the price thus fixed would exceed levels prescribed by the FPC.\u201d (367 F.2d at 110, 111.) The court took account of the public interest issues involved, and directed a reference by the parties to the FPC under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction for that agency to make an initial determination of its jurisdiction over rates to be paid for gas royalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Thereafter the royalty owner-landholders in <em>Huber </em>petitioned the FPC for a declaratory order disclaiming jurisdiction over royalty payments. Several lessee-producers involved in similar litigation filed complaints seeking an FPC determination that such royalties are subject to FPC jurisdiction. The FPC consolidated the dockets for hearing and decision. After prehearing conferences and evidentiary hearings, the presiding examiner concluded that the royalty owners are \u201cnatural gas companies as defined in the Natural Gas Act\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that a royalty owner seeking an increase in royalty payment must apply to the FPC beforehand. The Commission affirmed in part by a vote of 3-2. It declared that \u201cthe royalty provisions of oil and gas leases constitute sales of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce subject to all the provisions of the Natural Gas Act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, it held that the royalty owners need not make a separate filing to the FPC; the producers\u2019 filings were held to cover the royalty \u201csales\u201d adequately for regulatory purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Petitions to review have been filed both by Mobil Oil Corporation and other producers, and by royalty owners, and the cases have been consolidated. The royalty owners challenge the FPC\u2019s jurisdictional decision. The producers challenge the contemporaneous ruling, referred to in more detail hereafter, that the royalty owners are entitled to payment on the basis of their contract terms even when higher than the producer\u2019s effective rate, provided no breach of ceiling prices is wrought. We find error in the jurisdictional determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\n<em>Ruling That The FPC Does Not Have Jurisdiction Over The Payment of Royalties Under A Typical Natural Gas Lease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">In the FPC\u2019s order of June 23, 1967, setting a hearing on whether royalty payments to the lessors are subject to its jurisdiction, the Commission authorized receipt of evidence relating to general industry contracting practices with respect to gas leases so as to be more fully informed as to the general background of the problem and possible economic and legal consequences before making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Evidence was introduced on industry practice with respect to oil and gas lease agreements. The evidence is well summarized in the opinion of the Presiding Examiner. He focused on the development wherein the landowner has sometimes reserved a royalty of a percentage of the physical hydrocarbon recovered (for oil), has sometimes reserved a royalty of a percentage of the proceeds thereof, and has sometimes reserved a royalty of a percentage of the \u201cmarket value\u201d thereof at the well or in the field. This portion of the Examiner\u2019s opinion provides useful background information and is set forth in an Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">The Commission found one \u201cbasic fact\u201d determinative of the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>issue: \u201cthe effective retention by the royalty holders of a percentage interest in the gas sold in interstate commerce.\u201d This led to the conclusion \u201cthat if he has contracted to retain an economic interest in interstate sales, he has joined the other interest owners in such sales and he has become a seller of natural gas and therefore a natural gas company.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">For jurisdiction to attach under the Natural Gas Act, the royalty owners must be held engaged in a \u201csale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale.\u201d Section 2(6) of the Act defines a \u201cnatural gas company\u201d to mean \u201ca person engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or the sale in interstate commerce of such gas for resale.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1(b) of the Act provides, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cThe provisions of this act shall apply to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use, and to natural-gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale, but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas or to the local distribution of natural gas or to the facilities used for such distribution or to the production or gathering of natural gas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Whether landowners or other royalty owners are engaged in the \u201csale\u201d of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale within the meaning of \u00a7 1(b) of the Act must be determined by reference to the intention of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">The Act was passed in 1938 and it has not heretofore been construed to apply to ordinary lessors. While inaction is not controlling on intent, the widespread assumption and acquiescence therein, including administrative and legislative acquiescence, extending over such a great period of time is not lightly to be brushed aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">The intention of Congress cannot be conclusively determined by reference to concepts and classifications under state law decisions normally disposing of \u201cprivate\u201d controversies. United Gas Improvement Co. v. Continental Oil Co., [the Rayne Field case] 381 U.S. 392, 400, 85 S.Ct. 1517, 14 L.Ed.2d 466 (1965).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-19\">It must ultimately be ascertained in the light of regulatory purpose and objective. But as a point of departure we may properly begin with the presumption that Congress, like other legislatures, has in mind the ordinary, usual, and natural sense of a word like \u201csale.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This canon is given reinforcement for this term because \u201csale\u201d was not one of the terms for which Congress provided an express or supplemental definition in \u00a7 2 (\u201cDefinitions\u201d) of the Natural Gas Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">We have no need to pursue the intricacies of oil-and-gas law, or to take note of the way in which state law concepts vary in describing the interests created by oil and gas leases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It suffices for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>this case that generally the royalty owner is not considered, either in common parlance or in conceptions of state law decisions, to be engaged in any \u201csale\u201d of gas.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As to state law we refer to Judge Brown\u2019s discussion in <em>Huber.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The lease terms give the lessee all possessory interests in gas produced during the life of the lease, including full right of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The general understanding of lack of any \u201csale\u201d by the royalty owner, an understanding rooted in state law concepts, is underscored by the opinion in Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U.S. 103, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77 L.Ed. 199 (1932) decided only a few years before passage of the Natural Gas Act. While that opinion interprets a tax statute, there is pertinence in Justice Stone\u2019s discussion of the lack of incidents of a \u201csale\u201d by the royalty owner, both in technical terms and common understanding. See 287 U.S. at 107, 53 S. Ct. at 75:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">[T]he statute speaks of a \u201csale,\u201d and these leases would not generally be described as a \u201csale\u201d of the mineral content of the soil, using the term either in its technical sense or as it is commonly understood. Nor would the payments made by lessee to lessor generally be denominated the purchase price of the oil and gas. By virtue of the lease, the lessee acquires the privilege of exploiting the land for the production of oil and gas for a prescribed period; he may explore, drill, and produce oil and gas, if found. Such operations with respect to a mine have been said to resemble a manufacturing business carried on by the use of the soil, to which the passing of title of the minerals is but an incident, rather than a sale of the land or of any interest in it or in its mineral content. Stratton\u2019s Independence v. Howbert, 231 U.S. 399, 414, 415 [34 S.Ct. 136, 58 L.Ed. 285]; see Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., 242 U.S. 503, 521 [37 S.Ct. 201, 61 L.Ed. 460].<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">The Court referred to its rule of longstanding, that \u201cpayments by lessees to lessors under mining leases were not a conversion of capital, as upon a sale of capital assets, but were income to the lessor, like payments of rent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108, 53 S.Ct. at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">The FPC\u2019s opinion stated \u201cit would be senseless to attempt to determine what is a natural gas company and what is a sale on the basis of Hornbook definitions or local decisions not applicable to the Natural Gas Act. . . . For purposes of the Act, a \u2018natural gas company\u2019 is engaged in \u2018the sale in interstate commerce of [natural] gas for resale\u2019 but whether his operations would be classified as a \u2018sale\u2019 under private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>law is not determinative, U.G.I. v. Continental Oil Co., 381 U.S. 392 [85 S.Ct. 1517, 14 L.Ed.2d 466].\u201d (R. 5041).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In UGI v. Continental Oil Co., <em>supra, </em>referred to as the <em>Rayne Field </em>case, the Supreme Court extended FPC jurisdiction over sales of certain leases, although the Act addresses itself, in terms, to sales of gas. Sound analysis of that case requires development of its background.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347 U.S. 672, 74 S.Ct. 794, 98 L.Ed. 1035 (1954), the Court held that FPC had jurisdiction over \u201cwell-head\u201d sales of natural gas by independent producers to interstate pipeline companies for resale in interstate commerce. As the <em>Phillips </em>opinion made clear (347 U.S. at 677, 74 S.Ct. at 796) the producers admitted \u201cas they must\u201d that they were engaged in \u201cthe sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale\u201d and hence came within the basic coverage of \u00a7 1(b). The issue was whether the sales of an independent producer were excluded from regulation by the ultimate, and negative, clause of \u00a7 1(b) excluding \u201cthe \u2018production or gathering of natural gas.\u2019 \" The Court rejected the contention of exclusion, in view of the Act\u2019s text and legislative history, including notably the Federal effort to plug the \u201cgap\u201d in regulation of the natural gas industry created by decisions prohibiting state regulation of interstate commerce aspects. The Court found \u201ca congressional intent to give the Commission jurisdiction over the rates of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce, whether by a pipeline company or not and whether occurring before, during, or after transmission by an interstate pipeline company.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Rayne Field, </em>an interstate pipeline company made arrangements to buy the producers\u2019 leasehold interests in the lands in which the natural gas was located, instead of buying the gas produced directly. The gas reserves in Rayne Field were proven and the field was substantially developed. The Court noted \u201cThe provisions of the lease-sale agreements were such that they were very close in economic effect to conventional sales of natural gas.\u201d (381 U.S. at 396, 85 S.Ct. at 1520). The Court concluded (p. 401, 85 S.Ct. at 1522) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">\u201cThe sales of leases here involved were, in most respects, equivalent to conventional sales of natural gas which unquestionably would be subject to Commission jurisdiction under Phillips Petroleum Co. v. State of Wisconsin, 347 U.S. 672. [74 S.Ct. 794, 98 L.Ed. 1035] . . . [I]t is perfectly clear that the sales of these leases in Rayne Field, a proven and substantially developed field, accomplished the transfer of large amounts of natural gas to an interstate pipeline company for resale in other States. That is the significant and determinative economic fact. To ignore it would substantially undercut <em>Phillips. . </em>. . \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">It is in this context, of a transaction that was in form a lease of reserves but in economic impact the equivalent of \u201cconventional sales of natural gas\u201d that the Court, in upholding FPC jurisdiction to avoid \u201cgaps\u201d in the regulatory framework, stated (381 U.S. at 400, 85 S.Ct. at 1522):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-15\">\u201cA regulatory statute such as the Natural Gas Act would be hamstrung if it were tied down to technical concepts of local law.\u201d <em>Rayne Field, supra, </em>381 U.S. at 400, 85 S.Ct. at 1522.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkY\">These opinions were written with full awareness of the significance, in commercial and regulatory terms, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>sales of gas by independent producers to interstate pipeline companies. In establishing a Congressional intent to regulate those sales the Court began, in <em>Phillips </em>with what were plainly and admittedly \u201csales in interstate commerce of natural gas.\u201d This was fortified when <em>Rayne Field </em>extended coverage to producers\u2019 sale of their leases to interstate pipelines, for that extension was on the ground that these lease transfers were the equivalent \u201cin economic effect to the concept of conventional sales\u201d and such conclusion was required so as not to open gaps in Federal regulation. In both cases the Court did not undercut, it rather underlined, the need for a jurisdictional foundation in \u201csales in interstate commerce\u201d- \u2014 plain and admitted in <em>Phillips, </em>and existing through economic equivalent in <em>Rayne Field.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">When we come to an ordinary lease by the landowner to the producer there is neither a \u201ccustomary\u201d sale in interstate commerce nor its equivalent in economic effect. Such a lease is a transaction that is itself customary and conventional, but one that precedes the \u201cconventional\u201d sales in interstate commerce with which Congress was concerned, indeed even precedes the \u201cproduction and gathering\u201d which \u00a7 1(b) visualized as preceding the sale in interstate commerce over which jurisdiction was being established.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Turning to the \u201csignificant and determinative economic facts,\u201d basically the significant fact for a sale in interstate commerce is interstate movement either by the seller, prior to or in connection with the sale, or by the purchaser, typically an interstate pipeline company, subsequent to or in connection with the sale. In the case of a typical oil and gas lease, there is no such interstate movement by either the transferor or transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In <em>Rayne Field, </em>the gas reserves were known and had been substantially developed by or in behalf of the lessees-producers. A gas lease, however, transfers only the right to explore, develop, and market if exploration is successful; no royalty is paid if no gas is discovered. In <em>Rayne Field </em>the lease-buyers were interstate pipeline companies \u2014 clearly \u201cnatural gas companies\u201d under the Act \u2014and it was known that the gas was destined for interstate commerce. As to leases of reserves from landowners to lessee-producers there is no knowledge when the lease is executed of the ultimate destination of any gas that might be discovered,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> no knowledge whether the gas, if discovered, will be sold either to an interstate pipeline or to any other customer that will move it across state lines. While the lease by the landowner provides for a royalty in the event of the discovery and sale of gas, typically he has no control over any incident of such sale either as to the quantity to be sold, the price to be paid, the identity of the purchaser or whether it shall be sold in interstate or intrastate commerce. To refer to the royalty owner as engaging in the sale is to depart from the common understanding of the words used, industry parlance, economic equivalent, or any other foundation hitherto considered a source for discerning Congressional intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The Commission\u2019s approach was this, that when a landowner executes a \u201cproceeds\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d lease \u201che has contracted to retain an economic interest in interstate sales by the producer,\u201d and \u201chas joined the other interest owners in such sales and he has become a seller of natural gas.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But an economic interest in the proceeds of a sale, unaccompanied by authority to determine the incidents of the sale, does not make one a seller. The developer of a shopping center does not become a seller of food because he leases to a supermarket on percentage rental terms. A patentee who licenses various manufacturers on a royalty per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>centage basis is not generally considered the seller of the articles. Nor does the lessor become a seller of an article merely because the article was produced on or from the land that he leased. An owner of farmland leased to a farming tenant does not become a seller of produce raised because his rent may be a fraction of the price received for the crops. An owner of a mine leased to an operator does not become a seller of the ore produced because the stipulated compensation for the lease is a fixed fraction of the price received for the ore produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">If the statutory use of \"seller\u201d or \u201csale\u201d of natural gas in interstate commerce is referable to the meaning of these words in ordinary usage, or as likely understood by Congress, the FPC\u2019s ruling is clearly unsound. We do not think a different result warranted or mandated on the ground that the purpose of the Act is to protect the ultimate beneficiaries against exploitation by natural gas companies. That was indeed the objective of Congress, see FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591, 610, 64 S.Ct. 281, 88 L.Ed. 333 (1944). The FPC is to be commended for attempting to further that objective, but it is not sufficient justification upon which to base an expansion of the Act to activities clearly not within its terms. Congress did not give the FPC carte blanche to take whatever action it might consider appropriate in furtherance of this purpose. The FPC is limited by the provision establishing its jurisdiction, and we do not find in that provision, rooted as it is in a sale in interstate commerce, any basis for reaching out to cover the landowner\u2019s lease or its royalty payments. We think it too far removed from the interstate sale. When there is a sale of gas to a pipeline in interstate commerce, the FPC will of course have the jurisdiction and the responsibility to exercise control in the interest of the ultimate consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We turn to a consideration of what may be implied as to jurisdiction from the requirement of effective Federal regulation of producers and pipelines. Of course for leases executed after this controversy took shape, it seems probable that producers will be able, and indeed have been able, to insist on leases drafted so as to avoid recurrence of the present controversies.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">More significantly, the FPC\u2019s jurisdiction over rates chargeable by a producer includes authority to determine the reasonableness of costs incurred, even though these are not subject to direct FPC control, and that establishes authority to review royalty payments, or drilling rig rentals, or any other element of the producer\u2019s cost of service.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, passim and at pp. 824-825, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312 (1968). And we interject that this is the only approach that even the FPC has in mind for handling other elements of the total payments made by producers to landowners, <em>e. g., </em>the cash bonus, delay rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Intervenor Shell Oil Co. put forward the contention that jurisdiction should rest on the burden created on interstate commerce by allowing royalty payments in excess of producers\u2019 rates. The Commission opinion stated that \u201csince we find that an actual sale for resale by an interest owner does take place under the royalty provisions of the mineral leases the argument of Shell and Tenneco constitute an additional, but not the basic, reason for asserting jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">If an interpretative ruling stretching the Act as written to cover leases by landowners is to be countenanced on the score of necessity, and we do not say this will be possible, the underlying record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>must be more comprehensive and profound \u2014 broader and deeper, as it were\u2014 than the findings and analysis presented on this record. The case as it comes before us, with a cursory \u201cmakeweight\u201d reference to a possible theory of economic burden, is in a wholly different posture from that presented in United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S. 157, 88 S.Ct. 1994, 20 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1968), which held CATV systems to be within the Federal Communications Act\u2019s coverage of \u201call interstate and foreign communication by wire or radio\u201d, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a), and relied significantly on the FPC\u2019s finding that achievement of its regulatory purposes would be placed in jeopardy by the unregulated growth of CATV.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">As to the problem of economic burden and higher prices for consumers, although the record contains evidence and findings concerning different forms of industry contracts (see Appendix) we have no findings concerning the extent or significance of market price contracts. And the FPC\u2019s opinion gives no concrete indication of whether, in what circumstances, or to what extent, there may be an economically meaningful problem of \u201cmarket prices\u201d in excess of ceilings. In the <em>Huber </em>case the judgment entitling the royalty owners to pursue their claim made no determination of amounts of recovery. Apparently such litigation may come to involve substantial sums even if pursued so as to recover royalties based on ceilings higher than filed rates. This we infer from the fact that Mobil Oil and other producers have appealed from the ruling of the FPC that although the royalty owners\u2019 filing obligations are met by virtue of the filings made by the producers,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a royalty owner is not limited to the rate filed by the producer and may enforce his contract as calling for a higher rate if permitted by the Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The record simply does not focus on what may be involved in the possibility of recovery of royalty calculated on the basis of \u201cmarket prices\u201d higher than ceilings.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Questions have come to our mind concerning the FPC\u2019s theory as to how the royalty owners may be shoe-horned into the existing regulations, and we at least have it in mind that if the FPC\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over royalty owners were sustained its regulatory problems might be more complicated than it has assumed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To avoid any misunderstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ding we interject that we have not been made uneasy by the contentions the producers have presented to us,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> for we see no theoretical impediment to producers\u2019 being held on the basis of a contract to a royalty payment related to a base higher than the producers\u2019 filed rate. United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332, 76 S.Ct. 373, 100 L.Ed. 373 (1956). The producers make no claim, even obliquely, that they face financial or other difficulties requiring relief from contractual obligations, see Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 822, 88 S.Ct. 1344, 20 L.Ed.2d 312, and insofar as general equitable considerations are concerned we suppose the FPC may have had in mind that its area ceilings are predicated on an assumption of royalty costs at a conventional fraction of ceiling prices (see note 17, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">In any event we are not persuaded that the maintenance in either state or Federal courts of contract (lease) controversies between royalty owners and lessees will undercut the Federal regulatory system. The controversies hitherto delineated by the private parties have focused on the producers\u2019 assertion of the need of the royalty owners to abide by the producers\u2019 filings and receipts. The problem of relationship of market prices to producer ceilings presents different considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Without purporting to rule on the matter in any way, we can certainly visualize the possibility that a court confronted with a contention of entitlement to a market price basis higher than the producer\u2019s ceiling would consider it to run counter to the intention of the parties, unless there is something to rebut the fair presumption that they contemplated interstate movement and market prices compatible therewith.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court might also consider that this result would be in furtherance of the general principle against application of contracts so as to contravene public policy, whether or not the result would be in violation of supremacy clause doctrine prohibiting state rules or decisions that require a regulated company to take action inconsistent with Federal regulation, see Northern Natural Gas Co. v. State Corp. Comm, of Kansas, 372 U.S. 84, 83 S.Ct. 646, 9 L.Ed.2d 601 (1963).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The court handling the contract clause could avoid becoming embroiled in the ascertainment of the Federal ceiling by referring that issue to the FPC, invoking the broad and supple doctrine of primary jurisdiction, see J. M. Huber Corp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>v. Denman, <em>supra,, </em>367 F.2d at 111; <em>cf. </em>Brawner Building Inc. v. Shehyn, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 442 F.2d 847 (1971).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This would bring the FPC into the dispute between the royalty owner and the lessee-producer, but the FPC would be acting properly, on reference from the courts, rather than unduly stretching its jurisdiction and the statutory mandate to extend to royalty owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\n<em>Special Circumstances of Denman \u201cR\u201d Lease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">While Commissioners Carver and O\u2019Connor wrote strong dissenting opinions from the assertion of jurisdiction over the royalty interest in most gas leases, they agreed with the majority that variations in the Denman \u201cR\u201d lease rendered its royalties jurisdictional. Commissioner Carver found that the circumstances show \u201cthe lessor clearly identified his interests with those of the lessee-producer. The privity found lacking in the usual and normal leasing arrangement is supplied under these particular facts.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We do not consider this matter, as we do not know whether a majority of the FPC would have taken the same approach initially, or would wish to do so in the wake of our decision.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACG\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Excerpts from Opinion of Presiding Examiner, see 42 FPC at 190,191:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">Every provision in a lease is open to negotiation, but not every provision is actually negotiated in every transaction. The most common items of negotiation between the lessor and prospective lessee are the amount of cash bonus, the amount of delay rental, the length of the primary term, and the royalty fraction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">The cash bonus is the cash consideration paid by the lessee to the lessor for granting the mineral lease and may range from a minimal amount to a substantial sum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">The delayed rental is a payment for the privilege of deferring the commencement of drilling operations or the commencement of production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">The primary term is the term of the lease during which the lease may be continued in effect without drilling operations or production by the payment of a delayed rental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">* -X XXX X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">The landowner may create by grant or by reservation various estates in land. The interest we are concerned with here is called royalty and is created by a reservation in an oil and gas lease in which the landowner grants to the lessee certain rights and privileges, such as, to explore, drill and produce oil and gas, and in the same instrument reserves to himself, free from the expenses of production, a share in the oil and gas produced or the proceeds thereof. Williams and Meyers, Oil and Gas Law, Manual of Terms, 342; Volume 1, secs. 202, 202.1, 202.3. This share is usually expressed in terms of a fraction of the production. The fraction is generally one-eighth and in some instances a larger amount. The royalty interest as to oil produced is usually taken in kind, but as to gas produced, while the right to take in kind may be reserved, it is seldom done as a practical matter due to its characteristics and the lack of market other than the pipeline to which the lessee delivers the gas. The common provisions in the leases for accounting to the lessor for royalty as to the gas produced provide for the lessee to pay the lessor for his fractional part the market value in the field or a percentage of ,the proceeds derived from the sale of the gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-17\">In addition to the lessor\u2019s royalty interest, there is also another type of royalty interest called an overriding royalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>interest. Such interest is most commonly created when a lessee enters into a farm-out agreement with another producer. In such an agreement the lessee retains either an undivided interest in the leases or an override interest. Both the lessor royalty interest and the overriding royalty interest as a contractual matter receive their respective interests free of any of the costs of production, except for taxes. The working interest owners generally share the expenses of development and operation of the property, proportionate to their interest in the property. Although the overriding royalty interest owner is a bare holder of a right to receive proceeds, the lessor royalty interest owner is protected by certain implied covenants with respect to the development of a lease and the marketing of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In Docket No. RI67-113, there are involved three leases as to mineral rights in Texas, designated as the \u201cR Lease\u201d entered into on June 2, 1936, the \u201cB Lease\u201d and the \u201cM Lease\u201d on January 22, 1926. The royalty provision insofar as necessary for consideration here, under the \u201cR Lease\u201d which accounts for 93 percent of the production of gas provides for Huber, the lessee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">To pay the Lessors monthly for one-fourth (i/4) of the gas produced at the mouth of the well from any gas well, where gas only is found, four cents per one thousand cubic feet for the first ten years of this contract, and thereafter, the market price of such gas but in no event shall the price be computed at less than four cents per one thousand cubic feet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Under the B and M Leases the royalty clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">To pay the Lessor the equal one-eighths part of the market value in the field for the gas from each well where gas only is found, while the same is being used off the premises, * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The type of lease varies as to mineral rights in Kansas under Docket Nos. RI67-114, RI67-310 and RI67-400. The royalty clauses in the leases here necessary for consideration generally provide for the lessee to pay the lessor on gas marketed from each well where gas only is found one-eighth of the proceeds if sold at the well, or if marketed by the lessee off the premises, then one-eighth of its market value at the well. Some of the leases set forth only a proceeds type royalty clause and others only a market type royalty clause. Regardless of the type of royalty clause set forth in the leases involved in these proceedings, the landowners claim entitlement at the market price.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">.

The FPC stated (42 FPC at 173, R. 5043) that by operation of the law the jurisdictional royalty interest has in effect been covered by the producer filing since 1954, on the same theory as a producer\u2019s filing covers the interests of all non-signatory parties, and should continue to be so covered. Therefore the FPC concluded no amendment or extension of existing rules was needed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. \u201cWhere he [the royalty owner] has contracted for the market price or value it would appear that he has contracted for a payment equal to the maximum rate for such gas which could have been received [by the producer] as fixed under the law by this Commission.

We are puzzled by the FPC conception that royalty owners are, and have since 1954 been, natural gas companies under the Act, limited under \u00a7 4 of the Act to their rates as filed, even though they have not made filings and indeed could not have made filings, and by the corollary conception that the royalty owners are deemed covered by the filings made by the producers yet may now sue the producers for a higher basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">It is one thing to consider a nonsignatory represented by the signatory when they have a common interest. But as we see it the reason why the FPC is asserting jurisdiction over the royalty owner is to handle the situation of a controversy between royalty owner and producer, and we are at least uneasy with an analysis whereby the royalty owner makes his filing by incorporation within the producer\u2019s filing and yet is free to seek a higher basis. If the royalty owners should recover on a basis of a market value higher than the rate that was filed by producers, it is difficult to discern how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>they may be deemed in compliance with the obligation of natural gas companies, for any sale subject to the jurisdiction of the FPC, to charge only the rate that is set forth in a public schedule filed with the Commision. It seems clear that the provisions of the regulations do not fit lessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We are also uneasy with the FPC\u2019s assumption that there can be no controversy between the landowner and the producer if an area ceiling is established. As we understand it the royalty owner was not, and apparently could not have been, a party to the area rate proceeding. If this is correct, it is not easy to see on what basis he can be held concluded by what has been established in such a proceeding, whether on conventional findings, or following a settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">.
