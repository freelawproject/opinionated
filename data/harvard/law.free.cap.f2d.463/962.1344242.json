DAVIES, Senior District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">The record reveals that on December 27, 1966, Ruth Smith slipped and fell on an ice and snow covered sidewalk in front of her apartment located at 2022 Maryland Avenue, N.E., District of Columbia. She commenced an action against her landlord and the District of Columbia to recover damages for the injuries sustained as a result of the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-16\">At trial the landlord\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was granted, while that of the District was denied and the matter submitted to a jury. A verdict was returned in favor of Ruth Smith and the District\u2019s subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-17\">Claiming that it was entitled to a directed verdict by the trial court the District appealed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to which was presented two issues: (1) failure of Ruth Smith to prove compliance with the D.C.Code 1967, \u00a7 12-309, and (2) failure of Ruth Smith to present sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Agreeing with the District\u2019s first contention and thus finding it unnecessary to consider the second, the Court of Appeals, 271 A.2d 786, held that Ruth Smith had failed to comply with the plain mandatory language of \u00a7 12-309 and that the District was, therefore, entitled to a directed verdict. Ruth Smith\u2019s petition to appeal from that judgment was granted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Section 12-309 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-5\">\u201cAn action may not be maintained against the District of Columbia for unliquidated damages to person or property unless, within six months after the injury or damage was sustained, the claimant, his agent, or attorney has given notice in writing to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia of the approximate time, place, cause, and circumstances of the injury or damage. <em>A report in writing by the Metropolitan Police Department, in regular course of duty, is a sufficient notice under this section.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aey\">It is undisputed that the only written notice received by the District was a letter by a claims representative for Hartford Insurance Group, the landlord\u2019s insurer, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-6\">\u201cApril 5, 1967</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-7\">\u201cGovernment of the District of Columbia</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-8\">Office of the Corporation Counsel District Building</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV_\">14th &amp; E Streets, N.

E. The above claimant resides at this address in apartment No. 12 and alleges that on Dec. 27, 1966, at about 9:00 A.M. she was injured in a fall on the public sidewalk in front of this address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-15\">\u201cMrs. Smith is represented by Attorney Solomon L. Margolis with offices at 1025 Vermont Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.

Washington, D. C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-20\">While Hartford\u2019s letter complies with the statute to the extent that it identifies the claimant, the approximate time of the injury, the approximate place of the injury, the approximate cause of the injury and the approximate circumstances of the injury, it is the District\u2019s contention that since the notice did not emanate from <em>the claimant, his agent or attorney </em>as required by the statute, it was fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-21\">This Court seeks, as it has in the past,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to effectuate the purpose of the statute, that is, to give the District timely information concerning a claim against it so that it may adequately prepare its defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-22\">In Hirshfeld v. District of Columbia, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 71, 254 F.2d 774 (1958), it was held that under certain limited circumstances effective no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>tice could be given, without specific delegation, to an official other than the one set forth in the statute. Similarly, effective notice can be given, without specific delegation, by one not the claimant, his agent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or attorney where, as here, it is obvious that a claim is being made which sets forth the claimant\u2019s identity and the approximate time, place, cause and circumstances of the injury or damage and the District can show no resulting prejudice. To hold otherwise would be giving effect to an overly strict and technical reading of the statute while ignoring its legislative history and the purpose of its enactment. \u201cWe see no prejudice to the District, but a substantial compliance with the statute and an effectuation of the purposes of Congress.\u201d Hirshfeld v. District of Columbia, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Reversed and remanded to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for its consideration of the District\u2019s contention that it was entitled to a directed verdict for failure of Ruth Smith to present sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the District.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">.
