The critical factual issue is whether the employees permanently quit their employment, as the respondent contends, or whether their departure was only temporary and in the nature of a strike. The Board determined that the latter was the case, and we cannot say that the determination was without substantial evidentiary support. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s Application for the enforcement of its Order is GRANTED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-16\">. AVe reject the respondent\u2019s suggestion that our conclusion should be withheld pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in N.L.R.B. v. International Van Lines, 448 F.2d 905 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. granted, 405 U.S. 953, 92 S.Ct. 1177, 31 L.Ed.2d 230 (1972). AVe do not view that case as presenting the same issue as that which is here involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
