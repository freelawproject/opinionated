There is no provision in the Act for administrative determination whether a particular drug is a \u201cnew drug\u201d nor for any right of appeal from any such determination. The FDA sometimes offers to render \u201cinformal advice\u201d as to whether it considers a product a \u201cnew drug\u201d but it uniformly designates such opinion \u201cadvice\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the responsibility for determining whether its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>product is a \u201cnew drug\u201d requiring premarketing clearance by FDA, rests on the manufacturer, who must act at its peril.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If it makes an incorrect determination and seeks to market without FDA clearance a drug meeting the definition of a \u201cnew drug\u201d, it lays itself open to drastic judicial procedures that may be invoked by FDA, i. e.: The product may be seized in an <em>in rem </em>action instituted by the Government;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> its sale may be enjoined in an action begun by the Government;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in addition, the manufacturer may be subjected to criminal action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> All these remedies must be prosecuted in the District Court and the role of the Secretary is that of plaintiff or prosecutor. The Act thus establishes two forums for the regulation of drugs: One is administrative and deals with the procedures for securing pre-marketing clearances for the statutorily defined \u201cnew drug\u201d, with right of appeal from a denial of approval, or withdrawal of a previous approval, to the District Court, later changed to the Court of Appeals; the other is judicial and is intended to make effective and give strength to the requirement that \u201cnew drugs\u201d be cleared as safe before marketing by providing the Government with certain potent judicial remedies, <em>available exclusively in the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Under the 1938 Act, a new drug was one \u201cnot generally recognized, among experts * * * as safe for use.\u201d The Amendments added \u201ceffectiveness\u201d as well as \u201csafety\u201d to the definition. Simply stated, the change effected by the Amendments was that, whereas prior to the 1962 Amendments a drug which was generally recognized as safe was not a \u201cnew drug\u201d, the Amendments defined a drug as \u201cnew\u201d if it were not generally recognized as both safe <em>and effective. </em>Furthermore, they replaced the provision for automatic approvals of applications not disapproved within a fixed time with a requirement of a positive act of approval on the part of FDA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They proceeded to provide that the Secretary must find as a basis for clearance of a new drug not only safety but \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of effectiveness, \u201cconsisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved.\u201d The applicability of these amendments, including the revised definition of \u201cnew drug\u201d to drugs already marketed, either under previously issued NDAs, or as \u201cold drugs\u201d requiring no FDA approval, was carefully spelt out in the Amendments and certain \u201cgrandfather rights\u201d were granted. For all previously NDA\u2019d drugs, the Amendments conferred a grace period of two years after the effective date of the Amendments within which to prepare evidence to satisfy the new requirement of efficacy added by the revised definition of \u201cnew drug\u201d; during that \u201ctransitional\u201d period no revocation or withdrawal of approval because of a lack of substantial evidence of efficacy of such drugs was permitted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For a drug, however, which on the day prior to the enactment of the Amendments was (1) being \u201ccommercially used or sold in the United States,\u201d (2) \u201cwas not a new drug as defined by\u201d the preAmendment statute and (3) \u201cwas not covered by an effective (new drug application), * ' *\u201d \u201con the day immediately preceding the enactment date\u201d of the Amendments, there was a permanent exemption from the efficacy provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of the Amendments so long as the drug\u2019s labeling remained the same.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In summary, these provisions required that, \u201cThose drugs which had obtained effective NDAs must be proven efficacious after two years; those which had not need never be proven efficacious so long as they had become safe prior- to the 1962 Amendments.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">The \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d set forth in Section 107(c) (4) simply continues for the products satisfying its criteria the pre-1962 definition of a \u201cnew drug\u201d. Its effect is to assure that a drug which was generally recognized by qualified experts as safe for the purposes recommended for its use on October 9, 1962, need not be NDA\u2019d as <em>effective </em>under the new requirements for the issuance of an NDA as a \u201cnew drug\u201d. But any drug, whether requiring an NDA or not, whether a \u201cnew drug\u201d or an \u201cold drug\u201d, is subject to the misbranding provisions of the Act and may be proceeded against on that basis. A false claim of either safety or effectiveness constitutes misbranding, rendering a drug subject to both civil and criminal penalties. United States v. Article of Drug Labeled Decholin (D.C.Mich.1967) 264 F.Supp. 473, 482-483; United States v. Lanpar Company (D.C.Tex.1968) 293 F.Supp. 147, 153-154.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, in United States v. Guardian Chemical Corporation (2d Cir. 1969), 410 F.2d 157, a drug manufacturer was acquitted of a charge of marketing a \u201cnew drug\u201d without securing an NDA, but was convicted under a separate count of the indictment charging misbranding. \u201cThus\u201d, as one commentator has aptly stated, \u201cthe amplications of the FDA\u2019s authority (as granted by the 1962 Amendments) is (was) not due to the absence of power to proceed against ineffective drugs, but rather to authorize the exercise of that power at the initial stage, that is, <em>before </em>marketing, and also to shift the burden of proof to the applicant.\u201d Jurow, The Effect on the Pharmaceutical Industry of the \u201cEffectiveness\u201d Provisions of the 1962 Drug Amendments, 19 Food, Drug, Cosmetic Law Journal, 110, at p. 116 (1964).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The plaintiffs, manufacturers of a prescription drug containing pentylenetetrazol and nicotinic acid, claim the protection of the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d included in Section 107(c) (4) for their products and that contention represents the substantive issue in this case. It is undisputed that plaintiffs had marketed their product commercially for many years prior to and on October 9, 1962,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> without an NDA under the claim that it was not a \u201cnew drug\u201d within the definition of the Act, and therefore required no NDA. Such claim was supported, it is asserted, both by previous informal advice of the Secretary and by the general recognition of the safety of such product by \u201cexperts qualified by scientific training and experience\u201d to make such evaluation. The defendants, the Secretary of HEW and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in their brief, concede that \u201cOver the years since 1938\u201d and until 1968, the Food and Drug Administration had given the opinion that certain pentylenetetrazol combinations similar to those of the appellants were not \u201cnew drugs.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the District Court observed in its opinion that there was \u201cno contention (by the FDA) that the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 drugs in treatment of the symptoms of senility in geriatric patients is in any way harmful to them, either directly or indirectly by causing the disuse of better drugs.\u201d On this basis, the plaintiffs contended that they met exactly the criteria established for exemption from the requirements of general recognition by qualified experts of the effectiveness of their products as provided in the permanent grandfather section of the 1962 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Prior to the filing of this action, however, the defendants withdrew their advice that products such as those distributed by the plaintiffs were \u201cold drugs\u201d and contended that such products did not qualify for exemption under the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d, Section 107(c) (4). The basis for this contention was the claim (1) that these drugs were not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe as of the effective date of the Amendments of 1962 and (2) that they wez\u2019e \u201cme-too\u201d drugs, whose marketability without FDA clearance depended in turn on the NDA\u2019s granted the basic drug, and for that reason must be regarded as drugs covered by an effective NDA on the effective date of the Amendments.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Faced with this threat, the plaintiffs began this action for a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>claratory judgment sustaining their right to exemption from proof of the effectiveness of their product and for injunctive relief awaiting the disposition of their claim for exemption. The defendants directed against the complaint a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, which, in essence, (1) asserted primary jursidiction in the Secretary to determine whether the products of the plaintiffs met the requirements for exemption under Section 107(e) (4), particularly whether they were \u201cnew drugs\u201d, requiring pre-marketing approval under the Act, (2) denied the propriety of a declaratory judgment action, and (3) claimed that the products of the plaintiffs were \u201cnew drugs\u201d which did not qualify for exemption under the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The District Court sustained the right of the plaintiffs to maintain a suit for a declaratory judgment and the jurisdiction of the Court in such action to determine judicially whether the products of the plaintiffs were \u201cnew drugs\u201d, on the effective date of the Amendments, and whether they were or were not entitled to the benefits of the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However,' \u2014 and this is the nub of the controversy between the parties on this appeal \u2014 it concluded that the Secretary had concurrent jurisdiction * to determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 products were \u201cnew drugs\u201d, requiring pre-marketing clearance, and that, because of the greater expertise of the Secretary in the field, it deferred to the Secretary\u2019s assumed jurisdiction to determine whether the drugs of the plaintiffs came within the exemption provided by the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d. It enjoined any action against the plaintiffs and their products until the plaintiffs had been accorded a hearing before the Secretary on the issue of the qualifications of these drugs for protection under the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d. It is the conclusion of concurrent jurisdiction in the Secretary and deference to that assumed concurrent jurisdiction from which the plaintiffs have prosecuted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The defendants, on the other hand, have not cross-appealed and have accordingly acquiesced in the decision of the District Court that the action is properly maintainable as a declaratory judgment proceeding under Section 2201, 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>U.S.C. and that the District Court has jurisdiction over the substantive issue in this case, i. e., whether plaintiffs\u2019 products are \u201cnew drugs\u201d, as defined in the Act. The question in the case is thus whether the Secretary has concurrent jurisdiction to determine whether a drug is a \u201cnew drug\u201d under the Act or whether that issue is cognizable only in the District Court. Contrary to the conclusion of the District Court, we conclude that the Act confers no such jurisdiction on the Secretary, and, therefore is no basis for any deference by that Court to the concurrent jurisdiction of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"> The FDA has neither primary jurisdiction, as the defendants argue, nor concurrent jurisdiction, as the District Court concluded, to adjudicate whether a product is an old or a new drug. It may, in its prosecutorial role, reach a conclusion that a product being marketed is a \u201cnew drug\u201d requiring pre-marketing approval; but that opinion is not adjudicatory, it is only the basis on which the FDA, as the prosecutor or initiator of either a seizure or injunctive action in the District Court, may invoke the jurisdiction of that Court to determine, among other issues, whether the drug challenged is a \u201cnew drug\u201d. There is manifestly no provision in the Act for an administrative proceeding before the Secretary to compel the filing of a \u201cnew drug\u201d application or to halt the marketing of a drug for which there is no approval, by the Secretary. It is not without significance that, so far as the official reports reflect, the Secretary has never attempted directly to exercise such jurisdiction. The only occasions on which he has sought to assert such jurisdiction has been as an element in his defense to a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, when FDA undertook its new responsibilities under the 1962 Amendments, it sought merely to review \u201cthe efficacy of <em>all new drugs that had been cleared, </em>for safety only, between 1938 and October 10, 1962\u201d (Italics added) and enlisted the services of the National Academy of Sciences\u2014 National Research Council for this limited task.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It did not assert the right to review, or assume the burden of reviewing, for efficacy, drugs such as those involved here, which had been commercially marketed on the basis of a general recognition of safety without an effective NDA as of the effective date of the 1962 Amendments. It, thus, recognized that its adjudicatory rights extended merely to the approval, or the withdrawal of approval,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of a drug embraced in a \u201cnew drug\u201d application that had been approved. This confirms the conclusion that the halting of the marketing of a drug, for which there is no NDA, may not be by administrative action but must be by an injunction or an <em>in rent </em>seizure proceeding, in which the Secretary appears, not in a judicial but in a prosecutorial role.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Those are the procedures prescribed and available to the Government under the Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Secretary, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>is true, has offered to provide \u201cadvice\u201d on whether a product meets the qualification of an old drug but he categorizes his action in such instances as merely \u201cadvice\u201d and makes no claim of finality therefor. Nor is there, as we have already observed, any provision for judicial review of such \u201cadvice\u201d.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The only adjudicatory right vested by the Act in the Secretary relates to approval, or withdrawal of an approval, of a \u201cnew drug\u201d application.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> That this is so follows from-the limitations placed by the Act on judicial review of the decisions of the Secretary. The Secretary himself asserted, shortly after the enactment of the 1962 Amendments, in Turkel v. Food and Drug Administration, Dept. of H. E. W., <em>supra, </em>334 F.2d at p. 845, that the Act \u201cgrants a right to appeal only from an order of the Food and Drug Administration approving or disapproving a New Drug Application\u201d. In keeping with the Secretary\u2019s contention as to the extent of his adjudicatory powers, the Court in that case held that the right of appeal from an order of the Secretary \u201capplies only to an order of the Secretary refusing or withdrawing approval of an application for sale and distribution of a new drug\u201d (334 F.2d at pp. 845-846). It is not to be assumed that the Act confers an adjudicatory right on the Secretary from which no judicial review, however limited, is provided or allowed. Yet this is the unusual situation that would be presented if the Secretary were held to have jurisdiction to adjudicate whether a drug meets the statutory criteria of a \u201cnew drug\u201d.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The District Court, in finding concurrent jurisdiction, held that \u201cThis grant of authority to approve or withhold approval of new drug application, * * * necessarily implies authority for F.D.A. to determine the threshold question of whether the article involved is a drug which required an approved new drug application for lawful interstate shipment.\u201d This reasoning assumes that an application for approval by the Secretary under the Act poses as its initial issue whether the product is a new drug. No such issue is posed by the application. The very filing of the application is a concession and recognition by the applicant-manufacturer that the article is a \u201cnew drug\u201d; otherwise, there would be no reason to file the application. As a matter of fact, in the prescribed form of application, the applicant describes his product as \u201ca new drug\u201d. 21 C.F.R. 130.4. The applicant makes the determination whether his product is a \u201cnew drug\u201d and whether he must file for pre-marketing clearance by the Secretary. And when filed, the application puts in issue only one question: Is the article safe and effective? That and that alone is the issue to be considered by the Secretary in connection with an application for approval filed by a manufacturer under Section 355(d), 21 U.S.C. That issue is quite different from that presented when there is an issue whether a drug fits the statutory definition of \u201cnew drug\u201d in the Act. The criterion for ascertaining whether a product is within the statutory definition of \u201cnew drug\u201d under the Act is not safety and effectiveness <em>per se, </em>which, as we have observed, is the issue before the Secretary in connection with application for approval of a \u201cnew drug\u201d, but \u201cwhether the government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the \u2018drug is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling thereof.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That is an issue that must be and is resolved, sometimes with, and at other times without a jury, in practically every injunctive, seizure, or criminal proceeding under the Act. See, for instance, United States v. Articles of Drug Labeled \u201cQuick-O-Ver\u201d, supra; United States v. 41 Cases, More or Less (5th Cir. 1970) 420 F.2d 1126, 1128; United States v. Article of Drug, etc., <em>supra, </em>415 F.2d 390 at p. 392; United States v. Article . . . Consist. of 216 Carton (2d Cir. 1969) 409 F.2d 734, 742; United States Article Consisting of 36 Boxes, etc., <em>supra, </em>284 F.Supp. at p. 113; see, also, United States v. Article of Drug, etc. (D.C.Md. 1971) 331 F.Supp. 912, 915-917. That was one of the issues resolved in the declaratory action of Lemmon Pharmaeal Co. v. Richardson, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is manifestly a justiciable issue and the plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment on that issue by the Court, which alone has the jurisdiction to resolve it. In the absence of any statutory review proceedings within which they may assert their claim of exemption, the plaintiffs are not to be compelled to proceed at their peril, subject to the possibility of both civil and criminal penalties, but are entitled to seek relief by way of a declaratory judgment action. The District Court should accordingly have retained jurisdiction and proceeded to determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 drugs met the criteria for exemption under Section 107(c) (4). We deem it premature for us to consider at this stage whether plaintiffs\u2019 products meet such criteria. That issue was not developed in the record before, or ruled on by, the District Court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Upon remand, the issue can be considered by the Court in the light of the record that may be made by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">Remanded, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">. There was an earlier Food and Drug Act of 1906. 34 Stat. 768 (1906). It did not provide for any pre-marketing review of the safety of drugs. The sulfanilamide episode in 1938 prompted the enactment of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of that year to replace the earlier Act and to provide, <em>inter alia, </em>for such pre-marketing review of \u201cnew drugs\u201d. See C. W. Dunn, Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act \u2014 A Statement of Its Legislative Record, pp. 1316-27 (1938).

It is, of course, axiomatic that such opinions or advice can create no estoppel against the Government. AMP Incorporated v. Gardner (D.C.N.Y.1967) 275 F.Supp. 410, 412, n. 1, aff. 389 F.2d 825, cert. den. 393 U.S. 825, 89 S.Ct. 86, 21 L.Ed.2d 95, reh. den. 395 U.S. 917, 89 S.Ct. 1738, 23 L.Ed.2d 231. The most that can bo claimed for such opinions is that they lend color and good faith to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. FDA not only lias the right but is obligated to change its opinion if it learns its prior position was erroneous. United States v. 60 28-Capsule Bottles, More or Less, etc. (D.C.N.J.1962) 211 F.Supp. 207, 215, aff. 325 F.2d 513.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b458-12\">. The defendants assert that three \u201cnew drug\u201d applications filed by other manufacturers and earlier approved by the FDA covered drugs similar in every particular to those marketed by the plaintiffs. Proceedings for withdrawal of the approval of such \u201cnew drugs\u201d had been begun by FDA in advance of the filing of this action. In fact, such proceedings to a large extent prompted this action. It is the contention of the defendants that the withdrawal of what they describe as \u201cthe primary NDAs\u201d operates to remove the marketability from what they assert are the \u201cme-toos\u201d or non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>NDA\u2019d drugs which are similar to other drugs which have secured effective NDAs. The plaintiffs deny that their drugs are like those previously NDA\u2019d. They argue that those NDA\u2019d products, unlike theirs, are intravenously administered or are a compound containing, in addition to the components of plaintiffs\u2019 drugs, reserpine. Such changes in formula or method of administering vitiated any claim by their manufacturers that they were marketing an old drug and required an approval as a new drug. The plaintiffs assert their drugs are not subject to any such disability. These, however, are questions of fact not relevant to the simple question of jurisdiction presented by this appeal and may be inquired into on remand. Even if the products of the plaintiffs be deemed \u201cme-too\u201d drugs (i. e., simply \u201ca copy of a pioneer drug which preceded it on the market\u201d), it is by no means clear that they do not \u201cmeet the requirements for section 107 (c) (4) protection\u201d and the argument of the Government to the contrary has been described as \u201clacking in merit.\u201d See, Note, Drug Efficacy and the 1962 Drug Amendments, 60 Georgetown Law Journal, 185 at pp. 203-207 (1971) ; Hagan, Grandfather Protection under the Drug Amendments of 1962, 19 Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, 119 at p. 125 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\">.
