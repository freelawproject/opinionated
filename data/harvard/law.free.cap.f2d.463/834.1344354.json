Seeking a change to 1320 kc, it challenges the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s denial of its petition for a waiver of the \u201cfreeze\u201d which the Commission has imposed, pending new rule-making proceedings, on the acceptance of applications for new standard broadcast stations or for major changes in the frequency allocations of existing ones. We affirm the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">In September, 1968, appellant filed an application to change its frequency from 1600 kc to 1300 kc. The Commission accepted this application despite the freeze, since it conflicted with another application filed prior to the freeze and was therefore within an exception to it. However, in an attempt to avoid the comparative hearing necessitated by the competing applications for 1300 kc, appellant sought to change its request from 1300 kc to 1320 kc, and petitioned the Commission for leave to amend its application. Since there was no prior conflicting application for 1320 kc, the amended petition could not be accepted under an exception to the freeze, and appellant therefore requested a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">In support of the waiver request, appellant alleged that (1) it was unable to achieve adequate coverage at 1600 kc, due to poor ground conductivity and the inability of many radios to tune to that frequency, (2) its inadequate coverage had resulted in financial \u201chard going,\u201d (3) the proposal for 1320 kc would eliminate the need for a comparative hearing on its request for 1300 kc, and would therefore save time and expense for both the Commission and appellant, and (4) the amendment would not violate the basic purpose of the freeze, since it did not contemplate \u201cany additional load whatever, electrical or economic, on the AM broadcasting spectrum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">By a memorandum opinion and order released on September 14, 1970, the Commission denied appellant\u2019s request for a waiver and rejected the proposed amendment. Noting appellant\u2019s arguments,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it disposed of them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-13\">Policy considerations underlying the current \u201cfreeze\u201d criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>are so important that the Commission has granted waivers only under extraordinary circumstances, which we do not find in this case. <em>While 1600 kilocycles may not be the most desirable frequency on the standard broadcast band from a signal propagation standpoint, </em>we note that KNCB\u2019s coverage of Vivian is quite adequate according to the Commission's rules, <em>and any undesirable aspects of the channel due to its location on the upper end of the band are certainly not considered so significant as to justify the extraordinary relief requested. </em>Moreover, we find no merit in the argument that acceptance of the amendment is justified on the basis that it would preclude a . hearing. . [M]ost likely, publication of the amended application on a new \u201ccutoff\u201d list, as required by section l.~ 571(c), could well result in the receipt of conflicting applications which would require still another hearing proceeding, (emphasis added) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Appellant attacks the Commission\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, it alleges that \u201cthe failure of the Commission\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order to even allude to appellant\u2019s arguments in its Petition for Waiver suggests either that the Commissioners were unaware of appellant\u2019s contentions, or failed to understand them.\u201d In light of the paragraph of the opinion excerpted in footnote 1, however, we think that this claim of error is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Second, appellant argues that since the Commission did not make findings with respect to the factual issues raised by the petition, it must be presumed to have acted \u201carbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d This argument, however, misconstrues the rationale of the Commission\u2019s decision. The Commission has determined that waiver of the freeze, the validity of which appellant does not challenge, is justified \u201conly under extraordinary circumstances.\u201d A fair reading of its opinion, in light of the emphasized portion of the passage excerpted above, is that the Commissioners assumed appellant\u2019s alleged hardships to exist, but nevertheless found them insufficient to overcome the policy objectives behind the freeze. Thus, they recognized that there were \u201cundesirable aspects\u201d to broadcasting at 1600 kc in appellant\u2019s area, but held that they were not \u201cso significant as to justify the extraordinary relief requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">In short, the Commission ruled that the policy objectives behind the freeze outweigh the hardships caused stations such as appellant\u2019s. We see no reason to overturn this policy decision, especially since appellant is not left without an avenue for relief. The rejection of the proposed amendment leaves intact appellant\u2019s original proposal for a transfer to 1300 kc;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the comparative hearing necessitated by competing applications for that frequency will afford appellant an opportunity to air its claims of inadequate coverage and financial hardship. In fact, given the Commission\u2019s opinion that acceptance of the amendment would likely result in a hearing on competing applications for 1320 kc, we fail to see how its rejection makes it less likely that appellant will obtain timely relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-17\">. The Commission stated :</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">In support of its request for waiver, North Caddo claims that due to the use of 1600 kilocycles, it has not only experienced serious coverage problems, but that its service is reduced by the inability of many radios to tune to its location on the extreme upper end of the broadcast band. Also, it is alleged that the licensee has had \u201chard going\u201d in achieving a financially successful station, and that acceptance of amendment will eliminate a hearing proceeding ... on 1300 kilocycles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-7\">. Although this paragraph does not specifically refer to the fourth of the arguments noted above (the asserted inapplicability of the policies behind the freeze), a rejection of that argument is implicit in the Commission\u2019s point that, if the amendment were accepted for filing, the receipt of conflicting applications would likely result. If one of the competing applications were to prevail, then there <em>would </em>be an \u201cadditional load ... on the AM broadcasting spectrum.\u2019\u2019 A new station would broadcast at 1320 kc, while appellant would continue to broadcast at 1600 kc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-13\">. Appellant does not claim that 1300 kc is less desirable, in terms of coverage, than 1320 kc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
