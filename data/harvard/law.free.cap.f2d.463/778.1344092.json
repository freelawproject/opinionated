No. 10. The Board has filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160. The Board found that Texas Gulf discharged four employees (Brownshadel, Breaux, Sherman and Munoz) in violation of sections 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act. It concluded that although the company was justified in laying off a certain number of employees for economic reasons, it laid off the four employees in question because of their union activities. The issues before us are particularly factual and turn on the credibility of witnesses who testified below. There is substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole to support the Board\u2019s findings. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160; Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Rel. Bd., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); N. L. R. B. v. Hertz Corporation, 5 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">In addition to ordering the Company to post appropriate notices at the plant where the four employees worked, the Board ordered the Company to post the notices at other facilities within the particular division of the Company located in the same geographical area. The Board sought to eliminate any coercive impact at the other plants resulting from the unfair labor practice. The order is well within the Board\u2019s broad remedial authority. See National Labor Relations Board v. Lummus Co., 5 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 377; J. P. Stevens 6 Co., Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
