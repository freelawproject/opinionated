United States, 378 F.2d 433 (9th Cir. 1967) and the facts as presented in this ease meet the dictates of <em>Juvera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-17\">The granting of a motion for severance pursuant to Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overruled by this court without a showing of clear prejudice, which has not been shown to be the case here. Cortez v. United States, 405 F.2d 875 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-18\">The issue of the constitutionality of the Ninth Circuit rule that criminal defendants must admit the elements of a crime in order to avail themselves of the defense of entrapment, Wright v. United States, 391 F.2d 542 (9th Cir. 1968), is moot because the trial court gave an entrapment instruction to the jury and did not require appellants to conform to the rule as a condition of asserting the defense nor the giving of the entrapment instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-19\">The order of proof at trial is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned in the absence of prejudicial error and none has been shown in this case. Enriquez v. United States, 293 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-20\">Accordingly, it is the opinion of this court that the decision of the trial court should be, and the same hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
