The buildings were demolished by a tenant of the taxpayers under a 99-year lease, which permitted the tenant to destroy the buildings, but did not require their destruction. The lease did not require replacement of the buildings or any other compensation to the taxpayers for the destroyed buildings, the rent being the same before and after destruction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">This is the first time this question has been presented to this Circuit. In 1964 the Ninth Circuit decided the issue in favor of the taxpayer. Feldman v. Wood, 335 F.2d 264 (9th Cir. 1964). Recently the Seventh Circuit decided the issue in favor of the government. Landerman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 454 F.2d 338 (7th Cir. 1971). More recently the Eighth Circuit in a split decision has followed <em>Landerman </em>and decided the issue in favor of the government in Foltz v. United States, 458 F.2d 600 (8th Cir. 1972). We affirm District Judge William A. McRae\u2019s reliance on the <em>Feldman </em>case for the reasons stated in his opinion and in the <em>Feldman </em>opinion itself. Hightower v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>United States, 346 F.Supp. 707 (M.D. Fla.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">We consider the rationale in the <em>Feldman </em>case and the dissent in the <em>Foltz </em>case to be more persuasive than the difficult reasoning in the <em>Landerman </em>case. The regulations are clear and not inconsistent with the Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The taxpayers were entitled to rely on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">This decision is not inconsistent with our holding in Holder v. United States, 444 F.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1971). There we held that the taxpayer was not entitled to a loss because the lease required the tenant to replace the demolished building with other buildings meeting certain specifications and value. Thus \u201cthey were compensated for their loss by the lessee\u2019s contractual duty to construct other improvements to be delivered to taxpayers at the termination of the lease.\u201d (p. 1300). There is no such contractual duty under the Hightower lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-14\">.

The amount of the loss shall be the adjusted basis of the buildings demolished increased by the net cost of demolition or decreased by the net proceeds from demolition.
