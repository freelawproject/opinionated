Sanders, filed his complaint on March 12, 1970, against John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc., a broker-dealer in securities, one of its registered representatives, and its directors and controlling persons. The complaint charged defendants with a scheme and artifice to defraud plaintiff and others in his class by selling to them short-term commercial paper issued by Winter &amp; Hirsch, Inc. but owned by Nuveen. Plaintiff\u2019s claim was based on the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a, Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, and the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-13\">On May 18, 1970, the defendants moved to strike certain allegations of the complaint and expressly attacked the class-action aspects of the complaint. They also challenged the jurisdiction of the court under the 1934 act on the ground that the short-term commercial paper involved was not a \u201csecurity.\u201d The district court denied the motion to strike on October 8, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">On October 19, 1970, the plaintiff served on defendants his motion, to be presented to the court on November 2, requesting that a notice be sent to the class represented by plaintiff as provided in Rule 23(c) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class suggested was \u201call persons who were purchasers of short-term commercial paper which was issued by Winter &amp; Hirsch, Incorporated, and sold by John Nuveen &amp; Co., Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-15\">On October 29, the First National Bank of Chicago and the Harris Trust and Savings Bank sought leave to intervene on their own behalf and \u201con behalf of certain creditors of Winter &amp; Hirsch, Incorporated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-16\">The motion to intervene stated that on March 11, 1970 (one day prior to the filing of plaintiff\u2019s suit), the creditors of Winter &amp; Hirsch had met and had elected an informal creditors\u2019 committee. The creditors\u2019 committee, working with the management of Winter &amp; Hirsch, had negotiated with Mercantile Financial Corp. a purchase agreement relating to substantially all of Winter &amp; Hirsch\u2019s loan receivables; the agreement required certain waivers by holders of long-term debt obligations. The motion also stated that the creditors\u2019 committee had developed a liquidating trust to become effective upon the execution and delivery of a \u201cConsent and Agreement\u201d by all the lenders of funds to Winter &amp; Hirsch, including plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-17\">At the same time that they sought to intervene, the two banks also moved that the district court enter an order pursuant to Rule 23(d) directing the plaintiff to execute a \u201cConsent and Agreement\u201d on a stipulation by all parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>that its execution would \u201cnot constitute a dismissal or compromise under Federal Rule 23(e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">The banks\u2019 motions were not accompanied by any pleadings in the Rule 7(a) sense of complaints or answers, or by documents seeking to adopt pleadings already on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel were notified by telephone the night before that the banks were going to appear before the district judge on October 29; counsel were given copies of the motions at 10 a. m. on the 29th as court convened. The court continued the matter to 1:45 p. m., at which time the plaintiff filed written objections to the motions. The court heard argument by the parties but no evidence in the afternoon, at which time the court requested the parties to attempt to agree on an order. The banks delivered a proposed form of order to plaintiff\u2019s counsel at 4 p. m. and advised them that they would reappear in court at 4:30. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied that they would need some time to read the proposed order and confer with their client. They appeared at the courtroom at 4:50 to learn that the judge had entered an order at 4:35 and left the bench. The order permitted the banks to intervene and directed the plaintiff to sign the stipulation and consent by 5 p. m. or the class aspects of the complaint would be stricken. The intervention was allowed on behalf of creditors including all members of the class which plaintiff sought to represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">The plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the October 29 order, which motion was denied on November 5, 1970. The court\u2019s reason was \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s expressed opposition to all members of the class by refusing to join in a compromise that all of them have agreed to enter into.\u201d On its own motion, the court found that \u201cthere may be a class described in the cause without counsel,\u201d whereby he ordered that \u201csaid cause . proceed as an individual complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">On November 17, 1970, the district judge certified pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) the questions (1) whether it was error to permit the banks to intervene, (2) whether it was error to find that the plaintiff did not represent the class and (3) whether it was error to strike the class aspects of the complaint. On the motion of defendants, the court on the following day amended its prior order denying defendants\u2019 motion to strike, to certify another question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b): whether the commercial paper upon which the complaint is predicated is a \u201csecurity\u201d as defined in section 3(a) (10) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-9\">This court granted leave to appeal on all four questions on December 21, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">We consider first the threshold question of whether a security under the 1934 act is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">Federal securities legislation enacted for the purpose of avoiding frauds is to be construed \u201cnot technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d S.E.C. v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 285, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">Particularly, the definition of a security \u201cembodies a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\u201d S.E.C. v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 299, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). \u201c[I]n searching for the meaning and scope of the word \u2018security\u2019 in the [Securities Exchange] Act [of 1934], form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 553, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-14\">The Supreme Court has sanctioned, in interpreting the definition of a security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>in the 1934 act, recourse to the definitions of security in the Securities Act of 1933 <em>(Tcherepnin </em>at 335-336, 338, 88 S. Ct. 548) and in the \u201ccompanion legislative enactments.\u201d Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 1456, 31 L.Ed.2d 741 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">An examination of the six basic federal securities acts is relevant and revealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">The Securities Act of 1933,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Trust Indenture Act of 1939,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Investment Company Act of 1940,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all define a security as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018security\u2019 means any note, . . . evidence of indebtedness, . . . investment contract, ... or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u2019 . . . . \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> definition differs slightly: \u201c \u2018Security\u2019 means any note, . . . investment contract, ... or, in general, any instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u2019 . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">In none of these five acts does there appear any language limiting in any way the broad definitions of \u201csecurity\u201d or of \u201cnote,\u201d \u201cevidence of indebtedness,\u201d \u201cinvestment contract\u201d or \u201cinstrument commonly known as a security.\u201d Thei\u2019efore <em>any </em>note, regardless <em>of </em>its nature, terms or conditions, is fully subject to whatever antifraud provisions are included in the five acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-17\">Only in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is there an exception to the broad definition of a security; it reads:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-18\">\u201cThe term \u2018security\u2019 means any note, . . . investment contract, . or in genex'al, any instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u2019; . but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker\u2019s acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-21\">Therefore only in the 1934 act is a note with a maturity not exceeding nine months withdrawn from the application of the antifraud provisions of the act, section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Since the same note is subject to the antifraud provisions of all the other securities acts, it becomes important to determine just what Congress intended to be exempt from the operation of the 1934 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-22\">Although all notes are subject to the antifraud provisions of the other acts, some of those acts exempt short-term commercial paper from registration or other requirements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiff urges that the meaning given to short-term obligations in other securities legislation, particularly the 1933 act, be applied to the definition found in the 1934 act. The 1933 act exempts from registra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>tion,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but not from antifraud sanctions,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[a]ny note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker\u2019s acceptance which arises out of a current transaction or the proceeds of which have been or are to be used for current transactions,\u201d and which has a maturity not exceeding nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">The Securities and Exchange Commission has interpreted the 1933 act\u2019s exemption of short-term commercial paper as embodying four <em>requirements:</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1169-6\">\u201cThe legislative history of the Act makes clear that section 3(a) (3) applies only to (1) prime quality negotiable commercial paper (2) of a type not ordinarily purchased by the general public, that is, (3) paper issued to facilitate well recognized types of current operational business requirements and (4) of a type eligible for discounting by Federal Reserve banks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Although no evidence has been heard in this case, the record shows that the commercial paper purchased by the plaintiff was dated January 30, 1970, and that \u201cWinter &amp; Hirsch was engaged in the business of making loans until in or about February 1970, when it advised its creditors of its precarious financial condition and ceased to make any further payments on any of its obligations for borrowed money.\u201d At that time it had assets of $12.5 million and liabilities of more than $36 million. Thus, because of the company\u2019s insolvency, it seems highly unlikely that the paper purchased by the plaintiff and members of his class is either prime quality or issued to facilitate current transactions or eligible for discounting by Federal Reserve banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-14\">The record further shows that the commercial paper purchased by the plaintiff was \u201cplaced through John Nuveen &amp; Co.\u201d and bought by 42 purchasers, including the plaintiff, in the aggregate face amount of $1,661,500. The paper was therefore obviously offered and sold to the general public; indeed, it was characterized in the issuer\u2019s financial statements as \u201cshort term open market\u201d paper.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The notes fail to meet any of the S.E.C.\u2019s four requirements for exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-15\">If, as the Supreme Court has admonished, \u201cform should be disregarded for substance\u201d and economic reality emphasized, it is reasonably clear that plaintiff and his class purchased the kind of \u201csecurity\u201d in regard to which the securities acts were intended to offer protection against fraud, misrepresentation and non-disclosure.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Five of those acts expressly did so. We believe Congress intended to protect against fraud the purchasers of securities such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>as those involved here under the 1934 act as well.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">The court in Anderson v. Francis I. duPont &amp; Co., 291 F.Supp. 705, 708-709 (D.Minn.1968), reached the same conclusion. Promissory notes of less than nine months\u2019 maturity were given in exchange for investments in defendant\u2019s commodities market scheme. The court held the 1934 act applicable to the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Our conclusion is further supported by Congress\u2019 characterization of short-term commercial paper in exempting it from certain provisions (but not anti-fraud provisions) of two of the other securities acts. Certain provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 do not apply to a note or draft with a maturity not exceeding nine months, provided that it \u201cis not part of a public offering\u201d and aggregates not more than 5 percent of the other securities of the company.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines \u201cshort-term paper\u201d as paper with a maturity not exceeding nine months \u201cand such other classes of <em>securities, of a commercial rather than investment character, </em>as the Commission may designate by rules and regulations.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">In other words, when Congress spoke of notes with a maturity not exceeding nine months, it meant commercial paper, not investment securities.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When a prospective borrower approaches a bank for a loan and gives his note in consideration for it, the bank has purchased commercial paper. But a person who seeks to invest his money and receives a note in return for it has not purchased commercial paper in the usual sense. He has purchased a security investment. <em>Cf. </em>City National Bank v. Vanderboom, 290 F.Supp. 592, 608 (W.D.Ark.1968), aff\u2019d, 422 F.2d 221 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 905, 90 S.Ct. 2196, 26 L.Ed.2d 560 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-14\">Although further evidence may be necessary to determine the issue, the allegations of the complaint together with additional information in the record on appeal indicate a strong possibility that Nuveen\u2019s arrangements with the plaintiff and with the members of plaintiff\u2019s class also constitute investment contracts. Apparently, Nuveen purchased the Winter &amp; Hirsch paper at a discount and resold it to the 42 purchasers at a different rate of discount in order to realize a profit. At least in the plaintiff\u2019s case (and evidence would be necessary to determine in how many other cases), the use of plaintiff\u2019s funds for the short-term notes was a temporary arrangement \u201cin lieu of tax exempt municipal bonds and . . . the money so invested would be available for purchase of tax exempt bonds at an early date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfX\">It seems likely that the arrangements between Nuveen and plaintiff constituted \u201cthe placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment.\u201d S.E.C. v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1102, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). <em>See also </em>1 Loss, Securities Regulation 489-91 (1961); Anderson v. Francis I. duPont &amp; Co., 291 F.Supp. 705, 708 (D.Minn.1968).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-17\">However, in view of our interpretation that the instruments involved here are securities since they are notes not covered by the exemption, we do not need to determine whether as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>of fact the arrangements between the parties also constituted investment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">The remaining three issues certified for determination can be considered together: whether the allowance of the banks\u2019 intervention was proper and whether the district court erred in finding that the plaintiff did not represent the class and in striking the class allegations from the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">The record discloses that the two intervening banks are holders of \u201cshort term senior debt\u201d as banks extending lines of credit, First National Bank of Chicago in the amount of $1,750,000 and Harris Trust and Savings Bank in the amount of $1,000,000. As such, neither bank would come within the class suggested by the plaintiff, namely, all persons who were purchasers of short-term commercial paper which was issued by Winter &amp; Hirsch and sold by John Nuveen &amp; Co. The plaintiff has alleged in addition, and the banks have not denied, that each bank is also the holder or owner of substantial amounts of long-term debt of Winter &amp; Hirsch, which is described in the liquidating trust agreement as \u201cjunior subordinated debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">Since it is acknowledged by all parties that Winter &amp; Hirsch is insolvent and unable to pay its debts as they mature, it is reasonably certain that the creditors will eventually receive less than the amounts which they are owed. It follows that any advantage obtained by one class of creditors will cause other classes of creditors to be disadvantaged. The two intervening banks, as members of at least two classes of creditors other than the class represented by the plaintiff, are <em>per se </em>antagonistic to the plaintiff\u2019s class. It is obvious that the banks can neither represent the plaintiff\u2019s class nor strengthen the representation of plaintiff\u2019s class by intervening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-15\">The portions of Rule 23(d) pertaining to intervention in class actions are intended to strengthen the adequacy of representation of the class.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Advisory Committee\u2019s Note to Rule 23 emphasizes, \u201cSubdivision (d) is concerned with the fair and efficient conduct of the action\u201d through supplementary notice to members of the class and by strengthening the class where necessary.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-16\">Since the district judge did not provide for any notice to the plaintiff class, it was clearly improper for him' to permit the two banks, with their conflicting and antagonistic interests, \u201cto intervene herein, on their own behalf and on behalf of those creditors of Winter &amp; Hirsch, Incorporated set forth in Exhibit B to the Motion to Intervene.\u201d That exhibit listed, among others, the members of plaintiff\u2019s suggested class: all persons who were purchasers of short-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>term commercial paper which was issued by Winter &amp; Hirsch and sold by Nuveen. The effect of such intervention was to weaken the plaintiff class and possibly to strip from it advantages which it held against other classes of creditors, including the classes of which the two intervening banks are members. The attempt to include some protective language in the intervention order did not alter the fact that once antagonistic parties purported to represent the class, the plaintiff\u2019s cause virtually collapsed. No intervention could be accomplished without prior full and fair notice to the members of plaintiff\u2019s class and, of course, such notice could not be given until the court determined whether plaintiff\u2019s suggested class fulfilled the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) (3).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">If in fact the banks had procured the \u201cconsent and agreement\u201d of all the members of plaintiff\u2019s class other than plaintiff, such consent and agreement was meaningless within the context of this cause of action unless procured after full and fair notice and disclosure to the members of the class, under the supervision of the court, of their possible rights in this cause, of the conflicting interests of other classes of creditors, including the banks, and of the surrender of certain rights by consenting and agreeing to the liquidating trust arrangement. The purpose of the mandatory notice and disclosure requirements of Rule 23(c) (2) is to advise all class members of their rights and privileges under the close supervision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">This is not to say that the banks could not intervene under any circumstances. Once the court has determined whether the plaintiff\u2019s suggested class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) (3), and once members are notified under Rule 23(c) (2), the banks may seek to intervene under Rule 24(a) (2). They would petition not as representatives of the plaintiff\u2019s class, but as applicants who claim \u201can interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and [are] so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede [their] ability to protect that interest. . . . \u201d At that point, the court may determine that the members of plaintiff\u2019s class are entitled to supplementary notice under Rule 23(d) (2) <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If the banks seek to intervene under those circumstances, Rule 24(c) and sound judicial administration require that their motion to intervene \u201cshall state the grounds therefor and shall be accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.\u201d The pleading should be one of those described in Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(a) so that all parties understand the position, claims and nature of relief sought by the prospective intervenors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">Once the due process requirements of Rule 23 are satisfied by full and fair notice to all members of any class or classes or subclass or subclasses determined by the court, the court may then \u201cmake appropriate orders . . . determining the course of proceedings.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-14\">The basic error in these proceedings was permitting two members of antagonistic classes to intervene on behalf of another (plaintiff\u2019s) class and not only to purport to take over plaintiff\u2019s case but in effect to introduce an entirely different cause of action in which all parties but plaintiff had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>\u201cconsented\u201d without notice and disclosure under court supervision of their rights and options. The error was compounded by attempting to coerce the plaintiff to add his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">In No. 71-1163 we reverse the orders which allow intervention, which find the plaintiff not representative of the class alleged in the complaint and which strike allegations in the complaint as to class action. In No. 71-1164, we affirm the order denying the motion to strike certain allegations of the complaint, because the commercial paper on which the plaintiff predicated his claim for relief is a \u201csecurity\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">.
