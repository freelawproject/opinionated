The object of the suit is to recover one hundred acres of land in Burnet county\u2014a part of the William Slaughter league. The case in the petition is that the land had been originally purchased by plaintiff and the consideration therefor paid by him, but the conveyance from the vendor was made to W. B.

T. Moore, a witness for defendants, testified \u201cthat he, in. company with W. B. Boss, H. A. Burns, one of the Boss boys and Lewis Thomas, about the latter part of July, 187?, rode over all of the lands offered for sale by Lewis Thomas. After we had been around the lands Boss asked Lewis Thomas his price. He told him six thousand seven hundred dollars. Boss said the price was too high, and called -Thomas\u2019s attention to the fact that the fences around the farm were rotten, and to the scarcity of rail timber. Thomas replied that should be no objection to a trade, that he would put in a one hundred acre tract, well timbered (the land in controversy), and twenty acres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>in the Mormon cedar brake. Boss then replied, \u201cWell if you will do that, you may consider the trade closed.\u201d We then agreed to go to Burnet the next day to fix up deeds. After the trade was closed, Boss, Burns, Thomas and witness rode over the Gavin lands. \u201cBurns seemed well pleased with the same and made no objection to it in my hearing, or while I was present. On the next day I came to Burnet, where I met Boss, Burns, Gavin and Thomas. Thomas and Boss went to Bob Cates\u2019s office, and there the deed was drawn from Thomas to W. B. Boss. H. A. Burns came in the office of Oates several times during the preparation of the deed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">B. H. Cavin testified \u201cthat a short time after the sale from Thomas to Boss he had a conversation with Thomas in which he (Thomas) said that he had to give Boss one hundred acres of the Slaughter survey to get him to close the trade with him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">Defendants then proved by N.

B. Ross, deceased, on the twenty-seventh day of September, 1886, to recover one hundred acres of land, part of the William Slaughter league. It was alleged in the petition that the land was purchased by plaintiff in error, and the consideration therefor furnished by him, but that the conveyance was made to W. B. Ross without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent, and through the fraud and misrepresentation of W. B. Ross.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Defendants in error answered by general denial, not guilty, and special defenses not necessary to mention here.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">The case was tried by a jury, October 12, 1886, resulting in a verdict and judgment for the defendants. The court charged the jury as follows: \u201cThe questions of fact which you are to determine by your verdict are: First. Was Burns induced to purchase Gavin\u2019s land in consideration of Thomas\u2019s promise to convey bim (Burns) the one hundred acres of land in dispute? Second. Did Boss, at the time or prior to the execution of the deed to him, agree to convey the land to Burns? If you are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>satisfied to answer both of these questions in the affirmative, from a preponderance of creditable evidence in the case, you will find for plaintiff; if not so satisfied, for defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The plaintiff requested the following special instruction, which was refused by the court: \u201cThe promise, if any, made by W. B. Ross at the time of receiving the deeds to the land in controversy, will entitle plaintiff to recover, whether such promise was an express or implied promise; and such promise will be implied if the jury believe that plaintiff furnished the consideration for the purchase of said land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Under proper assignment of error, it is contended that the court erred in the charge given and in refusing the special charge requested, and this is the only question involved in this appeal. If the consideration for the land was actually furnished by plaintiff, a trust resulted in his favor at the time the legal title was conveyed to Boss, and his right to recover the legal title and possession of the land was not dependent upon an express agreement upon the part of Boss to convey the land to him. By implication, equity charges Boss with the duties and liabilities arising upon such an express agreement. (McKamey v. Thorp, 61 Texas, 648; <em>2 </em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, secs. 981, 1031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We think the court below erred in the second paragraph of the charge given, and in refusing the special instruction requested by plaintiff, for which the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.
