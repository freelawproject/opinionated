Plaintiff requested judgment for partition so as to allow him access to the well and an equitable half of the land in value, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The defendant excepted to the petition: (1) Because the alleged contract was not in writing; (2) because the contract was against public policy; and (3) because it sought to control the homestead rights of defendant, under a contract not executed by the wife of defendant. A general denial was also pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Upon trial the jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff and responded to several special issues submitted in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The fourth, fifth and sixth special findings are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">4. We find they are entitled to one hundred and sixty acres each. 5. We find the, division line as to leave well equally upon land of each, also their improvements respectively. 6.

(10 Texas, 340, Wilkins v. Gilkerson; 18 Texas, 16, Miller v. Roberts; 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Texas, 132, Smock v. Tandy; 45 Texas, 423, Gibbons v. Bell. We know of no case holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">As to the homestead rights, they attach to the land as ac: quired subject to any burden, legal or equitable, upon the land at the time of its occupancy as a homestead. The contract did not need the assent of the wife, and the homestead rights were subordinate to Howard\u2019s rights to an equitable partition. (51 Texas, 150, Clements v. Lacy.) We do not think such contract would be an obstacle to the acquisition by these parties of homesteads covering the three hundred and twenty acres under the pre-emption laws which require the applicant to make affidavit to his claim as being in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Neither the pleadings nor evidence, however, authorize the judgment as entered. The decree should have followed the verdict, adjudging to the plaintiff his one hundred and sixty acres to be so surveyed as to give common access to the well to both parties and dividing the three hundred and twenty .acres to the best advantage to the parties, giving to each, if possible, his improvements. Commissioners should have been appointed to make the partition in accordance with the decree. Upon their report the division lines could be ascertained and confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The judgment is reversed and remanded, the judgment to be entered in accordance with the verdict and proceedings to be taken as here indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Opinion delivered June 15, 1888.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
