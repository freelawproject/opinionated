Adjoining the Jung homestead lies a tract of land owned by the Roman Catholic church, the legal title being in Neraz, the bishop. Jung and his two sons joined as plaintiffs, sought to enjoin Neraz from establishing a cemetery upon the land, complaining that the burial of the dead in that place would poison the wells upon the land of complainants, would pollute the atmosphere and otherwise injure their homestead as a residence. <em>Held:</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-9\">(1) The bishop was the proper party defendant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-10\">(3) That the sons of the owner in fee, residing upon their father\u2019s homestead, were properly joined as plaintiffs; and,</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-11\">(3) That the allegations as to the threatened and permanent injury, etc., were grounds for equitable relief by injunction.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b412-12\">Appeal from Comal.

The percolation or filtration of noxious matter through the soil, so as to corrupt the water of a well on the adjoining premises or the soil of said premises, is a nuisance which the courts will abate.

An act which pollutes and corrupts the air so as to produce a real and sensible damage to the occupiers of the adjoining premises constitutes a nuisance. (Burdett v. Swenson, 17 Texas, 489; Waco v.

(Lake View v. Letz, 44 Ill., 81; Lake View v. Rose Hill Cemetery, 70 Ill., 191; same case, 22 Am., 74; Cooley on Torts, 600; Monk v. Packard, 71 Maine, 309; same case, 36 Am., 315; New Orleans v.

(Wood on Nuisances, secs. 780, 818, 826; 1 High on Injunctions, sec. 793; 14 Ala,, 135; Page v. Townsend, 5 Sim., 395.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b414-7\">Acker, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">Appellants brought this suit against appellee to prevent him from establishing a cemetery upon a plot of four acres of land \u201csituated in front of, contiguous and so near to appellants\u2019 residences that a cemetery there would render the homes of appellants unfit for habitation or the purposes for which they were designed, and thereby destroy their value and usefulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The writ of injunction was issued on the twenty-sixth of. March, 1886, on the fiat of Hon. A. W. Dillard, \u201cspecial district judge for Uvalde county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The petition alleges that the title to the land on which appellants\u2019 residences are situated, is in Jacob Jung; that he is the father of the other appellants, who live in houses upon his land; that Jacob Jung is old and infirm, and has had his home upon said land for more than forty years; that on said premises are several wells of water used and valued for drinking and household purposes, and also ground much lower than the surface of the tract upon which appellee proposes to establish the cemetery, and in consequence of the contiguous and peculiar situations of said lands, the rain water which falls upon the tract proposed to be used for a cemetery soaks into and' through the soil thereof, and through plaintiffs\u2019 soil into said wells, and likewise the subterranean streams supplying said wells flow through the soil of the proposed cemetery lands; that the interment of dead bodies in said.land would infect, poison and injure said wells and the use of the low grounds, and, further, injure plaintiffs\u2019 health by the foul odors arising from the decomposition of said bodies; that appellee, as bishop and trustee of the Catholic church, owns the land upon which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>proposes to locate said cemetery; that the establishment of the cemetery and burying dead bodies therein would render appellants\u2019 homes uninhabitable, and drive appellants from them. Appellee answered by general demurrer and special demurrer as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">1. That it does not appear from the petition that the defendant is a person or corporation capable of suing or being sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><em>2. </em>That there is a misjoinder of parties plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">3. That there is no equity in the bill. The demurrers were sustained and judgment rendered for appellee. It is contended by appellants that the court erred in sustaining the demurrers, and in determining this question all of the material allegations \u2022 of the petition must be taken as proved.</p>\n<p id=\"A_-\">We think it sufficiently appears that appellee is a person capable of suing and being sued, and therefore conclude that the court erred in sustaining the first special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">Each and all of the appellants were in possession of the land and premises to be injuriously affected by the proposed location of the cemetery, residing thereon and using water from the wells situated thereon. Each had the right to the enjoyment of his possession, and all had a common interest in protecting their possessions against an act that \u201cworketh hurt, inconvenience or damage\u201d thereto. We think there was no misjoinder of parties plaintiff, and that the court erred in sustaining the second special exception. (Barbour on Parties, 511; Dicey on Parties, 357; Ingraham v. Dunnell, 5 Metc., 125; High on Injunctions, sec. 793.) Without here reciting the allegations of the petition, we deem it sufficient to say that, in our opinion, the petition states a case that entitles appellants to the relief sought. (Burdett v. Swenson, 17 Texas, 501; Ellison v. Commissioners, 5 Johns\u2019s Eq., N. C., 57; Clark v. Lawrence, 6 Johns\u2019s Eq., N. C., 83; Barnes v. Hathorn, 54 Me., 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">We are of the opinion that the judgment of the court below .should be reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\"><em>Reversed and </em>remanded\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Opinion adopted October 16, 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">Stayton,</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">\n<em>Chief Justice.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
