Statute of Frauds\u2014Memorandum in Writing.\u2014A memorandum in writing must describe the land, the subject of the contract, with sufficient exactness to render its identity certain, upon the introdue tion of extrinsic evidence, simply disclosing the condition of the parties at and immediately before the making of the contract, (Pom. on Spec. Per., sec. 90.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b755-10\">2. Parol Evidence to Aid Such Memorandum.\u2014Parol evidence can not add to an imperfect contract a material part in order to sustain it, but it can apply a description in it to the subject of the contract.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b755-12\">3. Written Memorandum Description Sufficient.\u2014In a letter by the vendor from \u201cMt. Vernon, Texas,\u201d offering lands described therein as \u201cmy property which is situated six miles northwest of this place, consisting of lands and other property as follows: Twenty-five hundred acres of land, divided as follows: Two hundred acres in farm, five hundred fenced pasture, six hundred and thirty unfenced, balance timber, all lying in one body. * * My farm is situated on the north side of White Oak creek, one mile from the bottom,\u201d etc. The land having been pointed out to the vendee, and the proposition to sell accepted, <em>held </em>that the land was sufficiently described under the statute of frauds.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b755-15\"><em>4. </em>Rescission\u2014Delay.\u2014A vendee entered into possession of a farm and stock thereon. After taking possession discovery is made that one of the several parcels or surveys making up the aggregate acreage sold is detached from the main body about half a mile distant. Discovery was made in March. In June the vendee sold part of the personal property fiom the farm. August 10 he brought suit to rescind, and pending suit he sold the greater part of the stock on the farm. l\u00edo offer before or during the pendency of the suit was made to place the vendor in statu quo. <em>Held, </em>that while such conduct and delay was strongly against the right to rescind, still the vendee had the right to reasonable abatement in the purchase money from the effect of the detached locality of part of the land sold.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b755-17\">5. Mistake.\u2014As affecting the right of a vendee to compensation for a misrepresentation as to the subject of the sale, there is no distinction between misrepresentations made knowingly or by mistake. A false representation, however innocently made, if damage follow, will give the injured party a right to compensation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b755-19\">6. Parol Sale of Land\u2014Agreement by Purchaser to Pay.\u2014It seems in a parol sale of land followed by possession, the vendee promising to pay a stipulated price, and receiving and holding possession of the land, the vendor being willing to carry out the sale and tendering a deed for the land, that the vendee can not defeat recovery of the purchase money under the statute of frauds.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AKB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>7. Same.\u2014If the vendee obtain the possession of the land and obligate himself to pay for it, he can not defeat the obligation by reason of his having failed to have the vendor bind himself, and the less so when the vendor is wi'ling to complete the sale, and in seeking the payment, tenders his deed for the land.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-5\">Appeal from Hopkins. Tried below before Hon. S. B. Pounders, Special District Judge, in place of Hon. J. A. B. Putman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-6\">Appellant Watson sued appellee Baker in the district court of Hopkins county about August 10, 1885, to rescind a sale from Baker to Watson (made about December, 1884), of two thousand five hundred acres of land, two hundred head of cattle, one hundred head of hogs, seven horses and mules and a lot of farming tools, etc., and to recover four thousand dollars paid Baker; setting up fraud on Baker\u2019s part as the ground for rescission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-7\">Baker answered, pleading to the jurisdiction of the court, denying Watson\u2019s allegations of fraud, acknowledging that he was mistaken as to the locality of the six hundred and twenty-nine acre tract, which he had believed adjoined the remainder of the land, and offering to pay appellant any damages he had sustained on account of his (Baker\u2019s) mistake. Judgment in this case was for Baker. Watson appealed, and said judgment was reversed. (67 Texas, 48.) Pending said appeal of Watson v. Baker, appellee sued appellant in the district court of Hopkins county for eight thousand dollars, the purchase money for said land, and to foreclose a vendor\u2019s lien on same; said cause being numbered on said docket No. 5J366. At the spring term of said court, 1887, the district Judge ordered the parties. (both suits being then pending) to replead, with Baker as plaintiff, whereupon appellee as plaintiff and appellant as defendant filed new pleadings; appellee setting up the sale of all said property to Watson in December, 1884;. that appellee vacated the premises and appellant took possession of same, together with all the personal property, about January 1, 1885, appellant agreeing to execute his notes and appellee agreeing to execute to him a deed to the lands in a few days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-8\">Watson answered by demurrers, general and special, general denial, allegations of fraud upon the part of Baker, that the land was worthless for a stock farm (for which pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>pose it was bought), disconnected and out of shape, and asking a recission; but never offering to put Baker in statu quo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-6\">Appellee replied by demurrer, etc., denying the fraud, alleging that he represented the six hundred and twenty-nine acre tract as cornering with the main tract; acknowledging his mistake as to the location of the corner; offering compensation in damages; denying appellant\u2019s ability to place him in statu quo, alleging that appellant had disposed of, etc., all the personal property; torn down and burned up the fencing and out houses on the place; cut down and destroyed and otherwise damaged the property so as to make it inequitable to rescind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-7\">The history of the negotiations is given by Baker as witness on the trial: \u201cAbout the twenty-eight November, 1884, I received a letter from plaintiff dated Mt.

I will sell the above for fifteen thousand dollars cash, or for five thousand dollars cash with remainder on time to suit purchaser, with twelve per cent interest.

We took dinner with Baker, and after dinner we all three rode out to look at Baker\u2019s property. We first went down into Baker\u2019s farm north of his house and looked at it. Baker said there were two hundred acres in the farm. After looking at his farm we went into his pasture. He said there were five hundred acres in that. We went out of the pasture near the southwest corner of same, and then went southeast to the south line of the Trevenio survey. Baker had a paper in his hand which he used as a guide. I did not examine it nor did he show it to me. Then we went around the place and back to the house. On our way back to the house, on our way around we saw some horses and cattle which Baker claimed. Baker asked me fifteen thousand dollars for his property and I offered him ten thousand dollars cash, which he refused to take, and I went home to Falls county, Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-10\">On the nineteenth of December I wrote Baker a letter which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-11\">\u201cMarlin, Texas, )</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4rh\">\u201cDecember 19, 1884. \u00cd</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajub\">\u201cCapt.

The deed for this connection was tendered Watson on the trial. The detached tract was shown to be of equal value with land of similar shape and cornering upon the southwest corner of the main tract.

The reason urged for withdrawing them is that they do not show a contract in writing sufficient to take it out of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">It is well established, that \u201cthe written evidence required by the statute need not be comprised in a single document or drawn up in any particular form. It is sufficient if the contract can be plainly made out in all its terms from any writings of the party or from his correspondence.\u201d (19 Texas, 74, Peters v. Philips.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>The memorandum or agreement required by the statute \u201cneed not be signed by both parties, but only by him who is to be charged by it.\u201d (49 Texas, 695, Crutchfield v. Donathon.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">In Fulton v. Robinson, 55 Texas, 404, the general rule as to the requisites of the agreement or memorandum in writing, under the statute of frauds, is stated that it should be so reasonably definite and certain within itself or other writing referred to as to parties, consideration and subject matter that specific performance can be enforced without a resort to parol testimony.\u201d In that case a receipt \u201cin part payment of a certain tract of land, being my headright lying on Rusk creek in the Cross Timbers,\u201d was held sufficiently definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In 19 Texas, 74, is cited from 1 McCord, 425 (not accessible to us), \u201cA receipt stating that the vendor had received of the vendee a certain sum, being on account of a plantation on the Cypress, sold to him this day for two thousand two hundred dollars, * * was held sufficient compliance with the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In Colerick v. Hooper, 3 Indiana, 318, specific performance-was decreed upon the following agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">\u201cI have this day sold my lot to Alexis Coquilard, on the plat in the town of South Bend, on the plat of said town, on the-river bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">(Signed) \u201cD. H. Colerick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">\u201cAug. 11, 1835.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">In discussion the court argues \u201cthis memorandum * !$5 describes the property sold, not with the utmost certainty, it is true, but so that it could be identified, and parol evidence for that purpose would be admissible. Such evidence would not be required to make out the terms of the agreement, but to apply it to the subject matter of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">\u201cThe thing sold was Colerick\u2019s lot on the river bank in the town of South Bend. The written contract assumed that he had one lot on the river bank in said town, and implied that he had but one. Which was it was the only question to be settled. This can be easily answered from the data given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Of examples of descriptions, so imperfect that identity is impossible, we have in Johnson v. Granger, 51 Texas, 42, \u201cReceived of Cone Johnson three hundred dollars on town lots.\u201d In 46 Indiana, 433: \u201cSix hundred and forty acres of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>land in Anderson county, Kansas.\u201d In 52 Indiana, 127: \u201cOne hundred and twenty acres of land in Shannon county, Missouri.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">These cases may illustrate the rule applied to the memorandum in writing under the statute as to certainty required as to the land sold. It is clearly stated in Brown on Statute of Frauds, sec. 385: \u201cIt must appear from the memorandum what is the subject matter of the defendant\u2019s engagement. Land, for instance, which is purported to be bargained for must be so described that it may be identified.\u201d And in sec. 90, Pomeroy\u2019s Com. on Specific Performance: \u201cThe subject matter must be described with sufficient exactness to render its identity certain upon the introduction of extrinsic evidence simply disclosing the condition of the parties at and immediately before the making of the contract.\u201d (See also Lewis v. Reichey, 27 N. J. Eq. Rep., 240; Glenn v. Rogers, 3 Md., 316; Waring v. Ayers, 40 N. Y., 357; Pom. Com., sec. 90 and note.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">As in all other contracts in writing, parol testimony can not add to their terms, yet it can show the circumstances. It can not make the contract for sale of land, but can apply a description to the property, if such application can be made so that it be known that the particular object is found. Parol evidence can not add to an imperfect contract a material part in order to sustain it, but it can apply a description in it to the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Applying these suggestions to the letters and telegrams in evidence, there can be no doubt as to the fact that Baker\u2019s farm on which he resided, with the external description as to buildings and to farm and pasture lands enclosed, and its locality with reference to Mt. Vernon and the creek named,, was the property for which Watson made the offer and which was accepted at a price agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Whether within the description is included the detached six hundred and twenty-nine acres\u2014the Trevenio survey\u2014is more difficult. The lands described in Baker\u2019s letter are said to lie in a body. That the lands pointed out to Watson by Baker were in contemplation of the parties, and which was supposed to have been included in Trevenio survey, is equally clear to have been in Baker\u2019s mind and also in Watson\u2019s when he made his offer, which was finally accepted. But this does not appear in the writings relied upon as the contract. Nor will the difficulty be removed by resorting to a parol executed contract, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>while such may be inferred from the testimony, yet as to the Trevenio tract there was no possession given by Baker and taken by Watson, either actual or constructive. Watson\u2019s possession was of the farm, and without occupation in any way of the Trevenio tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Watson\u2019s letter of December 19, 1884, addressed to Baker, speaking of \"your property,\u201d referring doubtless to what he had been shown as Baker\u2019s lands, etc., offering ten thous- and dollars, may have been intended as applying to the lands he had inspected, and if so, with knowledge of the general locality of the detached part, only that his information was that the tracts cornered together. But we can not reach this conclusion from the words \"your property;\u201d and we can not from them impart the two tracts into the written memorandum. We conclude that there was a sufficient memorandum to apply to the main farm tract, but not to the other detached from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Watson\u2019s subsequent conduct places him at a disadvantage. It is in evidence that as early as February 7, 1885, he knew that the Trevenio survey was part of his contract. It is included in the unsigned notes for the purchase money prepared at his instance after he had resided on the land a month. It is natural that, having bought a piece of ground, like the old time farmer, \u201che must needs go and see it.\u201d His own testimony is that he discovered the true locality of this survey about the first of May, 1885, and that soon thereafter he offered to rescind and brought suit. His suit, however, was not brought until August 10, 1885, and Baker testifies that he was first notified of the trouble by the suit. If Watson, on discovering the disconnection of the tracts, had exercised his right to rescind, he should have left the land and property, and should have made demand for his advance upon the trade. By so doing he could have occupied the advantage ground of prompt action. A tender in an offer to rescind should be kept up. He should restore the property. This would not be excused by suit. Upon rescinding, the property would be Baker\u2019s, and Watson had no right to dispose of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Having elected to dispose of it even after suit, he is in the attitude of claiming the right to dispose of the personal property under the contract. He can not claim under it and against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">He would not, however, be precluded from damages, if any, suffered by reason of the mistake, in a deduction from the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>So far as Watson was concerned, it was of no consequence whether the misrepresentation was wilful or innocently made by Baker. The damage was the same, and his rights were the same as to a recovery of the loss sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Wf\">While we\u2019 are satisfied that the contract was sufficiently shown in the letters and telegrams in evidence, and that the court acted properly in overruling the motion of defendant to excludethem from the jury, we are not fully satisfied but that Watson may have suffered in his contest resisting complete specific performance. In the charge to the jury, while containing substantially the law applicable .to the testimony, a distinction between false representation and innocent mistake on Baker\u2019s part seems to have been recognized. An instruction was asked by Watson, for the purpose of removing this distinction, and it should have been given, or a like charge, informing the jury of the effect of mutual mistake upon question of rescission and upon question of damages if rescission should be refused, and any damages be proven as resulting from such mistake. The charge is as follows: \u201cThat if the representations made by Baker concerning the sale of the property in controversy were untrue, but were made by Baker believing them to be true and that Watson acted on said representations and believed them to be true, and that the representations were a material inducement to the trade, and that Baker had better means of informing himself of the facts than Watson, then he, defendant, would be entitled to have the trade rescinded, although there was no positive fraud on Baker\u2019s part, if the other circumstances of the case entitled him to a recission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The record shows clearly a mutual mistake in the locality of the Trevenio survey. It can not be brought into the terms of -the contract in writing, nor into an executed parol contract between the parties; although it was in the mind of both parties in February, when the papers were prepared, but which were not signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Watson having elected to remain in possession and to dispose of the personal property, will have great difficulty in acquitting himself of laches in acting upon the breach of the con? tract. Yet, he should have the right to an equitable abatement in the price, should the Trevenio survey be excluded from the contract; or in event of a material difference in the value of the entire estate by reason of the tracts being disconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>The purchase by Baker of the roadway connecting the lands did not remove the diffiulty. It could not alter the locality of the lands though a convenience, and it naturally would be taken into consideration upon the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Another view of the main question may be taken, not distinctly made in the pleadings nor briefs of counsel. In 49 Texas, 696, it was held that a suit upon a promissory note given for land \u201cwas not an action brought upon a contract for the sale of land, but was upon a promissory note given for the purchase money for land.\u201d And that \u201calthough it may not be such a memorandum as satisfies the statute, the maker can not avoid the note which he has given because he has omitted to bind the vendor.\u201d The vendor tendered a deed on the trial, and judgment for the amount of the note and foreclosing the vendor\u2019s lien was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In this case Watson by telegram did promise Baker to pay him the twelve thousand dollars. And after payment of the four thousand dollars he again promised to pay the eight thousand, dollars for the land, which was assented to by Baker, It was not necessary that his promise to pay be in writing, (49 Texas, <em>2, </em>Pitschki v. Anderson.) In consideration for these promises Watson received and retained possession of the farm and valuable stock upon it. He has used the farm and has disposed of all the personal property. Baker has tendered the deed, and it was relevant to the issues for the deed to be admitted in evidence, with evidence of the tender of it. Upon this view of the condition of the parties, it would seem that the relief for 'Watson would be a just abatement in the price by reason of the locality of the Trevenio survey, if there be such difference, and without reference to the good or bad faith of Baker in his representations in the matter. The action of the court upon the right to open and close, as shown in the bill of exceptions, was regular. Upon the issues litigated, the affirmative was on Baker, The contract was denied. He was put upon its proof. Watson was on the defensive. Besides the position of the parties as plaintiff and defendant seems to have been determined by the order of the court in consolidating the two suits. It was acquiesced in by the parties in their repleading with reference to the one suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The judgment below will be reversed for the defect in the charge of the court above noted and the refusal to give the \u2022charge asked to correct the defect. <em>Reversed and </em>remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Opinion delivered November 13, 1888.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
