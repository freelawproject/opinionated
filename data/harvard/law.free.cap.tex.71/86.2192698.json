Boring, 44 Texas, <em>255; </em>Taylor v. Harrison, <em>47 </em>Texas, 454, 460; Thorn v.

Appellant having in his petition, declared upon the deed as an absolute conveyance of the land itself can not now be heard to complain, because the court gave to the deed the same construction which he had. (Mast v. Tibbles, 60 Texas, 304; Ross v. McGowen, 58 Texas, 608.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">2. A deed is conclusively presumed in the absence of accident, mistake or fraud, to use language, which, when unambiguous, truly evidences the intention of the grantor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">The language of the deed clearly shows that the grantor\u2019s intention was to convey a certain tract of land itself, and not his right, title and claim in the land. The words of the deed are: 16Have granted, bargained, sold and released, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell and release and quit claim unto the said Gk W. DeLong, all that tract of land known and described as follows,\u201d giving description of the land. (Lott v. Kaiser, 61 Texas, 668; Heirs of Watrous v. McKie, 54 Texas, 71.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">3. If the deed did not express the true intention of the parties, and plaintiff intended to show a state of facts different from and outside of the deed, he should have set forth the same by appropriate averments sufficiently broad and clear to inform the defendant that matters not contained in the deed would be relied upon in support of his claim on the trial of the cause. (Adams v. Hicks, 41 Texas, 243; Mims v. Mitchell, 1 Texas, 445, 446; Carter &amp; Hunt v. Wallace, 2 Texas, 207.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-9\">4. The rules which regulate the admission of evidence in trials by jury do not apply strictly wher\u00e9 the trial of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>is by the court. The court will discriminate between evidence which is competent to establish or disprove the issue, and that which is not; and though incompetent evidence may have been heard by the court, it will not be a ground for the reversal of the judgment, if rightfully rendered upon evidence which is competent. (Chrisman v. Miller, 15 Texas, 161; Hall &amp; Jones v. Jackson, 3 Texas, 309, 310; Rosenborough v. Gorman, 6 Texas, 313, 314; Smith v. Hughes, 23 Texas, 249, Melton v. Cobb, 21 Texas, 543; Schleicher v. Markward, 61 Texas, 102.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-6\">Walker, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ALB\">This is an appeal from a judgment against McIntyre in a suit brought by him upon a promissory note made by DeLong to plaintiff, for eight hundred dollars, and to enforce the vendor\u2019s lien retained upon one-third interest in the Mary Harrison survey of one thousand two hundred and eighty acres of land (being one-half of a two-thirds interest in said survey conveyed by tax deed May 7, 1878, by A. McIlvaine, sheriff of Tom Green county, to John Lackey and to said McIntyre.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The petition contained appropriate averments for the judgment and decree asked. Another note and foreclosure were included in the petition about which there is no controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The defendant pleaded failure of title to the land for which the note was made, alleging that the only title held by McIntyre at his sale was a tax deed void on its face. Prayer also for two hundred and fifty dollars cash payment upon the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The testimony showed the note as alleged made by the defendant to plaintiff of the date January 4, 1884, and payable one year thereafter, with interest at twelve per cent from date, and payable annually\u2014vendor\u2019s lien retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The deed of same date by McIntyre to DeLong recited a cash payment of two hundred and fifty dollars, and the making of the note for eight hundred dollars as consideration for which \u201cI have granted, bargained, sold and released, and by these presents, do grant, bargain, sell and release and quit claim unto the said G. W. DeLong, all that tract of land known and described as follows: My undivided half interest in and to the undivided two-thirds of survey number 809, abstract number 321, in the name of Mary Harrison, lying and being situate on the south fork of the Concho river, * * and containing four hundred and twenty-five acres, more or less. It being the undivided half of the' same land conveyed by A. McIlvaine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sheriff of Tom Green county, to John Lackey and H. C. McIntyre, by deed dated May 7, 1878, and recorded in records of Tom Green county, in book B, page 628, together with all and singular the rights * * * to have and to hold all and singular the said premises, unto the said G. W. DeLong, his heirs and assignees forever,\u201d with warranty \u201cagainst every person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same, or any part thereof, by, through or under me,\u201d and specially retaining vendor\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It appeared in evidence that McIntyre refused to give a general warranty, and for that part of the land which he held by tax title he would only give a quit claim deed. He fully explained the character of his title. Leach, the agent of DeLong in making the purchase testified: \u201cI told DeLong at time of signing notes, and before the trade was closed, that McIntyre only held a tax title to the land conveyed by special warranty deed and he might lose it any time. He (DeLong) said that tax titles were generally regarded good in this section of the country and he would make the trade anyhow.\u201d The defendant DeLong testified that in buying he \u201cexpected to get a good title to the land, not a mere chance at title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The court below held that plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the note, nor the defendant to recover the cash payment on the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In an action upon a purchase money note for land conveyed by special warranty, on appeal, Justice Bell (27 Texas, 445, Rhode v. Alley), clearly and fully declares the principles governing such cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cIt can not be questioned that it is competent for a purchaser of land who has received a deed with special warranty to show that a fraud has been practiced upon him in respect to the title. If a vendor of land has a perfect title in himself, his vendor may well be content to accept from him a deed with special warranty because such a deed would in that case vest an unimpeachable title in the vendee. Ordinarily, when a vendor accepts a quit claim deed or a deed with special warranty, the presumption of law is that he acts upon his own judgment and knowledge of the title, and he will not be heard to complain that he has not acquired a perfect a title. But where in the negotiations preliminary to the execution of the contract the purchaser stipulates for a perfect title and is after-wards induced by the false or fraudulent representations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the vendor to accept a quit claim deed or a deed with speecial warranty, in the belief that he is acquiring a perfect title, and one free from litigation at the time, he will be permitted to show that he was deceived in respect to the title, and may be relieved against such contract.\u201d (Citing 4 Texas, <em>75; </em>9 Texas, 85; 14 Texas, 629; 22 Texas, 429.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In the absence of fraud or mistake the note and deed express the contract between McIntyre and DeLong. The note contained a promise to pay, absolutely and without any condition. The deed limits responsibility in the warranty. The nature of the title was discussed before the note and deed were executed, and DeLong was .advised by his agent Leach, that it was but a tax title he was buying, and he was liable to lose it at any time. After .this assurance defendant declared he \u201cwould make the trade any how.\u201d There is undisputed testimony that De Long took the defective title with full knowledge of the facts. From his contract, so made, courts can not relieve him.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The judgment below, so far as recovery is refused upon the eight hundred dollar notes, with interest at twelve per cent, from June 4, 1883, is reversed, and judgment will be here rendered in addition to the recovery in the judgment below, for said eight hundred dollars and interest at twelve per cent, from June 4, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\n<em>Reversed and rendered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Opinion delivered May 29, 1888.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
