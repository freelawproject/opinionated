A decree of foreclosure and sale was entered and the defendants prayed an appeal therefrom to the Appellate Court for the First District, whereupon the court entered the following order: \u201cAppeal prayed by the defendants from the decree of sale this day entered herein to the Appellate Court in and for the First District of Illinois, which is allowed to them upon their filing herein a bond to be approved by the clerk of this court, in the sum of $1000. Bond to be filed in twenty days and bill of exceptions in sixty days.\u201d Within the time fixed by the court, the appellant, with Thompson Y. Douglass as surety, filed an appeal bond in the required amount, in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of Cook county, which was duly approved by said clerk. The Appellate Court, after overruling the motion of appellant for leave to file a new bond, on the motion of appellees dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appeal was granted to all the defendants jointly and that the appeal bond was executed by the appellant alone, the other defendants not joining in the execution thereof, and that such defect could not be cured by filing a new bond signed by all the defendants. The appellant has brought the record to this court to review the judgment of the Appellate Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-5\" pgmap=\"471\">Willis H.

If the appellant desired to sever the appeal he should have prayed a separate appeal. The defendants other than appellant not having attempted to perfect the appeal by filing a bond within the time fixed by the court, the defective appeal of appellant could not be cured by filing a new bond signed by all of the defendants..
