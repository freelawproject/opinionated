J.</author>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">Plaintiff initiated this case as a class action under ORCP 32. Plaintiff, a former employee of defendant Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. (Smith Barney), contends that Smith Barney wrongfully withheld wages owed to her and to others similarly situated after their employment ended. Smith Barney moved to compel arbitration pursuant to a provision in its employment agreement with plaintiff. The trial court deferred ruling on Smith Barney\u2019s motion until the issue of class certification was resolved. Initially, the trial court denied class certification. However, it determined that additional class discovery was necessary and declined to rule on the arbitration motion until that was completed. Thereafter, the court granted leave to plaintiff to amend her complaint and certified classes as to three counts in the amended complaint. Subsequently, it denied, in part, Smith Barney\u2019s motion to stay the case and to compel arbitration. Smith Barney appeals that order pursuant to ORS 36.730. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">On appeal, Smith Barney makes three assignments of error: (1) the trial court erred in failing to grant Smith Barney\u2019s motion to compel arbitration once it denied plaintiffs original motion for class certification; (2) the trial court erred in denying Smith Barney\u2019s motion to strike plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint and her motion for partial summary judgment; and (3) the trial court erred in ruling that plaintiff had satisfied the notice requirement in ORCP 32 H.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff filed this class action on February 18, 2005, alleging that defendant had violated ORS 652.140.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant filed a motion to stay the case and compel arbitration based on arbitration agreements that plaintiff had signed in connection with her employment. The agreements provide for arbitration of individual claims but not for class action cases or claims. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>court deferred ruling on the motion to compel arbitration. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">\u201c[H]aving [precertification] discovery occur, and then making a determination about whether to certify a class is a necessary predicate to determining whether the matter needs to be sent to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">\u201c* * * I am exercising my discretion not to rule on the motion to compel arbitration at this point, because I think we all agree. You have said as much. If it\u2019s certified as a class then the arbitration agreement would not compel arbitration. So I think we need to know that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On January 27, 2006, plaintiff filed her initial motion for class certification. The trial court issued a letter ruling to the effect that plaintiff had failed to satisfy some of the requirements to maintain a class action, and, on April 14, 2006, the court signed an order denying class certification. On June 8, 2006, before ruling on Smith Barney\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, the court entered a second order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> clarifying that the denial of \u201cclass certification\u201d was \u201cconditional\u201d under ORCP 32 C(l), in that it contemplated plaintiff being able to fully engage in the precertification discovery that had previously been ordered. Because it determined that the contemplated discovery had not occurred, the court ordered the discovery to be completed and ruled that Smith Barney\u2019s motion to compel arbitration would remain under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Following completion of the contemplated discovery, Smith Barney filed a renewed motion to compel arbitration, and plaintiff sought to amend her complaint to bring additional class claims against defendant and again requested the trial court grant class certification. Smith Barney then sought to strike plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint based on its pending motion to compel arbitration and, when that motion was denied, filed a response substantively opposing the motion for class certification. Following a hearing, the trial court issued a letter opinion and entered orders permitting plaintiff to amend her complaint, granting plaintiffs motion to certify a class as to several of plaintiffs claims, denying plaintiffs motion to certify a class as to other claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>granting Smith Barney\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to the claims for which class certification was denied, and denying Smith Barney\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of the claims for which class certification was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">ORS 36.730 governs when an appeal may be taken under the above circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By its terms, ORS 36.730 does not authorize an appeal from a pretrial order granting class certification. Accordingly, Smith Barney\u2019s third assignment of error (that the trial court incorrectly concluded that plaintiff had satisfied the notice requirement of ORCP 32 H) is not reviewable. In contrast to the third assignment of error, Smith Barney\u2019s first and second assignments of error are based on the premise that the trial court failed to summarily grant its motions to compel arbitration and, therefore, the court erred in denying those motions. The court\u2019s decision not to immediately rule on the motions to compel arbitration resulted in the court\u2019s denial of arbitration with respect to the claims that were certified as class action claims and, therefore, we conclude it is reviewable under ORS 36.730.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On appeal, Smith Barney argues that the trial court granted plaintiffs motion to amend her complaint and her second motion for class certification in error because the court \u201cignored the plain and mandatory language of ORS 36.625(1)(b), which requires a court \u2018summarily to decide\u2019 the issue and \u2018order the parties to arbitrate\u2019 if there is an enforceable arbitration agreement.\u201d Thus, the question we must decide is whether the court acted \u201csummarily\u201d under the above-described circumstances, as required by ORS 36.625.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">As noted, it is undisputed that the arbitration agreements in this case do not provide for arbitration of class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>action claims. Rather, only individual claims brought by plaintiff against defendant are governed by the agreements. Before it may compel arbitration, a court must determine that \u201cthe particular type of controversy between the parties is within the scope of that agreement.\u201d <em>Industra / Matrix Joint Venture v. Pope &amp; Talbot, </em>341 Or 321, 331, 142 P3d 1044 (2006) ; <em>see Dex Media, Inc. v. National Management Services, </em>210 Or App 376, 381, 150 P3d 1093, <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 644 (2007) ; <em>see also Snow Mountain Pine, Ltd. v. Tecton Laminates Corp., </em>126 Or App 523, 529, 869 P2d 369, <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 36 (1994) (court will compel arbitration unless the arbitration clause does not cover the dispute at issue). Because plaintiffs original complaint brought only class claims that were not subject to arbitration, it was necessary for the court to resolve whether the case could proceed as a class action before it could determine whether to compel arbitration. Arbitration would have been proper only if the class action claims could not be properly certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In that light, the outcome of this appeal is controlled by the interplay of two rules of law: ORCP 32, which governs the procedure in class actions, and ORS 36.625, which governs petitions to compel arbitration. ORS 36.625 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u201c(1) On petition of a person showing an agreement to arbitrate and alleging another person\u2019s refusal to arbitrate pursuant to the agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">\u201c(b) If the refusing party opposes the petition, the court shall proceed <em>summarily </em>to decide the issue as provided in subsection (8) of this section and order the parties to arbitrate unless it finds that there is no enforceable agreement to arbitrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">(Emphasis added.) According to Smith Barney, the term \u201csummarily\u201d in ORS 36.625(1)(b) means that the court was required to immediately order the case to arbitration once it entered the order denying plaintiffs initial motion for class certification. To determine the legislature\u2019s intent in that regard, we employ the framework set out in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) and <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), by examining the text and context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ORS 36.625 does not provide a definition of the word \u201csummarily.\u201d In our analysis of the text and context of the statute, we therefore turn to the common meaning of the word. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201csummarily\u201d is \u201cin a summary manner or form &lt;was ~ relieved of his command&gt; &lt;the case was tried ~ without a jury - O. W. Holmes * * *&gt;.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2289 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cSummary,\u201d in turn, means \u201cdone * * * without delay or formality\u201d or \u201cof, relating to, or using a summary proceeding or procedure.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1476 (8th ed 2004) (\u201c[w]ithout the usual formalities; esp., without a jury\u201d). Additionally, we note that the language in ORS 36.625 is imported from section 7 of the Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA), as adopted by the legislature in 2003. Or Laws 2003, ch 598. The comment to section 7 of the UAA specifically states that the term \u201csummarily\u201d as used therein \u201chas been defined to mean that a trial court should act expeditiously and without a jury trial to determine whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.\u201d UAA \u00a7 7 comment (2000). That meaning is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word as set forth above. Thus, we conclude that the word \u201csummarily,\u201d as it is used in ORS 36.625, means that the court must decide the issue of arbitrability expeditiously and without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Having identified the meaning of the word \u201csummarily\u201d as used in ORS 36.625, we turn to the question of whether the court ruled \u201csummarily\u201d in resolving defendant\u2019s motions to compel arbitration. It is undisputed that the court made its decision pretrial and before a jury had been impaneled. In that sense, it could be concluded that the court ruled \u201csummarily.\u201d However, the court did not decide whether arbitration should be compelled immediately after the motions on that issue were filed. Instead, the court permitted discovery of matters relating to class certification and declined to decide the arbitration question until that discovery was completed. It is those circumstances on which Smith Barney focuses in support of its argument that the trial court failed to rule \u201csummarily\u201d as the statute requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In our view, Smith Barney\u2019s argument frames the issue of whether, by amending its order denying class certification and making the denial conditional pending further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>discovery, the court exceeded its authority under ORS 36.625(1)(b). If the legislature contemplated that the denial of class certification could be conditional, then it would be consistent with its use of the word \u201csummarily\u201d that the legislature did not intend to prohibit a court from exercising that authority as part of a summary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">ORCP 32 C(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\"><em>\u201cAs soon as practicable </em>after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine by order whether and with respect to what claims or issues it is to be so maintained and shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions thereon. <em>An order under this section may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the merits.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">(Emphasis added.) Based on the above language, it is apparent that ORCP 32 C(l) grants broad authority to trial courts to make rulings in class actions that can be tailored to the practical needs of individual cases and to a variety of circumstances. Smith Barney\u2019s proposed interpretation of ORS 36.625 and ORCP 32 is inconsistent with that view. Such an interpretation would deprive courts of the authority expressly granted by ORCP 32 C(1). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court was authorized to make the denial of class certification conditional in order to ensure that an adequate record was in place before making a final decision on the issue. <em>See also Joachim v. Crater Lake Lodge, </em>48 Or App 379, 393, 617 P2d 632, <em>rev den, </em>290 Or 211 (1980) (trial courts have wide latitude in matters of judicial administration).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Nonetheless, Smith Barney counters that \u201cthe court\u2019s order on April 14, 2006, was not conditional by its terms.\u201d However, we are not aware of any general rule of law that prohibits a court from <em>sua sponte </em>modifying an order that is absolute in its terms to an order that is conditional in its terms. Indeed, courts generally have inherent authority to modify their orders during the pendency of a proceeding, and here, the trial court had not yet ruled on Smith Barney\u2019s motion to stay the pendency of the case and to compel arbitration when it modified its certification order. <em>See Patrick v. State of Oregon, </em>178 Or App 97, 103-04, 36 P3d 976 (2001) (discussing the trial courts\u2019 historical inherent authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>modify orders and judgments and the impact of ORCP 71 on that authority with respect to judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We conclude for the above reasons that, when it deferred ruling on Smith Barney\u2019s motion to compel arbitration until after certain discovery had occurred and the issue of class certification was finally resolved, the trial court proceeded \u201csummarily\u201d within the contemplation of ORS 36.625(1)(b). Similarly, the granting of plaintiffs motion to file an amended complaint did not exceed the court\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\"> ORS 652.140 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201c(1) When an employer discharges an employee or when employment is terminated by mutual agreement, all wages earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge or termination become due and payable not later than the end of the first business day after the discharge or termination.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Although the June 8, 2006, order is in the form of a letter, it was entered in the trial court register and orders relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"> ORS 36.730 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">\u201c(1) An appeal may be taken from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-9\">\u201c(a) An order denying a petition to compel arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-10\">\u201c(b) An order granting a petition to stay arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-11\">\u201c(c) A judgment entered pursuant to ORS 36.600 to 36.740, including but not limited to a judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-12\">\u201c(A) Confirming or denying confirmation of an award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">\u201c(B) Modifying or correcting an award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-14\">\u201c(C) Vacating an award without directing a rehearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-15\">\u201c(2) An appeal under this section must be taken as provided in ORS chapter 19.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
