J.</author>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In this serpentine appeal, the state, invoking <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), petitions for reconsideration of our most recent decision in this case, <em>State v. Hopson, </em>220 Or App 366, 186 P3d 317 (2008) <em>(Hopson III). </em>For the reasons that follow, we grant reconsideration, adhere to our opinion as modified, and alter our disposition on the state\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We recount, as necessary context, the procedural history. Defendant was convicted of first-degree sodomy and first-degree kidnapping. At sentencing, the trial court determined that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), it could not impose consecutive sentences based on its own factual findings, ORS 137.123, but that it could impose a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence, under ORS 137.767, on the sodomy conviction based on those findings. Defendant appealed, arguing that the court erred in imposing a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence because <em>Blakely and Apprendi </em>required jury findings to support such a sentence; the state cross-appealed, arguing that the court erred in concluding that it could not impose consecutive sentences on the convictions in light of <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi. Hopson III, </em>220 Or App at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In our original opinion, <em>State v. Hopson, </em>214 Or App 288, 164 P3d 342 (2007) <em>(Hopson I), </em>we reversed and remanded for resentencing on cross-appeal in light of our then-recent decision in <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 150 P3d 31 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we did not reach the issue raised on appeal. <em>Hopson I, </em>214 Or App at 289 (\u201cGiven that that error requires us to remand the case for resentencing, ORS 138.222(5), there is no need for us to reach the sentencing issue raised by defendant on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The Oregon Supreme Court allowed review and, following its decision in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>(2007), remanded the case to us for reconsideration. <em>State v. Hopson, </em>343 Or 366,170 P3d 1064 (2007) <em>(Hopson II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Following that remand, in <em>Hopson III, </em>we revisited our disposition of the state\u2019s cross-appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cIn <em>Ice, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court held that judicial factfinding in support of consecutive sentences pursuant to ORS 137.123 violated the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi. </em>Consequently, and contrary to our original disposition, the trial court in this case was correct in concluding that it lacked the ability to make factual findings in support of a consecutive sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">220 Or App at 368. Accordingly, we affirmed with respect to the state\u2019s cross-appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Given that conclusion, we then addressed defendant\u2019s assignment of error on appeal (which, again, we had not reached in <em>Hopson I </em>because of our original disposition in that case of the cross-appeal): \u201cDoes judicial factfinding in support of a sexually violent dangerous offender sentence pursuant to ORS 137.765 * * * run afoul of <em>Blakely </em>and Apprendi?\u201d <em>Hopson III, </em>220 Or App at 368. After an extensive discussion, <em>id. </em>at 369-73, we answered that question in the affirmative and, consequently, concluded that the trial court had erred in imposing sentence pursuant to ORS 137.765. Accordingly, on the appeal, we vacated defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">After <em>Hopson III, </em>the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>reversed the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ice. </em>Perhaps ironically, the Court\u2019s holding corresponded to that in <em>Tanner, </em>on which our disposition in <em>Hopson I </em>had rested. Thus, this case has, in some ways, simply circled back to its original starting point. Given that circumstance, the simplest course would be just to vacate our intervening decision in <em>Hopson III </em>and reinstate our decision and disposition in <em>Hopson </em>I \u2014 to wit: \u201cAppeal dismissed as moot. On cross-appeal, sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.\u201d <em>Hopson I, </em>214 Or App at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">We decline, for prudential reasons, to follow that simple course. That is so for two related reasons: <em>First, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>although we may, effectively, have returned to our starting point, in the course of this case\u2019s circuitous journey we addressed and resolved a very substantial issue pertaining to the application of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>principles to the imposition of sentence pursuant to ORS 137.765. To be sure, but for <em>State v. Ice </em>we would never have reached that question in <em>Hopson III, </em>but we did \u2014 and our determination of that matter has, presumably, informed and guided sentencing courts since <em>Hopson III </em>issued. Our analysis there was correct and should not be effectively rescinded by way of withdrawing our entire decision in <em>Hopson III.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><em>Second, </em>and more immediately, our analysis in <em>Hopson III </em>can afford valuable guidance to the trial court on remand in this case. Although a reversal on the cross-appeal will necessitate (as it would have in <em>Hopson I) </em>a complete vacating of defendant\u2019s sentences, including the ORS 137.765 component, there is a substantial prospect for reimposition of such a sentence on remand. Our analysis in <em>Hopson III </em>is instructive as to the process that must be followed in that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Consistently with the foregoing, we: (1) modify our opinion in <em>Hopson III </em>to delete the second full paragraph of the opinion, 220 Or App at 368, and otherwise adhere to our opinion; and (2) alter our disposition of the cross-appeal from \u201caffirmed\u201d to \u201creversed and remanded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; on appeal, sentence vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed. On cross-appeal, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\"> In <em>Tanner, </em>we rejected a defendant\u2019s <em>Apprendi/Blakely-based </em>challenge to the imposition of a consecutive sentence under ORS 137.123 predicated on judicial factfinding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
