J.</author>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The state petitions, based on <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US _, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), for reconsideration of our decision in this case. <em>State v. Loftin, </em>218 Or App 160, 178 P3d 312 (2008) <em>(Loftin I). </em>For the reasons that follow, we allow reconsideration, adhere to our prior opinion as modified, vacate our prior disposition, and affirm the imposition of the consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In <em>Loftin I, </em>defendant contended that, under the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s then-recent decision in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), the trial court had \u201cerred in imposing sentences that were partially consecutive to each other * * * based on the court\u2019s finding made pursuant to ORS 137.123(5)(a).\u201d 218 Or App at 162. The state responded that (1) <em>State v. Ice </em>was wrongly decided, and (2) in all events, regardless of whether <em>State v. Ice </em>was correct, the sentencing court was \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d because ORS 137.123(5) should be construed in such a way as to render the sentence imposed in <em>Loftin I </em>materially distinguishable from that at issue in <em>State v. Ice. See Loftin I, </em>218 Or App at 164-65. In particular, the state argued that, because defendant had been convicted of two offenses of equally \u201cserious\u201d crime classification, the trial court was authorized, as a matter of law, to impose a consecutive sentence without any reference to the requirements of ORS 137.123(5), including the requirement of predicate findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the state reasoned, although the sentencing court had, in imposing the consecutive sentence, rendered a finding in accordance with ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>137.123(5), that judicial finding was gratuitous \u2014 and, consequently, <em>State v. Ice </em>was inapposite. <em>Loftin I, </em>218 Or App at 164-65,167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">We held that <em>State v. Ice </em>was controlling, requiring a remand for resentencing. <em>Loftin I, </em>218 Or App at 170. In so holding, we addressed in detail, and rejected, the state\u2019s alternative statutory construction argument that the requirements of ORS 137.123(5), including the requirement of predicate findings, are inapposite to the circumstance in which a defendant has been convicted of two or more offenses of equally \u201cserious\u201d crime classification. <em>Loftin I, </em>218 Or App at 167-70. That analysis focused on the question of <em>whether, </em>or in what circumstances, predicate findings are required for the imposition of consecutive sentences \u2014 as opposed to the question (in <em>Ice) </em>of <em>who </em>must make such findings when they are required. Thus, our opinion in <em>Loftin I </em>addressed and resolved an important question of Oregon statutory construction pertaining to the imposition of consecutive sentences that was, and is, distinct from the constitutional question presented in <em>Ice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In the wake of <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>our statutory construction analysis in <em>Loftin I </em>could be regarded, retroactively, as <em>\u201cdicta\" </em>\u2014 after all, that discussion, albeit essential to our disposition at that time, would never have been necessary but for <em>State v. Ice. </em>Given that posture, we could as a prudential matter \u2014 as we have in some other <em>Ice </em>\u201csecond wave\u201d reconsideration cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 simply vacate our original opinion in its entirety and alter our disposition. We decline to do so here because of the continuing significance, beyond the circumstances of this case, of the statutory issue that we properly and necessarily addressed in <em>Loftin I. </em>Rather, we (1) modify our prior opinion to delete those portions that state that <em>State v. Ice </em>is controlling and requires a remand for resentencing, <em>see </em>218 Or App at 162,170; (2) adhere to our prior opinion as so modified; (3) vacate our prior disposition in light of <em>Oregon v. Ice; </em>and (4) affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> ORS 137.123(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cThe court has discretion to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment for separate convictions arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct only if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201c(a) That the criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated was not merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious crime but rather was an indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201c(b) The criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or caused or created a risk of causing loss, injury or harm to a different victim than was caused or threatened by the other offense or offenses committed during a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\"> <em>See, e.g., State v.
