Plaintiff defends the trial court\u2019s reasoning, urges, alternatively, that she was entitled to a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4), and also advances, byway of a \u201ccross-assignment of error,\u201d an additional, potential alternative basis for affirmance. We conclude that the trial court erred in granting the motion for new trial on its stated grounds, and we reject plaintiffs alternative contentions. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The operative facts, for purposes of our analysis and disposition, are uncontroverted. The denial of plaintiffs motion to compel production of certain incident reports, the allowance of defendant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude plaintiffs testimony regarding an encounter with another customer, and the denial of plaintiffs request for an <em>in camera </em>review are central to the parties\u2019 dispute. Consequently, we recount those matters in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In June 2005, plaintiff filed this personal injury action alleging that she had been injured at defendant\u2019s Sandy Boulevard store in Portland. According to plaintiff, at about 8:30 p.m. on June 25,2003, she slipped and fell because of the presence of a slippery foreign substance on the floor of the store\u2019s main aisle. Plaintiff alleged that defendant had been negligent in several particulars, including placing the substance on the floor, failing to warn of the presence of the substance, failing to restrict access to the area until the substance was removed, and failing to use a nonskid surface on the floor in that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In November 2005, plaintiff requested that defendant produce, among other items, \u201c[c]opies of reports of all similar incidents prepared by any and all employees of the premises in question from January 1,1997 up to and through the present.\u201d Defendant objected to that request on the basis that (1) \u201cit is vague, overbroad, and unduly burdensome\u201d and (2) \u201cproduction of such information is not reasonably calculated to lead to the further discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Plaintiff subsequently moved to compel production of, <em>inter alia, </em>those incident reports. Plaintiff contended that those documents were reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence because they would lead to information that would help establish defendant\u2019s knowledge of potentially dangerous conditions and would show that defendant should have known that failure to conduct floor inspections resulted in injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Defendant opposed that motion, arguing that, to the extent that any prior \u201cslip-and-fall\u201d incidents did not result in litigation, documents pertaining to those incidents were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant also remonstrated that incident reports from several years before plaintiffs alleged injury were not relevant to establish knowledge of the alleged slippery substance on the ground on the date of plaintiffs fall. Finally, defendant asserted that claims and complaints involving unadjudicated allegations had negligible probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The Honorable Jean K. Maurer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied plaintiffs motion to compel, without specifying the bases for that denial. Plaintiff did not thereafter seek to modify or narrow the scope of her request for production.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Before trial, defendant moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude certain anticipated testimony by plaintiff. According to defendant, during the course of plaintiffs deposition, plaintiff had testified that, on the night of plaintiffs fall, she spoke to a woman who, according to plaintiff, was at the jewelry counter \u201cwaiting for an incident report.\u201d Defendant emphasized that the woman\u2019s identity was unknown and that she had not described to plaintiff the circumstances of the incident she was waiting to report. Defendant sought to exclude testimony \u201cconcerning [plaintiffs] conversation with this woman.\u201d Specifically, defendant contended that, because both the identity of the woman and the nature of the incident she was waiting to report were unknown, the evidence should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>be excluded on the basis that it was irrelevant, hearsay, and potentially unfairly prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">At the pretrial conference on the morning of trial, plaintiff opposed that motion, responding that the testimony was probative in that the jury could properly infer from that evidence that someone else had slipped in the same area, and around the same time, as plaintiff, and was waiting to report an incident for that reason. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and excluded the testimony, reasoning that \u201cit may be probative, but I think that any probative value is really outweighed by potential for undue prejudice and confusion, assuming it\u2019s not hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Plaintiff then immediately asked the trial court if it would engage in an <em>in camera </em>review of \u201cthat incident report\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201c[I]f you could do an in-camera review of that incident report, <em>if they have that with them, </em>and see if it does relate to a slip in that same area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">(Emphasis added.) The trial court agreed to look at the report. However, defendant told the trial court that, because Judge Maurer had previously ruled that defendant was not required to produce the prior claims history requested by plaintiff, defendant did not have the incident report with it in the courtroom \u2014 and, indeed, did not know whether such a report existed. Defendant also contended that the trial court should not engage in an <em>in camera </em>review because the nature of the incident that the woman was allegedly waiting to report was unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The trial court rejected the latter reason, but stated, \u201cif you don\u2019t have the report, I don\u2019t think on the state of the record there\u2019s anything I can do if they don\u2019t have the report.\u201d The trial court also referred to Judge Maurer\u2019s earlier discovery ruling and observed, \u201cAnd there was a ruling on that.\u201d Plaintiff responded that Judge Maurer\u2019s ruling did not address the particular issue of an incident report from the evening of plaintiffs alleged injury, but, rather, simply refused to compel production of defendant\u2019s entire incident report history for the Sandy Boulevard store over a span of eight years. The trial court responded, \u201cOkay. Well, I \u2014 it\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>not here, so I can\u2019t look at it.\u201d Plaintiff responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d Plaintiff did not ask the court to defer ruling on her request for an <em>in camera </em>review until defendant could produce for the court\u2019s review any incident reports generated on the evening of plaintiffs alleged fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The case proceeded to trial. During plaintiffs casein-chief, her counsel examined Riggs, a loss prevention manager for defendant. Riggs testified that all employees inspect the floor as they move about the store. Defendant subsequently called Riggs to testify during its case. On plaintiffs cross-examination of Riggs, plaintiff asked whether Riggs was \u201caware if anyone else slipped and * * * fell on the same substance prior to [plaintiff] on the night of the incident.\u201d Riggs replied, \u201cI am not aware.\u201d On redirect examination by defense counsel, Riggs testified regarding methods of preventing falls and stated, \u201c[I]f having all those associates on the floor didn\u2019t provide a track record of success, then we wouldn\u2019t train our associates to look.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The jury returned a defense verdict. Plaintiff subsequently moved for a new trial pursuant to ORCP 64 B, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201cA former judgment may be set aside and a new trial granted in an action where there has been a trial by jury on the motion of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201cB(l) Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the court, or abuse of discretion, by which such party was prevented from having fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">* * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">\u201cB(3) Accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">\u201cB(4) Newly discovered evidence, material for the party making the application, which such party could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cB(6) Error in law occurring at the trial and objected to or excepted to by the party making the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Plaintiff invoked ORCP 64 B(l), (3), and (4) in support of her motion. Plaintiff identified three predicate rulings that she argued warranted a new trial: (1) Judge Maurer\u2019s denial of plaintiffs motion to compel defendant\u2019s prior claims history, which encompassed the alleged incident report; (2) the trial court\u2019s allowance of defendant\u2019s motion <em>in </em>limine; and (3) the trial court\u2019s ultimate denial of plaintiffs request to review the alleged report <em>in camera. </em>Plaintiff contended that those rulings prejudiced her because they denied her access to another incident report that likely involved an incident that occurred on the same evening prior to her fall. Plaintiff asserted that the nonproduction of that report prevented her both from obtaining evidence that was probative to demonstrate that defendant had notice of unsafe conditions and from properly impeaching Riggs\u2019s testimony. Plaintiff also argued that she was prejudiced when, after defendant had previously argued in opposition to plaintiff s motion to compel that defendant\u2019s prior claims history was not relevant, defendant elicited testimony from Riggs that defendant had a \u201ctrack record of success.\u201d Finally, plaintiff contended that, under ORCP 64 B(4), the incident report \u2014 assuming one existed \u2014 constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In conjunction with the new trial motion, plaintiff requested that the trial court order production of defendant\u2019s claims history for the 10 years prior to the date of plaintiffs fall \u2014 or, at the very least, to require defendant to produce the complete report involving the other incident that allegedly occurred on the same evening. In the alternative, plaintiff requested that the trial court review that incident report <em>in camera </em>to assist its determination as to whether a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Defendant opposed the new trial motion on a variety of grounds. First, defendant argued that nothing in plaintiffs motion demonstrated that an irregularity or abuse of discretion occurred by which plaintiff was prevented from having a fair trial for purposes of ORCP 64 B(l). Second, defendant contended that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that an \u201caccident or surprise\u201d occurred under ORCP 64 B(3), because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>plaintiff had known about a possible incident report at least as early as two months before trial, when she filed her motion to compel. Finally, defendant argued that plaintiff was not entitled to a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4) because, according to defendant, plaintiff could have discovered any other contemporaneous incident report with \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">During the hearing on the motion, the trial court agreed to review <em>in camera </em>all incident reports generated from the Sandy Boulevard Kmart location on the date of plaintiffs alleged injury. That <em>in camera </em>review revealed a five-page incident report involving the slip and fall of a customer, West (the \u201cWest incident report\u201d). The West incident report, which was filled out by both West and store employees, reported that she fell after slipping on \u201cpurple bubble bath\u201d on the floor at register 9 at 8:40 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">After reviewing the West incident report, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial. Specifically, the court stated that, \u201c[b]ased on the in-camera review,\u201d plaintiff was entitled to a new trial not only under ORCP 64 B(l), but also under ORCP 64 B(6) \u2014 which plaintiff had not invoked in support of her motion for new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201c[A]t the time of trial, defendant\u2019s representative, * * * Riggs, was allowed to testify that the store had no prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>notice of a hazardous condition. The [West incident report] raises a fact question for the jury as to the veracity of Mr. Riggsfs] testimony on these issues. The Court\u2019s pretrial ruling relating to the incident precluded plaintiff from cross-examining Mr. Riggs about another slip and fall occurring in close proximity in time to this incident. In addition, Mr. Riggs testified that defendant\u2019s policy did not include scheduling floor inspections at regular intervals but instead generally relied on store associates to monitor for safety. He testified that he would look for a different way to address hazards in the store if he was informed that the current policy was not effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The court concluded that its pretrial ruling constituted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">\u201can \u2018[i]rregularity in the proceedings of the court * * * or [an] order of the court, or abuse of discretion, by which [a] party was prevented from having [a] fair trial.\u2019 ORCP 64 (B)(1). The pre-trial ruling was also an \u2018[e]rror in law occurring at the trial and objected to by the party making the application.\u2019 ORCP 64 (B)(6).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">(Brackets in original.) Accordingly, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Defendant appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s allowance of plaintiffs motion for a new trial under ORCP 64 B(l) and (6). Plaintiff responds that a new trial was properly granted under either of those provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an alternative basis for affirmance, plaintiff argues that a new trial would have been properly granted under ORCP 64 B(4) because the West incident report constitutes \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that plaintiff \u201ccould not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at trial.\u201d <em>See Snyder v. Hunter Room, Inc., </em>269 Or 536, 538, 525 P2d 1293 (1974) (\u201c[A]n order of a trial court granting a new trial will be upheld if any ground in the motion is adequate to sustain such action whether or not it was the basis for the trial judge\u2019s ruling.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, plaintiff advances a \u201ccross-assignment of error,\u201d contending that Judge Maurer\u2019s denial of plaintiff s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>compel was erroneous and constitutes an additional ground for allowing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Before addressing the substance of the parties\u2019 particular contentions, it is useful \u2014 indeed, essential \u2014 to revisit the content and structure of ORCP 64 B, and specifically subsections (1), (4), and (6). Again, those provisions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">\u201cA former judgment may be set aside and a new trial granted in an action where there has been a trial by jury on the motion of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201cB(l) Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the court, or abuse of discretion, by which such party was prevented from having fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u2021 * * Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">\u201cB(4) Newly discovered evidence, material for the party making the application, which such party could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">* * * \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">\u201cB(6) Error in law occurring at the trial and objected to or excepted to by the party making the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">Those provisions, perhaps surprisingly, are derived from the Deady Code and are remarkably similar to analogous provisions as originally enacted in 1862:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">\u201cThe former verdict or other decision may be set aside and a new trial granted on the motion of the party aggrieved, for any of the following causes, materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">\u201c1.

Excessive damages, appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\"><em>\u201c6. </em>Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision, or that it is against law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\"><em>\u201c7. </em>Error in law occurring at the trial, and excepted to by the party making the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">General Laws of Oregon, Civ Code, ch II, title VIII, \u00a7 232, p 197 (Deady 1845-1864).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Four aspects of the new trial provisions, as originally enacted and in their present form, are striking. <em>First, </em>both within subsections, and among subsections, the rule prescribes distinct and yet functionally overlapping \u201ctriggers\u201d for the allowance of a new trial. \u201cIrregularities],\u201d \u201corder[s] of the court,\u201d \u201cabuse[s] of discretion,\u201d and \u201cerror[s] in law,\u201d while generally distinct concepts, can, and often do, overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\"><em>Second, </em>the rule does not itself define its operative terms. Some are essentially self-defining <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d \u201cerror in law\u201d) or have been refined through case law application over nearly 150 years <em>(e.g., </em>\u201c[i]rregularity in the proceedings of the * * * jury\u201d). But others \u2014 \u201c[i]rregularity in the proceedings of the court\u201d or \u201cany order of the court\u201d \u2014 are so amorphous that, without some limitation, they would subsume the others and subvert the coherent and principled application of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\"><em>Third, </em>in closely related fashion, consistently with principles of statutory construction, all provisions of ORCP 64 B(1) must, to the extent possible, be construed in such a way \u201cas will give effect to all.\u201d ORS 174.010. Thus, for example, the more general language of subsection (1) should not be construed in such a way as to abrogate the limitations of the more particularized grounds for new trial prescribed in other subsections, including, as pertinent in this case, subsections (4) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\"><em>Fourth, </em>application of the rule must comport with the constitutional constraints on overturning a jury\u2019s verdict, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>prescribed in Article VII (Amended), section 3, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Beglau v. Albertus, </em>272 Or 170, 180, 180 n 2, 536 P2d 1251 (1975) (stating that \u201c[i]t is fundamental that a new trial may be ordered by a trial court only for prejudicial <em>error\u201d </em>(emphasis added) and that that \u201chas been the rule since 1910 when Art VII, \u00a7 3, was added to the Constitution\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, a new trial cannot be granted under ORCP 64 B based on the allegedly \u201cprejudicial\u201d effect of a prior judicial act, including a ruling, unless that act was erroneous. Even more particularly, \u201cany order of the court\u201d for purposes of subsection (1) necessarily, constitutionally, means any <em>erroneous </em>\u201corder of the court.\u201d Thus, a court cannot grant a new trial under ORCP 64 B(l) based on its <em>post hoc </em>belief that a nonerroneous ruling contributed to an \u201cunfair\u201d result.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Against that backdrop, we turn first to the application of ORCP 64 B(1) to these circumstances \u2014 that is, whether, because of some erroneous \u201cirregularity\u201d or \u201corder of the court\u201d or an \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d plaintiff was deprived of a \u201cfair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Plaintiff identifies two pretrial matters that she contends constituted \u201c[i]rregularit[ies] in the proceedings of the court\u201d: (1) the trial court\u2019s allowance of defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and (2) the trial court\u2019s failure to review the purported incident report <em>in </em>camera.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>As noted, ORCP 64 B(l) does not define \u201c[i]rregularity\u201d; nor did any of its statutory antecedents. However, in common usage in the nineteenth century, as today, an \u201cirregularity\u201d meant a \u201c[deviation from * * * any common or established rule\u201d or \u201cdeviation from method or order; as the <em>irregularity of proceedings.\u201d </em>Noah Webster, 1 <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1828) (emphasis in original; boldface added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That definition comports with our understanding of the term as used in ORCP 64 B(1). <em>See Leland Properties v. Burton Engineering and Survey, </em>152 Or App 557, 562, 954 P2d 851, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 620 (1998) (noting that \u201cthere may have been an \u2018irregularity\u2019 in the proceedings in the sense that the trial court inadvertently did not follow its usual practice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Here, there was nothing irregular in the process by which the parties presented, and the court decided, the motion <em>in limine </em>and the request for <em>in camera </em>inspection. As recounted above, <em>see </em>228 Or App at 104-06, the submission and consideration of those matters conformed to well-established practice. It may well be that the trial court, with the benefit of hindsight based on its post-trial reading of the West incident report, wished that it had ruled differently in the first instance. But that does not render its consideration and disposition of the pretrial matters procedurally \u201cirregular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Nor did the trial court\u2019s disposition of the <em>in limine </em>motion or the request for <em>in camera </em>inspection represent an actionable \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d for purposes of ORCP 64 B(1). \u201cAbuse of discretion,\u201d as a legal term of art, means that the court\u2019s action or decision was not \u201cwithin the range of legally correct discretionary choices\u201d and did not produce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cpermissible, legally correct outcome.\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000); <em>see also Forsi v. Hildahl, </em>194 Or App 648, 652, 96 P3d 852 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 124 (2005) (\u201cThe trial court abuses its discretion if it exercises that discretion in a manner that is unjustified by, and clearly against, reason and evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In granting the <em>in limine </em>motion and excluding plaintiffs putative testimony about her encounter with the other woman waiting to fill out an incident report, the trial court predicated its ruling exclusively on its application of OEC 403:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t may be probative, but I think that any probative value is really outweighed by potential for undue prejudice and confusion, assuming it\u2019s not hearsay.\u201d That ruling was, thus, based on the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>See McCathern v. Toyota Motor Corp., </em>332 Or 59, 71, 23 P3d 320 (2001) (\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s ruling whether to exclude relevant evidence under OEC 403 for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling on the <em>in limine </em>motion did not represent an abuse of discretion. Regardless of whether the court could properly have denied, rather than allowed, that motion, the allowance of the motion was \u201cwithin the range of legally correct discretionary choices.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>330 Or at 312. In particular, the trial court could properly determine, as it did in the first instance, that the probative value of the <em>evidence</em>\u2014viz., that <em>some </em>other incident had occurred on the evening of plaintiffs alleged injury\u2014was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion of issues. Even more particularly, the court could properly exclude the putative testimony because of substantial concerns that the jury might use that testimony to speculate about the nature of other possible incidents, including whether the other customer had slipped on the same substance that plaintiff alleged had caused her to fall.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>To be sure, if the trial court had known about the content of the West incident report at the time that it ruled on the <em>in limine </em>motion, it might well have exercised its discretion differently. But that does not mean that the court abused its discretion based on the facts presented to the court at the time that it made its original ruling. Permissible exercises of discretion cannot, retroactively, be deemed \u201cabuses\u201d because of \u201c20/20 hindsight\u201d derived from later-disclosed information. <em>Cf. Roe v. Doe, </em>161 Or App 477, 486, 984 P2d 344 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 651 (2000) (\u201cWe view the record as the trial court would have * * *. The relevant record, for purposes of [reviewing an allowance of summary judgment], is, of course, the record that was before the trial court <em>at the time </em>it considered and allowed the summary judgment motion.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The same analysis applies and controls with respect to the trial court\u2019s failure to review the alleged incident report <em>in camera. </em>Again, the court\u2019s ruling on that matter was ultimately predicated on an exercise of discretion. <em>See State v. Stanley, </em>30 Or App 33, 35, 566 P2d 193, <em>rev den, </em>280 Or 1 (1977) (\u201c[T]he decision of whether to preliminarily determine in camera the admissibility of evidence is one for the discretion of the trial court.\u201d). Again, the court\u2019s disposition was, in the totality of the circumstances, within the range of legally permissible discretionary outcomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As noted, during the pretrial conference on the morning of trial, plaintiffs counsel asked for an <em>in camera </em>review of the purported incident report \u201cif they have that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>with them,\u201d and the trial court indicated that it was amenable to that request. However, when defense counsel indicated that the document was not available in the courtroom, the court observed, \u201cWell, * * * it\u2019s not here, so I can\u2019t look at it.\u201d In response, plaintiffs counsel merely said, \u201cOkay.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel did not object and, in particular, did not ask the court to require defendant to promptly produce for the court\u2019s review any incident reports generated on the night of plaintiffs alleged fall. Nor did plaintiff seek a brief continuance for that to be accomplished \u2014 even though the jury had not yet been summoned to the courtroom for <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">There was no abuse of discretion. In the absence of some objection or request for further relief by plaintiffs counsel, the court acted within the bounds of permissible discretion in proceeding without reviewing a document that was not presently available for its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Further, in a closely related sense, plaintiff, by failing to insist on defendant\u2019s production of the report at trial for the purpose of <em>in camera </em>inspection, waived any further objection that the court\u2019s ruling warranted a new trial. In <em>Transamerica Title Ins. v. Millar, </em>258 Or 258, 262-63, 482 P2d 163 (1971), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201cAfter learning of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to suspect that a situation might exist which was inimical to a fair trial, plaintiff had a choice to make. It could either ask the judge to investigate the circumstances or waive anything that such an investigation would have disclosed. It could not wait and gamble on the outcome of the case and then raise the question if the results were adverse. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201c * * [W]hen a party having knowledge of an error or an irregularity during the trial fails to call it to the attention of the court and remains silent, speculating on the result, he is deemed to have waived the error, and the denial of a motion for a new trial based upon that ground presents no reviewable question * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">(Quoting <em>Wills v. Petros et al, </em>225 Or 122, 129, 357 P2d 394 (1960)) (citation omitted; brackets in <em>Transamerica.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>See also Turman v. Central Billing Bureau, </em>279 Or 443, 450, 568 P2d 1382 (1977) (reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial because the moving party could have easily obtained the adverse party\u2019s records, but did nothing until after it received an adverse verdict); <em>Way v. Prosch, </em>163 Or App 437, 444-46, 988 P2d 422 (1999) (the mother\u2019s election to proceed to trial with the knowledge that a possible judicial conflict of interest existed, without exercising her procedural right to inquire further, constituted a waiver of her right to a new trial under ORCP 64 B(1) on the basis of that conflict).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Consistently with those principles, once the trial court indicated that it was willing to review the report <em>in camera, </em>but could not do so because the report was unavailable, plaintiffs failure to insist that defendant immediately produce the incident report for <em>in camera </em>inspection precluded the allowance of ORCP 64 B(1) relief predicated on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Finally, with respect to the asserted \u201ctriggers\u201d for relief under ORCP 64 B(1), there was no predicate erroneous \u201corder of the court.\u201d That is, neither the allowance of the <em>in limine </em>motion nor the failure to engage in <em>in camera </em>inspection was the product of any legally cognizable error. As noted, both were predicated solely on exercises of judicial discretion \u2014 and, consequently, could be erroneous only if the trial court had abused its discretion in rendering those rulings. As we have explained, those rulings were not the product of any abuse of discretion and, thus, were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In sum, we conclude that neither the allowance of defendant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion nor the failure to engage in pretrial <em>in camera </em>inspection constituted an erroneous \u201corder of the court,\u201d \u201c[irregularity in the proceedings of the court,\u201d or \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d for purposes of ORCP 64 B(l). Accordingly, the trial court erred in determining that plaintiff was entitled to a new trial under that provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">We proceed to the trial court\u2019s alternative basis for allowing a new trial, <em>viz., </em>ORCP 64 B(6). Under that provision, a trial court may order a new trial if it determines that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>a party\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d have been \u201cmaterially affect[ed]\u201d by an \u201c[e]rror in law occurring at the trial and objected to or excepted to by the party making the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">As noted, the trial court invoked ORCP 64 B(6) <em>sua sponte. See </em>228 Or App at 108 n 2. Again, putting aside the propriety of that <em>sua sponte </em>invocation \u2014 which defendant did not, and does not, challenge<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 the trial court\u2019s application of ORCP 64 B(6) was erroneous for two reasons. First, although there can be some overlap \u2014 for example, where an exercise of discretion is based on a legally erroneous premise \u2014 \u201cerror in law\u201d is, generally, conceptually distinct from \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Rogers, </em>330 Or at 312 (\u201cIf there is only one legally correct outcome, then \u2018discretion\u2019 is an inapplicable concept.\u201d). Here, as noted, both of the trial court\u2019s rulings were, in fact, products of \u201cpure\u201d discretion, without reference to some legally erroneous premise. Accordingly, even if ORCP 64 B(6) were somehow apposite here, it would afford no relief for the same reasons explained above with respect to \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Second, the trial court\u2019s assessment of the correctness of its predicate rulings was expressly \u2014 and impermissibly\u2014 based on its post-trial knowledge of facts <em>(viz., </em>the contents of the West incident report) that were not of record as of the time the court made the original ruling. A trial court can allow a new trial based on \u201cerror in law\u201d only if the asserted error \u201cwould have been sufficient to justify the reversal of the judgment upon appeal.\u201d <em>Timmins v. Hale, </em>122 Or 24, 32, 256 P 770 (1927); <em>accord Leland Properties, </em>152 Or App at 562 (to warrant the allowance of a new trial under ORCP 64 B(1), an \u201cirregularity\u201d must be \u201csufficient to amount to <em>reversible error </em>in the proceedings\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Thus, in applying ORCP 64 B(6), trial courts are to operate as this court would in determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>original ruling that is the subject of the new trial motion constituted reversible error. Just as we are constrained on appellate review to consider only the circumstances known to a trial court at the time that it rendered an evidentiary ruling, so too are trial courts constrained under ORCP 64 B(6) in revisiting the correctness of their original rulings. The content of the West incident report \u2014 which was not known to the trial court until weeks after it had made its pretrial rulings\u2014 was immaterial to whether, at the time it rendered those rulings, the court had committed reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We next consider, as an alternative basis for affirmance, whether the trial court should have granted a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4). <em>Snyder, </em>269 Or at 538. Under ORCP 64 B(4), a new trial may be granted based upon \u201c[njewly discovered evidence, material for the party making the application, which such party could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In <em>State v. Arnold, </em>320 Or 111, 120-21, 879 P2d 1272 (1994), the Supreme Court explained that, to satisfy ORCP 64 B(4), the evidence must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\u201c(1) It must be such as will probably change the result if a new trial is granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201c(2) <em>It must be such as, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered before or during the trial-,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201c(3) It must be such that it cannot, with reasonable diligence, be used during trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">\u201c(4) It must be material to an issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">\u201c(5) It must not be merely cumulative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">\u201c(6) It must not be merely impeaching or contradicting of former evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">Defendant contends that the trial court could not properly have granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial under ORCP 64 B(4), because the West report could have been discovered before or during the trial \u201cwith reasonable diligence\u201d on the part of plaintiff. Plaintiff remonstrates that she was reasonably diligent by filing a motion to compel production of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>incident reports and requesting the trial court to review the report <em>in camera </em>during the pretrial conference. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u201c[E]vidence is \u2018newly discovered\u2019 when its existence is first known by [the party] or counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Cadigan, </em>212 Or App 686, 692, 159 P3d 348, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 223 (2007). Consequently, evidence that is known to a party prior to trial is not \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, plaintiff stated in her motion for a new trial that \u201cplaintiff was denied access by the Court to prior incident reports, including an incident and investigation report from an incident the same evening. It involved a report that <em>plaintiff witnessed another customer filling out.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, plaintiff, by her own admission, had knowledge \u2014 as early as the evening of the alleged injury itself and, at the very least, prior to her original request for production \u2014 -that an incident report probably existed from the same evening and in close proximity in time to plaintiffs alleged injury. <em>Cf. Cadigan, </em>212 Or App at 692 (although the significance of evidence may become better appreciated after trial, that does not make the evidence \u201cnewly discovered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In a closely related sense, plaintiff could have, with reasonable diligence, obtained the West incident report before trial. To be sure, Judge Maurer had denied plaintiffs sweeping motion to compel production of incident reports over an eight-year period. However, nothing in that ruling precluded plaintiff from revisiting and narrowing the scope of her request, so as to focus on reports generated in close temporal proximity to this incident, including, specifically, reports generated on the same evening. Indeed, such a renewed and precisely focused request would have comported with the dictates of reasonable diligence. And yet\u2014 notwithstanding plaintiffs own explicit knowledge that another report was probably generated on the same evening within minutes of her fall \u2014 plaintiff never pursued such a manifestly pertinent particularized request for production of that document. <em>See Mitchell v. Mt. Hood Meadows Oreg., </em>195 Or App 431, 456, 99 P3d 748 (2004) (a new trial may not be sustained under ORCP 64 B(4) where the plaintiff knows of the issue days before the case is submitted to the jury and knows how to procure the evidence, but never asks for a delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>in the trial to procure the evidence before the case goes to the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In sum, because the probable existence of the West incident report was known to plaintiff well before trial and that report could have been procured through reasonable diligence, plaintiff was not entitled under ORCP 64 B(4) to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We turn, finally, to plaintiffs cross-assignment of error. Plaintiff cross-assigns error to Judge Maurer\u2019s denial of plaintiffs motion to compel production of defendant\u2019s incident reports generated from the Sandy Boulevard store over an eight-year period. Plaintiff seeks two alternative forms of relief based on that allegedly erroneous ruling: (1) affirmance of the order for a new trial, or (2) in the event that we reverse the judgment granting the new trial, reversal of the original judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Defendant responds that this court does not have jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs \u201ccross-assignment of error\u201d because that \u201ccross-assignment\u201d is, in fact, a cross-appeal and no notice of cross-appeal was ever filed. Invoking ORAP 5.57(2), defendant argues that, because plaintiff is attacking the original judgment \u2014 that is, because plaintiff is seeking relief from the judgment in defendant\u2019s favor \u2014 such an attack must be made by cross-appeal and not by way of a cross-assignment of error. Defendant further argues that, even if plaintiffs cross-assignment of error is somehow cognizable, plaintiff loses on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">ORAP 5.57(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cA cross-assignment of error is appropriate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\u201c(a) If, by challenging the trial court ruling, <em>the respondent does not seek to reverse or modify the judgment on </em>appeal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">\u201c(b) If the relief sought by the appellant were to be granted, respondent would desire reversal or modification of an intermediate ruling of the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, under ORAP 5.57(2)(a), a cross-assignment of error is defective when the respondent is seeking to reverse or modify the judgment <em>on appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Here, the disposition from which the appeal was taken \u2014 or could be taken \u2014 was the order granting a new trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because plaintiff does not seek to reverse or modify that disposition, defendant is incorrect in contending that plaintiffs cross-assignment of error is defective. Plaintiff was not required to cross-appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">We understand plaintiffs \u201ccross-assignment of error,\u201d viewed broadly, to urge an alternative basis for affirmance. In her motion for a new trial, plaintiff properly raised the very contention that she now presents as a cross-assignment of error before the trial court: \u201cIn discovery, plaintiff was denied access by the Court to prior incident reports, including another incident and investigation report from an incident the same evening just prior to plaintiffs fall.\u201d The trial court granted plaintiffs motion, but not on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We thus consider, as an alternative basis for affirmance, whether Judge Maurer\u2019s denial of plaintiffs motion to compel entitled plaintiff to a new trial under ORCP 64 B(1).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Plaintiff sought \u201c[cjopies of reports of all similar incidents prepared by any and all employees\u201d from the Sandy Boulevard store over an eight-year period. Defendant objected on the grounds that that request for production was \u201cvague, overbroad, and unduly burdensome\u201d and \u201cnot reasonably calculated to lead to the further discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Judge Maurer denied plaintiffs motion to compel that evidence without specifying the basis for that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">Without rehashing and belaboring the various arguably applicable \u201ctriggers\u201d for allowance of a new trial under ORCP 64 B(1), it appears, in context, that Judge Maurer\u2019s ruling was the product of an exercise of judicial discretion. <em>See generally ODOT v. Winters, </em>170 Or App 118, 131, 10 P3d 961 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 239, <em>cert den, </em>534 US 996 (2001) (reviewing trial court\u2019s ruling on motion to compel for abuse of discretion); Doe <em>v.

Given the breadth of plaintiffs motion to compel, particularly its temporal scope, Judge Maurer\u2019s disposition was well \u201cwithin the range of legally correct discretionary choices.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>330 Or at 312.

Instead, we determine whether the district court applied the correct legal standard, and whether the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion was reasonable <em>given the information available to the court at the time the decision was made.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted; emphasis added.)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\"> Given that conclusion, we do not assess the impact of those rulings on the outcome of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> <em>See Maulding, </em>278 Or at 362-66 (addressing proper interplay between trial court\u2019s authority, on motion of a party, to allow a new trial based on \u201cerror in law occurring at trial\u201d and court\u2019s authority to grant new trial on its own motion, where trial court granted relief more than 30 days after entry of judgment and relied on an \u201cerror in law\u201d to which no timely exception had been taken).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b146-6\"> Indeed, plaintiff could not cross-appeal from the original judgment because that judgment was vacated upon the allowance of the new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> Obviously, plaintiff would not desire to cross-appeal from the disposition on appeal, <em>viz., </em>the order granting anew trial. <em>Cf. Macy v. Blatchford, </em>154 Or App 313, 325, 961 P2d 873 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>330 Or 444, 8 P3d 204 (2000). In <em>Macy, </em>the plaintiffs \u201cconditionally\u201d cross-appealed from the original judgment, specifying that the cross-appeal should he considered only \u201cin the event that this court concludes that there was a procedural flaw in the trial court\u2019s new trial ruling which mandates reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The conditional cross-appeal from the original judgment in <em>Macy </em>was proper because the order granting the new trial was untimely, with the effect that the original judgment in the defendant\u2019s favor was not properly vacated \u2014 and, consequently, remained in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In all events, this case serves as yet another reminder as to the arcane distinctions between alternative bases for affirmance, cross-assignments of error, and cross-appeals. <em>See, e.g., Capital Credit &amp; Collection Service, Inc. v. Armani, </em>227 Or App 574, 586, 206 P3d 1114 (2009); <em>Austin and Austin, </em>191 Or App 307, 322 n 3, 82 P3d 170 (2003); <em>id. </em>at 322-23 n 1 (Haselton, P.

Prudent practitioners are well-advised, if there is any doubt as to whether a matter should be cross-appealed, to err on the side of caution. The only additional cost of cross-appealing is a filing fee; conversely, erroneously cross-assigning error rather than filing a cross-appeal is fatally, jurisdietionally, preclusive \u2014 and may result in a malpractice judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\"> We consider whether plaintiff would be entitled to a new trial only under ORCP 64 B(l) because plaintiff did not raise ORCP 64 B(6) in her motion for a new trial and did not renew her ORCP 64 B(3) contentions on appeal, and we have rejected any ORCP 64 B(4) basis for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
