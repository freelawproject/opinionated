J.</author>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Plaintiff, the State of Oregon by and through the Department of Human Services (DHS), brought a claim against the estate of Keith Broyles pursuant to ORS 414.105(2) and ORS 411.795<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to recover $80,113.95 in medical assistance payments that it made to Broyles between 1972 and 1991. Broyles died in 1991, but probate proceedings were not initiated until June 2006, when DHS filed its claim. Defendant, the personal representative of Broyles\u2019s estate, disallowed DHS\u2019s claim as untimely and required DHS to file a separate action against the estate. <em>See </em>ORS 115.155.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DHS initiated a proceeding in circuit court, and defendant moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>for summary judgment, arguing that the claim was time barred. DHS\u2019s response was two-fold: (1) ORS 414.105 and ORS 411.795 do not contain a statute of limitations; rather the applicable statutes are ORS 115.008<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ORS 115.005(2)(a), and (2) DHS complied with ORS 115.005(2)(a) by presenting its claim to the personal representative within four months of the initiation of probate proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that ORS 115.008 barred DHS\u2019s claim. DHS appeals and assigns error to the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. There are no disputed material questions of fact and, thus, the decisive issue is whether defendant was entitled to prevail as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C; <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 420, 939 P2d 608 (1997). That question is controlled by an interpretation of the relevant statutes. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). We conclude that DHS\u2019s claim is timely. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Recovery of public assistance paid on behalf of a decedent pursuant to ORS 414.105(2) is carried out through the procedures set out in the probate code, chapter 115 of the Oregon Revised Statutes. <em>See Dept. of Human Resources v. Payne, </em>157 Or App 612, 617, 970 P2d 266 (1998) (\u201cThe claim provisions of the probate code simply provide the procedures by which claims and ensuing actions against the estate * * * may be pursued.\u201d). Here, DHS is attempting to recover public assistance payments from Broyles\u2019s estate, which is subject to a probate proceeding; accordingly, DHS\u2019s claim is subject to the procedural requirements of the probate code.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Defendant argues that, nonetheless, DHS\u2019s claim before the circuit court constituted a separate \u201caction\u201d from the probate proceeding and, thus, is subject to the time limitations set out in ORS chapter 12 regarding actions. Defendant is mistaken. Even if DHS\u2019s claim before the circuit court constituted a separate action for purposes of the statutes of limitation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the limitation periods in ORS chapter 12 are not applicable to such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">ORS 12.250 provides that, \u201c[u]nless otherwise made applicable thereto, the limitations prescribed in this chapter shall not apply to actions brought in the name of the state, or any county, or other public corporation therein, or for its benefit.\u201d ORS 12.250 thus exempts actions brought in the name of the state from the limitations imposed in ORS chapter 12. As the Supreme Court held in <em>Shasta View Irrigation Dist. v. Amoco Chemicals, </em>329 Or 151, 158-59, 986 P2d 536 (1999), ORS 12.250 refers only to \u201cthe limitations prescribed in this chapter\u201d and, thus, \u201capplies only to the limitations contained in \u00d3RS chapter 12\u201d unless some other statute makes the exemption applicable outside that chapter. Defendant argues that ORS 115.008, by virtue of its \u201cnotwithstanding ORS 12.250\u201d clause, operates to extend the time limitations in ORS chapter 12 to DHS\u2019s action here. We disagree. The import of the notwithstanding clause is that, despite the provision in ORS 12.250 that the limitations prescribed in ORS chapter 12 do not apply to actions brought by the state or a public entity, the time limitations set out in ORS chapter 115 <em>are </em>applicable to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">That notwithstanding clause was included in ORS 115.008 in response to our decision in <em>Payne.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Payne, </em>we held that ORS 12.250 exempted the state from the 30-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>limitation period set out in ORS 115.145(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We based that holding on our earlier decision in <em>City of Medford v. Budge-McHugh Supply Co., </em>91 Or App 213, 754 P2d 607, <em>rev den, </em>306 Or 661 (1988), in which we held that ORS 12.250 was applicable outside of ORS chapter 12, despite the \u201cin this chapter\u201d language. Specifically, we applied the exemption in ORS 12.250 to claims brought under ORS 30.905. In doing so, we rejected the argument that \u201cORS 12.250 applies only to limitations in chapter <em>12.\u201d Budge-McHugh Supply Co., </em>91 Or App at 218-19. However, the Supreme Court rejected that reasoning in <em>Shasta, </em>329 Or at 158-59 (holding that ORS 30.905 did not make ORS 12.250 applicable to claims brought under that statute because ORS 12.250 applies only to limitations contained in ORS chapter 12). Accordingly, even without ORS 115.008, we would be constrained from applying the exemption contained in ORS 12.250 to the limitations periods set out in ORS chapter 115, because no statute expressly makes ORS 12.250 applicable to the provisions of that chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">ORS 115.008 further provides that, \u201cexcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, all statutes of limitation and other time limitations <em>imposed under this chapter </em>apply to actions brought in the name of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendant argues that the reference to \u201call statutes of limitations\u201d necessarily refers to the limitations contained in ORS chapter 12. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Defendant grounds his interpretation in the doctrine of the last antecedent. According to that doctrine, defendant contends, the phrase \u201cimposed under this chapter\u201d refers <em>only </em>to the term \u201ctime limitations,\u201d and not to the term \u201call statutes of limitations.\u201d In <em>Baker v. City of Lakeside, </em>343 Or 70, 75, 164 P3d 259 (2007), the Supreme Court, citing to <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>v. Webb, </em>324 Or 380, 927 P2d 279 (1996), stated that the doctrine of the last antecedent provides that, \u201c[Referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent. The last antecedent is the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) That doctrine applies only where <em>no </em>contrary intention on the part of the legislature appears; where statutory context indicates that a meaning other than that suggested by the doctrine was intended by the legislature, the legislature\u2019s intention will control. <em>See Rash v. McKinstry Co., </em>160 Or App 131, 135-36, 981 P2d 343 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>331 Or 665, 20 P3d 197 (2001) (concluding that statutory context provided meaning of the statute, rejecting alternative meaning derived from the doctrine of the last antecedent). Such is the case here. The statutory context of ORS 115.008 demonstrates that, where the legislature intends to refer to statutes of limitation located outside the probate code, it does so specifically. For example, ORS 115.004(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsection (6) of this section, an action under this section against a personal representative, the surety for a personal representative or an interested person shall be commenced within two years after the death of the decedent or within the statute of limitations applicable to the claim, whichever is earlier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">By providing that certain types of claims are subject to both the statute of limitations applicable to those claims and a statute of limitations supplied by the probate code, the legislature has demonstrated an awareness of the existence of statutes of limitation outside the code, specifically referred to them, and specified how they interact with the statutes of limitations provided by the code. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 115.004(5) (requiring compliance with the statute of limitations applicable to the claim or the time limitation in ORS 115.004(5), whichever is earlier); ORS 115.005(2) (requiring compliance with both the statute of limitations applicable to the claim and the time limitations in ORS 115.005(2)(a)). Nothing in the statutory context of ORS 115.008 supports defendant\u2019s assertion that the legislature intended to incorporate all statutes of limitation \u2014 wherever codified and regardless of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>nature of the claim \u2014 into the probate code, merely by using the term \u201cstatute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Moreover, to the extent that ORS 115.008 was enacted to legislatively abrogate our decision in <em>Payne, </em>the statute tracks the language of our opinion that referred to the time limitation at issue, contained in ORS 115.145, as a \u201cstatute of limitations.\u201d <em>See Payne, </em>157 Or App at 617. Thus, by referring to both statutes of limitations <em>and </em>\u201cother time limitations,\u201d the legislature, in ORS 115.008, ensured that this court\u2019s interpretation of ORS 12.250\u2019s exemption would <em>not </em>be applicable to the probate code, regardless of how the code\u2019s timelines were labeled. As discussed, the Supreme Court in <em>Shasta </em>effectively superseded our interpretation of ORS 12.250 in <em>Payne; </em>nevertheless, nothing in <em>Payne </em>and nothing in the statutory context of ORS 115.008 supports defendant\u2019s understanding of the term \u201cstatute of limitations.\u201d Accordingly, the reference in ORS 115.008 to \u201cstatutes of limitation\u201d refers to those statutes of limitation imposed under chapter 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Defendant next argues that ORS 115.005(2)(a), which provides that \u201ca claim is barred from payment from the estate if not presented within the statute of limitations applicable to the claim,\u201d must invoke the limitations period in ORS chapter 12, because it references the \u201cstatute of limitations,\u201d and \u201cno other chapter has that title.\u201d We reject that argument. ORS 115.005(2)(a) does not import the entirety of ORS chapter 12 into the probate code. Rather, it merely provides that, if a claim is otherwise subject to a statute of limitations, the claimant must comply with that limitation period as well as the limitation period imposed by ORS 115.005(2)(a) for claims against the estate. That interpretation is consistent with the structure of the probate code, which, as we concluded in <em>Payne, </em>is a mechanism for the vindication of rights that are grounded in law <em>outside </em>the probate code. <em>See Payne, </em>157 Or App at 617 (\u201c[T]he probate claims procedure is * * * a statutory mechanism for vindicating rights that have their origins elsewhere[.]\u201d). Thus, a claim against an estate must comply with both any limitation that is otherwise applicable to the claim and those that are part of the probate scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>In short, a claim against an estate for recovery of medical payments under ORS 414.105 and ORS 411.795 must be brought within <em>both </em>the limitations period for claims against the estate and any limitation period applicable to a claim for reimbursement under ORS 414.105 and ORS 411.795. Neither statute imposes a limitation on the time that the state has to bring a claim for reimbursement of medical expenses. Nor does any other statute in ORS chapter 410 or 414 impose such a limitation. Further, no statute expressly provides that the time limitations contained in ORS chapter 12 apply to such claims. The only time limitation that remains is contained in ORS 115.005(2)(a): The claim must be brought within four months of the estate\u2019s publication of notice to interested persons. It is uncontested in this case that DHS complied with that requirement. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it concluded that DHS\u2019s claim was time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-5\"> ORS 414.105(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cMedical assistance pursuant to this chapter paid on behalf of an individual who was 55 years of age or older when the individual received such assistance, or paid on behalf of a person of any age who was a permanently institutionalized inpatient in a nursing facility, intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation or other medical institution, may be recovered from the estate of the individual or from any recipient of property or other assets held by the individual at the time of death including the estate of the surviving spouse.
