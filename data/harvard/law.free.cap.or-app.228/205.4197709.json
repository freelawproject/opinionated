Before defendant made the incriminating statements, the arresting officer gave defendant the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, confirmed that defendant understood his rights, and then told defendant that he needed to be honest with the officer. We conclude that defendant was properly informed of the right to remain silent and that he validly waived the right, and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Portland Police Officer Reagan was involved in the pursuit of a pickup truck that had been reported stolen. He lost sight of the pickup for a short time but then came upon it parked crookedly against the curb, with the engine running and no one in it. He saw defendant approximately half a block from the pickup, jogging away from it. Defendant appeared to be nervous and looked back toward the pickup after every few steps.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Reagan approached defendant, placed him under arrest, and handcuffed him. Reagan read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights and asked if he understood them. Defendant said that he did. Reagan then told him, \u201cYou need to be honest with me about the vehicle and the pursuit. Were you driving the [pickup]?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and told Reagan that he had stolen it.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Defendant moved to suppress evidence of his statements to Reagan under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Constitution. He argued that, by telling defendant that he needed to be honest with him, Reagan undermined the portion of the <em>Miranda </em>warning that informed him of his right to remain silent. Thus, defendant contended, his waiver of the right was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">At the hearing on the motion, Reagan testified that he told defendant that he \u201cneeded to be honest\u201d because he wanted defendant to be honest with him, but that he did not order him to confess. The trial court found that Reagan did not threaten defendant in any way and that his statement about being honest was not made in the form of an order. It concluded that the statement did not undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning and that defendant voluntarily waived his right to remain silent. It denied the motion to suppress and, following a bench trial, found defendant guilty. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress for errors of law. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact relating to voluntariness if there is sufficient evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 135, 806 P2d 92 (1991). Under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the state must prove the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 137. Under Article I, section 12, a waiver of the right to remain silent is voluntary if, under the totality of the circumstances, it is apparent that the statement was \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice [and the] defendant\u2019s will was not overborne and his capacity for self-determination was not critically impaired.\u201d <em>State v. Vu, </em>307 Or 419, 425, 770 P2d 577 (1989). Under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant\u2019s decision to waive his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights is valid if it is \u201cvoluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice\u201d and is \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 421, 106 S Ct 1135, 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Defendant renews his contention that his waiver of his right to remain silent was invalid. He argues that his waiver was not made with full awareness of the right, because Reagan failed to effectively inform him that he had the right to remain silent. According to defendant, Reagan\u2019s statement \u2014 that defendant needed to be honest with him\u2014 conveyed to defendant that he needed to explain himself and thus contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning that he had the right to remain silent. Thus, he contends, the statements that he made thereafter should be treated like any statement made in a custodial interrogation without valid <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The state responds that defendant was fully and accurately informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and voluntarily made the incriminating statements. The state notes that defendant indicated that he understood his rights before Reagan told him that he needed to be honest. In the state\u2019s view, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have understood Reagan\u2019s statement as a recommendation to be honest <em>if </em>he chose to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We have previously considered and rejected an argument similar to the one defendant now advances. In <em>State v. Rollwage, </em>21 Or App 48, 533 P2d 831 (1975), the defendant asserted that his incriminating statements should have been suppressed because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that he was given were undermined by a police officer\u2019s subsequent statements that he would \u201cfeel better\u201d if he confessed and that \u201cthe best thing for him to do was * * * to talk openly about what he had done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. We concluded that the officer\u2019s statements were \u201cnothing greater than an admonition to tell the truth\u201d and did not undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We reach the same conclusion here. The trial court\u2019s findings that Reagan\u2019s statement that defendant \u201cneeded to be honest\u201d was not made in the form of an order and that Reagan did not threaten or pressure him to waive his right to remain silent are supported by the record. Reagan made the statement about honesty after he gave defendant the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and after defendant indicated that he understood them. In that context, Reagan\u2019s statement did not convey that defendant was required to explain himself. In our view, it was merely an \u201cadmonition to tell the truth\u201d if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>defendant chose to speak. <em>Id. </em>It did not conflict with the warning that defendant had the right to remain silent, or otherwise nullify the warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In arguing that his waiver was not made with \u201cfull awareness\u201d of the \u201cright being abandoned,\u201d defendant relies on <em>Hart v. Attorney General of Florida, </em>323 F3d 884 (11th Cir), <em>cert den, </em>540 US 1069 (2003). In <em>Hart, </em>the defendant asked a police officer for clarification on the ramifications of waiving his right to counsel. In the course of explaining the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of having an attorney, the officer told the defendant that \u201chonesty wouldn\u2019t hurt him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894. The defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave an incriminating statement. The Eleventh Circuit noted that the defendant\u2019s request for clarification indicated that he did not fully understand his right to counsel. It went on to conclude that the officer had misled the defendant, reasoning that the phrase \u201c \u2018honesty will not hurt you\u2019 is simply not compatible with the <em>[.Miranda </em>warning] that \u2018anything you say can be used against you in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The court explained, \u201cThe former suggested to Hart that an incriminating statement would not have detrimental consequences while the latter suggested (correctly) that an incriminating statement would be presented at his trial as evidence of his guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It concluded, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In this case, there is no indication that defendant did not fully understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Furthermore, under the circumstances of this case, the statement \u201cyou need to be honest with me\u201d is not incompatible with the warning \u201cyou have the right to remain silent.\u201d Given those factual distinctions, <em>Hart </em>does not support defendant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In summary, we conclude that Reagan properly informed defendant of the right to remain silent and that defendant understood and voluntarily waived that right. It follows that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> Defendant also appeals his convictions for theft in the second degree, ORS 164.045, and criminal trespass in the second degree, ORS 164.245. Defendant\u2019s appeal of those convictions was, on defendant\u2019s motion, consolidated with his appeal in this case, hut defendant does not assign error to those convictions. We affirm those convictions without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
