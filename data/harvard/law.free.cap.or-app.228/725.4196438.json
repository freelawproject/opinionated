ORS 426.005(1)(d)(A), (B); ORS 426.130(1)(b)(C). Appellant suffers from a bipolar disorder and a form of psychosis with paranoia. She was placed on a mental health treatment hold after an incident at her mother\u2019s home in which she scratched her niece\u2019s face while attempting to grab a telephone out of the girl\u2019s hand. The state concedes that there is insufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s commitment on either danger to self or basic needs grounds, but asserts that appellant is a danger to others, ORS 426.005(1)(d)(A). On <em>de novo </em>review, we conclude that the record lacks clear and convincing evidence to support commitment on any ground. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">A recounting of the facts pertaining to appellant\u2019s alleged dangerousness to herself and inability to provide for her basic needs is unnecessary. The state\u2019s concession on those grounds is well taken, as the record lacks clear and convincing evidence that would support commitment on either ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">With respect to the state\u2019s argument on appeal that appellant is a danger to others, we take the following facts from the record. Appellant\u2019s bipolar disorder and psychosis cause her to be suspicious of her family members, particularly her mother. Appellant believed that her mother was trying to have her institutionalized; she had been hospitalized in the past for her mental disorder and did not want to be hospitalized again.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Appellant would sometimes approach her mother in an aggressive way, but her mother testified that she \u201cwould never touch me physically because she knows that\u2019s one of the criteria [for commitment]\u201d and \u201cshe knows just how far she can go with her aggressive behavior without actually crossing that line.\u201d Her mother also testified that appellant would make veiled threats to her, saying, \u201cI will get you.\u201d Appellant\u2019s mother and brother both testified that appellant\u2014-who has a master\u2019s degree in psychology\u2014believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>that her mother needed to be institutionalized. Appellant told her brother that she needed his help in having their mother institutionalized, or else she would have to \u201ctake other measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Appellant\u2019s mother also described the incident at home in which appellant scratched her niece\u2019s face. Appellant had begun acting \u201cin a way that was unpredictable and very manic and taking things and moving them around.\u201d When appellant\u2019s mother decided to call Portland Adventist Hospital\u2019s mental health ward in order to have her daughter admitted, to try to put a stop to that effort, appellant grabbed the telephone and, in doing so, \u201c[appellant\u2019s] nails had not been taken care of and so they scratched my granddaughter\u2019s face, and it was bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the two court-appointed examiners advised the court that they believed there was insufficient evidence of dangerousness to others to support commitment on that ground, although both supported commitment on other grounds. The court then asked the state if it had any closing argument. The state\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cYour Honor, I have nothing to add to [the examiners\u2019 statements].\u201d In appellant\u2019s closing argument, her attorney argued that there was insufficient evidence to support commitment. Basing its decision on the findings and conclusions of the examiners, the court committed appellant after finding that she was \u201ca danger to herself, was unable to provide for her basic personal needs, and was not receiving the care necessary for her health or safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"> On appeal, the state now asserts, as an alternative basis for affirmance, that appellant is a danger to others under ORS 426.005(1)(d)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To support commitment on the dangerousness to others ground, the record must contain clear and convincing evidence that establishes a \u201cfoundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>for predicting future dangerousness.\u201d <em>State v. Jepson, </em>48 Or App 411, 416, 617 P2d 284 (1980); <em>see also State v. Hitt, </em>179 Or App 563, 573, 41 P3d 434 (2002) (reversing commitment based on danger to others where the risk of future dangerousness was speculative and abstract). Verbal threats, while probative, are insufficient to support commitment unless they are accompanied by overt acts to follow through with the threat or otherwise demonstrate a clear risk of future violence. <em>State v. R. H, </em>212 Or App 479, 484-85, 157 P3d 1286 (2007) (so stating).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">On <em>de novo </em>review, we consider any direct evidence of violence or threats of violence, as well as the testimony of the experts who examined appellant. Both examiners and appellant\u2019s mother, who lived with appellant, felt that appellant was not a danger to others. We find appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony that appellant is \u201cvery careful\u201d and knew how far she could go without \u201ccrossing that line\u201d to be particularly persuasive. Moreover, the record lacks sufficient evidence of violent acts or threats by appellant. The face-scratching incident is the only evidence in the record of behavior in which appellant actually touched another person, and there is no evidence that she was trying to harm her niece, who was not seriously injured. Other evidence indicates that appellant\u2019s desire was for her mother to be institutionalized, not, as the state argues, violently harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Her statement to her brother about taking \u201cother measures\u201d (if she could not succeed at getting her mother committed), while troubling, was not accompanied by any acts or words suggesting that she was likely to follow through with the threat. <em>See Jepson, </em>48 Or App at 416 (reversing where the appellant\u2019s \u201cstatements about \u2018getting things fixed\u2019 in Washington, D.C.\u201d were \u201cambiguous and susceptible to many interpretations\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Hegbloom, </em>179 Or App 86, 38 P3d 963 (2002) (affirming the appellant\u2019s commitment despite lack of violent acts, where the appellant had refused treatment for schizophrenia, heard voices telling him to kick children, and was having increasing difficulty controlling violent and possibly homicidal impulses). As we stated in <em>Hitt, </em>when a court is faced with an abstract risk of violence \u201cit may be tempting to \u2018err on the side of caution\u2019 * * * because \u2018you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>can never be sure.\u2019 * * * That reasoning, however, effectively shifts the burden of proof from the state to [the] appellant.\u201d 179 Or App at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In summary, given the totality of the evidence, on <em>de novo </em>review, we agree with the state\u2019s concession on appeal that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support appellant\u2019s commitment on basic needs or danger to self grounds. We further conclude that the record also fails to support her commitment on the ground that she is a danger to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\"> Even if the prosecutor\u2019s statement helow could be regarded as a concession, we would address the merits of the state\u2019s argument in support of affirmance because the record was adequately developed to consider it. <em>Cf. State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Pfaff, </em>164 Or App 470, 476-79, 994 P2d 147 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 193 (2000) (affirming under \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine where the state\u2019s concession at the trial court level did not \u201cmaterially affect[ ] the development of the record\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
