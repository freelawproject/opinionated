ORS 657.176(2)(a) disqualifies a person who \u201c[h]as been discharged for misconduct connected with work\u201d from receiving unemployment compensation benefits. Claimant contends that the board erroneously applied OAR 471-030-0038, a rule of the Oregon Employment Department (department) that defines \u201cmisconduct\u201d by excluding conduct that is an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment.\u201d ORS 657.282; ORS 183.482(8)(a), (c). We agree with claimant and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The following facts are not challenged on review. Claimant worked for Nordstrom, Inc., as a customer service associate for five years. During the early years of his employment, employer reviewed job expectations with claimant that included information about allowed rest and meal breaks. Claimant signed an acknowledgment that he had received a written summary of employer\u2019s expectations of its employees, although he did not read the summary. Nonetheless, claimant understood that employer expected him to take rest and meal breaks that did not exceed the amount of authorized time. Employer required employees to clock in and out at the beginning and the end of their shifts and meal breaks, but not for 10-minute rest breaks. Claimant often worked through his rest breaks, and his manager gave him permission to combine his two allowed 10-minute breaks into one 20-minute break.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In April 2004, after forgetting to clock out one night after a shift, claimant was advised by the human resources manager that he needed to correct his timesheet due to his mistake. That mistake was attributed to \u201chuman error,\u201d and claimant was not subject to discipline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two years later, on August 11, 2006, claimant decided to combine his rest breaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>and drive to a nearby pharmacy to pick up a prescription. Claimant encountered heavy traffic, a result of a concert at the Rose Garden that evening, that delayed his travel to the pharmacy. Claimant picked up his prescription, returned to work, and apologized to his coworker for the delay. Claimant had been absent for 36 minutes, 16 minutes more than allowed by employer\u2019s policies. Claimant did not report the extended break to employer because he believed he had already made up for the extra time by not taking rest breaks on other occasions during the course of his employment. Claimant also believed that he had not caused a problem for employer because there was no business activity during his absence. Thus, claimant decided to \u201cjust let it slide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Employer received a tip that claimant had taken an extended break that he had not reported. When questioned, claimant admitted that he had taken an extended break and had not arranged to have his recorded work time adjusted. According to the board, claimant was discharged on August 25, 2006, for \u201cviolating [employer\u2019s] timekeeping expectations by taking an extended break that he did not report, as the result of which he received pay for time that he had not worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Claimant applied for unemployment insurance benefits, and his application was denied by the department\u2019s representative. The department determined that claimant had engaged in \u201cmisconduct\u201d under ORS 657.176(2)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cYou were discharged for misconduct connected with your work. Failing to properly record your time records, after being warned, was a wantonly negligent violation of the standards of behavior an employer has the right to expect of an employee.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Claimant appealed, and a hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ). After listening to testimony from a representative of employer and from claimant, the ALJ ruled against claimant, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">\u201cTheft of time was tantamount to unlawful conduct, and it was an act that created an irreparable breach of trust in the employment relationship. It was more severe than an isolated instance of poor judgment. Since the employer discharged claimant, for misconduct, claimant is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Claimant appealed to the board. The board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, concluding that claimant willfully violated employer\u2019s timekeeping standards and, as a result, he was paid for time when he was absent from the workplace, an act tantamount to theft. The board reasoned that claimant violated employer\u2019s \u201ctimekeeping expectations\u201d and the violation was intentional \u201c[a]s a matter of common sense and based on the employer\u2019s discussion with [claimant] in April 2006.\u201d The board found that the misconduct was not an isolated instance of poor judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201cActs that violate the law or that are tantamount to unlawful conduct exceed mere poor judgment. Claimant used 16 minutes of scheduled work time to run a personal errand. He made a conscious decision not to report his extended break. As a result, the employer paid him for the time that he had been absent from the workplace beyond the end of his scheduled break. Claimant\u2019s conduct was tantamount to theft. Therefore, his August 11, 2006 conduct, even though it was a single occurrence, exceeded an isolated instance of poor judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The board considered that outcome to be ordained by the department\u2019s decision in a similar case, <em>Tracee L. Stuart, </em>Director\u2019s Decision (Or Emp Dept, Deborah Lincoln, Sept 15, 2003) <em>(Stuart). </em>In that decision, the department determined that a claimant\u2019s 15-minute absence from the workplace for personal business during work time, although an \u201cisolated occurrence,\u201d was \u201ctantamount to theft.\u201d The department reasoned in <em>Stuart </em>that, by \u201cusing the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>time to engage in her own personal interests, claimant effectively stole time and productivity from the employer\u201d and that the conduct was not an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment.\u201d In the case under review, the board found that there was not \u201cany basis upon which to distinguish claimant\u2019s factual situation from the situation in Stuart\u201d and that it was obliged to \u201cdefer to the [department\u2019s] interpretation of its own rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On review, claimant makes three assignments of error. Claimant first contends that the board erred in concluding that he was discharged for misconduct connected with his work. \u201c[I]n reviewing the board\u2019s decision that a claimant was or was not discharged for misconduct, we review the board\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, and its legal conclusion as a matter of law, with appropriate deference to the authorized representative.\u201d <em>Ring v. Employment </em>Dept., 205 Or App 532, 537, 134 P3d 1096 (2006) (citations omitted). In this case, we review, under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B), to see if the board\u2019s decision is \u201cinconsistent with an agency rule,\u201d i.e., with the requirements of OAR 471-030-0038, bearing in mind that we may not substitute our judgment for that of the department \u201cas to any issue of * * * agency discretion.\u201d ORS 183.482(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Claimant\u2019s second assignment of error contends that the ALJ erred in excluding evidence that employer\u2019s reason for termination was pretextual and in excluding evidence of employer\u2019s past practice regarding extended breaks and claimant\u2019s knowledge of that practice. Claimant\u2019s third, and final, assignment of error is that a factual finding of the ALJ was based on unreliable hearsay evidence and not \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We conclude that the board\u2019s reasoning was incomplete and inconsistent with OAR 471-030-0038 and that the correctness of the proceeding was impaired by the exclusion of relevant evidence from the hearing record. Therefore, a remand is necessary to determine whether the evidence and department policies show that claimant engaged in \u201cmisconduct connected with work\u201d that was not an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Claimant\u2019s contentions arise in the following legal context. Under ORS 657.176(2)(a), a person who \u201c[h]as been discharged for misconduct connected with work\u201d is not entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. The statutory phrase \u201cmisconduct connected with work\u201d is a delegative term under <em>Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 228, 621 P2d 547 (1980) (delegative terms are those that \u201cexpress non-completed legislation in which the agency is given delegated authority to complete\u201d). ORS 657.610(4)(b) confers authority on the department\u2019s director to adopt rules to implement the statutes on unemployment insurance, including defining the meaning of \u201cmisconduct\u201d under ORS 657.176(2)(a). OAR 471-030-0038 contains that definition. We look to the rule, then, to determine the meaning of \u201cmisconduct connected with work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u201cMisconduct\u201d is defined by OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a) as \u201ca willful or wantonly negligent violation of the standards of behavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee\u201d as well as \u201c[a]n act or series of actions that amount to a willful or wantonly negligent disregard of an employer\u2019s interest.\u201d An act that is misconduct, however, can be excused if it is an \u201c[isolated instance[ ] of poor judgment.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(3)(b) provides that \u201c[ijsolated instances of poor judgment [and] good faith errors * * * are not misconduct.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d) defines an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201c(A) The act must be isolated. The exercise of poor judgment must be a single or infrequent occurrence rather than a repeated act or pattern of other willful or wantonly negligent behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">&lt;\u00a3:{; \u2021 # ij:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201c(C) The act must involve poor judgment. A decision to willfully violate an employer\u2019s reasonable standard of behavior is poor judgment. A conscious decision to take action that results in a wantonly negligent violation of an employer\u2019s reasonable standard of behavior is poor judgment. A conscious decision not to comply with an unreasonable employer policy is not misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">\u201c(D) Acts that violate the law, acts that are tantamount to unlawful conduct, acts that create irreparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>breaches of trust in the employment relationship or otherwise make a continued employment relationship impossible exceed mere poor judgment and do not fall within the exculpatory provisions or OAR 471-030-0038(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">We begin our analysis with claimant\u2019s first assignment of error. The board determined that claimant committed \u201cmisconduct\u201d under OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a) because he violated employer\u2019s \u201ctimekeeping expectations\u201d and that the violation was intentional \u201c[a]s a matter of common sense and based on the employer\u2019s discussion with [claimant] in April 2006.\u201d Claimant argues that the record does not contain substantial evidence of employer\u2019s \u201ctimekeeping expectations\u201d and that the board\u2019s findings do not explain what degree of personal use of work time violate the \u201cstandards of behavior which * * * employer has the right to expect\u201d of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We agree that the record is insufficient to determine employer\u2019s \u201ctimekeeping expectations.\u201d We are required to set aside or remand the board\u2019s order if we determine that \u201cthe order is not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c). Substantial evidence exists to support a finding \u201cwhen the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, there was no evidence before the department or in the hearing record that employer had any policy regarding the creation of a time record for extended breaks or the failure to take a break. In terms of the rule, there was no evidence as to the \u201cstandard[ ] of behavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee,\u201d much less a willful violation of that standard. OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Moreover, claimant testified that he was often allowed to take an unreported break by combining two allowed breaks and that he often worked through breaks without reporting the additional time worked. That evidence suggests that employer lacked a policy pertaining to how to accurately report break time and that the policy on work-break reporting was subject to contextual exceptions. Because the evidence does not show the nature of the employer\u2019s policy on reporting breaks, the board\u2019s finding of an intentional violation of \u201ctimekeeping expectations\u201d was not supported by substantial evidence in the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number> The board\u2019s order was also inconsistent with the requirements of OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d), the rule defining \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d as an exception to \u201cmisconduct connected with work.\u201d As noted earlier, the board relied upon the department\u2019s determination in Stuart\u2014that a failure to account for time away from work is not an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d\u2014to control the outcome in this case. In <em>Stuart, </em>the department set out tests for the meaning of \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d that later were codified in its rule at OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d). The department concluded that a failure to properly account for time was \u201ctantamount to theft\u201d under its announced tests because the claimant \u201ceffectively stole time and productivity from the employer.\u201d As noted earlier, OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d)(D), the rule presaged by <em>Stuart, </em>excludes from the definition of \u201cisolated instances of poor judgment\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">\u201cActs that violate the law, acts that are tantamount, to unlawful conduct, acts that create irreparable breaches of trust in the employment relationship or otherwise make a continued employment relationship impossible exceed mere poor judgment and do not fall within the exculpatory provisions of OAR 471-030-0038(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Consequently, the issue is whether the department\u2019s understanding of \u201ctantamount to unlawful conduct\u201d that was announced in <em>Stuart </em>controls. We give deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule if the interpretation is plausible and not inconsistent with the rule itself, the context of the rule, or with some other source of law. <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994). <em>See also Jones v. Employment Dept., </em>199 Or App 571, 576, 112 P3d 453 (2005) (department\u2019s unemployment compensation decision entitled to deference \u201cto the extent that a department\u2019s authorized representative based [the] decision on an interpretation of the department\u2019s own rule defining misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>Stuart, </em>the department interpreted a draft version of OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d)(D) to classify intentional failure to account for employee time as \u201ctantamount to theft\u201d and not an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment.\u201d That interpretation, however, is inconsistent with the context of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>rule\u2014specifically, our interpretation of \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d that preceded the adoption of the riile text. We explained in <em>Freeman v. Employment Dept., </em>195 Or App 417, 98 P3d 402 (2004), which was issued before the adoption of OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d) and after the <em>Stuart </em>decision, that determining the existence of an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d requires an examination of the seriousness of the conduct and the claimant\u2019s mental state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">\u201cWe do not suggest that the severity of conduct or its consequences is immaterial to the issue whether a claimant made a decision involving poor judgment. However, the determination whether an instance of poor judgment has occurred logically involves an examination of the claimant\u2019s decision-making process that led to the conduct or consequences, as well as the nature or gravity of the conduct or consequence itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>Freeman, </em>195 Or App at 424 (citation omitted); <em>see also Callaway v. Employment Dept., </em>225 Or App 650, 654, 202 P3d 196 (2009); <em>Jones, </em>199 Or App at 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In light of that legal context, the application of the rule requires \u201can examination of the claimant\u2019s decision-making process,\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>195 Or App at 424, that led to the act \u201cthat violate[s] the law [or that is] tantamount to unlawful conduct,\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d)(D). Neither the board nor the department engaged in the inquiry prescribed in <em>Freeman. </em>That is, they did not examine claimant\u2019s decision-making process that led to the conduct that purportedly \u201cviolated the law or * * * was tantamount to unlawful conduct.\u201d Claimant testified that he believed it \u201call equaled out\u201d because he rarely took his breaks and therefore \u201cNordstrom would still be ahead on this one because I never took my breaks.\u201d His belief that his employer had not lost anything was relevant to his intent to steal, even if that belief did not excuse his failure to report. An assessment of claimant\u2019s mental state is necessary in order to classify the conduct as unlawful or tantamount to being unlawful. Absent that determination, the issue of whether the conduct is an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment\u201d remains unresolved. A decision denying benefits, but omitting findings on claimant\u2019s intent that are necessary to evaluate whether the conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment,\u201d is not based on substantial reason.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">In sum, the board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence because there was no proof of employer\u2019s timekeeping expectations and the relevant \u201cstandard of behavior\u201d under OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a) to support the board\u2019s findings on \u201cmisconduct.\u201d The order lacks substantial reason because it fails to determine claimant\u2019s state of mind as part of its analysis of whether there was an \u201cisolated instance of poor judgment.\u201d Because of that, the board\u2019s order is inconsistent with the department\u2019s rule under ORS 183.482(8)(b)(B). A remand is necessary so that the board can reconsider the result and its findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">A remand is also necessary to allow evidence that was improperly excluded by the ALJ. Claimant\u2019s second assignment of error contends that the ALJ erred in excluding evidence on the disciplinary actions of employer in other instances of unreported extended breaks. We review that assignment of error for whether the exclusion of evidence was erroneous and whether it \u201csubstantially prejudiced the rights\u201d of claimant, ORS 183.450(1), in order to determine if the exclusion impaired \u201ceither the fairness of the proceedings or the correctness of the action.\u201d ORS 183.482(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The exclusion of the evidence was erroneous. That evidence was relevant to determine the \u201cbehavior which an employer has the right to expect of an employee\u201d as well as the \u201cemployer\u2019s interest\u201d under the definition of \u201cmisconduct\u201d at OAR 471-030-0038(3)(a). The evidence was also material to whether the question of the lack of reporting created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cirreparable breaches of trust in the employment relationship\u201d under OAR 471-030-0038(1)(d)(D). Those issues were fundamental in the contested case, and the evidentiary exclusion prejudiced claimant and impaired the correctness of the action. <em>See Johnson v. Employment Dept., </em>191 Or App 222, 224, 81 P3d 730 (2003) (remand necessary when determination made on inadequate factual record). Claimant\u2019s remaining contentions in his second and third assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\"> The board found the earlier incident occurred on April 28,2006, a few months before the time of the alleged misconduct at issue in this case. The administrative law judge found, and the evidence is unequivocal, that the failure to clock out actually happened in 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\"> The department also determined that, \u201c[w]ithout an admission of the commission of theft or a conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction, benefit rights based on wages earned prior to the date of discharge may not be canceled.\u201d ORS 657.176(3) precludes the denial of unemployment compensation benefits to a person who \u201cwas discharged for misconduct because of the individual\u2019s commission of a felony or theft in connection with the individual\u2019s work\u201d only if the theft is proven by admission or conviction. The department did not determine whether its findings under ORS 657.176(3) affect the application of OAR 471-030-0038(3) in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\"> Our conclusion highlights the factual distinction between the case under review and <em>Stuart. </em>The claimant in <em>Stuart </em>left work for personal reasons without \u201cclocking out.\u201d According to the department\u2019s findings in that case, the claimant \u201cmade a conscious decision not to comply with the employer\u2019s policy and \u201ceffectively stole time and productivity from the employer.\u201d By contrast, claimant here contended that he did not intentionally deprive employer of his work time, because he had overtime credits to spend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> The board also appeared to rely on an incorrect fact, the \u201cemployer\u2019s discussion with [claimant] in April 2006,\u201d in concluding that the misconduct in this case was intentional. On remand, the board can reconsider that part of its decision as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
