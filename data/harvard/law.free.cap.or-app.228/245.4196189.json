He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from a traffic stop, during which a police officer asked defendant about the presence of weapons without having reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed weapons. Defendant argues that that questioning violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that, as a consequence, the trial court should have suppressed the evidence that resulted from his answers to the officer's questions about weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We conclude that the circumstances here are indistinguishable from those presented in our decisions in <em>State v. Kirkeby, </em>220 Or App 177, 185 P3d 510, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 301 (2008), and <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 182 P3d 209, <em>rev allowed, </em>345 Or 301 (2008). <em>See also State v. Weil, </em>225 Or App 65, 200 P3d 164 (2008) (reversing and remanding under <em>Kirkeby </em>and <em>Rodgers </em>denial of motion to suppress where officer asked defendant early in traffic stop about presence of weapons without reasonable suspicion). Hence, we conclude that <em>Kirkeby </em>and <em>Rodgers </em>are controlling and that, based on those decisions, the trial court erred under Article I, section 9, in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
