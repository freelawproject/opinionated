Bruce, </em>201 Or App 295, 118 P3d 279 (2005) <em>(Bruce I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Bruce, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 62 (2008). In <em>Bruce I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on a judicial finding that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Bruce I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"> Defendant was convicted of first-degree theft and felon in possession of a firearm. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court gave the following reason for its decision to impose the departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cOn Count 4 which is the felon in possession of a firearm * * * I\u2019m going to do an upward departure on that. I think that\u2019s appropriate considering your history which is captured in the sentencing grids. But this conviction comes about when you were on supervision, postprison supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">\u201c* * * But for that being on supervision, I think that\u2019s a basis to go up. So it\u2019s going to be 60 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">As we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d Here, it is uncontested that defendant was on supervision at the time he committed his current offense. Defendant had previously been convicted of three felony sex offenses and was on supervision following his release on those convictions; before committing his current offenses, defendant had absconded from supervision and failed to register as a sex offender as required by the terms of his supervision. On this record, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inferences of malevolence and failure to be deterred required by <em>Allen. See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
