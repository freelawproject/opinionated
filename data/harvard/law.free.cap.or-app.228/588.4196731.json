J.</author>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Plaintiff holds a comprehensive general liability insurance policy issued by defendant Red Shield Insurance Company. The policy excludes coverage for claims made by plaintiffs employees, but it covers claims made by \u201ctemporary workers\u201d who are not employees. The policy defines a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d as \u201ca person who is furnished to you\u201d to substitute for a permanent employee who is on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions. The question in this case is whether an individual whom plaintiff hired directly, and who has filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against plaintiff for on-the-job injuries, is an \u201cemployee\u201d or a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy. Red Shield contends that the individual is an employee, not a temporary worker, because the worker was not \u201ca person who [was] furnished\u201d to plaintiff by a third party, such as an employment agency. Plaintiff insists that the individual is a temporary worker within the meaning of the policy because he was \u201ca person who [was] furnished\u201d to plaintiff by the worker himself. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court agreed with plaintiff, and Red Shield appeals, arguing that the trial court\u2019s decision is contrary to the plain meaning of the policy. We agree with defendant and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The relevant facts are uncontested. Plaintiff owns and operates Oregon Tree and Shrubbery Specialists. During the time pertinent to this case, he was insured under a comprehensive general liability insurance policy issued by Red Shield. The policy excluded coverage for employment-related injuries, including \u201cany obligation the insured might have under the workers\u2019 compensation laws, disability benefits or unemployment compensation,\u201d and any claim for bodily injury to an employee \u201carising out of and in the course of\u2019 employment or the performance of duties related to the insured\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The policy defined \u201cemployee\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 includes \u2018leased worker\u2019. \u2018Employee\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Thus, under the policy, a \u201cleased worker\u201d is an employee; however, a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d is not an employee and is therefore not excluded from coverage under the policy. The policy defined a \u201cleased worker\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">\u201ca person leased to you by a labor leasing firm under an agreement between you and the labor leasing firm, to perform duties related to the conduct of your business. \u2018Leased worker\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The policy defined a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201ca person who is furnished to you to substitute for a permanent \u2018employee\u2019 on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In October 2002, plaintiff hired Mize to work for him cutting and trimming trees and shrubs. Plaintiff hired Mize himself; he did not go through an employment agency, labor contractor, or any other entity to obtain Mize\u2019s services. Mize worked for plaintiff continuously from October 2002 to December 23, 2003, when he fell from a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Mize filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and recovered benefits for partial disability. In the course of that process, the Department of Consumer and Business Services determined that plaintiff was a noncomplying employer. Plaintiff disputes that determination, and it is stayed at the administrative level pending the outcome of this litigation. In light of plaintiffs noncomplying employer status, Mize brought an action against plaintiff for negligence and employer liability. <em>See </em>ORS 656.578 (worker of noncomplying employer entitled to seek damages from employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Plaintiff turned to Red Shield for defense and indemnity. Red Shield refused to defend or indemnify plaintiff, citing the policy\u2019s exclusions for employment-related injuries. Plaintiff then initiated this action for a declaration that Red Shield is obligated to defend and indemnify on the ground that, because Mize was a \u201ctemporary worker,\u201d his claim is subject to the policy\u2019s exception from the exclusion for employment-related injuries. As we have noted, the trial court determined that Mize was a temporary worker within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the meaning of the policy and that Red Shield was therefore required to defend and indemnify plaintiff against any liability to Mize.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">On appeal, Red Shield contends that the trial court erred in concluding that Mize was a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy. According to Red Shield, Mize cannot be regarded as a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d because he was not \u201ca person who [was] furnished to [plaintiff]\u201d; rather, plaintiff hired Mize directly. Even if the trial court correctly determined that, in some sense, Mize \u201cfurnished\u201d himself to plaintiff, Red Shield argues, Mize still is not a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy because he was not furnished to meet seasonal or short-term workload needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Plaintiff responds that, because the policy\u2019s requirement that a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d have been \u201cfurnished to [plaintiff]\u201d is ambiguous, the policy must be construed in favor of coverage. Plaintiff asserts that the policy is ambiguous in at least two ways. First, he contends, it is not clear that the phrase \u201ca person furnished to you\u201d even is relevant in this case. According to plaintiff, the policy definition of \u201ctemporary worker\u201d could be read to apply to <em>any </em>person who was hired to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions, regardless of who furnished the worker. Second, plaintiff contends that\u2014assuming that the worker must have been \u201cfurnished to\u201d the employer\u2014it is still unclear whether the worker may not \u201cfurnish\u201d himself. In addition, plaintiff contends that the record makes clear that Mize was hired only on a project-by-project basis, to meet short-term workload needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Thus framed, the parties\u2019 contentions require us to interpret the terms of the insurance policy, which we do in accordance with the interpretive principles set out in <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469-70, 836 P2d 703 (1992). Under <em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>our goal is to ascertain the intention of the parties \u201cbased on the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. We begin with the wording of the policy, applying any definitions contained in the policy and otherwise presuming that words have their plain, ordinary meanings. <em>Id. </em>at 469-70. If, from that vantage point, there is only one plausible interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of the disputed terms, our analysis goes no further. <em>Id. </em>If, however, we determine that the disputed term is susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation, we examine the term in the broader context of the policy as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 470. If our consideration of the policy\u2019s broader context fails to resolve the ambiguity, then we will construe the policy against the drafter, in this case, Red Shield. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71. In all events, the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law that is confined to the four corners of the policy without regard to extrinsic evidence. <em>Andres v. American Standard Ins. Co., </em>205 Or App 419, 424, 134 P3d 1061 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">At the outset, we summarily reject plaintiffs contention that the policy\u2019s definition of \u201ctemporary worker\u201d may be read to apply to <em>any </em>person who has been hired to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions, regardless of who furnished the worker. The wording of the policy simply cannot reasonably be read to say that. It plainly and unambiguously provides that a temporary worker is \u201ca person who is furnished to you\u201d either to substitute for a permanent employee or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions. The reference to meeting seasonal or short-term workload conditions refers to the purpose for which the worker has been \u201cfurnished to\u201d the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We turn to the question of the meaning of the reference to \u201ca person who is furnished to you,\u201d and whether it encompasses a worker who plaintiff hired directly, without the use of an employment agency or any other entity that supplies the worker. We agree with Red Shield that there is only one plausible reading of the policy in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The word \u201cfurnished\u201d is not defined in the policy. \u201cIf the term at issue is not defined in the policy, the next step is to look to the plain meaning of the term.\u201d <em>North Clackamas School Dist. No. 12 v. OSBA, </em>164 Or App 339, 344, 991 P2d 1089 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 361 (2000). <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>923 (unabridged ed 2002) defines \u201cfurnish\u201d as \u201cto provide or supply with what is needed.\u201d Under that definition, the person who \u201cfurnishes\u201d is the party who provides or supplies what is needed. In the context of human labor, it is conceivable\u2014as plaintiff suggests\u2014that a person can provide or supply himself or herself to an employer. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>however, the question is not what a single word in a policy means in the abstract, but what that term most likely was intended to mean when viewed in the context in which the term is used in the policy as a whole. 313 Or at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In context, plaintiffs proposed reading of the term \u201cfurnished\u201d becomes untenable, because it renders the entire phrase \u201ca person furnished to you\u201d superfluous. If plaintiff is correct that a temporary worker is a worker who furnishes himself or herself to the employer, then the words \u201ca person who is furnished to you\u201d are unnecessary. If they are omitted, the definition has the same meaning: <em>Any </em>person who works for the insured on a seasonal basis or who fills in for another employee would be a temporary worker. In determining whether a phrase is ambiguous, we do not lightly assume that contract language is superfluous. <em>Id. </em>For that reason, we conclude that the phrase \u201ca person who is furnished to you\u201d as used in the definition of temporary worker means a person who is referred from, or provided by, a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We note, in passing, that our interpretation of the policy is consistent with the decisions of many other jurisdictions that have considered the meaning of identical policy language and for precisely the same reasons that we have identified. <em>See, e.g., Northland Cas. Co. v. Meeks, </em>540 F3d 869, 875 (8th Cir 2008) (\u201cWe believe that the term \u2018furnished to,\u2019 in the context of the Policy\u2019s definition of \u2018temporary worker,\u2019 \u2018is not ambiguous and necessarily implies that a third party has been involved in providing or supplying the worker to the insured.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gavan v. Bituminous Cas. Corp., </em>242 SW3d 718, 721 (Mo 2008))); <em>Carl\u2019s Italian Restaurant v. Truck Ins. Exchange, </em>183 P3d 636, 639 (Colo Ct App 2007) (\u201c[I]n the context of the insurance policy, we conclude that plaintiffs interpretation is unreasonable. If a person could furnish himself to an employer, every worker could choose to \u2018furnish himself * * * and become a \u2018temporary worker\u2019 whenever such classification would be convenient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Because plaintiff hired Mize directly and not with the aid of a third party, Mize was not a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d within the meaning of the policy, and coverage of his claims against plaintiff is excluded. The trial court therefore erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and denying Red Shield\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
