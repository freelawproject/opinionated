In <em>State v. Mills, </em>219 Or App 225, 182 P3d 889 (2008), we granted defendant\u2019s petition for reconsideration, vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Mills, </em>215 Or App 112, 168 P3d 338 (2007), and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007). <em>Ice, </em>however, subsequently was reversed. <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009). The state now argues that, in light of <em>Ice, </em>our remand for resentencing was erroneous. The state is correct that the case is controlled by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ice. </em>Accordingly, on reconsideration, we withdraw our former opinion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
