J.</author>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Fanning, </em>206 Or App 584, 138 P3d 61 (2006) <em>(Fanning I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Fanning, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 62 (2008). In <em>Fanning I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial factfinding. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Fanning I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Defendant was convicted in two separate charges of second-degree burglary and two counts of invasion of privacy. At the consolidated sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed a dispositional and durational departure sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment on defendant\u2019s second-degree burglary conviction. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose the departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cWell, [defendant], you know, I\u2019m substantially disappointed here. I do want to point out that I try and pay attention to these matters when they arise, in particular to give you the benefit of the doubt if you are convicted of something. And I did that in regards to this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">\u201c* * * I continued you on probation to give you the opportunity to complete that sex offender treatment [for a separate prior conviction] * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\u00ed&lt;\u00ed*\u00ed \u00edj\u00ed sjc \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cAnd what\u2019s important for me to note to the record from the files that I have in my presence is that you were talking about your failure to enroll in the proper treatment program that you were sentenced to participate in * * *. So I think it\u2019s fair criticism that you have failed to take the steps necessary to attempt to rehabilitate yourself. And that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>particularly aggravated where that occurs in the context of your engaging in substantially similar behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what [defendant] did before. [Defendant] was waiting in a bathroom, engaging in sexual behavior \u2014 or, a woman\u2019s bathroom, to observe other people, and for purposes of arousal. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same thing [as defendant\u2019s current conviction] under just a modicum of difference in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cOn that basis, I\u2019ll find that there is grounds to both dis-positionally and durationally depart. He is, without dispute, a 2-F on the Burglary charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">\u201cIn that particular instance, I\u2019ll find that a dispositional departure to a prison sentence is appropriate based upon the fact that these events occurred while he was on probation. It doesn\u2019t matter that he was on probation for a similar offense. That just increases the fact that it warrants a dis-positional departure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201cThe durational departure from the maximum sentence is appropriate, because he has completely avoided efforts to rehabilitate himself, despite having several opportunities through the Probation Department, despite a significant amount of time. So, on that basis, I find that a durational and a dispositional departure is appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">On this record, we conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found the departure factors relied on by the trial court. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). With regard to the durational departure factor\u2014defendant\u2019s post-prison supervision status at the time he committed his current offenses\u2014as we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d Here, as the trial court noted, defendant was on post-prison supervision for a prior conviction for a very similar offense \u2014 invasion of privacy committed by observing women in restrooms \u2014 when he committed his current crimes. The court\u2019s recitation, which defendant did not contest, convinces us that the jury would have drawn the inferences of malevolence and failure to be deterred required by <em>Allen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">With regard to the durational departure factor\u2014 defendant\u2019s avoidance of opportunities to rehabilitate himself \u2014 we similarly conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that departure factor. As the trial court pointed out to defendant, it had continued his probation on the earlier conviction in order to afford defendant the opportunity to enroll in sex offender treatment. Defendant failed to do so and instead decided to commit a substantially identical crime. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
