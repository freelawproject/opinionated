In reviewing the record, we agree with defendant. The sentence imposed on Count 9 of the indictment was a <em>consecutive </em>12-month sentence, not a \u201cconsecutive <em>departure </em>sentence.\u201d Our erroneous description of defendant\u2019s sentence on Count 9 had no effect on our analysis in the remainder of the opinion. Accordingly, we adhere to our opinion as modified to correct the description of defendant\u2019s sentence on Count 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
