The board concluded that claimant\u2019s injuries did not occur \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment, as required by ORS 656.005(7)(a), because claimant was engaged in an activity\u2014fighting\u2014that was prohibited by employer and was beyond the boundaries of his ultimate work. Claimant contends that, because the compensability of injuries resulting from \u201cassaults or combats\u201d is addressed in a separate statutory provision, ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A), it is not a proper consideration under ORS 656.005(7)(a). He argues that the board erred in considering the fact that he was fighting in determining whether he was injured in the course of his employment and in concluding that his injuries were not connected to his work and therefore not compensable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We state the material facts consistently with the board\u2019s findings. <em>Sisco v. Quicker </em>Recovery, 218 Or App 376, 378, 180 P3d 46 (2008). When he was injured, claimant worked in employer\u2019s warehouse. Employer had a written rule prohibiting \u201c[flighting or threatening violence in the workplace.\u201d A report written by the warehouse manager after claimant was injured states, \u201cAll warehouse employees know that there is a no tolerance policy for violence in the workplace in or on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Claimant was injured in a fight with a coworker, Griffin. The hostility between claimant and Griffin was initially unrelated to their employment. It began as a dispute that they had in claimant\u2019s home, where Griffin had stayed for a few days. However, the hostility followed them into the workplace and was fueled by their work relationship, particularly after Griffin was promoted to a position in which he directed claimant in some of his job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">One evening, as claimant was leaving work, he found Griffin waiting for him near his truck in employer\u2019s parking lot. Griffin told claimant that he was tired of claimant trying to take his job. A confrontation ensued, and the two began fighting. In the fight, claimant sustained injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>including a fractured hand. Both men were fired the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for his injuries from the fight. Employer\u2019s insurer, SAIF, denied the claim. After a hearing on the claim, the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that the injuries were compensable and set aside SAIF\u2019s denial. SAIF requested board review of the ALJ\u2019s order. SAIF argued that the claim should be denied under ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A), which provides that a compen-sable injury does not include an \u201c[ijnjury to any active participant in assaults or combats which are not connected to the job assignment and which amount to a deviation from customary duties!.]\u201d SAIF also argued that claimant\u2019s injuries did not \u201carise out of and in the course of\u2019 his employment and thus were not compensable injuries under ORS 656.005(7)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The board stated that it did not need to decide whether claimant\u2019s injuries were excluded from compensability under ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A), because it was not persuaded that the claim satisfied the requirements for com-pensability under ORS 656.005(7)(a). It concluded that the injuries did arise out of claimant\u2019s employment, given that the conflict between the two men was fueled by Griffin\u2019s position directing claimant in his work duties. However, it concluded that the injuries did not occur in the course of claimant\u2019s employment. After noting that employer had a rule against fighting, the board reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cA violation of an employment rule does not render a claim <em>per se </em>noncompensable. Instead, the focus is on whether the claimant was engaged in an activity that was within the boundaries of his ultimate work. <em>Andrews [v.Tektronix, Inc., </em>323 Or 154, 166, 915 P2d 972 (1996)]. Additional relevant factors include \u2018the degree of connection between what the worker is authorized to do and is forbidden to do, the degree of judgment and latitude normally given the worker, workplace customs and practices, the relative risk to the worker when compared to the benefit to the employer, and the like.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 165.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cClaimant\u2019s job duties included loading and unloading mattresses from trucks to the warehouse, labeling products, filling orders for customer pick-up, and cleaning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>warehouse. He was not \u2018authorized\u2019 to fight as part of his work duties. To the contrary, as noted above, the employer had a rule prohibiting fighting and threatening violence in general. Claimant\u2019s manager had also instructed claimant and Griffin not to fight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\u201cIn addition, fighting put claimant at considerable risk of injury while the employer did not benefit from his altercation with Griffin in the parking lot. Finally, the record does not support a finding that it was part of the workplace \u2018custom and practice\u2019 to participate in such physical altercations. In light of the foregoing, we find that the fight was beyond the bounds of claimant\u2019s ultimate work, and not within the course of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">(Record citations omitted.) The board went on the note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cclaimant acted contrary to his job responsibilities when he disobeyed a directive of the employer not to fight with Griffin. Claimant\u2019s actions, namely, actively fighting with Griffin in the parking lot, were \u2018more than a violation of a regulation or prohibition relating to the method of accomplishing his work.\u2019 Claimant acted against the employer\u2019s benefit and specific directive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Based on those factors, the board concluded that claimant\u2019s injuries are not compensable, and it reinstated SAIF\u2019s denial of his claim. Claimant now seeks review of the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Claimant makes two assignments of error, which we address in turn. In the first, he argues that the board erred in considering the fact that he was fighting in determining whether his injuries occurred in the course of his employment. Claimant relies on ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201c \u2018Compensable injury does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">\u201c(A) Injury to any active participant in assaults or combats which are not connected to the job assignment and which amount to a deviation from customary duties[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">As we understand his argument, claimant takes the position that ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A) defines the only circumstances under which injuries resulting from assaults or combats are not compensable. He therefore contends that it is inappropriate to consider the fact that he was fighting with Griffin for purposes of determining whether he was acting outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>boundaries of his ultimate work when he was injured. According to claimant, the legislature has \u201coccupied the field\u201d in terms of determining whether injuries caused by combats are compensable. He contends that an employer should not be able to further restrict the compensability of such injuries by relying on rules against fighting to assert that an injured employee was acting outside the scope of employment, even if the injury would not be excluded from compensability under ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A). Thus, in claimant\u2019s view, the analysis of the \u201cin the course of\u2019 and \u201carising out of\u2019 elements of the work-connection test under ORS 656.005(7)(a) should not include any consideration of the \u201ccombat\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">SAIF responds, first, that claimant\u2019s argument is unpreserved. On the merits, it contends that ORS 656.005(7)(a) provides the primary definition of compensability, that the various exclusions in ORS 656.005(7)(b) provide additional, independent bases for finding an injury noncom-pensable, and that there is no inconsistency in considering workplace fights under both provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">We agree with SAIF\u2019s contention that the assignment of error is unpreserved. Claimant contends that the issue did not arise until the board issued its order, in which it failed to consider the exclusion from compensability of combats and assaults under ORS 656.005(7)(b)(A) in determining whether claimant was injured in the course of his employment. He argues, therefore, that preservation principles do not preclude him from raising the issue in this court. We disagree. SAIF argued in its opening brief to the board that claimant was injured while engaged in a prohibited activity\u2014fighting\u2014outside the boundaries of his ultimate work and, thus, that his claim is not compensable. Claimant responded that the \u201cprohibited activity\u201d analysis is inapplicable, albeit not for the reason that he now asserts. Rather, he argued that there was no evidence that he was aware of the rule, that he was not \u201cin the workplace\u201d when the injuries occurred, and that he had not been fighting. In short, the question whether employer\u2019s rule against fighting placed the injury-producing activity outside the course of claimant\u2019s employment did not arise for the first time when the board issued its order. Claimant\u2019s argument to the contrary is not well taken. We decline to consider his first assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>error and, consequently, proceed with the assumption that the board properly considered the fact that claimant was fighting in determining whether he was injured in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">In his second assignment of error, claimant contends that the board erred in concluding that his injuries did not occur in the course of his employment, for several reasons. First, according to claimant, for the reasons asserted in his first assignment of error, the board erred in ruling that, because the violation of employer\u2019s \u201cno fighting\u201d rule placed the injury-producing conduct beyond the bounds of claimant\u2019s ultimate work, the injuries are not compensable. Our disposition of the first assignment of error also disposes of that argument. Claimant argues further that substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s \u201cbasic premise and underlying assumption\u201d that he was violating employer\u2019s rule against fighting when he was injured. He notes that the written rule applied only to \u201c[flighting or threatening violence <em>in the </em>workplace\u201d (claimant\u2019s emphasis), and asserts that the parking lot, where the fight occurred, was not part of the workplace. He contends that any ambiguity in the meaning of \u201cworkplace\u201d must be construed against employer, the author of the rule. Finally, claimant contends that his injuries occurred in the course of his employment under the \u201cparking lot\u201d rule, which we discuss further below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Claimant\u2019s argument that substantial evidence does not support the board\u2019s finding that he was violating employer\u2019s rule against fighting when he was injured requires little discussion. \u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c). Even if we were to accept claimant\u2019s interpretation of employer\u2019s written rule prohibiting fighting \u201cin the workplace,\u201d the record includes a written report made by the manager at the warehouse after claimant was injured. The report states, \u201cAll warehouse employees know that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>no tolerance policy for violence in the workplace <em>in or on the property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In our view, in light of that statement, a reasonable person could find that the rule against fighting extended to the entire premises, including the parking lot, not just to the warehouse in which claimant actually performed his job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We turn finally to claimant\u2019s argument that his injuries are compensable under the \u201cparking lot\u201d rule. Under that rule, \u201cinjuries sustained on the employer\u2019s premises while the worker is going to or coming from work have a sufficient work-connection to be considered to have occurred \u2018in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 597-98, 943 P2d 197 (1997). Claimant notes that the board found that fighting was not part of his work duties or of a workplace custom or practice and that fighting put claimant at risk without benefitting employer, and it thus concluded that he was acting \u201cbeyond the bounds of [his] ultimate work, and not within the course of [his] employment.\u201d Claimant contends that, because he was injured in the parking lot after work, not while performing a work task, there is no point in considering whether he was acting outside the boundaries defining his ultimate work. We agree that, under the circumstances, the factors that aid in determining whether a claimant was engaged in work activities are inapposite, but that conclusion does not advance claimant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Hayes, </em>an injury takes place in the course of employment if it occurs \u201cwhile the worker reasonably is fulfilling the duties of the employment <em>or is doing something reasonably incidental to it.\u201d </em>325 Or at 598 (emphasis added). The court noted that \u201c \u2018[i]n the course of employment also includes a reasonable period of time after work for the worker to leave the employer\u2019s premises, including the employer\u2019s parking lot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It went on to explain that \u201creasonably incidental to\u201d employment includes \u201cactivities that are personal in nature\u2014such as a telephone call home or a brief visit with a coworker\u2014as long as the conduct bears some reasonable relationship to the employment and is expressly or impliedly allowed by the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>The fact that an injury occurs in the employer\u2019s parking lot does not exempt it from the requirement that the injury occur \u201cwhile the worker reasonably is fulfilling the duties of the employment or is doing something reasonably incidental to it.\u201d The \u201cparking lot\u201d rule does not stand for the proposition that <em>any </em>activity engaged in by an employee in the employer\u2019s parking lot when leaving work occurs in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">As claimant himself asserts, he was not fulfilling the duties of his employment when he was injured. Thus, he was acting in the course of his employment only if he was doing something reasonably incidental to it. Consistently with the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of \u201creasonably incidental,\u201d in the context of an activity that is not \u201cfulfilling the duties of employment,\u201d if an employee was injured while engaged in an activity that was neither expressly nor impliedly allowed by the employer\u2014or, as in this case, was <em>prohibited </em>by the employer\u2014that injury cannot be deemed to have occurred in the course of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In this case, the board found that claimant was injured while engaged in an activity that employer expressly prohibited, and substantial evidence supports that finding. It follows that the activity was not reasonably incidental to claimant\u2019s employment and that the \u201cparking lot\u201d rule does not apply. Because claimant was not \u201cfulfilling the duties of the employment or * * * doing something reasonably incidental to it,\u201d his injuries did not occur in the course of his employment. Accordingly, they are not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> Claimant also argues that the board erred in even considering whether his injuries occurred in the course of his employment, contending that SAIF conceded that issue before the ALJ and, thus, that it was not properly before the board. Claimant did not argue to the board that the issue was not properly before it, so we decline to consider the argument as it is unpreserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> <em>Cf.
