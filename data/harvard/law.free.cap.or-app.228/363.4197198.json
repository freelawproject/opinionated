In <em>State v. Nelson, </em>224 Or App 193, 197 P3d 1130 (2008), we affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction but remanded for resentencing in light of <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>rev\u2019d and rent\u2019d sub nom Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009). The state now argues that, in light of the United State\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ice, </em>our remand for resentencing was erroneous. The state is correct that the case is now controlled by that decision. Accordingly, we modify our opinion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former disposition withdrawn; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
