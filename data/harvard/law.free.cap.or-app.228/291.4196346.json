We write to address only defendant\u2019s second assignment of error and conclude that the trial court properly imposed \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentences, because, in convicting defendant on those counts, the jury necessarily found that he used or threatened to use a firearm in committing those offenses. <em>See State v. Akin, </em>125 Or App 351, 865 P2d 461 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 478 (1994). Accordingly, we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The relevant facts are procedural in nature and are undisputed. Defendant was charged with, <em>inter alia, </em>three counts of \u201cunlawful use of dangerous weapon <em>with a firearm\u201d </em>(Counts 3, 5, and 7) (emphasis added) and two counts of attempted assault in the first degree (Counts 4 and 6). <em>See </em>ORS 166.220; ORS 161.405; ORS 163.185.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On each count of attempted assault in the first degree, the state alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and intentionally attempt to cause serious physical injury to [victim] by means of a deadly and/ or dangerous weapon, to-wit: A FIREARM.\u201d On each count of unlawful use of dangerous weapon with a firearm, the state alleged that defendant \u201cdid possess with intent to use unlawfully against [victim] a deadly and/or dangerous weapon, to-wit: A FIREARM.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">At trial, two of the victims testified that defendant used a firearm. One of the victims testified that defendant \u201cshot\u201d him and another testified that defendant \u201cstarted shooting at us.\u201d The state established through several witnesses\u2019 testimony that defendant used a gun. In addition, one of the officers testified that \u201cthe gun used was a .22 caliber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The court instructed the jury on each count of the indictment. With respect to each of the three counts of unlawful use of dangerous weapon with a firearm, the court, titling the offense \u201cunlawful use of a weapon,\u201d instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of unlawful use of a weapon if the person attempts to use unlawfully against another any dangerous or deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">\u201cIn this case, to establish the crime of unlawful use of a weapon, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following three elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201c(1) The act occurred in Deschutes County, Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201c(2) The act occurred on or about March 22, 2006; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c(3) [Defendant] intentionally attempted to use unlawfully against [victim] any dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The court also instructed, the jury as follows on each of the two counts of attempted assault in the first degree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of attempted assault in the first degree if the person intentionally attempts to cause serious physical injury to another by means of a dangerous or deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">\u201cIn this case, to establish attempted assault in the first degree, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following three elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">\u201c(1) The act occurred in Deschutes County, Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201c(2) The act occurred on or about March 22, 2006; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">\u201c(3) [Defendant] intentionally attempted to cause serious physical injury to [victim] by means of a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">Those jury instructions did not include the element of \u201cuse or threatened use of a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The court also defined the terms \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d and \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d for the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">\u201cThe term <em>dangerous weapon </em>means any instrument, article, or substance which, under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used, or threatened to be used, is readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201cThe term <em>deadly weapon </em>means any instrument, article, or substance specifically designed for and presently capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The verdict form denominated Counts 3, 5, and 7 \u201cUNLAWFUL USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON WITH A FIREARM\u201d but did not otherwise refer to \u201ca firearm,\u201d including in its captions pertaining to Counts 4 and 6. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on, <em>inter alia, </em>Counts 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">At sentencing, the state urged the trial court to impose a minimum sentence on each of those counts pursuant to ORS 161.610(3), which, as noted, applies \u201cif a defendant is convicted of a felony <em>having as an element the defendant\u2019s use or threatened use of a firearm </em>during the commission of the crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Defendant objected to the imposition of a minimum sentence, arguing that the element \u201cuse or threatened use of a firearm\u201d was not properly presented to the jury. That is, according to defendant, in order to impose a minimum sentence pursuant to ORS 161.610(3), a jury must make the finding that a firearm was used and, because the court did not instruct the jury that it was required to make that finding in order to convict defendant, the jury could have convicted defendant without having made such a finding. The state responded that the language on the verdict form for all counts, and, particularly, the words \u201cwith a firearm\u201d on the verdict form for the three counts of unlawful use of a dangerous weapon with a firearm, was sufficient to satisfy the requisites for imposition of a minimum sentence pursuant to ORS 161.610.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The trial court reasoned that \u201cthe jury verdict form clearly spells out that it was with a firearm, and the \u2014 and the jury found it was with a firearm. And as a result, I am going to impose 60 months for the firearm \u2014 for the use of a firearm * * *.\u201d The trial court thus imposed \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentences of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to ORS 161.610 on Counts 3 through 7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>On appeal, defendant renews his contentions made before the trial court at the sentencing hearing. Specifically, defendant contends that, because the jury instructions on Counts 3 through 7 did not include the element of \u201cuse or threatened use of a firearm,\u201d the jury did not necessarily find that element and, thus, the imposition of the \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence pursuant to ORS 161.610 is improper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">ORS 161.610(3) authorizes the imposition of a minimum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment \u201cif a defendant is convicted of a felony <em>having as an element the defendant\u2019s use or threatened use of a firearm </em>during the commission of the crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Akin </em>is dispositive. There, the defendant was indicted for, <em>inter alia, </em>assault in the second degree with a firearm. 125 Or App at 353 n 1. The only evidence that the state presented pertaining to the defendant\u2019s use of a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d was that the defendant fired a shotgun \u2014 and the defendant \u201ctestified that that is what he did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354. The trial court instructed the jury that, to find the defendant guilty, it was required to find that he \u201cintentionally attempted to cause physical injury to [the victim] by means of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets in <em>Akin). </em>The court defined the terms \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d and \u201cfirearm\u201d for the jury. However, the trial court did <em>not </em>instruct the jury that it must find that the defendant \u201cuse[d] or threatened use of a firearm\u201d as an element of the offense. The jury convicted the defendant, and the trial court imposed a gun minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>On appeal, the defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s imposition of the gun minimum sentence, arguing that the use or threatened use of a firearm was not an element of the crime for which he was found guilty. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances \u2014 including the defendant\u2019s admission that he had, in fact, fired a shotgun at the victim \u2014 the court\u2019s instructions \u201cplaced the issue of defendant\u2019s use of a firearm before the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354. Accordingly, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s imposition of the \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The circumstances in this case are directly analogous to those in <em>Akin. </em>The indictment in this case alleged defendant\u2019s use of a firearm on Counts 3 through 7. With respect to attempted assault in the first degree, the jury was instructed that it must find that defendant \u201cintentionally attempted to cause serious physical injury to [victim] by means of a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d Similarly, with respect to the \u201cunlawful use of a weapon,\u201d the jury was instructed that it must find that defendant \u201cintentionally attempted to use unlawfully against [victim] any dangerous or deadly weapon.\u201d The court defined the terms \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d and \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d for the jury. Although the jury was never instructed that it was required to find that defendant used or threatened to use a firearm in order to convict him of the offenses charged, the <em>only </em>(and uncontroverted) evidence adduced at trial pertaining to use of a dangerous or deadly weapon referred to defendant\u2019s use of a .22 caliber gun \u2014 a \u201cfirearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Thus, here, as in <em>Akin, </em>on the record the jury, in convicting defendant on the charges for which a gun minimum sentence was imposed, <em>necessarily </em>found that he \u201cuse[d] or threatened to use\u201d a firearm in committing those offenses. The jury could not have convicted defendant otherwise. <em>Cf. State v. Thiehoff, </em>169 Or App 630, 635-37, 10 P3d 322 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 137 (2001) (reversing imposition of \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence based on the jury\u2019s general verdict, because trial court\u2019s jury instruction on alternative theory of aiding and abetting allowed jury to convict the defendant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>charged offense without necessarily finding that the defendant <em>personally </em>used or threatened to use a firearm).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\"> The indictment, verdict form, and judgment included the phrase \u201cwith a firearm\u201d in the caption of the three counts of unlawful use of dangerous weapon with a firearm.

Quintero-Martinez, </em>220 Or App 497, 500, 188 P3d 350, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 318 (2008) (imposition of multiple \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentences is \u201cplain error\u201d). Here, defendant does not raise such a challenge by way of ORAP 5.45(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\"> The state fails to respond to the substance of defendant\u2019s contentions on appeal. Although defendant\u2019s argument to the trial court and on appeal is a statutory argument based on ORS 161.610, the state misconstrues that argument as being predicated solely on the constitutional principles enunciated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). Given that understanding, the state\u2019s only response on appeal is that any Blakely-related error by the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because no reasonable juror could conclude anything other than that defendant personally used a firearm. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d, to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Under ORS 161.610(3), a jury\u2019s failure to find the element of \u201cuse or threatened use of a <em>firearm\u201dprecludes the imposition </em>of a \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence. <em>See State v. Thiehoff, </em>169 Or App 630, 635-36,10 P3d 322 (2000), <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 137 (2001). Accordingly, the state\u2019s invocation of \u201charmless error\u201d is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b331-5\"> Although we affirm the trial court\u2019s imposition of the \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentences, we do not agree with its reasoning for doing so. The fact that the verdict form for the three counts of unlawful use of dangerous weapon with a firearm included in the caption of the offense the words \u201cwith a firearm\u201d is immaterial. Jurors are not instructed to render findings as to the captions in the verdict form. Furthermore, that reasoning could not justify the imposition of the \u201cgun minimum\u201d sentence on the two counts of attempted assault in the first degree, because those jury instructions did not include the words \u201cwith a firearm\u201d in the caption of the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
