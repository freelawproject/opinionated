In that decision, we concluded that, based on the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>rev\u2019d and rent\u2019d, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences based on its own findings of fact was plain error. The state now argues that, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of the Oregon court\u2019s decision, we should reconsider. We agree. Under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the imposition of consecutive sentences was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified; former disposition withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
