In particular, petitioner asserts that our rejection of that assignment was based on the erroneous belief that petitioner did not dispute the timeliness of the five charges on which Portland State University (PSU) had based its decision to expel him as a student. We agree with petitioner that we erred in that understanding\u2014 that is, that petitioner did in fact dispute the timeliness of all of the charges. Accordingly, we allow reconsideration to once again address the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In that assignment, petitioner challenges the denial of his motion to quash the contested case proceeding against him on the ground that it was untimely. He relies on a PSU administrative rule that was in effect at the time of the charged conduct that imposed a six-month time limit on the application of the PSU code to students. PSU amended the rule while the charges were pending against petitioner to eliminate the six-month time limit. Relying on <em>Guerrero v. AFSD, </em>67 Or App 119, 676 P2d 928 (1984), petitioner contends that the change in the rule during the pendency of the proceedings violated the notice requirements in ORS 183.413 for contested cases as well as unspecified provisions of the state or federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We conclude that the change in the rule during the pendency of the contested case proceedings did not violate ORS 183.413. Furthermore, because petitioner did not identify a constitutional source for his contention that the change in the rule violated the state or federal constitution, we do not address that issue. We therefore reject petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
