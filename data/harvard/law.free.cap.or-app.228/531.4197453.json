J.</author>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Defendant, alone in his home and contemplating suicide, stepped onto his porch and opened fire on police officers who had been dispatched to his home in response to a call from his family. Defendant rapidly fired four or five rounds from a pump-action shotgun and, as the officers retreated behind their vehicles, one of them was wounded by the gunfire. Defendant subsequently surrendered and, after a jury trial, was convicted of attempted aggravated murder, attempted felony murder, and second-degree assault. He now appeals, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to dismiss a juror, a retired police officer with 30 years\u2019 experience who, one day into the trial, came forward and told the court, \u201c[A]fter sleeping on it and getting up this morning and struggling with some things, I d[on\u2019t] feel like I should sit on\u2014this particular case.\u201d We reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Because this case turns on the statements made by a juror, T, we describe them in some detail. At <em>voir dire, </em>prospective jurors were asked, as a pool, whether \u201c[a]nything about a police officer being shot * * * just strike[s] a chord with you that you don\u2019t think that you could be fair in a type of case like this.\u201d Defense counsel then asked T directly whether, as a former police officer, he could be fair. T replied, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be as fair as I can.\u201d Counsel then asked T whether \u201c[a]nything in your experience will affect your ability to be fair and impartial.\u201d and T again answered, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll try to be as fair as I can.\u201d T was seated as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The next day, after the trial had commenced and the first witness had finished testifying, T approached the court clerk and asked to speak with the judge. The judge brought T to the courtroom where both the prosecutor and defense counsel could question him on the record. T told the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cWell, I was surprised that I was not taken\u2014removed from the jury list with my background, but when I was chosen to be a juror I just decided I would go ahead and make the best of it. But after sleeping on it and getting up this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>morning and having some thoughts and maybe some judgments just based on what I\u2019ve seen so far that I really shouldn\u2019t be making I think because of my background. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">\u201cI don\u2019t have any problems serving on the jury! I just don\u2019t think I should be on a jury that involves assault on police officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The court then told T that it could not expect him to set aside his experiences as a police officer but that, instead, T should focus on setting aside \u201cany potential biases for or against either side, listen to the evidence as it comes in.\u201d The court then asked T \u201cif it\u2019s more personal, [and] it\u2019s more that this is bringing up things that you thought were old issues from the past * * * and it\u2019s weighing on your mind and making you feel that it\u2019s, I guess in the worst case physically debilitating to you, then that\u2019s another matter.\u201d T replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what it is, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The prosecutor then questioned T about his background as a police officer and whether he had experience with arresting the same person multiple times. T said that he had. The prosecutor then asked T if, on those occasions, \u201cyou ma[de] an independent decision about whether you had enough information to arrest them each time based on the evidence,\u201d and T answered that he had. When asked by the prosecutor about his statement at <em>voir dire </em>that he could be fair, T said, \u201c[L]ike I told the judge, I\u2014after sleeping on it and getting up this morning and struggling with some things, I didn\u2019t feel like I should sit on\u2014this particular case.\u201d The prosecutor then asked T whether he might be feeling uneasy because \u201cyou\u2019ve heard enough to know how you\u2019re leaning in the case,\u201d and T answered, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d T also agreed that other jurors could be feeling the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Defense counsel also questioned T and asked him whether \u201cyour experience is causing you some personal anguish in terms of having to sit through this case for three days. * * * It\u2019s bringing back old memories or something of that nature.\u201d T replied, \u201cThere is a little bit of that going on. Yeah.\u201d Probing further, defense counsel asked T to differentiate between his experiences as a police officer and his personal feelings about the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u201cIs it\u2014which is it\u2014I guess what I\u2019m wondering about is which is more, or is it both? Is it because you\u2019re an ex-police officer and you\u2019re hearing a case involving police officers and you think your experience is just\u2014you\u2019ve got too much experience, or is it because after you\u2019ve slept on it and you realized this is hitting too close to home and too personal?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">T answered, \u201cI think that\u2019s probably what it is. I think that I should be on a case that\u2019s not involving\u2014if this was just citizens being fired upon, or something like that I don\u2019t think I would have a problem with it.\u201d Finally, defense counsel asked T about his statement at <em>voir dire </em>that he could be fair: \u201c[Y]ou know, you said you could be fair and impartial. But in your mind\u2014you really thought you were going\u2014you were on the way out anyway, is that what I\u2019m hearing?\u201d T said, Yes.\u201d Defense counsel then suggested that T be removed and replaced with one of the two alternate jurors. The prosecutor responded that T had already been sworn as a juror after full <em>voir dire </em>and that he perceived no cause to remove T from the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The court again questioned T about the level of stress the case was causing him, asking particularly about whether T believed hearing the case could trigger any post-traumatic stress. The court told T that, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound to me that it\u2019s causing you that much personal stress. Do you agree with that?\u201d T replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say at this point. I\u2019m * * * stress[ed] right at this point.\u201d After hearing that statement, the trial court told T that it would keep him on the jury. T replied, \u201cI just wanted to put that information out there in front of the court the way I feel about it.\u201d T continued, \u201cLike I say, I don\u2019t mind serving on the jury. I\u2019m not trying to get out of it because of the time involved.\u201d The trial court told T that it understood his position and instructed him not to talk with the other jurors about their conversation. Defendant was convicted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to remove T because (1) there were alternate jurors available to serve on the case, and (2) in defendant\u2019s view, T was \u201cunable to affirm his ability to be fair and impartial, but instead maintained his desire to be disqualified despite attempts to rehabilitate him as a juror[.]\u201d The state counters that, under <em>State v. Compton, </em>333 Or 274, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>39 P3d 833, <em>cert den, </em>537 US 841 (2002), and <em>State v. Fanus, </em>336 Or 63, 79 P3d 847 (2003), <em>cert den, </em>541 US 1075 (2004), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to excuse T. We agree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Actual bias is a basis for challenging prospective jurors. <em>See </em>ORCP 57 D(1)(g) (made applicable to criminal trials by ORS 136.210(1)). In deciding whether a juror should be excused, \u201cthe test is whether the prospective juror\u2019s ideas or opinions would impair substantially his or her performance of the duties of a juror to decide the case fairly and impartially on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>State v. Barone, </em>328 Or 68, 74, 969 P2d 1013 (1998). Whether a prospective juror actually is biased is a factual question \u201cto be determined by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Montez, </em>309 Or 564, 574-75, 789 P2d 1352 (1990). Because the trial court has the advantage of observing a challenged prospective juror\u2019s demeanor, apparent intelligence, and candor, that court\u2019s judgment as to the prospective juror\u2019s ultimate qualifications is entitled to great weight. <em>Id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Here, defendant asserts that T \u201cbrought to his role as juror personal experiences admittedly affecting his ability to be fair.\u201d Defendant places special reliance on what he characterizes as T\u2019s failure \u201cto say he could be fair and impartial despite attempts to get him to say this.\u201d We agree. Unlike the jurors in <em>Fanus </em>and <em>Compton, </em>here\u2014despite the prosecutor\u2019s attempts to rehabilitate him\u2014T did not reaffirm his <em>voir dire </em>statement that he could impartially weigh the evidence against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In <em>Fanus, </em>a juror initially stated that she had formed opinions relating to the defendant and to the defendant\u2019s guilt from pretrial publicity about the case. When the defendant challenged her for cause, the prosecutor elicited from the juror an unqualified commitment that she was willing and able to comply with a juror\u2019s oath to assess a defendant\u2019s guilt only on the evidence presented at trial and to require the state to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court also questioned the juror, and she \u201cconfirmed that she understood that defendant was presumed innocent, that the state had the burden to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, and that, as a juror, she would be required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to base her decision as to defendant\u2019s guilt upon only the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Fanus, </em>336 Or at 81. She also volunteered that she knew from her own experience that facts reported in the news are not always accurate. The trial court asked again whether she had formed a fixed opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt and whether she would be able to judge the defendant fairly. She denied that she had formed such an opinion, at which point the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">The Supreme Court held that, although the juror initially had stated that she had developed opinions about the case, she later \u201cwas unequivocal that she was willing and would be able to require the state to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and to base her decision upon only the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84. Moreover, the court stated, the juror \u201cassured the trial court that she had not formed strong opinions about the case,\u201d which, the court stated, the trial court regarded as credible. <em>Id. </em>In light of the unequivocal nature of those assurances, the court held, the trial court had not abused its discretion in declining to excuse the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">In <em>Compton, </em>a juror similarly stated during <em>voir dire </em>that she believed that criminal defendants should be required to prove their innocence and that, if she heard a jury instruction that conflicted with her personal beliefs, she would follow her own beliefs. 333 Or at 284. The prosecutor then explained to the juror that the state, not the defendant, bore the burden of proof and that the state\u2019s burden was to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The juror then agreed with the prosecutor that, if criminal charges had been filed against her, the state would be required to prove those charges. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201cQ. [Prosecutor]: And would you accept that same circumstance for this defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">\u201cA. I see what he is saying now. Yeah, I understand now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201cQ. If you were to sit on this jury and the State put on its case and defendant didn\u2019t put on any evidence at all, would you be able to say to all of us now that you wouldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>hold that against him because it\u2019s not his obligation to prove anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cA. No, I wouldn\u2019t hold it against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cQ. The State is required to prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 284-85 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant moved to dismiss the juror, but the trial court denied the motion. The Supreme Court concluded, \u201c[0]nce she understood the role of a juror and the responsibility of the state to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, [the juror] expressed her willingness to perform the tasks of a juror in the manner required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. The court held that, in light of the juror\u2019s affirmative statements that she would follow the law, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to excuse her.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Our opinion in <em>State v. Carter, </em>205 Or App 460, 134 P3d 1078 (2006), is also instructive. There, a prospective juror was questioned about whether his previous experience as a police officer might bias him against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 462. After denying that his experience as a police officer would affect his judgment, the prospective juror told defense counsel that he had strongly held opinions against drugs and alcohol and that he considered individuals who used drugs or alcohol to be untrustworthy. <em>Id. </em>at 463. Because the defendant was on trial for sexual abuse, defense counsel asked the prospective juror whether the nature of the alleged crimes would affect his judgment, and the prospective juror answered, \u201cFrom what I heard so far, I would have to hear a lot of good stuff to probably change what I feel already.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. When defense counsel asked him to elaborate, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u201cA. Well, I feel like he\u2019s guilty. * * * I mean like I say, I haven\u2019t heard all the other stuff, but I mean that\u2019s just right off the bat how I feel, I mean but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">\u201cQ. And even though you haven\u2019t heard any evidence and there is a presumption of innocen[ce], you still think that he\u2019s more than likely guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cA. Yeah. I could\u2014maybe I could change my mind, I don\u2019t know, I would have to hear probably more to find out to see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">\u201cQ. Just a second. * * * Do you think it would be fair to have someone having the same thoughts that you\u2019re having be on the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201cA. Probably not, really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cQ. So you don\u2019t think you could be fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 463. After reviewing the holdings in <em>Fanus </em>and <em>Compton, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cThis case stands in sharp contrast to <em>Fanus </em>and <em>Compton. </em>* * * [TJhere is in this case none of the rehabilitation that occurred in both <em>Fanus </em>and <em>Compton. </em>The best that [the prospective juror] would offer the court is a guess that he \u2018could try\u2019 to follow the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 467. Accordingly, we held that the trial court had abused its discretion in refusing to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to remove the prospective juror for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Although not identical to any of the described cases, the circumstances here more closely resemble those in <em>Carter </em>than those in <em>Fanus </em>or <em>Compton. </em>Viewed in context, T\u2019s statements evinced more than mere personal discomfort with the case because of his status as a former police officer. Under questioning by the trial court, T did not merely say that he was suffering from stress but, instead, repeated that he did not believe he should serve on a jury involving an assault on a police officer. T explicitly stated that he had been making \u201csome judgments\u201d that he thought he \u201creally shouldn\u2019t be making[.]\u201d The most natural reading of T\u2019s statements is that he was genuinely concerned that his experience as a police officer was biasing him against defendant and that he believed he should be removed from the jury for that reason. Moreover, not only did T fail to reaffirm his <em>voir dire </em>statement that he could impartially weigh the evidence against defendant, he implicitly disclaimed that statement when he agreed with defense counsel that he had previously answered the question regarding his ability to be fair with the expectation that he would not be seated as a juror. T\u2019s statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the trial court that he \u201cd[idn\u2019t] mind serving on the jury. I\u2019m not trying to get out of it because of the time involved\u201d reflects, in our view, T\u2019s willingness to serve as a juror in a <em>different </em>case; that is, a case not involving an assault on police officers, as T had previously explained during questioning by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Although our standard of review in these cases is deferential, \u201c \u2018deferential\u2019 does not mean unbounded,\u201d and here the trial court did not make an explicit finding that T could provide defendant with a fair trial. <em>Carter, </em>205 Or App at 467. Although such a finding would be consistent with the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion\u2014retaining T as a juror\u2014the record does not support any such finding. In light of T\u2019s expressed concerns and his inability to reaffirm his <em>voir dire </em>statement that he could afford defendant a fair trial, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to discharge T and replace him with an alternate juror.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\"> Defendant also raises a second assignment of error, which we reject without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> Although we refer to \u201cT\u2019s inability to reaffirm\u201d his <em>voir dire </em>answer, it bears noting that he was never <em>expressly </em>asked to do so. Moreover, our discussion of T\u2019s expressed concerns should in no way be read to criticize him for what was, in our opinion, a commendably frank acknowledgment of his own potential biases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
