We have recently rejected an almost identical argument. <em>Pinedo v. United States, </em>955 F.2d 12 (5th Cir.1992). We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-24\">After being indicted, Weathersby was arraigned on December 29, 1989, and released on a personal recognizance bond. On September 25, 1990, Weathersby was arrested because of bond violations, and he was remanded to custody on October 4, 1990. He was eventually sentenced to twenty-seven months in jail, three years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Proceeding pro se, Weathersby invoked 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, moving to receive credit for the time he was free on bond. Section 2255 is not the appropriate vehicle for such a motion; he should have invoked 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because he is proceeding pro se, we construe his pleading liberally and consider it a proper motion under \u00a7 2241. <em>See United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 77-78 (5th Cir.1990). We are able to construe the purported \u00a7 2255 motion, which must be filed in the district where the prisoner was convicted, as a \u00a7 2241 petition, which must be filed in the district where the prisoner is incarcerated, because in this case the prisoner\u2019s district of incarceration is the same as the district of conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On the merits, however, Weathers-by cannot prevail. He bases his argument on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585, which provides: \u201cA defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in <em>official detention </em>prior to the date the sentence com-mences_\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b) (emphasis added). This statute replaced \u00a7 3568, which stated: \u201cThe <em>Attorney General </em>shall give any such person credit toward service of his sentence for any days spent <em>in custody </em>in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence was imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 (emphasis added); <em>Pinedo, </em>955 F.2d at 13. Section 3585 applies to Weathersby because his offense occurred after November 1, 1987. <em>Pinedo, </em>955 F.2d at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Notably, the new statute does not refer to the Attorney General. Whether a petitioner must exhaust his administrative remedies \u2014 which Weathersby has failed to do \u2014 before this Court can obtain jurisdiction is an open question under the new statute, and the issue will be decided soon by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>916 F.2d 1115 (6th Cir.1990), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 48, 116 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991) (argued Jan. 15, 1992). We noted the jurisdictional issue without deciding it in <em>United States v. Bleike, </em>950 F.2d 214, 217-19 (5th Cir.1991) (collecting cases). Because Weathersby cannot prevail, regardless of whether we have jurisdiction, we pretermit the jurisdictional issue. <em>See Norton v. Mathews, </em>427 U.S. 524, 532, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2775, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976) (\u201c \u2018In the past, we similarly have reserved difficult questions of our jurisdiction when the case alternatively could be resolved on the merits in favor of the same party.\u2019 \u201d), <em>quoted in Texas Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Jackson, </em>862 F.2d 491, 497 n. 8 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1035, 109 S.Ct. 1932, 104 L.Ed.2d 404 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The reason that Weathersby cannot succeed on the merits is that <em>Pinedo </em>rejected his argument. Weathersby argues, as Pi-nedo did, that the change in statutory language from \u201cin custody\u201d to \u201cofficial detention\u201d effected a change in the law. In <em>Pinedo, </em>however, we held that the change in language is of \u201cno consequence.\u201d Our precedent decided under former \u00a7 3568 remains applicable under the new statute. <em>Pinedo, </em>955 F.2d at 13. And our precedent precludes a prisoner from receiving credit for time free on bond. <em>E.g., United States v. Mares, </em>868 F.2d 151, 152 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">For those reasons, Weathersby cannot prevail. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
