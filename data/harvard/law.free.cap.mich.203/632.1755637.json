Under date January 28, 1910, the Victoria Hotel Company, by O. <em>A: </em>McClintock, its president, and O. A. McClintock personally, made an agreement with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, a Wisconsin corporation, in which agreement it .is recited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that the hotel company and McClintock, parties of the second part, are jointly and individually the lessees of certain portions of a brick hotel building- in Chicago known as the McCoy Hotel building, and that they have agreed to sell upon said premises domestic draught beer manufactured and sold by the Fred Miller Brewing Company, party of the first part, and to sell no other domestic draught beer upon the premises during the t\u00e9rm of the agreement and upon the terms and conditions therein recited. The agreement on the part of the Fred Miller Brewing Company expressed in the instrument is to advance and lend to the' second parties (the hotel company and McClintock) the sum of $10,000, to take two promissory notes of $5,000 each as evidence of the loan, due respectively May 1, 1915, and May 1, 1920, each of the notes to bear an indorsement to the effect that it is issued subject to the terms and provisions of the said agreement to sell to the second parties all of the domestic draught beer which they \u201cmay need, use, sell, consume, or give away upon the above described premises,\u201d at stated prices, the brand known as \u201cHigh Life\u201d at $8 a barrel, the brand known as Pilsener at $5.50 a barrel, and to sell to them also during the terms of the agreement bottled beer at 75 cents a dozen for small and $1.25 a dozen for large bottles, with the proviso that if at any time during the duration of the agreement the Federal internal revenue tax upon malt liquors is increased the increase shall be added to the said prices. The second parties agree that they will not purchase, use, sell, consume or give away upon the premises during the period of the agreement any domestic draught beer other than that manufactured and sold by the first party, and will purchase from the first party all that they may need, use, sell, consume or give away, and will purchase from the first party at least 60 per cent, of all the bottled beer used, sold, consumed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>given away upon the premises. They further agree that from and after May 1, 1910, they will maintain three saloons on the premises, two on the main floor and one in the basement, with the proviso that if any one of the saloons shall be operated at a loss during any six months\u2019 period they may discontinue the maintenance thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-5\">\u2022 \u201cParties of the second part agree that they will use in the two saloons and bars upstairs, exclusively, the grade and brand of beer known as \u2018High Life,\u2019 manufactured and sold by the party of the first part.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-6\">The agreement is to be in force until the second parties have purchased 5,000 barrels of \u201cHigh Life\u201d and 10,000 barrels of Pilsener beer, but not after the first day of May, 1920. While the agreement calls for payments to be made for beer in cash as it is delivered, it is a part of the agreement that whenever the second parties shall have purchased and paid for 2,500 barrels of \u201cHigh Life\u201d beer and 5,000 barrels of Pilsener beer, then, if they have also purchased from the first party 60 per cent, of all the bottled beer they have used upon the premises, the party of the first part will deliver up to the second parties the note for $5,000 due May 1, 1915. So it is provided that when the second parties upon the same conditions have purchased an additional 2,500 barrels of \u201cHigh Life\u201d and an additional 5,000 barrels of Pilsener, the party of the first part will cancel and deliver up. the second $5,000 note due May 1, 1920.' If, however, before May 1, 1915, the parties of the second part, having performed their agreement, have not purchased and paid for enough beer to secure the cancellation of the said notes in either of said periods they shall yet be entitled on the first of May, 1915, and on the first of May, 1920, to a credit of 66 2/3 cents a barrel for each barrel which they have purchased and paid for, said credit to be applied upon the said notes, and to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>further credit of a sum equal to 25 cents for each barrel of Pilsener beer in excess of double the number of barrels of \u201cHigh Life\u201d beer so purchased as aforesaid during the said periods.

It is further agreed that in the event that the first note, due May 1, 1915, shall be surrendered and canceled as in the original.agreement provided for prior to the date of its maturity, the parties of the second part shall be entitled to a credit upon the second note for all beer sold from and after the date of the cancellation of the first note.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-9\">Pursuant to this agreement, the Victoria Hotel Company and McClintock made two promissory notes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>dated January 28, 1910, by the terms of the first of which they promised to pay to the Fred Miller Brewing Company $5,000 May 1, 1915, at its office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with interest at 5 per cent, per annum after maturity .until paid.

A settlement was made between the Victoria Hotel Company and the Fred Miller Brewing Company, according to which a credit was given upon said note for beer purchased, so that the balance due upon the said note was $1,402, and that sum the Victoria Hotel Company paid and the note was canceled. They asked defendant Puffer to reimburse them, and upon his declining to do so brought this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b663-7\">Their declaration, which was filed August 26, 1916, contains the averment, among others, that the Victoria Hotel Company has faithfully complied with the terms of its said contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company and performed all the obligations imposed upon it by the said contract according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>letter and spirit thereof, but that the Victoria Hotel Company had been unable to sell such quantity of draught beer as would entitle it to the cancellation of its note, so that there became due and owing on the note on the first of May, 1915, $1,402, whereupon a demand was made upon defendant to liquidate said indebtedness in accordance with his contract with these plaintiffs; that the defendant neglected and refused to settle said indebtedness, whereupon, on the 3d of June, 1915, the Victoria Hotel Company paid the Fred Miller Brewing Company the said sum of money; that by reason of the failure of the defendant to perform his contract the assets of the Victoria Hotel Company have been depleted to the extent of $1,402 and the use thereof from the 3d of June, 1915, re-, suiting in a depreciation in value of the 400 shares of the issued capital stock of said corporation purchased by the plaintiffs, \u201cto plaintiffs\u2019 damage in the sum of two thousand dollars.\u201d To these allegations the common money counts in assumpsit are added.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-5\">The defendant with his plea gave notice of special defenses based upon the alleged violation by plaintiffs of the agreement of the Victoria Hotel Company with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, not all of which seem to have been relied upon at the trial, and only one of which, at the most two, were found by the trial court to have been sustained by evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-6\">It is stipulated by counsel that the period during which the Victoria Hotel Company sold Pilsener beer at the upstairs bar of its premises is correctly shown by the records of the Fred Miller Brewing Company, to wit, from October, 1914, to February, 1915, inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-7\">Defendant gives notice with his plea that if the contract had been faithfully lived up to, and there was a shortage, he had a contract with McClintock which would authorize him to call upon McClintock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to pay the Fred Miller Brewing Company; that the plaintiffs were aware of this fact and, without authority from defendant or McClintock, after violating the. contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, elected to pay an alleged claim of the Fred Miller Brewing Company, foreclosing both defendant and the said McClintock, without opportunity for either defendant or McClintock to be heard as against the said claim of the Fred Miller Brewing Company.- One of the alleged defenses is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-5\">\u201cThe plaintiffs, after they came into possession of the capital stock of the Victoria Hotel Company, in conducting the Victoria Hotel Company, without the consent of the said Oliver A.

There was a motion for a new trial made by plaintiffs, judgment having gone against them, and a new trial was refused. There are 26 assignments of error. It will be sufficient for an understanding of the issue to set out a part only of the findings of fact and the conclusions of law and to refer to the objections made thereto:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">\u201c8. It is conceded by stipulation on file that the Victoria Hotel Company (which is really the plaintiffs in this case), sold Pilsener beer instead of High Life, in the two saloons upstairs-and for a period of about four months, from November, 1914, to February, 1915, both inclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">\u201c9. Defendant contends this is such a breach of the contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, which plaintiffs were bound to abide by and perform according to its letter and spirit and for his protection and exoneration, as released him from or precludes plaintiffs from recovering from him any deficiency arising from insufficient sales of beer necessary to entitle him or plaintiffs to a cancellation of this $5,000 note now in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-8\">\u201cThe plaintiffs deny this contention and say it was not a violation of the real intent or meaning of the contract. That, at any rate, the defendant does not show he was damaged by it; that, in fact, he was not, and that the Fred Miller Brewing Company considered and treated the contract as having been faithfully performed. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel insist this is, if a breach, one that, as it operated, was immaterial, entailing no loss and that defendant is not discharged by reason of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201c10. Passing for the present the question as to whether it was such a breach on plaintiffs\u2019 part as releases' defendant irrespective of proof of damage, and the question as to whom the burden of proof is upon to show damage or want of damage, I find the proofs upon this question, from the testimony of H. W. Borgman, bookkeeper for the Fred Miller Brewing Company, show that for October, 1914, there were bought by plaintiffs from that company, 23 barrels of High Life beer and 2 of Pilsener; in November, 19 barrels of Pilsener and 2 of High' Life; in December, 23 barrels of Pilsener and apparently none of High Life; in January, 1915, 23 barrels of Pilsener and none of High Life; and in February, 1915, 25 barrels of Pilsener and 1 of High Life. The testimony shows that when the Fred Miller Brewing Company learned that plaintiffs were selling the Pilsener .contrary to contract they required the practice to stop and the terms of the contract to be complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-5\">\u201cFollowing this, the sales of High Life for March were 28 barrels.

For March, following the change back to contract terms, total sales of both kinds were 57.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-18\">\u201cThe only explanation for such diminished sales for these four months is the statement of Stowe that the business fell off; or that upstairs business was injured by the substitution of the cheaper beer, as counsel for the defendant claims; or that other beers not purchased of the Fred Miller Brewing Company were used; and I am not wholly satisfied, from the evidence, as to the real cause except that these diminished sales are coincident with the unauthorized change in handling these beers, and may be owing to that change and the proofs, do not clearly explain them or show they were not due to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-19\">\u201c11. I am not able to find, from the testimony, that defendant has not been damaged by the action of plaintiffs in violating the terms of the contract for four months. Not only were total sales diminished, but practically there were no sales of High Life, conditions not found for any similar period, and improved at once following a return to the contract requirements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-20\">\u201c12. Plaintiffs do not deny that for the four months mentioned, they violated the terms of the Fred Miller Brewing Company contract; that such company, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>informed of such violation, required its abandonment and a return to contract requirements, which were then complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">\u201c18. I find, as doubtless already \"sufficiently appears, that the contract relations governing the parties and the Fred Miller Brewing Company are set forth in Exhibits A and B, defining their respective rights, duties and obligations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">\u201c14. The declaration alleges that the Victoria Hotel Company, and meaning the plaintiffs also, has faithfully complied with its contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company and has performed all the obligations imposed upon it by the terms of said contract, according to the letter and spirit thereof. Plaintiffs fail, by their proofs, to sustain this averment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-7\">\u201c15. The declaration also alleges that the plaintiffs have faithfully performed all the conditions of their said contract with defendant on their part to be performed. They also fail to prove this averment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-8\">\u201c16. I am unable to find that the greater weight of the evidence shows that the aforesaid violation of or departure from the terms of the contract as to the handling and sale of the two kinds of beer did not pecuniarily damage the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-9\">\u201cIf either party thinks I have omitted any material or necessary fact, I will supplement this finding of facts, if convinced I should do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-10\">\u201cConclusions of Law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-11\">\u201cI, therefore, deduce the following conclusions of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-12\">\u201c1. That inasmuch as there is no claim or proof that defendant authorized such violations of the contract by plaintiffs, or that he has approved or ratified them or waived his rights to strict performance, the burden is upon them to show that he was not damaged thereby and is not entitled to defend therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-13\">\u201c2. That in the absence of clear and satisfactory proof to the contrary, the presumption is that his rights were thereby adversely affected, or, in other words, damage will be presumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-14\">\u201c3. That the case is not different in point of law from what it would have been had plaintiffs and the Fred Miller Brewing Company expressly agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>change the terms of the contract for the period of four months aforesaid, and permit plaintiffs to sell as they did sell, defendant not knowing of such modification and not assenting thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-5\">\u201c4. That under his contract, defendant was entitled to a strict performance of it on the part of plaintiffs. That plaintiffs have broken the contract on their part, and not having shown, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that defendant was not injured pecuniarily thereby, they cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-6\">\u201c5. Under the contract with defendant, it was the duty of plaintiffs to fully perform for him his contract obligations to the Fred Miller Brewing Company, and so far as such performance could do so, protect and exonerate him from pecuniary liability on account of it. His relation was, in a way, like or analogous to that of a surety for plaintiffs and he should only be called upon by them to make good in case after strict performance on their part the amount of sales or credits thereon should fall short of satisfying the claims of that company. Plaintiffs have paid the Fred Miller Brewing Company, and now seek recovery of such payment for the shortage arising from their failure to sell sufficient quantities of beer to cancel it under the contract. For their failure to carry out their part of the contract by not performing all its obligations according to the letter and spirit thereof, they are not in a position to call upon the defendant to make good the deficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-7\">\u201c6. They cannot ask defendant to be bound when they, themselves, have not been bound, their own delinquency not having been excused or justified or clearly shown to have been harmless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-8\">\u201c7. I think the same questions would arise and be confronted were it claimed that recovery could be had under the common counts and there is no better reason for awarding judgment for the plaintiffs upon those counts than upon the special count upon the express contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-9\">\u201c8. That plaintiffs have failed to sustain their case either under their pleadings or the proofs, wherefore the judgment must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-10\">\u201cThat judgment should be for the defendant for the amount of the set-off as stipulated and found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>my opinion on file with some additional interest since May 1st, 1916. It may be computed and here inserted. Three hundred ninety-three dollars and fifty-five cents ($393.55).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\">\u201cIn part support of these conclusions of law, I call the attention of the parties to 3 Elliott on Contracts, sections 2102 and 2103,, which I believe controlling under the evidence in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-6\">The amendment to the findings of fact made by the court is to the finding numbered 10, affecting only certain figures, the effect of the amendment not appearing to be of importance as affecting the issue to be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-7\">Nor do criticisms of the findings of fact made by appellants appear to apply to anything which affects the question to be determined. There are some slight inaccuracies pointed out, but an examination reveals nothing requiring comment. What plaintiffs claim is stated in the brief in the following language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-8\">\u201cIt was shown by testimony introduced by plaintiffs, and not disputed by the defendant, that the only time during which the Victoria Hotel Company sold Pilsener beer at its Clark street main floor bar, was during the period from October, 1914, to February, 1915, when it sold 91 barrels of Pilsener beer at its upstairs or main floor bar. Although the contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company required that the Victoria Hotel Company use only the brand of beer known as \u2018High Life,\u2019 at the upstairs bar, yet, the brewing company, in its settlement with the Victoria Hotel Company allowed the hotel company credit of 66 2/3 cents for each of the 91 barrels of Pilsener beer so used at the upstairs bar, and did not consider nor treat this departure from the strict terms of the contract as a violation. However, the defendant insists, and the circuit judge held, that it was such a departure from the terms of the contract as amounted to a breach, even though no damage is shown to have resulted to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-9\">\u201cIt is claimed by plaintiffs that this slight deviation from the strict terms of the contract with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Fred Miller Brewing Company, which could injure no one but the brewing company, and which the undisputed testimony shows, resulted in benefit and no injury to defendant, on account of the greater quantity of beer for which the hotel company was given credit on its note, was not such a departure from the strict terms of the contract as the parties intended should operate as a forfeiture of plaintiffs' rights to insist upon the defendant paying the $1,402 which became due on the Fred Miller Brewing Company note, in accordance with his contract with plaintiffs when they purchased the capital stock of the Victoria Hotel Company, and that the clear weight of the evidence shows performance of the contract sued upon, by the plaintiffs, in every essential detail, and in accordance with the purpose and intention of the parties, as expressed in the contract and shown by the admitted facts in the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">And the questions involved are stated to be:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\">\u201c1. Whether from the language of the contract, as a whole, and the facts and circumstances in evidence, it can be fairly said that it was intended by the contracting parties that the slightest deviation, on the part of the Victoria Hotel Company, from any detail of its contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, whether resulting in damage to defendant or not, would operate as a forfeiture of valuable rights which plaintiffs acquired under their contract with defendant, and thereby enable the defendant to reap the benefits of the contract, and yet, through a technicality and unconscionable advantage, escape responsibility for an obligation which he assumed when he sold the property to plaintiffs, and received the benefits of the $85,000 purchase price paid by plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Whether the common law rule of strict performance or the modern rule of substantial performance is applicable to the situation in the instant case, where it is not disputed that the plaintiffs have substantially, in good faith, fulfilled the obligations of their contract with defendant, in its essential particulars, and where the defendant has brought forward no proofs whatever to show that he has been damaged in any manner by reason of the slight variance from strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>performance, upon which he relies to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-5\">\u201c3. Whether the court erred in admitting the Mc-Clintock contract in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-6\">\u201c4. Whether the court erred in placing burden upon plaintiffs to negative an affirmative defense where no evidence was offered in support of such defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-7\">\u201c5. Whether the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are supported by the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b673-8\">Ostrander, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQF\"><em>(after stating the </em>facts). There is no occasion for considering the fifth question, because the court\u2019s conclusions are based upon a conceded breach of the agreement, nor the third question, unless a new trial is ordered, because the court, although admitting the agreement between McClintock and defendant in evidence, based no conclusion and no material finding upon that evidence. The first, second and fourth questions demand some discussion: although the first two are stated in an argumentative manner, they nevertheless present points upon which appellants rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The Victoria Hotel Company was a party to the contract with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, a contract which, by its terms, might run for ten years,. and which, so far as the record discloses, is still in force. The Victoria Hotel Company was a joint maker of the notes given to the Fred Miller Brewing Company. In their agreement they made provision for the contingencies of fire, injunctions, strikes, legal proceedings, restrictions upon the traffic in liquors and \u201cany other unavoidable causes,\u201d and for the\u00aecase which might arise if the hotel company premises were destroyed by fire or if, by the operation of a prohibitory liquor law, the selling of beer could not go on. In any event, wilful failure on the part of the hotel company to perform the contract after notice invited liability to pay the notes immediately and unavoidable failure to perform resulted also in immediate pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ment, but of the balance only after due credits were allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The Victoria Hotel Company is hot a party to any other of the contracts which have been referred to. It has remained, with McClintock, liable, primarily, to the Fred Miller Brewing Company upon the notes. Presumably, it had the advantage of the money furnished by the Fred Miller Brewing Company, or of some of it. But while the outstanding notes evidence a debt of the corporation, an analysis of the agreements clearly indicates that it was not a debt of the corporation which Puffer obligated himself to pay at all events. His undertaking is that if the hotel company shall faithfully comply with the terms' of said contract, performing all of the obligations imposed upon it thereby,\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cand shall be unable to sell such a quantity of draught beer as will, under the terms of said contract, entitle it to the cancellation of the two (2) notes * * * the party of the first part will, on demand of the said Victoria Hotel Company and the parties of the second part, pay to the Fred Miller Brewing Company such a sum of money as, added to the amount to which said hotel company shall be entitled as a credit upon said notes under the terms of said contract, shall be necessary to liquidate and pay said notes according to their \u25a0tenor and effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">So, that, while it appears that the Victoria Hotel Company might, at the end of the first five-year period, settle, as it did, with the Fred Miller Brewing Company and pay' it whatever sum was required to pay and cancel the first $5,000 note, and while such settlement would bind the Victoria Hotel Company and the Fred Miller Brewing Company, it -would not necessarily bind the defendant, since the hotel company might be willing to pay cash rather than sell beer, and the Fred Miller Brewing Company be willing to waive strict performance of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We are impressed that the parties stipulated for strict performance of the contract of the Victoria Hotel Company with the Fred Miller Brewing Company, although it is not necessary to a decision that-we should go quite so far. It is not necessary because it appears that the breach of the agreement by the Victoria Hotel Company was not inadvertent, did not grow out of any mistake, but was wilful. It continued for a period of four months. There is evidence to support the finding that the result of the breach was diminished total sales of beer and, consequently, of credits to apply upon the note. The effects of the breach cannot be measured, limited, but were plainly considerable. The Fred Miller Brewing Company protested, and the Victoria Hotel Company resumed the sale of \u201cHigh .Life\u201d beer in its first floor bar. It may be assumed that it was because it is difficult to determine the effects of a breach that the contract was drawn with so much particularity. \u201cAccording to the letter, and spirit\u201d is the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We think the learned trial judge committed no reversible error, and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-6\">Bird, Moore, Steere, Brooke, Fellows, Stone, and Kuhn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
