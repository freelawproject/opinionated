The defendants argue, therefore, that partial summary judgment was improperly granted. We disagree.</p><p id=\"b505-5\">A fair reading of the contract indicates that the irrevocably-restricted yard area is within the \"common element\u201d definition. Furthermore, the Supreme Court correctly determined that the repair in question was structural, and under all interpretations, the defendants are responsible for structural repairs.</p><p id=\"b505-6\">We have modified the order to reflect the intention of the trial court to grant partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the issue of liability with respect to their second cause of action to recover damages for the cost of the structural repairs in question. Thompson, J. P., Lawrence, Harwood and Balletta, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
