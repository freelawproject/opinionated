The secretly recorded conversation between Bell and a prosecutorial agent, after Bell had obtained counsel with respect to the subject matter of the inquiry, violated Bell\u2019s constitutional right to counsel. <em>(People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474; <em>People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24; <em>People v Ferrara, </em>54 NY2d 498; <em>People v Mealer, </em>57 NY2d 214; <em>People v Costello, </em>101 AD2d 244; <em>People v Bongarzone, </em>69 NY2d 892; <em>People v Sanders, </em>56 NY2d 51.) II. Bell should have been acquitted of the bribery counts since it was not shown that he knew Wallace had \u201cwitness status\u201d. III. The Attorney-General lacked statutory authority to prosecute. <em>(People v Di Falco, </em>44 NY2d 482; <em>Matter of Dondi v Jones, </em>40 NY2d 8; <em>Matter of Additional Jan. 1979 Grand Jury, </em>50 NY2d 14.) IV. The evidence under the misdemeanor counts was insufficient. <em>(People v Mullens, </em>292 NY 408.) V. Bell was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender. <em>(People v Orr, </em>57 AD2d 578; <em>People v Mangiapane, </em>87 AD2d 851; <em>People v Kennedy, </em>128 Misc 2d 937; <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-16\"><em>Robert Abrams, Attorney-General (Edward D.

II. Defendant\u2019s conversations with Walter Wallace were voluntary statements and recordings of them were therefore properly received in evidence. <em>(People v Ferrara, </em>54 NY2d 498; <em>People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24; <em>People v Farruggia, </em>61 NY2d 775; <em>People v Margolies, </em>125 Misc 2d 1033; <em>People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474; <em>People v Short, </em>110 AD2d 205, 67 NY2d 657; <em>People v Mealer, </em>57 NY2d 214, 460 US 1024; <em>People v Gruttola, </em>43 NY2d 116; <em>People v Cintron, </em>134 Misc 2d 453; <em>People v Sanders, </em>56 NY2d 51.) III. The affirmed finding of fact that defendant bribed a \"witness\u201d was more than amply supported by the evidence and was legally correct. <em>(Matter of Dondi v Jones, </em>40 NY2d 8.) IV. Defendant was properly prosecuted by the Attorney-General. <em>(People v Liebowitz, </em>112 AD2d 383; <em>Matter of Driscoll v Troy Hous.

The evidence supporting defendant\u2019s convictions for tax and liquor crimes, as well as for conspiring to obstruct governmental administration, was sufficiently corroborated to satisfy CPL 60.22. <em>(People v Cobos, </em>57 NY2d 798; <em>People v Rugg, </em>91 AD2d 692; <em>People v Fielding, </em>39 NY2d 607; <em>People v Torello, </em>94 AD2d 857; <em>People v Rossi, </em>11 NY2d 379; <em>People v Weis, </em>32 AD2d 856, 397 US 1047; <em>People v Spiegel, </em>60 AD2d 210, 48 NY2d 647.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b218-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b218-6\">Simons, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Defendant has been convicted of various charges involving violation of the tax and liquor laws, bribing a witness and conspiracy to obstruct governmental administration, and sentenced as a second felony offender to multiple concurrent terms of imprisonment having a maximum of four and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>minimum of two years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, a divided Appellate Division, modified the judgment by vacating the sentence as a second offender and otherwise affirmed. Justice Sullivan, who dissented and voted to affirm, granted both parties leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Defendant\u2019s principal challenge is to the validity of the bribery convictions. He contends that evidence of the briberies, established by a tape-recorded telephone conversation with a police informant, was obtained in violation of his right to counsel under the State and Federal Constitutions because at the time the conversation occurred defendant had retained an attorney to represent him on the tax violations then under investigation. He claims further that he could not be guilty of bribing a witness because at the time he made his telephone call he did not know that the informant had been subpoenaed to testify before the Grand Jury or that he might be subpoenaed in the future. Finally, defendant maintains that he cannot be sentenced as a second felony offender because he was originally sentenced on the predicate felony more than 10 years before commission of the present felonies <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv]). The Appellate Division, accepting this argument, held that the date of a predicate felony for enhanced sentencing purposes is the date of the original sentence notwithstanding that the original conviction was subsequently vacated as the result of a successful appeal and defendant resentenced after further proceedings. Defendant also raises several other points before this court which require no discussion. We find no merit to defendant\u2019s contentions and therefore modify the order of the Appellate Division, reinstate the second offender sentence and remit the matter to the Appellate Division for consideration of the factual issues as to sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Defendant Richard Bell and his codefendants John Dobson and Vincenzio Caravello owned and operated two Manhattan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>night clubs, The Mine Shaft Club and The Hell Fire Social Club. The Attorney-General, at the request of the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, had commenced an investigation into allegations that The Mine Shaft had failed to pay taxes <em>(see, </em>Executive Law \u00a763 [3]). On November 7, 1985, defendant warned Walter Wallace, a former manager of The Mine Shaft, that there might be a subpoena out for him and told him to stay around the house. The next day Wallace attended a meeting with defendant, Caravello and Dobson at which defendant told Wallace to go on \"vacation\u201d and to avoid \"subpoena people\u201d and reporters working on the investigation but to \"keep in touch\u201d while out of town. Wallace was assured he would be given money for expenses and $2,000 was subsequently delivered to him for that purpose. Wallace went to stay with friends in Westchester. The next day, after seeing his picture on the front page of the New York Post, Wallace spoke with defendant and Caravello and defendant told him, in a manner Wallace perceived as threatening, that he should leave that night for Hawaii with Caravello.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">As a result, Wallace decided to get counsel and speak to the authorities. He and his attorney met with members of the Attorney-General\u2019s staff on November 13, discussed his involvement with The Mine Shaft and the instructions he had received from defendant and the other partners, and offered to assist in the investigation. On November 19, 1985, the Attorney-General\u2019s staff decided to accept Wallace\u2019s assistance and to attempt to tape-record his telephone conversations with The Mine Shaft partners. The same day, the Grand Jury issued a subpoena duces tecum to defendant requesting documents pertaining to the operation of The Mine Shaft. Defendant then retained an attorney who notified the Assistant Attorney-General of his representation on the morning of the 20th.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Later on the 20th, an investigator from the Attorney-General\u2019s office met with Wallace in Ohio, where he had gone after his meeting with the Attorney-General\u2019s staff. The investigator had Wallace sign a cooperation agreement, served him with a Grand Jury subpoena and interviewed him concerning The Mine Shaft operations. At that time, Wallace agreed to allow the investigators to monitor and tape his future telephone calls. During the next two days he called Caravello twice, as he had been instructed to do by defendant, and, in response to Caravello\u2019s request, he gave Caravello a number where defendant could reach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>At approximately 1:00 p.m. on November 21 defendant telephoned Wallace and bribed him. The call was monitored and recorded by the police and is the subject of this appeal. In that conversation defendant told Wallace that he hoped The Mine Shaft information did not \"have to come out for a long time\u201d, to \"stay away\u201d and that money would be sent to him. He also told Wallace what to say if he were questioned by authorities about its operation. For the most part, the conversation was sustained by defendant\u2019s instructions to Wallace to stay in Ohio, to avoid investigators and, if he was interviewed, to make sure his story was consistent with defendant\u2019s story. During the conversation Wallace told defendant, falsely, that he had learned a subpoena had been left at his New York apartment. Defendant responded, \"Right. What there <em>[sic] </em>really doing they subpoenaed everybody * * * its <em>[sic] </em>just not you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As a result of this conversation, defendant was charged with two counts of bribery in violation of section 215.00 of the Penal Law. The first count charged an offense under subdivision (a), attempting to influence Wallace\u2019s testimony, and the second, an offense under subdivision (b), seeking to influence Wallace to avoid testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Based on the testimony of Wallace, other employees and the police officers involved in the investigation defendant was also charged with several tax and liquor law violations and conspiracy to obstruct governmental administration. The Supreme Court, New York County, granted defendant\u2019s motion for a <em>Huntley </em>hearing addressed to the tape-recorded telephone conversation with Wallace and, after the hearing, denied his motion for suppression. Defendant then waived a jury and agreed to a trial by the court based on the Grand Jury minutes and the minutes of the suppression hearing. On the basis of that evidence the trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him as a second felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Defendant seeks a dismissal of the entire indictment, contending that his recorded conversation with Wallace, a prosecutorial agent, should be suppressed and that in its absence the other counts fail for lack of sufficient corroboration. Noting that the conversation with Wallace took place after the Attorney-General knew he was represented, he claims that his State and Federal constitutional rights to counsel were vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>lated. He relies principally on the broader State rule as developed in <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">When a defendant in custody is represented on a pending charge, he may not, without his attorney present, be questioned about that charge <em>(People v Hobson, </em>39 NY2d 479), or about unrelated criminality if the police know of his representation <em>(People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167) or know of another pending charge on which defendant is represented <em>(People v Smith, </em>54 NY2d 954; <em>People v Bartolomeo, </em>53 NY2d 225). In <em>Skinner, </em>we took a further step and prohibited noncustodial interrogation about a matter under investigation if counsel had been retained specifically on the matter and had instructed the police not to question the defendant in his absence. Our ruling was designed to prevent the police from rendering the right to counsel ineffective by questioning the defendant about matters relating to the subject of the representation in the absence of counsel retained on the matter <em>(id., </em>at 32; <em>People v Hauswirth, </em>89 AD2d 357, 359, <em>affd </em>60 NY2d 904). The holding also granted the same protection to criminal defendants, as a matter of State constitutional law, as that granted a civil litigant who enjoys the benefit of \"the ethical responsibility of attorneys in civil matters not to communicate on the subject of the representation with an individual known to be represented by an attorney on the matter\u201d <em>(People v Skinner, supra, </em>at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In the present case defendant had been served with a Grand Jury subpoena duces tecum in connection with the tax investigation calling for him to produce records in his possession. His right to counsel attached on that matter on November 20, 1985 when his lawyer contacted the Attorney-General <em>(see, People v Rogers, </em>48 NY2d 167, <em>supra). </em>Moreover, Wallace was clearly acting as an agent of the police when he allowed the police to monitor and tape his conversation because he had agreed to cooperate with them for the purpose of obtaining evidence against defendant. Defendant contends that under these circumstances the protection afforded by the <em>Skinner </em>rule should be extended to prohibit his noncustodial questioning about an unrelated crime under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We addressed the question in <em>People v Ferrara </em>(54 NY2d 498). In that case, defendant retained counsel in connection with his appearances before the Grand Jury investigating fraud in the nursing home industry. The prosecutor, suspecting perjury, arranged to record defendant\u2019s subsequent conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>sations with a nursing home operator during which defendant offered cash kickbacks. Defendant was again called before the Grand Jury and denied any knowledge of the kickbacks. On the basis of that denial, he was indicted for perjury and the taped conversation was offered to establish his guilt. He claimed that the tape should have been suppressed because the prosecutor violated his right to counsel by arranging to record the conversation. We held that neither the Federal nor State constitutional guarantee of the right to counsel includes the right to have counsel present when a criminal enterprise is being planned or executed, noting that the critical fact requiring suppression in <em>Skinner </em>\"was that the defendant was represented on the very matter about which he was questioned, a past crime\u201d <em>(People v Ferrara, supra, </em>at 508).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>People v Middleton </em>(54 NY2d 474, 480) set forth some factors to be considered in deciding when a conversation between a person accused and a police officer is proscribed by the constitutional right to counsel. They included consideration of who initiated the conversation, whether the bribe offer furnished a valid independent basis for investigation, the risk that defendant took in offering the bribe with respect to the possible recording of it, and whether, in view of the credibility problems in such cases, it is usual practice to attempt to record a conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A consideration of the <em>Middleton </em>factors in this case establishes that the People did not violate defendant\u2019s right to counsel by recording his conversation with Wallace. It is particularly relevant that although Wallace initiated the calls, he did so on instructions from defendant and, indeed, the taped phone call in question was placed by defendant to instruct Wallace on how to testify or, preferably, avoid testifying. Wallace said very little. It is also significant that defendant had previously instructed Wallace to go on \"vacation\u201d and avoid subpoenas, and promised him that he would be \"taken care of\u2019 if he did. These facts provided evidence of a possible new crime and support the conclusion that the Attorney-General had a valid independent basis for arranging to tape the conversations and that he was not attempting to obtain incriminating evidence of defendant\u2019s prior offenses in violation of his right to counsel <em>(see, People v Ferrara, supra, </em>at 508).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Furthermore, the conversations were limited in scope and sought only to determine whether defendant was in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>cess of committing a \"new crime\u201d. The investigators instructed Wallace that they were only interested in obtaining more information about how he would be \"taken care of\u2019 and in confirming that defendant was involved in a possible bribe, not in obtaining additional evidence on the underlying tax offenses. Accordingly, the conversation related almost exclusively to defendant\u2019s plan to influence Wallace\u2019s testimony or avoid his testifying altogether, and Wallace did not question defendant about the crime for which he had obtained representation <em>(see, People v Ferrara, supra, </em>at 505). Thus, defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>People v Sanders </em>(56 NY2d 51) is unavailing because there, the conversations recorded by the police were offered to prove defendant was involved in the very crime for which he had retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Finally, it is worth remembering the basis for our rules on right to counsel. We established a broad right under our State Constitution because, as explained in <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167, 173, <em>supra), </em>\"the attorney\u2019s presence serves to equalize the positions of the accused and sovereign, mitigating the coercive influence of the State and rendering it less overwhelming.\u201d There is no sound reason for extending that right to protect a defendant against incriminating himself in a new unrelated crime, however. Where the questioning is in a noncustodial setting, the State does not exert an \"overwhelming\u201d or \"coercive influence\u201d on the individual nor are the purposes underlying the <em>Skinner </em>rule implicated when the investigation involves a new crime. The People did not, by taping the conversation between defendant and Wallace, interfere with defendant\u2019s representation concerning the Grand Jury investigation nor did they breach the ethical proscription against direct communication with persons represented by counsel on the subject of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Defendant also claims that his right to counsel under the Federal Constitution has been violated requiring suppression of the conversation (see, <em>Maine v Moulton, </em>474 US 159). The crimes involving defendant were still in their investigatory stages, however, and no formal charges had been filed at the time the conversation took place. Therefore, defendant\u2019s right to counsel had not attached under the Federal Constitution <em>(see, Kirby v Illinois, </em>406 US 682).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">ra</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Defendant next contends that he cannot be guilty of bribing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>a witness under section 215.00 of the Penal Law because he lacked the necessary <em>mens rea </em>to commit the crime. He argues first that even if it be assumed that Wallace had been properly subpoenaed at the time of the November 21 telephone conversation, he did not know of his witness status or of the facts that arguably transformed Wallace into \"a person about to be called as a witness\u201d. He claims further that the facts as he perceived them should control in determining his guilt under the statute, i.e., that while Wallace was in Ohio, a subpoena had been left at his New York apartment. Because he believed Wallace was not properly served, defendant contends that he could not be guilty of bribing a witness because under his subjective perception, Wallace was not a witness within the intendment of the statute. Implicit in this is the contention that the statute is not violated unless the bribe is made after the witness is under subpoena to the knowledge of defendant. Manifestly, Wallace was \"a witness or a person about to be called as a witness\u201d at the time of the crime under any reasonable interpretation of the statute. The trial court made only a general finding that defendant knew Wallace was about to become a witness, however, and therefore defendant\u2019s contention makes it necessary to construe the language of the statute to determine if this finding was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Penal Law \u00a7 215.00 states that: \"[a] person is guilty of bribing a witness when he confers * * * any benefit upon <em>a witness or a person about to be called as a witness </em>in any action or proceeding upon an agreement * * * that (a) the testimony of such witness will thereby be influenced, or (b) such witness will absent himself from * * * such action or proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The section is a part of article 215 of the Penal Law and is one of a number of provisions enacted to guard against corrupt interference with the judicial system by those seeking to improperly influence witnesses\u2019 testimony or induce them to avoid testifying.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The section does not define who is \"a witness or a person about to be called as a witness\u201d or impose a requirement that the witness actually be under subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>before the conduct is considered criminal and we are left to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In the dictionary sense, a witness is a person who \"personally sees or perceives a thing\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1438 [5th ed 1979]) or \"one who has knowledge of a fact or occurrence sufficient to testify with respect to it.\u201d (97 CJS, Witnesses, \u00a7 1.) The CPL, incorporating the uniform act for securing out-of-State witnesses, defines a witness as \"a person whose testimony is desired in any proceeding or investigation by a grand jury or in a criminal action, prosecution or proceeding\u201d (CPL 640.10 [1]). Finally, the California courts, in construing identical language contained in their statute, i.e., \"a witness or a person about to be called as a witness\u201d, have held that the crime may be committed before the witness is subpoenaed (see, <em>People v Martin, </em>114 Cal App 392, 300 P 130; <em>People v McAllister, </em>99 Cal App 37, 277 P 1082; <em>see also, </em>Annotation, <em>Influencing or Tampering with Witness, </em>8 ALR4th 769).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The conclusion to be drawn from these definitions is that an individual\u2019s status as a witness depends upon the evidence he can supply the court, not the immediacy of the need for the evidence. The necessity for such evidence does not depend upon the stage of the investigation or whether a subpoena has been issued. An investigation is frustrated equally whether a bribe is offered one day before a subpoena issues or one day after. If the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that defendant reasonably should have believed that the person would be a witness and that he intentionally attempted to influence the witness\u2019s testimony or induce the witness to avoid testifying, the crime is complete. This view is consistent with the statute\u2019s underlying purpose, to guard against subversion of judicial proceedings by suppressing needed evidence. Moreover, acceptance of defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute would only encourage efforts to influence potential witnesses before the investigation had fully developed and subpoenas issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">When the bribery occurred on November 21, Wallace was \"a witness or a person about to be called as a witness\u201d. He had signed a cooperation agreement with the Attorney-General and agreed to allow taping of his telephone calls. In addition, he had been served with a subpoena directing his appearance before the Grand Jury in the matter. Irrespective of those circumstances, however, defendant was chargeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>with knowledge that Wallace was \"a witness or a person about to be called as a witness\u201d because Wallace was the manager of The Mine Shaft and possessed knowledge crucial to any investigation of the club\u2019s tax liability. Defendant and his partners recognized this by urging him to leave the jurisdiction and giving him money to do so. Defendant also revealed his knowledge of Wallace\u2019s status during the November 21 conversation when he stated that the authorities had \"subpoenaed everybody * * * its <em>[sic] </em>just not you.\u201d Based upon this evidence, the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant possessed sufficient knowledge of Wallace\u2019s status as a witness was amply supported. This finding of knowledge, undisturbed by the Appellate Division, binds this court and is legally sufficient to support the finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The People\u2019s cross appeal questions the Appellate Division\u2019s vacatur of defendant\u2019s second felony offender sentence. The Appellate Division found the predicate crime could not be used to enhance defendant\u2019s punishment because his original sentence was imposed \"more than ten years before commission of the felony of which the defendant presently stands convicted\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 70.06 [1] [b] [iv]).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Defendant was first sentenced on the predicate felony in November of 1973 but his conviction was reversed and a new trial directed because of a prejudicial jury charge. His second conviction, after a new trial, was also reversed. He subsequently pleaded guilty to the crime of burglary in the third degree and was sentenced on June 9, 1980. The majority at the Appellate Division determined that the \"sentence\u201d referred to in the statute was the first sentence, notwithstanding the reversal of the conviction and vacatur of the sentence after defendant\u2019s successful appeal, and that it could not be used to enhance defendant\u2019s punishment because it was more than 10 years old. We agree with Justice Sullivan, for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion <em>(see, </em>138 AD2d 298, 299-300) that the \"sentence\u201d is the sentence imposed as a part of the final judgment on June 9,1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Before concluding, certain matters in the dissent must be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">First, it is necessary to correct some factual inaccuracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The dissent, noting the earlier efforts to influence Wallace to leave the jurisdiction, assumes that the bribery was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>continuing crime extending from November 8 to November 21. It then contends that the bribery was a crime under investigation and a crime for which defendant had sought the assistance of counsel. Evidence of the earlier contacts between defendant and Wallace were important for they gave the police a valid independent basis for investigating possible bribery but the fact remains that defendant was not charged with continuing crimes occurring over a two-week span from November 8 to November 21 but with two counts of bribery, both occurring on November 21, 1985, and both established by the tape-recording of his telephone conversation with Wallace on that date. Moreover, the tape did not contain \"admissions\u201d of a previous crime committed by defendant, as the dissent would have it, it recorded the crimes themselves. Thus, notwithstanding the comments of Saslaw quoted in the dissent, defendant was not prosecuted for a \"continuing crime\u201d or a \"crime in progress\u201d at the time he hired counsel and the trial court did not find he had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Continuing its argument of a crime in progress, the dissent would hold that inasmuch as the police knew of defendant\u2019s earlier misconduct, they were required to halt their investigation, rather than go forward with it, because the misconduct was encompassed within the broad scope of defendant\u2019s right to counsel. The Attorney-General instituted this investigation at the request of the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance to inquire solely into allegations of tax irregularities and defendant obtained counsel to assist him after a subpoena had been issued on November 19 seeking his records dealing with that investigation. Whether defendant\u2019s conduct on November 8 constituted bribery or not, defendant was not charged as a result of it, it did not make up any part of the offenses contained in the indictment and he had not retained counsel in connection with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Finally, it should be understood that the call which contained the bribes was placed by defendant and resulted from instructions defendant gave Wallace to \"keep in touch\u201d, not from instructions the police or the Attorney-General gave him to call defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Second, it is necessary to consider some matters of law, specifically, what this court held in <em>People v Skinner </em>(52 NY2d 24, <em>supra). </em>Our precise ruling was that an individual who is represented on a matter under investigation may not be interrogated on that matter, even in a noncustodial setting, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the absence of counsel. We did not, as the dissent implies, extend the right of counsel beyond the specific matter for which counsel was retained and not a single decision of this or any other court which does so hold is cited to support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As to the correct interpretation of <em>People v Sanders </em>(56 NY2d 51, <em>supra), </em>the dissent finds it necessary, because it views defendant\u2019s conduct as one continuing crime, to construe our holding in that case as resting on a finding that the crime was completed. Whether the crime was completed or not, however, was irrelevant to the decision in <em>Sanders. </em>The evidence was suppressed there because it related to a crime on which defendant was represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Finally, the dissent is concerned that the majority has taken an \"errant footstep\u201d and diluted the broad right to counsel previously recognized by this court. On the contrary, our decision follows a well-defined path established by earlier precedents and is consistent with the policy considerations underlying them <em>(see, e.g., People v Ferrara, supra; People v Middleton, supra; People v Mealer, </em>57 NY2d 214, 218; <em>see also, Maine v Moulton, </em>474 US 159, 180, <em>supra; People v Bongarzone, </em>69 NY2d 892). The rule asserted by the dissent, on the other hand, would extend <em>People v Rogers </em>(48 NY2d 167, <em>supra) </em>to noncustodial interrogation and hold that once an individual retains counsel he or she may not be dealt with directly on any matter in an absence of counsel. Under this reasoning, the police must suspend normal investigative techniques and give a defendant a preferred position facilitating his commission, planning or solicitation of a new crime, merely because he has counsel during the investigation of his earlier criminality <em>(see, People v Ferrara, supra, </em>at 508). The right to counsel does not extend that far, nor should it.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified in accordance with this opinion and, as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. Specifically, defendant was convicted of two counts of bribing a witness, 15 counts of failure to file New York State sales tax returns in violation of Tax Law \u00a7 1145 former (b), four counts of failure to file New York City General Corporation Tax returns in violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 R46-5.0, two counts of serving liquor without a license in violation of Alcoholic Beverage Control Law \u00a7 130 (3), and one count of conspiracy to obstruct governmental administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. Formerly the statute did not encompass acts intended to influence a witness to leave the jurisdiction <em>(see, People v Maynard, </em>151 App Div 790, 794). The present formulation was enacted to cover such conduct <em>(see, </em>Staff Notes of Temporary State Commission on Revision of Penal Law and Criminal Code, Proposed New York Penal Law, 1964 McKinney\u2019s Spec Pamph, at 377).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b229-8\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">(dissenting). The prosecution brazenly violated defendant\u2019s right to counsel in this case. Its conduct in that regard should not be countenanced, especially not by this court, because of the unwavering efficacy we have given to this fundamental constitutional bulwark.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Very simply, the defendant\u2019s bribery of his former business colleague, Wallace, for which defendant stands convicted, was not a \"new crime\u201d, legally or factually. The term \"new crime\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is a legal phrase of art here. It takes on legal significance in this case to qualify as an <em>exception (People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474) to the otherwise inviolate rule that the prosecution and its agents may not inquire of or gather evidence from a defendant who has, to its conceded knowledge, hired counsel for legal protection against particular prosecutorial pursuit <em>(People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24). The undisturbed findings of fact from the courts below include: (1) that the crime, which the majority classifies as \"new\u201d, was rather a continuing one begun prior to the recording of the critical telephone conversation between defendant and his former colleague, who by then was a cooperating police agent; (2) that the Attorney-General was investigating that very crime, seeking to get concrete evidence of its commission in order to prosecute; and (3) that the Attorney-General was informed that defense counsel had been retained for the very investigation against defendant, which already included a formal Grand Jury subpoena to defendant for his business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The facts are as essentially set forth in the majority opinion, but I emphasize and encapsulate specific features as bearing on the counsel deprivation issue, which is the only point on which I disagree with the majority. I conclude that the recorded telephone conversation, containing admissions by defendant to his former colleague working on behalf of the Attorney-General, should be suppressed as acquired directly and intentionally in violation of defendant\u2019s New York constitutional counsel rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In 1985, the Attorney-General\u2019s office commenced an investigation into allegations that The Mine Shaft, a New York City social club, failed to pay taxes. On November 13, Walter Wallace, manager of The Mine Shaft, contacted the Attorney-General\u2019s office to discuss the investigation. Wallace told an Assistant Attorney-General of a November 8 meeting with defendant Bell and his codefendants Dobson and Caravello, the owners and operators of the club, during which Bell told Wallace to take a vacation. Wallace was given $2,000 and told to keep in touch and that he would be taken care of. After meeting with the Assistant Attorney-General, Wallace left for Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">On November 19, subpoenas were served on defendant Bell and Caravello calling for the production of the records of The Mine Shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The next morning, November 20, Bell\u2019s attorney contacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the Attorney-General\u2019s office to inform the prosecution that he had been retained by Bell in connection with the Grand Jury investigation. Assistant Attorney-General Saslaw testified at the trial with respect to this critical development as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\"First of all, it wasn\u2019t a legal problem I was not aware of and <em>I didn\u2019t consider it to be a significant problem. </em>I did consider that there was \u2014 that at that particular point, as to the investigation of sales taxes that Mr. Bell was represented by counsel and that no further interviews of Mr. Bell by the office or by agents of the office could take place</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\"At that point \u2014 assuming what Mr. Wallace was saying was true indicated that <em>a crime might be in the process of being committed.\u201d </em>(Record on app, at A-361, A-363 [emphasis added].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Later that day, an investigator from the Attorney-General\u2019s office met with Wallace in Ohio and Wallace signed a cooperation agreement. During the evening of November 20, Wallace, at the direction of the Attorney-General\u2019s investigator, placed several phone calls to New York City. Two of the calls were made to Caravello. During these conversations with Caravello, Wallace indicated a need for more money and further instructions as to how long he should stay away. He gave Caravello a phone number where he could be reached the next day. On the afternoon of November 21, defendant Bell, having been told that Wallace was waiting for further instructions, placed a telephone call from New York to Wallace in Ohio. The conversation, monitored and recorded by Wallace for the prosecution, included Bell telling Wallace what to say if he were questioned by the authorities about the operation of The Mine Shaft. Bell also repeated to Wallace earlier \"advice\u201d to stay away for awhile and again that he would be taken care of.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The precedents of this court instruct that when a person not in custody has obtained counsel on a matter under investigation and the police have knowledge of such representation, the target may not be questioned about the subject matter of the investigation in the absence of counsel <em>(People v Skinner, </em>52 NY2d 24, <em>supra). </em>He has, after all, unequivocally invoked his guaranteed protection of counsel for dealing with the authorities on his behalf and they, in turn, are legally sealed off from dealing with him other than through his counsel. To be sure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>we have carved out a policy exception that this right to counsel is not violated when the otherwise forbidden communications concern a \"new crime\u201d <em>(People v Middleton, </em>54 NY2d 474, <em>supra; People v Ferrara, </em>54 NY2d 498, 508).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In <em>People v Mealer </em>(57 NY2d 214, <em>cert denied </em>460 US 1024), we went so far as to apply the \"new crime\u201d exception to a new crime in progress. In <em>Mealer, </em>defendant was indicted for murder and incarcerated while awaiting trial. His right to counsel on the murder charge had attached. While imprisoned, defendant arranged to meet with a prosecution witness in an effort to get the witness to alter his testimony. The witness informed the police and was instructed to \"play along\u201d if offered a bribe. A bribe was offered, and in his subsequent trial for bribery, defendant moved to suppress his statements on the ground that he could not be interrogated in the absence of counsel. We held that there was no violation because the police were \"investigating a new crime in progress\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The instant case must be approached from the opposite end of <em>Mealer (supra). </em>Here, although the bribery scheme was \"in progress\u201d, it was not a \"new crime\u201d. It was <em>the </em>crime. It had been in progress and was already part of the Attorney-General\u2019s investigation at the time at which defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The sole issue on which I thus depart from the majority is whether the bribing of Wallace by Bell can be considered a new crime within the exception precedents of this State\u2019s revered right to counsel protections. I conclude it cannot and should not possibly be so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The trial court specifically found that by the time of the recorded conversation between Bell and Wallace, the defendant\u2019s bribery scheme was in fact the subject of the Attorney-General\u2019s concerted investigation. As if that were not enough, there is an undisturbed, prosecutorially conceded, fact finding that Bell\u2019s attorney informed the Attorney-General prior to the arranged, recorded conversation that Bell had retained him with respect to the Grand Jury investigation. We have no power or reason to dispute or contradict these dispositive facts. Thus, defendant Bell\u2019s right to counsel had attached to a past or, at the very least, to an ongoing crime of bribery \u2014 not a new crime as in <em>People v Middleton </em>(54 NY2d 474, <em>supra) </em>or a new ongoing one as in <em>People v Mealer </em>(57 NY2d 214, <em>cert denied </em>460 US 1024, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Thus, this case does not fit into either category of \"new crime\u201d exceptions to the <em>Skinner </em>case. Furthermore, <em>People v Sanders </em>(56 NY2d 51) is completely inapplicable, not for the reason stated by the majority (majority opn, at 162) but because it pertains to an already completed crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The prosecution understandably tries to put the best face on the entire fact picture relevant to the counsel violation issue. It choreographs the bribe charge as an isolated matter occurring only on November 21 when, in fact, the bribe effort on that day was a replication of an endeavor between the parties going back to November 8. However convenient and successful that prosecutorial strategy may be, it cannot in the end obscure the realistic assessment of what was really perpetrated here: the purposeful evasion of defendant\u2019s counsel right by the prosecutor and by its acquired agent, Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Moreover, the majority wrongly lays at the doorstep of my analysis a consequential immunity from prosecution. The \"immunity\u201d, such as it is, (1) is not against prosecution for bribery, but against the use of illegally acquired evidence snared directly from the defendant himself after he has interposed counsel of his choice between himself and the forces of the government in a targeted investigation; and (2) derives not from my opinion but from the Constitution itself and its implementing mechanism, the exclusionary rule, a protection in our adversarial system which guarantees the defendant protection by an attorney from being pursued and prosecuted with evidence acquired from himself after the attorney has been secured. Finally, the counsel protection rule does not require a \"halt\u201d to a legitimate investigation; it bars the prosecution from inquisitorially pursuing, actively instigating, and proving its case out of the defendant\u2019s own counsel-protected mouth, which is hardly a novel concept under our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The flagrancy of the prosecution\u2019s evasion of defendant\u2019s counsel right is proven out of his mouth in testimony at trial \u2014he subjectively and cavalierly \"did not consider\u201d the interposition of defense counsel \"to be a significant problem\u201d. It escapes me why, in view of our court\u2019s proud history of undeviating allegiance to this critical area of constitutional protection, the majority should now extend the \"new crime\u201d exception and bestow its imprimatur on the prosecution\u2019s guileful evasion of this defendant\u2019s constitutional counsel protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The \"new crime\u201d exception applied here in any event enve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>lopes the principle. Harkening to the lessons expressed in <em>People v Hobson </em>(39 NY2d 479, 485-488) dealing directly with deviations from this State\u2019s right to counsel protections and precedents, I conclude with a rhetorical query: Might this case be another \"errant footprint\u201d like Robles, <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Wooden (id., </em>at 488), which will require course correction in some future case, as we forthrightly had to do in <em>Hobson </em>itself? That, however, will not restore the lost right to the present defendant or to anyone else who will be similarly deprived by application of the precedent made in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">I would reverse on the defendant\u2019s appeal, grant suppression and remit for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Kaye, Alexander and Hancock, Jr., concur with Judge Simons; Judge Bellacosa dissents and votes to reverse on defendant\u2019s appeal in a separate opinion; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Order modified by reinstating the sentence and case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
