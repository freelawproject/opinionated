Respondents\u2019 contention is that solicitation of membership dues to further the goals of a nonprofit organization is a form of \"fund-raising\u201d as the term is used in Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 (2) (b) (iii). Thus, it is argued, release of the names and addresses for such solicitation would constitute one of the specifically enumerated categories of unwarranted invasions of personal privacy for which disclosure may be withheld under the exemption established in Public Officers Law \u00a787 (2) (b). Supreme Court rejected this contention and granted the relief demanded in petitioner\u2019s CPLR article 78 proceeding. The Appellate Division affirmed without stating its reasons. We granted leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">In its solicitation circular petitioner describes itself as \"the largest individual membership, pro-gun activist, state-wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>organization whose sole function is to defend * * * <em>'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis in original). It lists various services and amenities provided to its members including free legal advice, replies to media attacks on a member\u2019s right to own firearms, political action to assist legislators friendly to petitioner\u2019s cause, and active cooperation with the National Rifle Association and its Institute of Legislative Action. Annual membership rates are $15 for an individual and $30 for a club.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Prior to commencing the instant proceeding, petitioner, in an earlier CPLR article 78 proceeding, had succeeded in obtaining the police department\u2019s computer print-out of all New York City pistol-revolver licensees as public records under Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 (5). In its initial decision in this proceeding, Supreme Court \u2014 while recognizing that permits for rifles and shotguns, unlike licenses for pistols or revolvers, were not public records under Penal Law \u00a7 400.00 (5) \u2014 nevertheless held that the names and addresses of such permittees were required to be released as public records under the comparable provision in New York City Administrative Code, chapter 18, \u00a7 436-6.0 <em>et seq. </em>(now \u00a7 10-301 <em>et seq.). </em>Although deciding, on motion for reargument, that the New York City Administrative Code was not applicable, Supreme Court nevertheless adhered to its original determination. The court, citing <em>Matter of New York Veteran Police Assn. v New York City Police Dept. </em>(92 AD2d 772, <em>revd on other grounds </em>61 NY2d 659), held that the information was sought for neither commercial nor fund-raising purposes and was, therefore, not exempt under Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Respondents make no claim that petitioner, as a not-for-profit corporation, seeks the names and addresses for commercial use. Their sole contention is that petitioner\u2019s solicitation of membership dues amounts to fund-raising and that, therefore, the release of the information sought for such purpose would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the permittees\u2019 privacy under section 89 (2) (b) (iii). We believe this conclusion is compelled by a fair construction of the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">FOIL, we have emphasized, is based on the strong policy conviction that \"the public is vested with an inherent right to know and that official secrecy is anathematic to our form of government\u201d <em>(Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, </em>47 NY2d 567, 571). Indeed, in its declaration of purpose in enacting FOIL the Legislature stated \"that government is the public\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and that the public, individually and collectively as represented by a free press, should have access to the records of government in accordance with the provisions of this article\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 84). For these reasons, we have repeatedly held \"that FOIL is to be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly interpreted so that the public is granted maximum access to the records of government (see, <em>Matter of Washington Post Co. v New York State Ins. Dept., </em>61 NY2d 557, 564, citing <em>Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, supra, </em>at p 571)\u201d <em>(Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen, </em>69 NY2d 246, 252). The exemptions must, nonetheless, be given their natural and obvious meaning where such interpretation is consistent with the legislative intent and with the general purpose and manifest policy underlying FOIL <em>(see generally, Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen, </em>69 NY2d 246, 251-252, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Applying these general rules, we look first to the particular statutory language on which respondents base their claim of exemption. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (b) (iii) includes as an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d the \"sale and release of names and addresses if such lists would be used for commercial or fund-raising purposes\u201d. There can be little question that the direct-mail membership solicitation proposed here would constitute \"fund-raising\u201d if that term is given its natural and most obvious meaning <em>(see, Matter of Capital Newspapers v Whalen, supra, </em>at 251; McKinney\u2019s, Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 94). Petitioner seeks the names and addresses of rifle and shotgun permittees so that it may mail them circulars describing the organization, its activities, and the services it performs for members. The circular contains a statement of \"annual membership rates\u201d for both individuals and clubs and a detachable \"membership application\u201d to be completed and returned with the requisite payment. It is not disputed that a primary reason for conducting this general mail solicitation is to obtain membership dues to support the organization\u2019s activities. Simply put, the proposed mailing is to <em>raise funds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We reject petitioner\u2019s argument \u2014 relying on <em>Matter of New York Teachers Pension Assn. v Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. </em>(71 AD2d 250, 256) and <em>New York Veteran Police Assn. v New York City Police Dept. </em>(92 AD2d 772, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 that seeking membership dues to promote the aims of a nonprofit organization is different from directly soliciting contributions. It is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>purpose of the solicitation which matters, not what it is called, the manner or form in which it is presented to the solicitees, or the incidental benefits available to those who make a payment \u2014 as, for example, in the case before us, the receipt of the organization\u2019s bimonthly newspaper or free legal advice in firearms licensing cases. If, as is unquestionably true here, dues received are intended to support the general activities of the organization and to further its over-all objectives, the solicitation activity is \"fund-raising\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Our construction of the term \"fund-raising\u201d is not in any sense inimical to the policies of FOIL. It does not deny disclosure of official information helpful to the public in making \"intelligent, informed choices with respect to both the direction and scope of governmental activities (see Public Officers Law, \u00a7 84).\u201d <em>(Matter of Fink v Lefkowitz, supra, </em>at 571.) It is not even suggested that disclosure of the names and addresses of the permittees would promote this objective. Indeed, it is precisely <em>because </em>no governmental purpose is served by public disclosure of certain personal information about private citizens that the privacy exemption of section 87 (2) (b) fits comfortably within FOIL\u2019S statutory scheme. Thus, the rights of individuals to be free from unwanted commercial contacts or nonprofit fund-raising efforts \u2014 specifically recognized by the Legislature in the exemption at issue here \u2014 can be given precedence without undercutting FOIL\u2019S purpose. In deciding what the Legislature intended to include in this particular category of exempted records, it is not for us\u2014 contrary to the suggestion in petitioner\u2019s brief \u2014 to weigh the degree of annoyance or intrusion which would result from the receipt by mail of dues solicitations. It is enough that the Legislature has seen fit to classify the release of the names and addresses of individuals for use in such fund-raising efforts as an unwarranted invasion of their privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In view of the foregoing, it is unnecessary to address the other arguments presented in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Accordingly, the order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\"2.
