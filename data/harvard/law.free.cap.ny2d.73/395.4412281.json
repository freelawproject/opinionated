The interpretation that the presumption contained in Retirement and Social Security Law former \u00a7 363-a applies for purposes of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a renders the statute unconstitutional and is therefore an incorrect construction of the statute. <em>(King v City of Newburgh, </em>84 AD2d 388; <em>People v Dozier, </em>72 AD2d 478; <em>Poggi v City of New York, </em>109 AD2d 265; <em>Matter of Arnold v Reed, </em>57 AD2d 1043; <em>Dandridge v Williams, </em>397 US 471; <em>McGowan v Maryland, </em>366 US 420.)

The rules of statutory construction and interpretation reveal the Legislature\u2019s intent that a disabled firefighter applying for section 207-a entitlements receive the benefit of the heart disease presumption. <em>(King v City of Newburgh, </em>84 AD2d 388; <em>Local 589 v City of Newburgh, </em>116 AD2d 396; <em>Matter of Callas v City of Elmira, </em>88 AD2d 1015; <em>Legg v Fitzmaurice, </em>112 Misc 2d 283; <em>Traver v City of Poughkeepsie, </em>108 AD2d 18; <em>Matter of Driscoll v Department of Fire, </em>112 AD2d 751; <em>Matter of Kieper v Fitzgibbons, </em>91 Misc 2d 1067; <em>Matter of Sutka v Conners, </em>139 AD2d 242; <em>Matter of Gregory v Board of Appeals, </em>57 NY2d 865; <em>Schillawski v State of New York, </em>9 NY2d 235; <em>City of Buffalo v Roadway Tr.

In interpreting the scope of section 363-a (1) and section 207-a (1), the court should be mindful of the mischief to be remedied. <em>(Lincoln First Bank v Rupert, </em>60 AD2d 193; <em>Childs v Childs, </em>69 AD2d 406.) III. Appellants\u2019 submissions of communications and messages sent to the Governor about section 363-a (1) are inconclusive. <em>(Recreation Lines v Public Serv.

We conclude that it should not, and therefore reverse the order of the Appellate Division and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">After passing a physical examination, in January 1971 petitioner commenced employment as a firefighter for the Board of Fire Commissioners of the Fairview Fire District. He served until May 1984, when he was suspended on charges of misconduct. While under suspension, on June 8, 1984 petitioner was in his backyard after boating with his son, and experienced discomfort in his chest and right arm which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>required hospitalization. The episode was diagnosed as a nontransmural myocardial infarction; further examination revealed that petitioner was suffering from coronary artery disease and angina. As a result, petitioner has been physically unable to perform the duties of a firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Petitioner applied to the Board of Fire Commissioners for full salary and medical expenses under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a. The Board after a hearing denied his application, concluding that the June 8 incident did not occur as a result of petitioner\u2019s employment or in the performance of his official duties for the Fire District, but rather as a result of an underlying heart problem that had developed over a long period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Petitioner commenced this article 78 proceeding to annul respondents\u2019 determination and allow him benefits under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a. Supreme Court transferred the proceeding to the Appellate Division, which granted the petition and remitted the matter to respondents for a calculation of back pay due petitioner. The Appellate Division, relying on <em>Traver v City of Poughkeepsie </em>(108 AD2d 18), found that the statutory presumption contained in Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363-a (1) applied to firefighters seeking disability benefits under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a, and that the Board had failed to rebut the presumption that petitioner\u2019s heart condition arose in the line of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We granted respondents\u2019 motion for leave to appeal (CPLR 5602 [a] [2]), and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Recognizing the extraordinary personal risk inherent in firefighting, the Legislature has long provided special benefits for firefighters injured in connection with their employment <em>(see, </em>General Municipal Law art 10; Retirement and Social Security Law art 8). For decades, however, firefighters\u2019 heart-related disabilities have been a subject of intense controversy \u2014employee associations insisting that it is wholly unrealistic to require each firefighter applying for benefits to establish a causal nexus between a heart condition and the work, public officials and others opposing any diminution in the firefighters\u2019 burden of proof on causation <em>(see, Uniformed Firefighters Assn. v Beekman, </em>52 NY2d 463). While the Legislature has responded to the issue by establishing certain presumptions, there is no single comprehensive statute clearly delineating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the various benefits and burdens of proof. Rather, several pertinent provisions have been separately adopted, extended, amended and reamended over the years. These provisions, often couched in \"indirect and obtuse language\u201d <em>(Traver v City of Poughkeepsie, </em>108 AD2d 18, 20, <em>supra), </em>erect different requirements depending on the status and location of the persons involved, the benefits sought, and the entity responsible for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In that the question raised by this appeal requires consideration of the interrelationship among the relevant statutory sections, we begin our analysis by briefly describing the provisions in order of their enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a. Petitioner\u2019s claim for benefits was lodged under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a, originally adopted more than 50 years ago (L 1938, ch 562). In its present incarnation, section 207-a provides for sick leave benefits for any paid firefighter who belongs to \"an organized fire company or fire department of a city of less than one million population, or town, village or fire district, who is injured in the performance of his duties or who is taken sick as a result of the performance of his duties so as to necessitate medical or other lawful remedial treatment.\u201d (General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a [1].) No presumption regarding causation is set forth in the section. The benefits provided by section 207-a consist of full salary until the disability ceases as well as medical and hospital expenses; some portion of those benefits may continue even after retirement (General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a [4]). The cost of section 207-a benefits is directly borne by the municipality or fire district that employs the disabled firefighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363. This section governs accidental disability retirement for retirement system members. In 1969, the Legislature adopted section 363-a \u2014 the \"New York State Heart Bill\u201d \u2014 for one year (L 1969, ch 1103).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>While section 363-a required proof that the injury was incurred in the line of duty <em>(see, Matter of Bunnell v New York State Policemen\u2019s &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>50 AD2d 244, 245-246, <em>appeal dismissed </em>39 NY2d 742), it established a presumption that injury to or impairment of the heart was the natural and proximate result of an accident, unless any substantial evidence to the contrary could be shown (L 1969, ch 1103, \u00a7 1; <em>see also, Uniformed Firefighters Assn. v Beekman, supra, </em>at 472, n 2; Note, <em>New York Heart Bills: Presumptions Governing Police and Firefighters\u2019 Cardiac Disabilities, </em>10 Fordham Urban LJ 247, 259-262 [1982]). The section was expressly limited to claims under the New York State Policemen\u2019s and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (renamed the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System [L 1987, ch 506]) \"or any general, special or local law relating to the operation and qualification for benefits under any municipal pension or retirement plan or system.\u201d (L 1969, ch 1103, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.) Subdivision (2), moreover, restricted availability of the presumption to firefighters who were \"members\u201d of the State retirement system <em>(see, </em>Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 302 [11]; \u00a7 340 [c], [e] and [g]).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-k. In 1970 the Legislature enacted the \"New York City Heart Bill,\u201d General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-k (L 1970, ch 805; <em>see also, </em>Note, <em>op. cit., </em>10 Fordham Urban LJ, at 253-25S). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 207-k, which ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>pressly excludes section 207-a from its coverage, created for New York City paid firefighters a rebuttable \"line-of-duty\u201d presumption. The section specifies that impairment of health caused by diseases of the heart and the resulting disability or death are presumptive evidence that the impairment is service-connected, unless proven otherwise <em>(see also, Uniformed Firefighters Assn. v Beekman, </em>52 NY2d 463, <em>supra). </em>Also pertinent to a consideration of the New York City Heart Bill and its relation with other analogous sections is the fact that New York City supports its own pension and retirement system, overseen by the Board of Trustees of the Fire Department Pension Fund <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code of City of New York \u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Amended Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363-a. Weeks after modifying and extending General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-k, the Legislature amended section 363-a of the Retirement and Social Security Law by adding to that section, <em>in haec verba, </em>the line-of-duty presumption of section 207-k <em>(see, </em>L 1973, ch 1046, \u00a7 30). When the words of section 207-k were superimposed on section 363-a, the section also lost its concluding clauses (\"for the purposes of this article, or any general, special or local law relating to the operation and qualification for benefits under any municipal pension or retirement plan or system\u201d). Since 1973, section 363-a has for present purposes remained essentially unchanged, and has been extended periodically to the present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Against this backdrop we turn to petitioner\u2019s claim that the line-of-duty presumption of section 363-a (1) must be read into his application for sick leave benefits under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a. Without such a presumption, petitioner cannot satisfy the requirement of injury or illness in the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The Appellate Division read the line-of-duty presumption into General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a (1), relying on its own 1985 decision, <em>Traver v City of Poughkeepsie </em>(108 AD2d 18, <em>supra; see also, Matter of Driscoll v Department of Fire, </em>112 AD2d 751). Respondents urge that <em>Traver </em>was wrong; they say the presumptions of section 363-a must be limited to applications for accidental disability retirement benefits under Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363. Petitioner responds that the Appellate Division decisions are consistent with the plain language of section 363-a (1), as amended in 1973, which neither limits its applicability to retirement claims nor suggests that New York City firefighters should be treated differently from any others. Petitioner also asserts that the Legislature implicitly adopted <em>Traver </em>when it thereafter reenacted section 363-a <em>(see, </em>L 1987, ch 203, \u00a7 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In this claim for statutory benefits the court\u2019s objective is, of course, to discern and apply the will of the Legislature, not the court\u2019s own perception of what might be equitable. We are, moreover, mindful of the competing concerns that surrounded legislative enactment of the presumptions at issue. In matters of statutory interpretation generally, and particularly here, legislative intent is \"the great and controlling principle.\u201d <em>(People v Ryan, </em>274 NY 149, 152.) Legislative intent may be discerned from the face of a statute, but an apparent lack of ambiguity is rarely, if ever, conclusive <em>(New York State Bankers Assn. v Albright, </em>38 NY2d 430, 436-437). Generally, inquiry must be made of the spirit and purpose of the legislation, which requires examination of the statutory context of the provision as well as its legislative history <em>(see, Ferres v City of New Rochelle, </em>68 NY2d 446, 451; <em>Matter of Albano v Kirby, </em>36 NY2d 526, 529-530; <em>Matter of Petterson v Daystrom Corp., </em>17 NY2d 32, 38).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">These principles of statutory construction assume particular significance where, as here, the Legislature has spoken to an issue simultaneously in separate laws, sometimes cross-referencing them, and has repeatedly adopted and amended perti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>nent provisions piecemeal throughout decades. While petitioner would have us limit our analysis to a seemingly unambiguous pronouncement in section 363-a of the Retirement and Social Security Law, no one clause isolated from its statutory setting could be determinative of a lack of ambiguity or of legislative intent as to the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We conclude that the 1973 amendment to Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 363-a was neither unambiguous as petitioner suggests nor, viewed in its statutory context and history, did it implicitly amend General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Section 363-a, as originally enacted, was plainly limited to retirement matters. It so provided and was so applied <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Pastor v Levitt, </em>58 AD2d 669, <em>lv denied </em>42 NY2d 808; <em>Matter of Conn v Levitt, 52 </em>AD2d 1021; <em>Matter of Bunnell v New York State Policemen\u2019s &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., supra). </em>While the 1973 amendment dropped the section\u2019s concluding clauses expressly limiting it to retirement matters, this revision did not effect the sweeping change petitioner urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Unlike the General Municipal Law, article 8 of the Retirement and Social Security Law (containing \u00a7 363-a) \u2014 entitled \"New York State Policemen\u2019s and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System\u201d \u2014 specifically governs retirement matters. If the Legislature had wished to add a line-of-duty presumption to section 207-a of the General Municipal Law, it could readily have amended that section, or even amended section 207-k, which expressly excludes firefighters covered by section 207-a. We cannot assume that the Legislature made a significant addition to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a (1) by amending the Retirement and Social Security Law without acknowledging it somewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Sections 207-a and 363-a in fact represent separate disability systems with differing coverage and consequences <em>(see, Matter of Klonowski v Department of Fire, </em>58 NY2d 398; <em>Matter of Mashnouk v Miles, 55 </em>NY2d 80). Section 207-a (1) applies to firefighters who belong to \"an organized fire company or fire department\u201d; section 363-a applies to \"members\u201d of a retirement system as defined by the Retirement and Social Security Law. Under section 207-a (1) a disabled firefighter is paid by the municipality or fire district; under section 363 benefits are paid by the retirement system \u2014 a significant distinction, as respondents point out, for fire dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>tricts having to compensate both a disabled employee and a substitute. The differences are further underscored by the distinctions in subdivisions (2) through (4-a) of section 207-a between sick leave benefits available under subdivision (1) and various \"retirement\u201d benefits available under the Retirement and Social Security Law. In short, from the face of the statutes, the 1973 amendment to section 363-a was not intended to increase the scope of coverage under section 207-a; it surely did not do so unambiguously.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Looking beyond the face of the statutes, the legislative history of the 1973 amendment contains no reference to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a. Nor can we agree with the suggestion in <em>Traver </em>(108 AD2d, at 22, <em>supra) </em>that the executive department memorandum accompanying the amendment evidenced a legislative intent to apply the job-related disability presumption of section 363-a to section 207-a. That memorandum is consistent with the conclusion that the amendment was intended simply to provide firefighters applying for <em>retirement benefits </em>under section 363 the same line-of-duty presumption that New York City firefighters had been allowed under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-k <em>(see, Uniformed Firefighters Assn. v Beekman, </em>52 NY2d 463, 472, n 2, <em>supra; </em>Division of Budget Mem, Governor\u2019s Bill Jacket, L 1974, ch 967, \u00a7 1 [1973 amendment provided that presumption for members of the State retirement system extends to both service connection and accidental cause]).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We note in this connection that the executive department memorandum is devoid of reference to any additional cost to municipalities that would result from a new presumption under section 207-a <em>(see, </em>Legislative Law \u00a7 50 [\"A bill which enacts or amends any provision of law relating to a retirement system or plan of the state of New York or of any of its political subdivisions shall contain a fiscal note stating the estimated annual cost to the employer affected and the source of such estimate.\u201d]). Additionally, when section 363-a was again amended in 1974, and thereafter extended and reextended to date, the bill jackets reflect that the benefits were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>consistently described as retirement disability benefits, paid by the retirement system to retirement system members.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Addressing petitioner\u2019s legislative reenactment argument, the Legislature\u2019s extension of section 363-a after <em>Traver </em>was decided in 1985 is not material to the issue before us. The single writing in <em>Traver </em>did not constitute the sort of pervasive settled doctrine that makes legislative reenactment relevant in this respect <em>(see, Boreali v Axelrod, </em>71 NY2d 1, 13; <em>Matter of Knight-Ridder Broadcasting v Greenberg, </em>70 NY2d 151, 157-158).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Finally, combining all of these factors, there is a stark difference between the present record and the record in <em>Uniformed Firefighters Assn. v Beekman (supra). </em>In <em>Beekman, </em>we concluded that General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-k established a presumption that heart impairment was accidentally sustained, although the statute itself did not expressly so provide. In reaching that conclusion, we looked to the extensive legislative history of section 207-k pointing to the legislative purpose that such proof not be required, and to the contemporaneous opinion of the city\u2019s own legal officer, the Corporation Counsel; we looked to the consistent practical application over many years by the agencies responsible for administering the statute, who had imposed no requirement of proof of accident; and we looked to the nine separate reenactments of the section by the Legislature, apprised of the controversy, including the latest enactment when the bill\u2019s sponsor endorsed the accepted and long-standing interpretation. No such record is presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, respondents\u2019 determination reinstated and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Alexander, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-8\">.
