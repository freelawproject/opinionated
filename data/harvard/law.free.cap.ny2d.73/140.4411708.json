The court\u2019s failure to charge on the Statute of Limitations as applied to the conspiracy count, pursuant to Leisner\u2019s written request, was reversible error, which was not waived by the failure to renew the request thereafter. <em>(United States v Greichunos, </em>572 F Supp 220; <em>United States v Head, </em>641 F2d 174; <em>United States v Ruggiero, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>726 F2d 913; <em>People v Le Mieux, </em>51 NY2d 981; <em>People v Hoke, </em>62 NY2d 1022; <em>People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273; <em>People v Lipton, </em>54 NY2d 340; <em>People v Cobos, </em>57 NY2d 798; <em>People v Cona, </em>49 NY2d 26; <em>People v Teeter, </em>47 NY2d 1002.) II. The court\u2019s error in permitting the jury to return a guilty verdict on the basis of defective overt acts, despite a timely motion to strike them, was reversible and preserved. <em>(People v Bongarzone, </em>69 NY2d 892; <em>People v Menache, </em>98 AD2d 335; <em>People v Musso, </em>57 AD2d 578; <em>People v Blase, </em>112 AD2d 943; <em>United States v Lieberman, </em>637 F2d 95.) III. Leisner was prejudiced by proof of a conspiracy of which he was not a member, requiring reversal of his conviction. <em>(United States v Alessi, </em>638 F2d 466; <em>United States v Cambindo Valencia, </em>609 F2d 603; <em>United States v Varelli, </em>407 F2d 735; <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750; <em>Blumenthal v United States, </em>332 US 539; <em>United States v Bernstein, </em>533 F2d 775, 429 US 998; <em>United States v Bertolotti, </em>529 F2d 149; <em>United States v Miley, </em>513 F2d 1191.) IV. The evidence was insufficient to make out Leisner\u2019s guilt of conspiracy to commit extortion by instilling a fear of \"physical injury\u201d. V. Leisner adopts any argument raised by his coappellant Marx which is favorable to him and consistent with his position on this appeal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\"><em>Herald Price Fahringer </em>and <em>Diarmuid White </em>for Max Marx, appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APJ\">I. Max Marx was denied due process, under both the New York State and Federal Constitutions, because the prosecutor failed to prove the single conspiracy charged in the indictment, and Justice Leif refused to charge the jury that if they found that several conspiracies existed, they must acquit defendants. <em>(People v McGee, </em>49 NY2d 48; <em>United States v Borelli, </em>336 F2d 376; <em>United States v Cambindo Valencia, </em>609 F2d 603; <em>United States v Bertolotti, </em>529 F2d 149; <em>United States v Fuel, </em>583 F2d 978; <em>United States v Miley, </em>513 F2d 1191; <em>United States v Varelli, </em>407 F2d 735; <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750; <em>People v Pelchat, </em>62 NY2d 97; <em>People v Glen, </em>173 NY 395.) II. The court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the Statute of Limitations as it related to the conspiracy charge was reversible error, and counsel did not withdraw a request for that instruction. <em>(People v Hoke, </em>62 NY2d 1022; <em>People v Le Mieux, </em>51 NY2d 981; <em>People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273.) III. It was reversible error for the court, as part of its charge, to read selected portions of the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law. <em>(People v Leonard, </em>77 AD2d 605; <em>People v Bell, </em>38 NY2d 116; <em>People v Johnson, </em>6 AD2d 181; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Bollenbach v United States, </em>326 US 607; <em>People v Bacaloeostantis, </em>111 AD2d 991.) IV. There was insufficient independent evidence to sustain the conviction of Max Marx for conspiracy. <em>(People v Moses, </em>63 NY2d 299; <em>People v Hudson, </em>51 NY2d 233; <em>People v Ohlstein, </em>54 AD2d 109, 44 NY2d 896; <em>People v Kress, </em>284 NY 452.) V. Max Marx\u2019s sentence should be vacated because he was denied due process at sentencing. <em>(Gardner v Florida, </em>430 US 349; <em>United States v Pugliese, </em>805 F2d 1117; <em>People v Andujar, </em>110 AD2d 606; <em>People v McGee, </em>49 NY2d 48.) VI. Max Marx adopts the claims and arguments of coappellant Morris Leisner where they are not inconsistent with those raised in this brief.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-5\"><em>Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney (Lisa Feiner </em>and <em>Mark Dwyer </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ9\">I. Defendants\u2019 guilt of the single conspiracy charged in the indictment was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v Keindl, </em>68 NY2d 410; <em>United States v Borelli, </em>336 F2d 376, <em>cert denied sub nom. Mogavero v United States, </em>379 US 960; <em>People v Engel, </em>200 Misc 60; <em>Braverman v United States, </em>317 US 49; <em>People v Trammell, </em>50 Misc 2d 179; <em>United States v Perez, </em>489 F2d 51; <em>United States v Tramunti, </em>513 F2d 1087; <em>United States v Panebianco, </em>543 F2d 447; <em>United States v Taylor, </em>562 F2d 1345, <em>cert denied sub nom. Salley v United States, </em>432 US 909.) II. The court was not required to charge the jury to acquit defendants if the People proved several conspiracies rather than the one conspiracy alleged in the indictment. <em>(United States v Alessi, </em>638 F2d 466; <em>United States v Murray, </em>618 F2d 892; <em>United States v Martino, </em>664 F2d 860, <em>cert denied sub nom. Miller v United States, 458 </em>US 1110; <em>United States v Ocampo, </em>650 F2d 421; <em>People v Watts, </em>57 NY2d 299; <em>United States v Tramunti, </em>513 F2d 1087; <em>United States v Cambindo Valencia, </em>609 F2d 603; <em>United States v Eubanks, </em>591 F2d 513; <em>United States v Griffin, </em>464 F2d 1352; <em>United States v Mack, </em>837 F2d 254.) III. Defendants abandoned their request for a Statute of Limitations charge on the conspiracy count and have therefore not preserved their complaint about the court\u2019s failure to give it. In any event, no such charge was called for. <em>(People v Hoke, </em>62 NY2d 1022; <em>People v Lipton, </em>54 NY2d 340; <em>People v Le Mieux, </em>51 NY2d 981; <em>People v Lam Lek Chong, 45 </em>NY2d 64; <em>People v Watts, 57 </em>NY2d 299.) IV. None of the overt acts submitted to the jury was defective as a matter of law. The jury was, therefore, entitled to consider all of them in determining whether the People had proven the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>commission of an overt act by one of the conspirators. <em>(People v Sheldon, </em>139 NY 251; <em>Yates v United States, </em>354 US 298; <em>People v De Cabia, </em>10 Misc 2d 923; <em>United States v Marable, </em>574 F2d 224; <em>United States v Villarreal, </em>546 F2d 1145; <em>United States v Ammar, </em>714 F2d 238; <em>United States v Gibbs, </em>739 F2d 838; <em>United States v Paone, </em>782 F2d 386; <em>United States v Gomez, </em>810 F2d 947; <em>People v Menache, </em>98 AD2d 335.) V. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Marx\u2019s motion for a severance. <em>(People v Bornholdt, </em>33 NY2d 75, <em>cert denied sub nom. Victory v New York, </em>416 US 905; <em>United States v Bari, </em>750 F2d 1169, <em>cert denied sub nom. Benfield v United States, </em>472 US 1019.) VI. The court properly read from a portion of the New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Law while defining property under the larceny statute. <em>(People v Garland, </em>69 NY2d 144.) VII. The court was not required to recuse itself from sentencing, and imposed sentence with a presentence report that was fair. <em>(People v Moreno, </em>70 NY2d 403; <em>People v Perry, </em>36 NY2d 114.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b206-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b206-6\">Titone, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Appellants Morris Leisner and Max Marx were indicted on December 14, 1984, and charged with one count of conspiracy and numerous substantive counts of attempted extortion and coercion based upon their alleged involvement in a plot to force tenants from their rent-controlled apartments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants, who owned several buildings in Manhattan both individually and jointly, allegedly sought to rid the buildings of tenants by instilling fear of personal injury and property damage, thereby increasing the buildings\u2019 resale value. Ultimately, appellants were convicted solely of conspiracy in the fourth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 105.10 [1]), and sentenced to indeterminate terms of imprisonment of from 1 to 4 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">At trial, the prosecution attempted to show that Leisner and Marx hired Morris Lender and Hardman P. Lambert to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\"relocate\u201d tenants from the subject buildings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the proof at trial demonstrated, the relocation techniques used by Lender and Lambert were highly unsavory. From December 1978 to July 1980, Lender and Lambert installed drug addicts, pimps, prostitutes and assorted thugs in appellants\u2019 buildings in order to coerce the tenants into abandoning their apartments. When threats, intimidation and abuse did not immediately produce the desired results, apartments were broken into and property was stolen or vandalized. According to the prosecution, appellants were aware of and condoned these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">With respect to the conspiracy count in the indictment, the prosecution endeavored to show that all of the aforementioned activities were part of one single integrated conspiracy. Although a majority of the buildings in question were individually owned, the prosecution theorized that the movements of the Lender-Lambert \"group\u201d were coordinated with the purchase and subsequent sale of buildings by Marx and Leisner, and that these activities constituted a unitary conspiracy to commit extortion. Eighty-six overt acts were alleged in the indictment, a significant majority of which occurred before December 14, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In defense to the substantive counts, both Leisner and Marx argued that they neither knew about nor authorized the use of any unlawful means to empty their buildings. In response to the conspiracy count, appellants argued that, if a conspiracy existed at all, the facts revealed three separate and discrete agreements concerning the relocation of tenants from different buildings: (1) the Marx buildings (W. 23rd St. and E. 30th St.); (2) the Leisner buildings (W. 22nd St., W. 80th St., Eighth Ave.); and (3) the jointly owned buildings (W. 53rd St.; W. 46th St., Ninth Ave. and 48th St.).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Based upon this argument, defendants submitted the following written request to charge: \"[I]n order to convict either defendant of the conspiracy alleged in Count One, you must find that the single overall conspiracy alleged in that Count existed, and that each defendant joined that conspiracy. If you find that more than one conspiracy existed, you cannot convict either defendant of conspiracy unless you find that at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>one of those conspiracies is the conspiracy alleged in Count One and the defendants were members of that conspiracy.\u201d In addition, appellants submitted a written charge directing that before the jury could convict either defendant of conspiracy, it must find that at least one overt act was committed within the past five years as required by the Statute of Limitations (CPL 30.10 [2] [b]). Neither of these charges nor their equivalents were given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">After a six-week trial and five days of deliberation, the jury acquitted Leisner and Marx of one count of attempted grand larceny and one count of attempted coercion, both involving the same tenant, Ion Burta. Both defendants were convicted of conspiracy to commit grand larceny in the first degree by extortion. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining substantive counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">On appeal, appellants challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the trial court\u2019s failure to give the two above-mentioned charges. The Appellate Division rejected their arguments and affirmed the convictions. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CHARGE</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Appellants argue that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to charge, as requested in writing by appellants, that before the jury could convict either defendant of conspiracy, it must find that at least one overt act was committed after December 14, 1979. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The establishment by the prosecution of a timely overt act by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy was clearly necessary to satisfy both the applicable Statute of Limitations (CPL 30.10 [2] [b]), and the elements of the crime (Penal Law \u00a7 105.20; <em>see also, </em>1 Sand, Siffert, Loughlin &amp; Reiss, Modern Federal Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal, Aug. 1986 Supp, at 52-53 [Matthew Bender 1986]). Such an instruction was critical here because an overwhelming majority of the overt acts on which the People relied were outside the Statute of Limitations. Because it is impossible to determine at this point whether the conviction was supported by a timely overt act, it plainly cannot be said that the error was harmless <em>(see, Yates v United States, </em>354 US 298; <em>United States v Head, </em>641 F2d 174, <em>on remand </em>697 F2d 1200, <em>cert denied </em>462 US 1132; <em>United States v Greichunos, </em>572 F Supp 220, 225-227).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Although it did not disagree that a Statute of Limitations charge would have been appropriate, the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Division concluded that reversal was not required because, in its view, appellants had withdrawn their requested charge on the issue, thereby waiving their objection to the court\u2019s failure to so charge (138 AD2d 273, 276). We disagree. In <em>People v Le Mieux </em>(51 NY2d 981), this court noted that, under the clear language of CPL 470.05 (2), an objection is deemed preserved when the court fails to grant a written charge request, regardless of the absence of a specific postcharge exception. Further, even though the defendant in <em>Le Mieux </em>had made specific reference to other omitted charges while making only a blanket renewal of all his prior requests (including the request disputed on appeal), the issue was not forfeited because defendant had not \"demonstrated a clear intent to waive a position already preserved\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 983). In <em>People v Whalen </em>(59 NY2d 273), in contrast, the trial court stated that it was granting defendant\u2019s submitted charge, but then delivered a different version than was requested by defendant. In that situation we held that \"[w]hen a Judge grants a request to charge and then fails to deliver the charge as requested, the requesting party has an obligation to draw the error to the Judge\u2019s attention\u201d <em>(People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273, 280, <em>supra). </em>Finally, in <em>People v Hoke </em>(62 NY2d 1022), we concluded that when a Trial Judge denies a requested charge and, in its place, gives a different instruction on the same subject without a defense exception, the propriety of the court\u2019s refusal to charge is preserved, but any issue as to the instruction as given is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, defense counsel made a written request to charge on the Statute of Limitations, but the trial court did not promptly rule on that request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, appellants were entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>to assume their request had been denied (CPL 300.10 [5]). Additionally, since the trial court did not give a variation on the requested charge, appellants were under no further duty to preserve their claim <em>(People v Whalen, supra). </em>Therefore, this case is most similar to <em>Le Mieux </em>and the only question is whether appellants \"demonstrated a clear intent\u201d to abandon their request on the Statute of Limitations. We believe they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">During the precharge conference, the Statute of Limitations was mentioned in two contexts. First, the subject was broached in regard to two substantive counts involving Ion Burta, a tenant in the West 53rd Street building. Second, appellant Marx\u2019s counsel raised the limitations issue in connection with the multiple conspiracy theory he had advanced. Neither of these discussions evinced a \"clear intent\u201d by defendants to waive their right to a Statute of Limitations charge on the entirely separate issue of the overt act element of the conspiracy count. Nor can such an intent be inferred from the fact that appellants\u2019 counsel took 21 specific exceptions to the court\u2019s charge, without mentioning the Statute of Limitations issue <em>(see, People v Le Mieux, supra).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">MULTIPLE CONSPIRACIES</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Since there must be a retrial, we deem it appropriate to comment on an additional error in the trial court\u2019s charge so that its repetition may be avoided. Appellants argue that the trial court committed reversible error by refusing to charge the jury on the possibility of multiple conspiracies. Additionally, they argue that, at best, the proof at trial established a number of discrete conspiracies, not the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment. Appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge as requested, and the prejudicial spillover effect resulting from combining separate conspiracies into a single count constitute reversible error. Although we reject appellants\u2019 contention regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the single conspiracy charged in the indictment, we agree that the trial court committed error in refusing to charge the jury on multiple conspiracies.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The crime of conspiracy has been described as the \"darling of the modern prosecutor\u2019s nursery\u201d <em>(Harrison v United States, </em>7 F2d 259, 263 [Hand, J.]), perhaps because it exemplifies the \" 'tendency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its logic\u2019 \u201d <em>(Krulewitch v United States, </em>336 US 440, 445 [Jackson, J., concurring], citing Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, at 51) and furnishes the prosecution with potent evidentiary weapons. For instance, the overt acts of any conspirator may be attributed to other conspirators to establish the offense of conspiracy <em>(People v McGee, </em>49 NY2d 48, 57). Similarly, the acts and declarations of any conspirator may be used against the others once a prima facie conspiracy case has been established <em>(People v Salko, </em>47 NY2d 230, 237-238; <em>People v Rastelli, </em>37 NY2d 240). In addition, a conspirator may be prosecuted in the county in which he entered into the conspiracy or in any county in which an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed (Penal Law \u00a7 105.25 [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">While such rules give the prosecution helpful tools in proving these often elusive crimes, they also create some risk of prejudice to the defense. This risk is greatest when the prosecution combines a number of seemingly related criminal agreements into a single integrated conspiracy count <em>(see, </em>Note, <em>The Conspiracy Dilemma: Prosecution of Group Crime or Protection of Individual Defendants, </em>62 Harv L Rev 276 [1948]; Note, <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Criminal <em>Conspiracy, </em>72 Harv L Rev 920, 983-985 [1959]; Note, <em>Federal Treatment of Multiple Conspiracies, </em>57 Colum L Rev 387, 397-398 [1957]). In such circumstances, the \"all too real\u201d danger that a jury will find guilt by association is well recognized <em>(see, Berger v United States, </em>295 US 78; <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750, 772-773; <em>Krulewitch v United States, </em>336 US 440, 445 [Jackson, J., concurring], <em>supra). </em>Moreover, jury confusion may arise when the prosecution\u2019s proof establishes several discrete conspiracies, but not the single integrated conspiracy charged in the indictment. Indeed, it has been noted that \"[t]his danger of sacrificing individual justice arises most often * * * wherein questions are raised as to. whether there was one single conspiracy or several minor conspiracies\u201d <em>(United States v Eubanks, </em>591 F2d 513, 522 [Ely, J., concurring] [9th Cir]; <em>see also, United States v Sperling, </em>506 F2d 1323, 1340-1341, <em>cert denied </em>420 US 962 [cautioning that use of single conspiracy indictments may lead to unnecessary exposure to reversal]).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Although this court has never addressed the problems created when the prosecution attempts to combine a series of agreements into a single integrated conspiracy, the Federal courts have been struggling with the dilemma for some 40 years <em>(see, Berger v United States, </em>295 US 78, <em>supra; Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750, <em>supra; see generally, </em>Note, <em>Federal Treatment of Multiple Conspiracies, op. cit.). </em>The Federal Circuit Courts appear to be in agreement that the determination as to whether a single conspiracy was demonstrated by the evidence is a classic question of fact <em>(see, United States v Alessi, </em>638 F2d 466 [2d Cir]; <em>United States v Brito, </em>721 F2d 743 [11th Cir]; <em>United States v Michel, </em>588 F2d 986 [5th Cir], <em>cert denied </em>444 US 825; <em>United States v Perry, </em>550 F2d 524 [9th Cir], <em>cert denied sub nom. Ware v United States, </em>431 US 918). Thus, the jury must be instructed on the single-multiple conspiracy issue when the facts are such that a jury might reasonably find either a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies <em>(see, United States v Cambindo Valencia, </em>609 F2d 603, 625 [2d Cir]; <em>United States v Eubanks, </em>591 F2d 513, 518 [9th Cir], <em>supra </em>[\"(i)f it is possible under the evidence for the jury to find that multiple conspiracies existed, then the court should instruct the jury on the issue\u201d]; <em>but see, e.g., United States v Martino, </em>664 F2d 860; <em>United States v Ocampo, </em>650 F2d 421).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Like the Federal courts, we believe that because the clarity of the charge is so crucial in these complex conspiracy trials, a charge must be given explicitly recognizing the possibility of multiple conspiracies and directing an acquittal in the event that the jury concludes that something other than a single integrated conspiracy was proven. Such a charge is required whenever the possibility of more than one conspiracy is supported by a reasonable view of the evidence <em>(see, </em>CPL 300.10 [2]; <em>see also, People v Butts, </em>72 NY2d 746; <em>People v Farnsworth, </em>65 NY2d 734; <em>People v Padgett, </em>60 NY2d 142; <em>People v Johnson, </em>45 NY2d 546; <em>People v Torre, </em>42 NY2d 1036; <em>People v Steele, </em>26 NY2d 526; <em>People v Asan, </em>22 NY2d 526; <em>People v Moran, </em>246 NY 100).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In this case, although the prosecution\u2019s \"single conspiracy\u201d approach was certainly viable, there was also a reasonable view of the evidence to support appellants\u2019 contention that any conspiracy or conspiracies proven were narrower in scope than the single overarching one charged in the indictment. Appellants point out that Morris Lender, the prosecution\u2019s chief witness, testified that Max Marx had nothing to do with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the Leisner buildings (22nd St., Eighth Ave., 80th St.), and did not participate in the vacating of those buildings. Lender further testified that there was no agreement between Marx and Leisner concerning the relocation of tenants from those buildings. Additionally, Max Marx testified that he had no interest in the Leisner buildings, that he had nothing to do with vacating the Leisner buildings, and that Leisner had no interest in his buildings. This testimony supported appellants\u2019 contention that whatever Leisner did at his buildings in no way \"depended\u201d on whether Marx succeeded or failed at vacating his own buildings, and vice versa, and that, consequently, there was no single overarching conspiracy. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury on the possibility of multiple conspiracies was error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We note, however, that even though a reasonable view of the evidence supports the multiple conspiracy charge, appellants are not entitled to a dismissal of the conspiracy count. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found that the single integrated conspiracy alleged in the indictment had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(Jackson v Virginia, </em>443 US 307, 319; <em>People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620, 621; <em>Matter of Anthony M., </em>63 NY2d 270, 280; <em>People v Lewis, </em>69 NY2d 321, 324).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In support of their single conspiracy theory, the prosecution relied upon what has become known as a \"wheel conspiracy\u201d approach, with the Lender-Lambert group as the hub and appellants both individually and jointly serving as the spokes. However, a single conspiracy cannot be found unless there is a \"rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes\u201d <em>(Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750, 755, <em>supra). </em>No matter the geometric shape taken by a conspiracy, \"the gist of the offense remains the agreement, and it is therefore essential to determine what kind of agreement or understanding existed as to each defendant\u201d <em>(United States v Borelli, </em>336 F2d 376, 384 [2d Cir] [Friendly, J.], citing Note, <em>Developments in the Law </em>\u2014 Criminal <em>Conspiracy, op. cit., </em>at 923-933; <em>see also, United States v Falcone, </em>109 F2d 579, <em>affd </em>311 US 205 [Judge Learned Hand\u2019s formulation of the stake in the venture test]; Note, <em>Resolution </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>of the Multiple Conspiracies Issue Via a \"Nature of the Enterprise\u201d Analysis: The Resurrection of Agreement, </em>42 Brooklyn L Rev 243 [1975]; Wechsler, Jones, Korn, <em>The Treatment of Inchoate Crimes in the Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute: Attempt, Solicitation, and Conspiracy, </em>61 Colum L Rev 957, 979-990 [1961]).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In order to prove the existence of such a \"rim\u201d, i.e., a single controlling agreement, the prosecution relied on the timing of appellants\u2019 purchasing, vacating and selling of the subject buildings, and the coordinated movements of the Lender-Lambert group <em>(see, </em>Note, <em>Federal Treatment of Multiple Conspiracies, op. cit., </em>at 388-389, n 12; <em>United States v Tramunti, </em>513 F2d 1087, 1106, as well as the existence of a \"joint economic benefit\u201d which, the prosecution argues, was demonstrated by the evidence that there was, in fact, disguised joint ownership of some of the buildings <em>(see, People v Ruiz, </em>130 Misc 2d 191, 193; <em>United States v Tilton, </em>610 F2d 302, 307 [5th Cir]; <em>United States v Bernstein, </em>533 F2d 775, 791 [2d Cir], <em>cert denied </em>429 US 998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree that a rational trier of fact could have inferred a single integrated conspiracy from this evidence. Accordingly, reversal and a retrial, rather than dismissal, is the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the orders of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In each case: Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\">. Appellants were indicted for conspiracy in the fourth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 105.10), 10 counts of attempted grand larceny in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 155.40 [now \u00a7 155.42]), two counts of grand larceny in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 155.40 [now \u00a7 155.42]), 10 counts of attempted coercion in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 135.65), two counts of coercion in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 135.65) and two counts of burglary in the third degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.20). Appellant Leisner was also indicted for an additional six counts of attempted grand larceny in the first degree and six counts of attempted coercion in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-8\">. The nine buildings involved in the conspiracy count of the indictment are: 345-347 West 22nd Street; 204 Eighth Avenue; 140 West 80th Street (Leisner\u2019s buildings); 351-353 West 53rd Street; 410-412 West 46th Street; 704-708 Ninth Avenue; and 367-369 West 48th Street (buildings owned jointly by Leisner and Marx); 171 West 23rd Street and 155-157 East 30th Street (Marx\u2019s buildings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">. After reviewing appellants\u2019 written charge requests, the Trial Judge endorsed on some of them either \"covered by charge\u201d or \"refused\u201d, and made his annotated copy a court exhibit. The Judge did not, however, explicitly rule on the Statute of Limitations request. Instead, he simply underlined the relevant date constituting the limitation deadline. Relying on this, the majority below concluded that the Trial Judge had not yet rejected appellants\u2019 request, but was apparently relying on the oral charge conferences to clarify appellants\u2019 position on the issue (138 AD2d 273, 276). This position is untenable. As pointed out by the dissent below, there is no indication that appellants\u2019 counsel ever saw the Judge\u2019s annotated copy. While appellants\u2019 requests were marked during the precharge conference, the court made reference to them for the first time during the postcharge conference. At this time, the court merely invited counsel to look at the annotations, but did not instruct them to do so. Thus, appellants\u2019 counsel were aware only that they had submitted a written charge, and that it had not been given in any form whatsoever. The Appellate Division\u2019s belief as to what the Trial Judge must have thought is sheer speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. The fact that two of appellants\u2019 exceptions concerned written charges which had been submitted and not given by the trial court, other than the Statute of Limitations charge, is of no legal consequence, since appellants were under no duty to bring such charges to the Judge\u2019s attention <em>(People v Hoke, 62 </em>NY2d 1022; <em>People v Le Mieux, </em>51 NY2d 981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. Since we are reversing on another ground, we need not address whether the Appellate Division\u2019s application of the \"substantial prejudice\u201d test, the harmless error rule applied by the Federal courts, was proper <em>(see, Berger v United States, </em>295 US 78; <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750; Note, <em>Federal Treatment of Multiple Conspiracies, </em>57 Colum L Rev 387).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. At trial, Marx testified that he had no ownership interest in 140 West 80th Street, but the evidence at trial showed that this building had been purchased by 650 Tenth Avenue Corporation, a company in which he conceded he was a principal and a signatory on a joint bank account with Leisner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
