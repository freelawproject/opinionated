In January 2014, Alby experienced back pain and could not move. Alby's treating orthopedic surgeon and medical-causation expert, Dr. Stefano Sinicropi, concluded that Alby suffered from degenerative disc disease and a disc herniation. Beginning in the spring of 2014, Alby underwent multiple medical procedures to address his back injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2014, Alby sued BNSF under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that BNSF's negligence, including violations of federal track standard regulations and the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020701\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), caused his back injury. BNSF moved to exclude Alby's proffered expert opinion, including that of Dr. Sinicropi, and moved for summary judgment. The district court denied BNSF's motions and the case proceeded to trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Alby testified at trial, along with Beau Price (BNSF's Director of Locomotive and Air Brake Systems), Dennis Luft (Alby's coworker at BNSF), Alan Blackwell (engineer), Dr. Robert Andres (ergonomist), and Dr. Sinicropi (Alby's medical-causation expert). The jury returned a special verdict in Alby's favor, finding that BNSF violated the LIA and that the violations caused, in whole or in part, Alby's back injury. The jury also found that BNSF did not violate any federal track regulations and was not negligent. The jury awarded Alby $1,888,264.90 in damages. The district court ordered collateral offsets to the award and ruled that the federal postjudgment interest rate is applicable to the resulting judgment of $1,524,663.79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BNSF moved for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) and, in the alternative, a new trial. The district court granted JMOL to BNSF, vacated the judgment in favor of Alby, and dismissed Alby's claims. The court also denied BNSF's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

For example, the court noted that Alby's medical-causation expert, Dr. Sinicropi, failed to provide the necessary causation evidence for Alby to succeed with his claim because he \"never tied the specific LIA violations\" to Alby's injuries.

The Tenth Circuit disagreed, affirming the jury instructions because trial testimony supported the fact that the employee's injuries may have been caused by his pre-existing degenerative disc disease had the accident not occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1495.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In this case, the district court determined that apportionment jury instructions were not necessary because \"there was very little evidence about Alby's prior back injuries, their seriousness, the probability that they could cause symptoms in the future, or their contribution\" to Alby's injuries. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Sauer\n   </em>\n   , and contrary to BNSF's argument, the court's aggravation jury instruction allowed the jury to diminish Alby's damages as they felt appropriate based on the evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, as the Supreme Court emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   , \"whether the immediate reason for an employee's injury was the proven negligence of the defendant railroad or some cause not identified from the evidence\" is irrelevant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    538 U.S. at 161-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    123 S.Ct. at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Here, because the jury instructions fairly and correctly stated the applicable law, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting BNSF's proposed apportionment jury instruction and did not abuse its discretion by denying BNSF's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because Alby satisfied the relaxed standard of proof applicable to FELA claims,\n   by providing adequate evidence that BNSF's LIA violations caused his injuries, the district court erred by granting JMOL to BNSF.
