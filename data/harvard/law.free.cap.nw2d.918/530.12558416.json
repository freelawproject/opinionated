The April 11, 2001 judgment of sentence specifies that the defendant is not required to register as a sex offender, and the trial court did not purport to amend that judgment. The court's October 24, 2002 order amending the order of probation to add sex offender registration as a condition of probation did not, and could not, extend the registration requirement beyond the term of probation. The authority to require compliance with SORA ended, at the very latest, after expiration of the five-year maximum period of probation that the trial court could have imposed. See\n   <em>\n    People v. Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1925830\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/340/495/#p501\">\n    340 Mich 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501-502,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.W.2d%20698\">\n    65 N.W.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954). As the April 11, 2001 judgment of sentence is the operative judgment in this case, the trial court's December 9, 2015 order properly ruled that the defendant is not required to register under SORA. The defendant is not required to file a motion for relief from judgment under MCR 6.501\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., because the order of probation has expired, and he is not seeking relief from his judgment of conviction and sentence, which provides that he is not required to comply with SORA. Regardless of the form of the defendant's motion, the trial court properly recognized the lack of authority to act contrary to the final judgment in the case.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
