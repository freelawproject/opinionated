We conclude the district court did not substantially comply with N.D.R.Crim.P. 11 when the court failed to inform Wallace of and determine that he understood the five-year mandatory minimum period of probation. We reverse and remand to the district court to allow Wallace to withdraw his plea of guilty and for further necessary proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In September 2016, the State charged Wallace with luring minors by computer or other electronic means under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-20-05.1, a class C felony. On October 3, 2017, the district court held a change of plea and sentencing hearing. At the hearing Wallace entered an open plea of guilty to the charge. Wallace was sentenced to a five-year prison term, with all but eighteen months suspended, and four years' probation. The criminal judgment was filed on October 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 3] On October 11, 2017, the State moved the district court to amend the criminal judgment to reduce Wallace's probation to three years. The court filed the first amended criminal judgment with a three-year probation term on November 9, 2017. On December 1, 2017, the State again moved the court to amend the criminal judgment to correct the length of probation to impose the mandatory minimum five-year period of probation required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-32-06.1(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 4] On December 26, 2017, while the second motion to amend was pending, Wallace filed the first of multiple notices of appeal. On December 28, 2017, these appellate proceedings were stayed to allow the district court an opportunity to consider the second motion to amend the judgment. On March 6, 2018, the district court filed a second amended criminal judgment increasing Wallace's probation by imposing a five-year term of probation consistent with the mandatory minimum period of probation required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-32-06.1(4). Wallace filed an additional notice of appeal on March 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] Wallace argues on appeal, among other things, that he was incorrectly charged, that he was \"entrapped\" by law enforcement, that the district court erred in denying him court-appointed counsel, that the court erred in amending the criminal judgment, and that the court erred in denying his demand for a change of judge. He also claims he was unaware that by pleading guilty he would be subject to a five-year mandatory minimum period of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Rule 11, N.D.R.Crim.P., governs pleas and provides the procedural framework for entering pleas. \"To be valid, a guilty plea must be entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the State concedes the record does not disclose whether Wallace was ever informed of or understood the five-year mandatory minimum period of probation imposed by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-32-06.1(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] Under N.D.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(H), the district court was required to inform Wallace of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   mandatory minimum penalty and determine that Wallace understood the mandatory minimum penalty.

We conclude the district court did not substantially comply with N.D.R.Crim.P. 11, and we are therefore compelled to remand this case to the district court to allow Wallace to withdraw his guilty plea. However, we also note the distinction between the imposition of a mandatory period of probation as required by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 12.1-32-06.1(4),\n   which has compelled the remand in this case, and conditions of probation or collateral consequences resulting from a defendant's sentence.\n   <em>\n    Davenport v.

Our review of a district court's decision to deny a defendant court-appointed counsel is limited to determining whether the district court abused its discretion. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, unconscionably, or unreasonably.\n   <em>\n    State v. DuPaul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10705750\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/527/238/#p240\">\n    527 N.W.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (N.D. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 12] We have held that \"[t]here is no legal reason to appoint counsel for someone who can afford and obtain his own.\"\n   <em>\n    DuPaul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10705750\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/527/238/#p240\">\n    527 N.W.2d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The right to counsel for those individuals who may not be able to afford their own counsel is governed by N.D.R.Crim.P. 44. \"An indigent defendant facing a felony charge in state court is entitled to have counsel provided at public expense to represent the defendant at every stage of the proceeding from initial appearance through appeal.\" N.D.R.Crim.P. 44(a)(1). Additionally, the district court may appoint counsel for a non-indigent defendant if the defendant cannot retain counsel. N.D.R.Crim.P. 44(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Wallace filed numerous applications for court-appointed counsel. The district court reviewed each of the applications, determined Wallace was not indigent, and denied his request for court-appointed counsel. In denying Wallace's requests for court-appointed counsel, the district court noted Wallace had assets in excess of $20,000; an amount in excess of the guideline amount for determining indigent status. The court further found Wallace transferred approximately $70,000 worth of assets to his son that could have been used to retain private counsel. Wallace also retained two private attorneys during the proceedings in the district court. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in the denial of Wallace's requests to be appointed indigent counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Wallace argues the district court erred when his demand for a change of judge was denied. Here, the presiding judge for the judicial district reviewed the demand, denied Wallace's request as untimely, and also addressed Wallace's allegation that the assigned judge was biased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Demands for a change of judge are governed by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21. A demand for change of judge is untimely if it is made more than ten days after the earliest of any of the following events:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a. The date of the notice of assignment or reassignment of a judge for trial of the case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   b. The date of notice that a trial has been scheduled; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   c. The date of service of any ex parte order in the case signed by the judge against whom the demand is filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21(2). Under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21(5) and (6), a demand for a change of judge is reviewed by the presiding judge of the judicial district where the action is pending. Wallace's demand for a change of judge was untimely and therefore was properly denied by the presiding judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rath v.
