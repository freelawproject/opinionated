The State charged Christensen with first-degree murder. The defense conceded Christensen was the shooter but argued he acted out of passion, warranting a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, the second of three lesser-included offenses. A jury found him guilty of second-degree murder, the first of the three lesser-included offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Christensen raises several issues. We find dispositive his claim of juror misconduct based on the introduction of extraneous information into jury deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Juror Misconduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Background Proceedings\n   </em>\n   . The proceedings leading up to the claim of juror misconduct are as follows. During the six-day trial, the district court repeatedly admonished the jurors \"not to converse among\" themselves \"or with anyone else on any subject connected with this case.\" They were also instructed not to \"allow anyone to speak with\" them \"about this case.\" If someone did, they were to \"walk away and ... not listen.\" If a person persisted in talking to them or in their presence, the court instructed the jurors to \"report it immediately\" to the clerk or to the court. The jurors' phones were taken away during deliberations. The jurors were \"admonished not to listen to, view, or read any form of media while this case is in progress.\" They were told, \"This includes ... the full gamut of social media, the internet, cell phone communications, Instagram, Twitter.\" They were instructed not to \"report to anybody on Facebook or any of those [social media] that\" they had \"been selected as a juror\" to avoid inadvertently receiving something they were \"not supposed to have.\" Finally, the court stated, \"Our goal here is to have this case decided strictly upon the evidence and testimony presented at trial. So we do not want you to see any outside information that's not presented here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the conclusion of trial, the district court reminded the jurors, \"You may not communicate about this case before reaching your verdict. This includes cell phones, and electronic media such as text messages, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, email, etc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Several jurors disregarded these admonitions. After the jury announced its verdict, Christensen moved for a new trial. He asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   During deliberations, the jury was exposed to and influenced by extraneous social media information which was considered by the jurors during the deliberative process. This act exceeded the tolerable bounds of jury deliberation and appeared calculated to, and with reasonable probability did, influence the jury's verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Christensen claimed his \"rights under the constitutions of the United States and the State of Iowa to a fair trial and due process of law were violated for all the reasons urged above.\" Christensen simultaneously moved to poll the jury. The district court granted the motion to poll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following a hearing, the court denied the new trial motion. The court began by conceding the jury received unauthorized information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The testimony from the majority of jurors during the post-trial hearing confirms they were made aware of extraneous information concerning the possibility of a riot or some other sort of public disturbance or violence occurring if the jury did not find Christensen guilty of something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Turning to whether the information was prejudicial, the court stated, \"[S]uch information, if actually considered by the jury during their deliberations, would certainly be prejudicial.\" But, in the court's view,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   While there [was] some testimony suggesting that the extraneous information about the possibility of a public disturbance, a riot, or public violence was brought to light prior to them reaching their verdict, the greater preponderance of the evidence establishes that it was not until after the jury had reached their verdict that such evidence was discussed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court concluded, \"[T]he jury could not have exceeded the tolerable bounds of their deliberations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, Christensen argues, \"There can be no doubt that the exposure of one or more jurors to Facebook postings or conversations with family members about the possibility of a riot or danger to the jurors in the event Christensen was not found guilty of murder constitutes misconduct.\" He asserts the misconduct \"was calculated to, and with reasonable probability did, influence the verdict.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal, the court acknowledged constitutional claims trigger de novo review, but concluded the defendant waived the constitutional claim and review was for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867222\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 231 n.4, 232. Given the posture of the case and the court's \"general[ ] agree[ment] with the fact-finding of the district court,\" the court declined to decide \"the proper standard of review regarding fact-finding by the district court in the context of a motion for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867222\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 231 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We are faced with the same procedural posture. The district court denied the misconduct/bias ground for a new trial under Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.24(2)(b)(2) (2015). The court also cited rule 2.24(2)(b)(9), permitting a court to grant a new trial if the defendant has not received a fair and impartial trial, but did not address the constitutional claim of juror misconduct. Accordingly, our review of the district court's ultimate conclusion on Christensen's new trial motion is for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That said, we are faced with the question the\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   court was able to avoid-the standard of review of district court fact-findings-because, unlike the court in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   , we disagree with the district court's key fact-findings supporting the ruling. The rule-based claim of juror misconduct is grounded in the constitution and, specifically, a defendant's right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Iowa Rs. Crim.

We turn to the record on juror misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Pre-Deliberaton Facebook Contact.\n   </em>\n   Before deliberations began, a juror reported she logged onto Facebook during a lunchbreak and noticed Christensen's relative was listed on her profile as one of several top friends. She advised the court she met the relative on a \"girls' weekend trip\" three years earlier and they became Facebook friends. She denied routine contact with the relative and denied having any conversation with her about the case. She stated the contact would not prevent her from being a fair and impartial juror in the case. The district court decided to keep the juror on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The juror did not receive extraneous information. But the contact highlighted jurors' blatant disregard of the district court's unambiguous admonition to refrain from the use of social media during the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867222\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/223/\">\n    865 N.W.2d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (disapproving of a juror's click of the \"like\" button on a comment by the victim's stepmother).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Post-Deliberation Extraneous Information\n   </em>\n   . Several jurors reported gaining access to extraneous information after they began deliberating. This information is the crux of the misconduct claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   One juror was asked,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [B]efore you and the other jurors reached your verdict and announced it in the courtroom, did you hear or see any comments from news media, from social media, from comments in the community, among friends, people that you know that there might be some sort of public disturbance or riot or public violence if a certain verdict wasn't reached in Mr. Christensen's case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The juror responded, \"I didn't see it, but I did hear in the jury room that some people had seen it on Facebook.\" He described the people as \"two female jurors.\" When asked if \"the other jurors\" said \"specifically what they heard or saw,\" he said, \"I think what specifically came up is that there were some threats against the jury depending on what-whatever decision was made.\" The women \"just said that there are people threatening the jury.\" Although this juror could not say the threats were \"dependent on what specific decision was made by the jury,\" he stated the threats \"had an impact on ... the jury feeling safe\" and \"upon reaching a verdict, there was a decision made to ask for a police presence as we walked to our cars to make sure we were safe.\" While, in his view, the discussion \"wasn't part of our proceedings at all ... as far as the decision we reached,\" he admitted the discussion took place \"prior to\" the announcement of the decision in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A second juror, asked the same question by defense counsel, began by stating she did not learn of extraneous comments about a riot or public disturbance or violence if a certain verdict was not reached until \"after the decision was made\" and they \"were escorted out.\" However, on further questioning, she said the information was mentioned \"a few days\" before the jurors came into the courtroom to announce their verdict, \"[d]uring the time [they] were in the jury room.\" She agreed the information referenced in the question \"was mentioned to all of us\" and the person who mentioned it \"had been told that it was all over Facebook.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A third juror stated, \"I did hear someone say something about that, but I don't know who.\" She did not recall the time line. Later, she explained, \"I think someone just said that they heard that if we didn't vote for first degree murder that there was going to be-people were going to be mad or be outside the courthouse, something to that effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A fourth juror seconded the third juror's comments. When asked what she recalled being brought up in the jury room, she said, \"Just that someone had told them that if it wasn't first degree that there would be a riot.\" She stated the comment was made after the jury reached a verdict but before it was announced in the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A fifth juror said a person was told there was something on Facebook, but she heard the comment after the verdict was announced and after they returned to the jury room, but before they left the courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A sixth juror said there was a concern for the safety of jurors, but he did not remember \"if it was after the verdict or before.\" He said \"most people raised their hands\" when asked if they were worried about their safety. He attributed the concern to the \"highly charged,\" \"emotional pressure\" in the jury room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A seventh juror agreed she heard other jurors in the jury room say they heard or saw something about possible violence based on what the verdict might be. She said, \"There was just a comment made that there might be, like a possible riot at the courthouse.\" She said the comment was made before they came in to announce the verdict. She stated one juror made the comment and it was based on a call she received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   An eighth juror described a \"very emotional\" juror who heard there would possibly be a riot. The juror said the comment was made after the verdict was announced in open court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, eight of the twelve jurors said they received extraneous information relating to the outcome of the case in the jury room, after they began deliberating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A ninth juror said she heard \"there had been talk about a riot if [Christensen] wasn't found guilty.\" She said she heard it out in the public somewhere while the trial was still going on but did not recall that it was discussed in the jury room. The juror appeared to have heard the information outside the jury room. In\n   <em>\n    Webster,\n   </em>\n   the court found a juror \"confronted with brief conclusory statements by third parties,\" who \"did not engage in an extended conversation on the merits of the case,\" did not commit misconduct.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867222\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/223/\">\n    865 N.W.2d at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the verdict had to be unanimous and the jurors could have changed their minds in open court, we conclude the misconduct was calculated to and with reasonable probability did influence the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, we have considered the State's argument that there was no prejudice because \"the defense theory was that it was second-degree murder, not a premeditated murder\" and the defense theory succeeded. To the contrary, the defense did not ask for a finding of guilt on the charge of second-degree murder. The defense pointed out the four options facing the jury-first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter-and asserted, \"[A]t best the evidence establishes that [Christensen] committed the crime of voluntary manslaughter.\" Christensen's attorney specifically moved for judgment of acquittal on first- and second-degree murder. And in closing argument, he advocated for a finding of guilt on voluntary manslaughter. In short, the defense did not get what it asked for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ceretti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6838770\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/871/88/#p93\">\n    871 N.W.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93-94 (Iowa 2015) (distinguishing mental states for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter and stating, \"Because a person could commit voluntary manslaughter under circumstances which would otherwise be second-degree murder, specific intent to kill is not an essential element of voluntary manslaughter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nor are we persuaded by the State's contention that the strength of the State's case warrants a finding of no prejudice. The State cited Christensen's admission \"to both of his parents and his ex-girlfriend that he harmed the victim,\" \"[t]he gun and ammunition ... discovered in [his] home,\" \"[a] bloodstain on [his] blue jeans and ... on boots\" at his home, a text from the victim to his ex-girlfriend \"that he gave [Christensen] a ride home on the day of his murder,\" and \"the evidence ... that the victim was killed during a narrow window consistent with when he was with the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Christensen's attorney conceded most of these facts. He spent little time on whether Christensen shot the young man and whether the man died as a result-both elements of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter. Instead, he attacked the State's evidence on Christensen's mental state-whether he \"acted willfully, deliberately, premeditatedly, and with a specific intent to kill\" the young man, as required for a finding of guilt on first-degree murder, and whether he acted with malice aforethought, as required for a finding of guilt on first-degree and second-degree murder. And he elicited evidence supporting the mental state for voluntary manslaughter-\"The shooting was done solely by reason of sudden, violent and irresistible passion resulting from serious provocation.\" He told the jury he would not insult their intelligence by seeking a verdict of \"not guilty\" and insisted the crime was one of passion. The State's essentially undisputed shooting evidence was not the sticking point; Christensen's mental state was. The extraneous information with reasonable probability could have influenced which mental state the jurors adopted and, hence, which verdict they reached, irrespective of the strength of the remaining evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by the State's reliance on juror testimony minimizing the effect of the extraneous information. As the court stated in\n   <em>\n    Cullen\n   </em>\n   , \"statements by jurors, subsequent to deliberations, as to whether they were influenced by certain matters or to what degree they were influenced, are incompetent for the purpose of impeaching a verdict and must be ignored.\" 357 N.W.2d at 29. \"To justify a new trial for jury misconduct it must appear (independently of what jurors might later say) the misconduct was calculated to, and probably did, influence the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This standard was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Notably, the Iowa Supreme Court adopted the \"reasonable probability that the misconduct influenced the verdict\" test to prevent de minimus extraneous information from upending jury verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10596478\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/476/28/#p35\">\n    476 N.W.2d at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiffs urge us to retreat from this standard and adopt, instead, a rule whereby prejudice is presumed to result from the introduction of extraneous material.

While the defendant presents this case as raising new issues regarding juror exposure to social media, this case merely presents the intersection of two long-resolved issues in the administration of the criminal jury trial. The first issue is whether the defendant's right to receive a fair trial was compromised by trying a high-profile case in a smaller community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3 William Blackstone,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries\n   </em>\n   , *349, *383 (\"A jury coming from the neighborhood is in some respects a great advantage; but is often liable to strong objections: especially in small jurisdictions ... or where the question in dispute has an extensive local tendency; where a cry has been raised and the passions of the multitude been inflamed.\"). The second issue is whether the defendant's right to receive a fair trial was compromised by the injection of information into the trial process due to technological advances in the dissemination of information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irvin v.

To protect the defendant's right to trial by a fair and impartial jury, we have in place an elaborate pretrial process to select and empanel a fair and impartial jury.

P. 2.18(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The record reflects the parties successfully availed themselves of these pretrial procedures to select a fair and impartial jury. The district court and the lawyers were keenly aware selecting a jury would be more difficult in this case than in the average case due to the visibility of the case in the community. At the beginning of jury selection, the district court stated, \"This case, as I understand it, has gotten a fair amount of media attention. I'm from Estherville. I know this is a small community, people talk. So I just want to ask all of you at this point in time how many of you have heard about this case or have knowledge of this case, raise your right hand. That's a pretty good group. Please put them down.\" With this understanding, the district court and the lawyers conscientiously and diligently conducted voir dire of the prospective jurors over several days. A fair reading of the transcript shows the district court liberally granted the defendant's for-cause challenge to any prospective juror who expressed an inability or even reluctance to judge the case solely on the evidence presented at trial. A fair reading of the transcript also shows the jurors selected to serve, as a whole, were engaged in the process, candid in their responses to the lawyer's respective questions, and committed to rendering a verdict solely on the evidence and argument presented during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Despite the pretrial procedures designed to select and empanel a fair and impartial jury, there are nonetheless circumstances that might later arise that might call into question whether the jury was in fact fair and impartial. One such circumstance is juror misconduct. \"Juror misconduct ordinarily relates to actions of a juror, often contrary to the court's instructions or admonitions, which impair the integrity of the fact-finding process at trial. Typical acts of misconduct include communication with others outside the jury about the case, independently investigating the crime or accident scenes outside of judicial oversight, or engaging in independent research about questions of law or fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867222\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/865/223/\">\n    865 N.W.2d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (Iowa 2015). A related, perhaps overlapping, circumstance is jury intrusion. Jury intrusion occurs when extraneous information makes it way to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in ruling on motions for new trial arising out of claims of jury misconduct or jury intrusion. District courts regularly preside over trials and have better developed the skills necessary to evaluate the facts and circumstances of the particular case with respect to the conduct of the trial. The district court judge is a member of the local community and has his finger on the pulse of the community of which the jury is merely a microcosm. The district court also has the advantage of percipience. \"We, as an appellate tribunal, are in a poor position to evaluate these competing considerations; we have only an insentient record before us.

The defendant failed to prove the alleged intrusions were calculated to influence the jury's verdict. \"Calculated\" means to plan or contrive to accomplish a purpose.\n   <em>\n    See Calculated\n   </em>\n   , Merriam Webster Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calculated (last visited Apr. 10, 2018). \"Calculated\" connotes agency, viz., there is an actor who targeted the jury for the purpose of influencing the jury's verdict. In this case, there is no record of any actor seeking to influence the jury's verdict. Instead, the only evidence here is a Facebook post from an unknown person. During the hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial, no juror identified any actor allegedly attempting to influence the jury's verdict. The majority opinion does not identify the actor \"calculating\" to influence this jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The defendant also failed to establish a reasonable probability the alleged intrusions did, in fact, influence the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riessen v.

App. Oct. 12, 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, the content of the information is not of the type that would have influenced the jury's verdict. At issue in this case are vague allegations of possible disturbances in the community. In the record, there is a Facebook post from an unknown poster. The unknown poster stated \"she was told\" by unknown persons of unsubstantiated \"rumors\" of a \"possible riot.\" Although the majority tries to characterize these statements as a direct threat against the jury to reach a particular verdict, there is no specific, readily identifiable, credible threat against the jury depending on its verdict. One juror stated the rumors were \"ridiculous.\" Another juror testified the issue was raised and readily dismissed. When asked for detail about what was heard, one juror captured the zeitgeist. The juror stated the alleged disturbance was not \"dependent on what specific decision was made by the jury, just that there were people on both sides of the issue about whatever the decision would be made.\" In other words, at worst, the Facebook post and other unsubstantiated rumors of possible disturbances in the community-started and spread by unknown persons-merely confirmed what the community, district court, lawyers, and jurors already knew. In a small community where, as the prosecutor said, \"everybody knows everybody,\" the community was tense and divided, and any verdict would be subject to criticism from someone in the community. The unsubstantiated rumors discussed in the post-trial hearing were unlikely to influence any juror under the circumstances presented. A determination of juror misconduct must be based on objective facts, and not mere speculation, conjecture, or rumor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, from the beginning of voir dire and throughout the course of trial, the district court repeatedly guided and admonished the jury it had to be fair and impartial and decide the case based on the evidence and argument at trial. On the first day of voir dire, before the jury was selected, the judge told the jury, \"Now that you know what this case name is, please do not talk to anybody about the case. Don't do any research about the case. Don't do anything to gain information about this case. Our goal here is to end up with a jury, number one, and be sure that jury is fair and impartial.\" The district court repeatedly warned the jurors that media reports do not contain accurate information. Review of the voir dire transcript shows the jurors committed to deciding the case based on the evidence and not extraneous information about the case. The jury was instructed the defendant was presumed innocent and not guilty, the State had the burden to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the determination of guilt or innocence must be based on \"the evidence and the law\" in the instructions. Instruction 13 provided the jury \"shall base [its] verdict only upon the evidence and these instructions.\" Instruction 13 further provided \"[a]nything you saw or heard about this case outside the courtroom\" was \"not evidence.\" Instruction 15 provided the jury was to \"[d]ecide the facts from the evidence.\" Instruction 37 provided each juror must decide the case for his or her self but only \"after an impartial consideration of the evidence with the other jurors.\" Finally, instruction 38 provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   You may not communicate about this case before reaching your verdict. This includes cell phones, and electronic media such as text messages, Facebook, MySpace, Linkedln, YouTube, Twitter, email, etc. Do not do any research or make any investigation about this case on your own. Do not visit or view any place discussed in this case, and do not use Internet maps or Google Earth or any other program or device to search for or to view any place discussed in the testimony. Also, do not research any information about this case, the law, or the people involved, including the parties, the witnesses, the lawyers, or the judge. This includes using the Internet to research events or people referenced in the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   This case will be tried on evidence presented in the courtroom. If you conduct independent research, you will be relying on matters not presented in court. The parties have a right to have this case decided on the evidence they know about and that has been introduced here in court. If you do some research or investigation or experiment that we do not know about, then your verdict may be influenced by inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information that has not been tested by the trial process, including the oath to tell the truth and by cross-examination. All of the parties are entitled to a fair trial, rendered by an impartial jury, and you must conduct yourself so as to maintain the integrity of the trial process. If you decide a case based on information not presented in court, you will have denied the parties a fair trial in accordance with the rules of this state and you will have done an injustice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The facts and circumstances of this case are not the extreme case in which we can infer the jury disregarded the district court's instructions to decide the case on the evidence presented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We may presume the jurors followed the court's admonition.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Third, and most important, we need not speculate on whether the alleged intrusions did, with reasonably probability, influence the jury's verdict. In this case, approximately three months after the jury returned its verdict, the district court held a hearing on the defendant's motion for new trial. Given the length of time between the trial and the post-trial hearing, there was some unsurprising inconsistency in the juror's respective testimony regarding who heard what and when. However, each of the jurors was specifically questioned regarding whether he or she had been exposed to or heard information regarding a potential riot\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the jury reaching its verdict. Each juror answered the question in the negative. While the majority is correct that the verdict is not final until announced in open court, that legal proposition does not change the factual finding that these particular jurors testified they were unaware of the information until after the jury had already decided the case. While there may be some remote possibility a juror could have changed his or her verdict between the time of decision and the time the verdict was announced in open court, this remote possibility does not rise to the level of reasonably probability our case law requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riessen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10662005\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/425/665/#p669\">\n    425 N.W.2d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating the reasonable probability requirement is not easy to satisfy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   If the facts and circumstances of this case-unsubstantiated rumors of possible disturbances directed at no one in particular posted on Facebook-were enough to establish an entitlement to new trial, no murder case could be tried in any community, let alone a smaller community. This is particularly true in an era where information is available on the Internet, on television, on radio, and in the newspaper; where people rapidly exchange information via email, text message, direct message, and public messaging platforms; where smart phones push local news and information to the user; where members of the community are more connected via social media platforms; and where the social media platforms also push information to the user. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   , I noted in dissent the defendant failed to prove the denial of a right to fair trial due, in part, to the extensive interconnectedness of persons in smaller communities:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The nature of the relationship between the juror and the victim's family, in and of itself, is not grounds for finding bias. The relationship is not of the type from which bias is necessarily inferred and that would support a challenge for cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Iowa R.Crim. P. 2.18(5). In fact, the relationship was attenuated-the juror's daughter was high school friends with the victim's half-sister or stepsister. The victim's mother was included in the juror's Facebook social network, but that fact alone does not indicate a meaningful relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sluss v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=381%20S.W.%20215\">\n    381 S.W. 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222 (Ky.2012) (noting on Facebook \"a person can become 'friends' with people to whom the person has no actual connection\");\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   n.8 (noting the performer Lady Gaga had millions of Facebook \"friends\"). Also, the inference of bias that could be drawn from the relationship between the juror and the victim's family, if any, is mitigated by the fact the juror also had a relationship to the defendant's family-the juror's parents were good friends of the defendant's wife's family. The juror was also Facebook friends with one of Webster's wife's relatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   State v. Webster, No. 13-1095,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205861967\">\n    2014 WL 5861967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (Iowa Ct.

The fact that an unsubstantiated rumor was spread on a social media platform does not change the analysis. The defendant's claim is old wine in a new bottle. Our courts have long-settled rules and principles governing jury misconduct and intrusion of any type. Long ago, the Iowa Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   In fact, it must be apparent that to follow the narrow rule of the Caine case would be to vitiate verdicts in almost all cases in which the jury is not strictly segregated. The citizens of Iowa are highly literate; they are interested in world affairs, and in the news of their state and of their communities. They follow events closely; and the fact of their selection as members of a jury does not automatically eliminate their desire to keep up with the times. When they are permitted to disperse at adjournments of the trial, it is inconceivable that they will not read newspapers and listen to telecasts and broadcasts. No matter how conscientiously they may try to avoid reading or listening to accounts of the trial in progress, and especially when the case is one which has aroused considerable interest, they will be faced with headlines or will advertently hear some comment from a newscaster concerning the matter before them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   But each juror has taken an oath which requires him to try the case solely upon the evidence submitted, guided by the court's instructions. We think a rule which assumes as a matter of law that the mere reading or listening to newspaper or television or radio broadcasts of accounts of the trial is prejudicial misconduct of the jury goes too far, and we decline to follow it. Insofar as State v. Caine and State v. Peirce, announce such a rule they are overruled. We hold the true rule to be that reading or listening to reports of or comments on a trial in progress, by the jurors, or some of them, is not necessarily prejudicial error. Something must appear which leads to the conclusion that the jury was unfairly influenced by these extraneous matters; and in determining this, the trial court has a considerable, although not always final, discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    State v. McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4445532\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/iowa/250/435/#p309\">\n    94 N.W.2d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309-10 (Iowa 1959). In the same vein, the United States Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [D]ue process does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation. Were that the rule, few trials would be constitutionally acceptable. The safeguards of juror impartiality, such as voir dire and protective instructions from the trial judge, are not infallible; it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote. Due process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304618\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/209/#p224\">\n    455 U.S. at 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
