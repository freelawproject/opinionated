R. Prof. Conduct 5.1(b) ; and failing to safeguard client funds by failing to transfer credit card payments into her trust account and negligently misappropriating client funds, resulting in trust account shortages, in violation of Minn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(a) and 1.15(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Respondent and the Director have entered into a stipulation for discipline. In it, respondent waives her procedural rights under Rule 14, Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility (RLPR), and unconditionally admits the allegations of the petition.

Respondent shall no longer employ the bookkeeping services of Edward Rooney in connection with respondent's law practice. Respondent shall inform the Director, within 30 days of hiring, of the name of the current bookkeeper. Respondent shall keep the Director apprised of any staffing changes with respect to bookkeeping duties within 30 days of any such change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   /s/ ______________________________\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   David L.
