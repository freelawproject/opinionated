Thompson, Respondent.\n </docketnumber>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-3\">\n  No. 2017AP2473-D\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-4\">\n  Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-5\">\n  Opinion Filed: October 16, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <disposition id=\"p-6\">\n  ATTORNEY disciplinary proceeding.\n  <em>\n   Attorney's license suspended.\n  </em>\n </disposition>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   PER CURIAM.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 1 We review the report and recommendation of Referee James W. Mohr, Jr., concluding that Attorney Ryan P. Thompson committed 16 counts of professional misconduct and recommending the court suspend his law license for 15 months, order him to pay restitution to one client, A.K., and impose the costs of this proceeding on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Upon careful review of this matter, we uphold the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law and agree that a 15-month suspension is an appropriate sanction for Attorney Thompson's misconduct. We further agree that Attorney Thompson should pay restitution to A.K. in the amount of $1,000. We also find it appropriate to impose the full costs of this proceeding on Attorney Thompson, which are $7,370.73 as of August 24, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Attorney Thompson was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 2006. He has not previously been professionally disciplined but his law license was suspended on May 6, 2016, for willful failure to cooperate with an Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) investigation into the misconduct giving rise to this matter. It remains suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 On December 20, 2017, the OLR filed a disciplinary complaint alleging 16 counts of misconduct. Attorney Thompson filed an answer in which he admitted many of the factual allegations. Referee Mohr conducted a hearing on July 10, 2018. Attorney\n   Thompson appeared, but elected not to attend the hearing. Before the hearing commenced, however, Attorney Thompson and the OLR advised the referee that they would stipulate to the discipline recommended in the OLR complaint, except for requested restitution for C.W., which Attorney Thompson had paid. The parties stipulated that the restitution claim on behalf of A.K. could abide by the proof in the record. The parties additionally contemplated that restitution could be made as a condition of reinstatement. The OLR called two witnesses. The parties waived the opportunity for post-hearing briefing and the referee issued his report on August 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 No appeal has been filed so we consider this matter under SCR 22.17(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The facts set forth in this decision are based on the referee's factual findings which have not been shown to be clearly erroneous in any respect. The findings derive, in turn, from the OLR's complaint, Attorney Thompson's answer, the facts to which the parties stipulated before the evidentiary\n   hearing, and evidence from the hearing itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of A.K. (Counts 1 &amp; 2)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2014, A.K. retained Attorney Thompson and paid him a $1,000 retainer. Shortly thereafter, she elected not to pursue her legal claim. Since January 2015, A.K. has repeatedly asked Attorney Thompson to refund the unearned portion of her advanced fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Attorney Thompson failed to provide A.K. with an invoice, a written notice of intent to remove her funds from trust, an accounting, to return any unearned portion of her advanced fees, or to provide an explanation as to why he did not owe her a refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 In September 2015, A.K. filed a grievance against Attorney Thompson with the OLR. Attorney Thompson failed to respond and, ultimately, on May 6, 2016, this court issued an order suspending Attorney Thompson's license to practice law due to his willful failure to cooperate with the OLR's investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, based on Attorney Thompson's own admission, by failing to refund the unearned portion of A.K.'s fees or, in the alternative, to timely explain to A.K. why she was not due a refund, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 20:1.16(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by failing to file a written response to OLR's November 17, 2015 letter, Attorney Thompson willfully violated SCRs 22.03(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of C.W. (Counts 3-8)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 In November 2014, C.W. hired Attorney Thompson to represent her in an employment matter. She signed a legal services agreement and paid Attorney Thompson a $2,500 advance fee. Attorney Thompson told C.W. he would file a claim alleging a violation of the Wisconsin Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and a disability discrimination claim on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 On December 12, 2014, Attorney Thompson duly filed C.W.'s state FMLA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   complaint with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce and Development. On February 18, 2015, the complaint was denied. Attorney Thompson did not appeal and, in March 2015, the case was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 After her state FMLA claim was denied, Attorney Thompson told C.W. that he would file a federal disability discrimination and federal FMLA claim on her behalf. He failed to file any other claims on C.W.'s behalf within the statutory period allowed to pursue those claims and he did not inform C.W. he would not file any additional claims on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Subsequently, C.W. made numerous telephone calls to Attorney Thompson and sent him emails and text messages requesting information regarding the status of her case. Attorney Thompson failed to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 On May 6, 2016, this court suspended Attorney Thompson's law license based on his failure to cooperate with the A.K. investigation. Attorney Thompson did not advise C.W. of his suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 On July 22, 2016, C.W. terminated Attorney Thompson's representation of her and requested a copy of her file, an accounting, and a refund of unearned fees. Attorney Thompson failed to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 C.W. hired another attorney who contacted Attorney Thompson on September 7, 2016, requesting a copy of C.W.'s file and a refund of her advanced fee. Attorney Thompson failed to respond. C.W. eventually filed a grievance with the OLR. Attorney Thompson failed to respond to the OLR inquiries as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 At some point thereafter, Attorney Thompson apparently provided C.W. with a refund. The parties agree that no restitution is warranted in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 The complaint alleged and the record supports the conclusion that, after dismissal of C.W.'s Wisconsin FMLA claim, by failing to file any other\n   claims on C.W.'s behalf, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 20:1.3 (Count 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that by failing to communicate with C.W. about the status of her claims, and failing to respond to C.W.'s reasonable requests for information, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 20:1.4(a)(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that by failing to provide C.W. with a written accounting following her request for one, Attorney Thompson violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(2) and current SCR 20:1.15(e)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that by failing to refund the unearned portion of C.W.'s fee or, alternatively, to timely explain why she was not due a refund; by failing to provide C.W. or her counsel with the contents of her file; and by failing to notify C.W. that he was closing his private practice, Attorney Thompson in each instance violated SCR 20:1.16(d) (Count 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 22 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that by failing to notify C.W. of the May 6, 2016 suspension of his license to practice law and that she should seek legal advice from another attorney, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 22.26(1)(a) and (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(f)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that by failing to file a written response to the OLR's November 23, 2016 letter, Attorney Thompson\n   willfully violated SCR 22.03(2) and (6), enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h) (Count 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of L.R.\n   </em>\n   (Counts 9-11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 24 In June 2015 L.R. hired Attorney Thompson to defend him in a civil matter. L.R. signed a retainer agreement and paid Attorney Thompson a $2,500 advance fee. On May 6, 2016, this court suspended Attorney Thompson's law license so Attorney Thompson was unable to proceed with L.R.'s matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 25 Between June 3, 2016 and October 31, 2016, L.R. spoke with and wrote Attorney Thompson several times requesting an accounting and refund of the unearned portion of his $2,500 advance fee. Attorney Thompson failed to provide L.R. with an invoice, an accounting, or refund of any unearned fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 26 On November 15, 2016, L.R. filed a grievance with the OLR seeking a refund of at least $1,750. In an email dated December 14, 2016, Attorney Thompson acknowledged to the OLR that he owed L.R. both an accounting and a refund. In an email to L.R. dated February 23, 2017, Attorney Thompson stated he owed L.R. a refund of $1,000 but failed to provide L.R. with an invoice or a refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 27 On May 17, 2017, L.R. filed a request for arbitration of his fee dispute with the State Bar of Wisconsin. On July 21, 2017, pursuant to a mediation agreement, L.R. received a $1,000 refund from Attorney Thompson. Attorney Thompson never provided L.R. with a written invoice, a billing statement, or an accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by failing to provide L.R. with a written accounting upon his request, Attorney Thompson\n   violated former SCR 20:1.15(d)(2) and current SCR 20:1.15(e)(2) (Count 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 29 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by failing, upon termination of the representation, to properly\n   refund the unearned portion of L.R.'s fees or, in the alternative, to timely explain why he was not due a refund, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 20:1.16(d) (Count 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 30 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by willfully failing to file a written response to the OLR's December 23, 2016 letter, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 22.03(2) and (6), enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h) (Count 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Practicing after Suspension\n   </em>\n   (Counts 12-16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 31 When Attorney Thompson was suspended by this court on May 6, 2016, he was employed as an in-house attorney for Heartland Business Systems LLC (Heartland). He continued to work for them after the suspension, holding himself out-both to Heartland and to others-as an attorney licensed to practice law in Wisconsin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 32 Attorney Thompson later admitted to the OLR that he had been practicing law between May 2016 and at least November 2016 and retained the title of General Counsel. Attorney Thompson made numerous misrepresentations to the OLR when discussing his suspension, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 That he told the President and Vice President of Heartland's parent company that his license had been suspended;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 That when he informed Heartland of his suspension, they restricted his signing authority and caused Heartland to begin looking for another attorney;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 That the Vice President took over the handling of all contract matters until another attorney was hired;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 That the Vice President began to supervise a legal assistant for all law-related work;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 That Attorney Thompson did not supervise the new attorney's legal work;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 That after Attorney Thompson informed Heartland of his suspension, he stopped practicing law on behalf of Heartland; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 That Attorney Thompson changed his title from General Counsel to Chief Operating Officer, Compliance Leader and Privacy Officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 33 The referee found that, in fact, Heartland had no knowledge of Attorney Thompson's suspension until April 27, 2017 and during that time, he was still providing what the company would consider legal services and legal advice. The referee further found that had Heartland known of his May 2016 suspension, Attorney Thompson would have been terminated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 34 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that by practicing law in Wisconsin at a time when his license to practice law was suspended, Attorney Thompson violated SCRs 22.26(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   and 23.02(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(f) (Count 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by using the title General Counsel and otherwise holding himself out as a licensed attorney while employed in Wisconsin at a time when his license to practice law in Wisconsin was suspended, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 23.02(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforced via SCR 20:8.4(f) (Count 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 36 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by engaging in a dishonest and deceitful course of conduct related to the status of his license to practice law and his ability to act as legal counsel for\n   Heartland, which included material misrepresentations and omissions in his interactions with Heartland, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 20:8.4(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Count 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 37 The complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by failing to file a written response to the OLR's March 23, 2017 letter until September 18, 2017, Attorney Thompson willfully violated SCR 22.03(2) and (6), enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h) (Count 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 38 Finally, the complaint alleged and the referee concluded that, by making misrepresentations to the OLR during the course of its investigations, Attorney Thompson violated SCR 22.03(6), enforced via SCR 20:8.4(h) (Count 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 39 With respect to the appropriate discipline, the parties stipulated before the evidentiary hearing that a one-year suspension of Attorney Thompson's license to practice law was appropriate, together with restitution to A.K. as a condition of any future reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 40 The referee was troubled by Attorney Thompson's misconduct, particularly his blatant disregard of a supreme court order and his misrepresentations to the OLR. In reaching an independent recommendation regarding discipline, the referee deemed instructive\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Rostollan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555650\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/911/112/\">\n    2018 WI 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555650\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/911/112/\">\n    381 Wis. 2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12555650\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/911/112/\">\n    911 N.W.2d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Attorney Rostollan, who had no prior disciplinary history, was suspended for failure to cooperate in an OLR investigation. He was then suspended for two\n   years for failing to properly document advance fees; making misrepresentations to a federal bankruptcy court; failure to hold fees in trust; failure to cooperate with an OLR investigation; failure to keep a client properly informed; and practicing after suspension. The referee acknowledged that Attorney Rostollan's conduct was more egregious than that of Attorney Thompson, but noted, correctly, that many of the same elements are present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 41 The referee was also informed by\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Ruppelt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279773\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/377/441/\">\n    2017 WI 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279773\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/377/441/\">\n    377 Wis. 2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=898%20N.W.2d%20473\">\n    898 N.W.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   where the attorney stipulated to 16 counts of misconduct and a one-year suspension for failure to hold client money in trust; dishonest billing practices; dishonesty toward the OLR in its investigation; failure to properly communicate with a client; and false statements to a tribunal. There, the referee opted to recommend a 15-month suspension, which this court imposed.
