After Mortenson performed field sobriety tests and failed a preliminary breath test (PBT), Officer Cederberg arrested Mortenson for driving while impaired. The officer read Mortenson a Minnesota Motor Vehicle Implied Consent Advisory, and Mortenson refused to submit to blood and urine tests. Mortenson's refusal was sent to the commissioner of public safety, and the commissioner revoked his license to drive under Minnesota's implied-consent law. Mortenson petitioned the district court for review of the license revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the ensuing implied-consent hearing, the district court received a transcript of the implied-consent advisory and the officer's supplemental report as exhibits, based on the parties' agreement. No witnesses testified at the hearing. According to the exhibits, after reading the implied-consent advisory, Officer Cederberg advised Mortenson that refusal to take a test to determine if he was under the influence of alcohol is a crime and that he had a right to consult with an attorney before making a decision whether to submit to testing. Mortenson left a message for one attorney and spoke to a different attorney. After 28 minutes, Officer Cederberg asked Mortenson if he would take a blood test,\n   and Mortenson eventually responded, \"No, sir.\" Officer Cederberg also asked Mortenson if he would take a urine test, and Mortenson responded, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In his memorandum in support of his petition to rescind the revocation of his license to drive, Mortenson argued that his license revocation should be rescinded because the state cannot constitutionally charge him with a crime for refusing warrantless blood and urine tests. The district court agreed and rescinded the revocation of Mortenson's license to drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This court issued an order opinion affirming the district court's rescission based on a different theory, reasoning that the implied-consent advisory misled Mortenson by inaccurately informing him that refusal to take a blood or urine test is a crime and that the advisory therefore violated Mortenson's right to due process under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell v.

The commissioner argues that Mortenson is not entitled to rescission of his license revocation because, like the driver in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , he refused to submit to blood and urine tests, so there is no concern that he prejudicially relied on the misleading statements in the implied-consent\n   advisory regarding the criminal consequences of refusal.

Specifically, McDonnell was advised that she \"had the right to speak with an attorney\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   submitting to a breath test,\" but \"she was not otherwise advised of her right to counsel either before or after being read the Implied Consent Advisory.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10614773\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/473/848/#p853\">\n    473 N.W.2d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The supreme court noted that under\n   <em>\n    Friedman v.

The supreme court therefore held that in advising McDonnell that she \"could not consult an attorney until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   submitting to a breath test,\" the\n   arresting officer \"affirmatively violated\" her right to counsel under the Minnesota Constitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10614120,10614487\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/473/828/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although Mortenson appears to assert a right-to-counsel claim under the Minnesota Constitution, his legal theory is unclear.
