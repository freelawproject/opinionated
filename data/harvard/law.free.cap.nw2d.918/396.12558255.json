During the hearing, Dakota Engineering/KLJ asserted that a clause in the contract between Domson and the Oglala Sioux Tribe insulated them from liability for negligence to\n   Domson. The circuit court agreed and separately granted Dakota Engineering and KLJ summary judgment. Domson appeals. We requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the enforceability of exculpatory clauses insulating a third party from claims of negligent design and negligent administration and interpretation of a contract. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62.] The Oglala Sioux Tribe hired Dakota Engineering/KLJ to design a road reconstruction project on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. On March 21, 2012, the Tribe advertised the project for bids. Prospective bidders could inspect the contract documents, including the drawings and project manual. It is unclear whether Dakota Engineering or KLJ prepared the bid documents, including the project manual, the proposal to bidders, plans, specifications, estimates, and amendments for the project. However, the record reveals that the manual and documents relevant to the request for bids were signed and sealed in March 2012 by Tonya Tordsen of KLJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63.] It is undisputed that Domson obtained the bid documents and submitted a bid on the project. The public bid opening revealed Domson as the apparent low bidder. KLJ informed Domson that Domson had been awarded the bid. On July 5, 2012, Domson and the Tribe executed a contract for the project. The contract between Domson and the Tribe designated Dakota Engineering/KLJ as the \"Engineer\" and the Tribe's representative. The contract provided that \"Engineer assumes all duties and responsibilities, and has the rights and authority assigned to Engineer in the Contract Documents in connection with the completion of the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.\" KLJ had the duty to administer the contract for the Tribe, including the processing of applications for payment by Domson. Change orders and payments needed approval from the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64.] It is undisputed that Domson did not substantially complete the project in the time required under the contract. KLJ, as the Tribe's representative, assessed Domson $103,950 in liquidated damages. In January 2015, Domson brought suit against Dakota Engineering and KLJ, alleging professional negligence. Domson asserted that \"Dakota Engineering/KLJ owed a duty to Domson to reasonably draft, interpret, and apply the project's contract documents.\" Domson alleged that \"Dakota Engineering/KLJ were negligent in their design, interpretation, and application of the plans and specifications[.]\" According to Domson, Dakota Engineering/KLJ's negligence in designing and administering the contract caused Domson approximately $1,138,027.28 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b65.] Dakota Engineering and KLJ filed a joint answer. Dakota Engineering denied that it was a proper defendant because Dakota Engineering's \"only involvement was initial design work[.]\" Dakota Engineering/ KLJ asserted that Domson's alleged damages arose out of its contract with the Tribe. Dakota Engineering and KLJ filed a joint motion for summary judgment. They again indicated that Dakota Engineering was only involved in the design work and did not administer the contract. Dakota Engineering/KLJ also highlighted Paragraph 9.09 of the standard general conditions contract document. That paragraph provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Neither Engineer's authority or responsibility under this Article 9 or under any other provision of the Contract Documents nor any decision made by Engineer\n   <em>\n    in good faith\n   </em>\n   either to exercise or not exercise such authority or responsibility or the undertaking, exercise, or performance of any authority or responsibility\n   by Engineer shall create, impose, or give rise to any duty in contract, tort, or otherwise owed by Engineer to Contractor, or any Subcontractor, any Supplier, any other individual or entity, or to any surety for or employee or agent of any of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b66.] Domson did not submit \"a separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to which\" it contended a genuine issue existed as required by SDCL 15-6-56(c)(2). Instead, it submitted a brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. But the brief did not \"respond to each numbered paragraph in the moving party's statement with a separately numbered response and appropriate citations to the record.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, Domson's brief grouped arguments together with general responses. Domson's brief also did not cite to the record. Nevertheless, in the brief, Domson referred the circuit court to\n   <em>\n    Mid-Western Electric, Inc. v. DeWild Grant Reckert &amp; Associates, Co.\n   </em>\n   , as authority for recognizing that Dakota Engineering/KLJ owed a duty to Domson to reasonably draft, interpret, and apply the project's contract documents.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10617202\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/500/250/\">\n    500 N.W.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. 1993). Domson asserted generally that issues of material fact existed on the question of breach of that duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67.] The circuit court issued a memorandum decision. The court granted summary judgment on all claims against Dakota Engineering. It concluded that Dakota Engineering was not an appropriate party in the lawsuit. The court also granted summary judgment on all claims against KLJ. Although Domson did not comply with SDCL 15-6-56(c)(2), the court gave Domson \"the benefit of the doubt with what [it had] submitted\" in response to the motion for summary judgment. After considering Domson's submissions, the court concluded that Domson offered mere general allegations and denials. The court also interpreted Paragraph 9.09 to insulate KLJ from liability to Domson for negligence, absent a claim by Domson that KLJ acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b68.] In response to the court's decision, Domson filed a motion and brief in support requesting the circuit court reconsider its decision granting summary judgment. It asserted that Paragraph 9.09 was unlawful under SDCL 53-9-3. Domson then filed a supplemental brief in support of its motion for reconsideration. It restated its position that because KLJ owed it a duty, a jury must determine whether KLJ breached that duty. The court denied Domson's motion to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b69.] Domson appeals and asserts the following issues, which we restate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Whether summary judgment was improper because defendants failed to plead Paragraph 9.09 as an affirmative defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Whether the circuit court erred when it granted summary judgment based on Paragraph 9.09 of the standard general conditions contract document.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Whether the circuit court erred when it granted summary judgment despite that defendants admitted they owed a duty to Domson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b610.] Under our well-settled standard of review on appeal from a grant of summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We must determine whether the moving party demonstrated the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and showed entitlement to judgment on the merits as a matter of law. The evidence must be viewed most favorably to the\n   nonmoving party and reasonable doubts should be resolved against the moving party. The nonmoving party, however, must present specific facts showing that a genuine, material issue for trial exists. Our task on appeal is to determine only whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the law was correctly applied. If there exists any basis which supports the ruling of the trial court, affirmance of a summary judgment is proper.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Brandt v.

Dakota Engineering and KLJ respond that they asserted Paragraph 9.09 as a defense in their answer by pleading the affirmative defenses of estoppel and waiver. They also claim that Domson failed to raise waiver before the circuit court. We agree that Domson waived the issue. Because Domson failed to assert this argument to the circuit court, we will not address it for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rush v. U.S. Bancorp Equip.

The circuit court recognized that under South Dakota law, an engineer can owe a duty to a contractor despite the lack of contractual privity between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mid-Western Elec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10617202\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/500/250/\">\n    500 N.W.2d at 253-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, here, the contract between the Tribe and Domson, via Paragraph 9.09, insulated Dakota Engineering/KLJ from liability for their good-faith acts and failures to act by the authority given to them under the contract and contract documents. Therefore, although a duty may exist under\n   <em>\n    Mid-Western Electric\n   </em>\n   , we must examine the effect of Paragraph 9.09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613.] Domson argues that \"the exculpatory clause should be construed as an indemnity provision that violates statute[,]\" citing SDCL 56-3-16, -17. But Domson did not assert this argument to the circuit court, and further, it exceeds the scope of this Court's inquiry on supplemental briefing. We, therefore, decline to address whether Paragraph 9.09 should be construed as an indemnity provision. For the same reason, we decline to examine Domson's claim that Paragraph 9.09 is unconscionable and its argument in its supplemental brief that the contract between the Tribe and Domson is a contract of adhesion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362901\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/742/266/\">\n    2007 S.D. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362901\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/742/266/\">\n    742 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   269 n.1 (The failure to assert an argument below waives it on appeal.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b614.] Nonetheless, Domson further claims that Paragraph 9.09 \"is against the policy of the law\" under SDCL 20-9-1, SDCL 53-9-3, and SDCL 53-9-1. It claims that SDCL 20-9-1 and SDCL 53-9-3 evince a public policy forbidding the enforcement of Paragraph 9.09. It also asserts that\n   <em>\n    Lyndon Property Insurance Co. v.

SDCL 20-9-1 provides: \"Every person is responsible for injury to the person, property, or rights of another caused by his willful acts or caused by his want of ordinary care or skill, subject in the latter cases to the defense of contributory negligence.\" Further, SDCL 53-9-3 provides that \"[a]ll contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud or willful injury to the person or property of another or from violation of law whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b616.] Although SDCL 20-9-1 mandates responsibility for injury caused by willful acts or want of ordinary care or skill, nothing in this statute prohibits one party from agreeing by contract to release a third party from liability for ordinary negligence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Moreover, although Domson claims Paragraph 9.09 is contrary to SDCL 53-9-3 because it purports to exempt Dakota Engineering/KLJ from a \"violation of law whether willful or negligent[,]\" we disagree. Domson's suit against Dakota Engineering and KLJ alleges professional negligence, not a willful or negligent violation of law.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holzer v.

Domson contends that\n   <em>\n    Lyndon\n   </em>\n   more aligns with South Dakota public policy as compared to the cases cited by Dakota Engineering and KLJ. In response, Dakota Engineering and KLJ claim that \"courts are in agreement that not only the very exculpatory clause at issue here is enforceable, but that exculpatory clauses in general are enforceable in cases such as the present, in which ordinary negligence is alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patriot Contracting, LLC v.

A county district had entered into a contract with a utilities contractor for construction of a sewer system. The county district also entered into a contract with an engineer. The engineer, prior to the completion of the project, terminated the utilities contractor. The contractor's surety funded the completion of the project but brought suit against the engineer asserting its right to recover in the shoes of the county district (not the contractor) under the doctrine of equitable subrogation. The engineer claimed that a clause in the contract between the county district and the contractor insulated the engineer from liability to anyone but the county district. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. It held that \"the District cannot bargain away the engineer's potential duty to a surety that would step into the District's\n   shoes under the doctrine of equitable subrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753625\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b619.] Here, however, Domson is not seeking to stand in the shoes of the Tribe in its suit against Dakota Engineering and KLJ.

Based on our review of the contract documents as a whole and in light of Domson's failure to identify a statutory provision or scheme or judicial decision from this Court to support its argument that Paragraph 9.09 is unlawful, we decline to declare Paragraph 9.09 void under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b621.] This is not to say that every exculpatory clause insulating a third party from liability for negligence will be enforceable. Nor does today's decision mean that we adopt the views expressed by the authorities cited by Dakota Engineering/KLJ in response to this Court's request for supplemental briefing. Rather, Paragraph 9.09 is valid and enforceable in this case because Domson has not identified that Paragraph 9.09 contravenes sound public policy in this State under these particular circumstances. The exculpatory language unambiguously informed Domson that Dakota Engineering/KLJ would be immune from suit in tort or contract arising out of Dakota Engineering/KLJ's good-faith acts and failures to act by the authority given to them under the contract and contract documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b622.] Although we hold that Paragraph 9.09 is valid and enforceable under the circumstances, Dakota Engineering and KLJ must still establish entitlement to the protections afforded by Paragraph 9.09. When the circuit court granted summary judgment, relying on Paragraph 9.09, it erroneously imposed the initial burden on Domson to establish bad faith on the part of the engineer.

In fact, although Kostaneski identified errors in the project documents, he never suggested that design problems violated any standard of care, let alone the standard of care for architects and engineers. Moreover, he unequivocally indicated that problems in the design phase were normal and should have been worked out during the contract administration.

Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073406\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/817/395/\">\n    2012 S.D. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073406\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/817/395/\">\n    817 N.W.2d 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b640.] Here, the majority opinion focuses on a statement made by Domson's expert, Larry Kostaneski, that not all \"project documents are perfect, nor field conditions exactly as described in those documents\" for the proposition that Domson's expert \"never suggested that design problems violated any standard of care, let alone the standard of care for architects and engineers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. For the majority, this suggests that there is no genuine, material issue for trial because Domson failed to make a specific assertion that the project's design fell below the standard of care. However, that reasoning does not account for Kostaneski's opinion that there were problems with \"the package released for the public bid process\" which made it \"quickly apparent that several critical issues were going to have a significant impact on both the scope and schedule of the work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b641.] Specifically, Kostaneski explained that shortly after the project began, Dakota Engineering/KLJ informed Domson that a restriction existed with respect to commencing construction on a 3,000-foot area at the beginning of the project. Domson learned that, due to an impending artifact study, the area remained ineligible for development until completion of the survey. No mention of the study was included in the design plans, and even Dakota Engineering/KLJ's own expert, Dennis Micko, agreed that preliminary inspections, reports, and environmental artifact studies \"[n]ormally ... would have been completed in advance of [the bidding].\" Domson contends that this deficiency caused delay in completing the project, which resulted in accrual of additional damages under the contract's liquidated damages provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b642.] Additionally, Kostaneski noted problems with beginning construction at the other end of the project. The project's drafters had incorrectly identified an existing pipe on the plans, so the construction team decided to delete it. According to Kostaneski, this decision significantly impaired Domson's progress. Kostaneski described the effect on the project stating, \"Unfortunately, it also meant that this end of the project would not have the plan grade. Domson had already graded this area to the original plan elevations, which required a significant adjustment to return it to the field changed elevation. KLJ seemed disinclined to recognize this unanticipated effort and delay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b643.] \"Summary judgment ... was never intended to enable parties to evade jury trials or have the judge weigh evidence in advance of it[ ] being presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Pierce v.

Yet, by declaring that Domson's factual assertions are mere general allegations referring to contract administration and not design, the majority opinion's conclusion regarding negligent design of the project plans weighs the evidence presented. We must instead view the facts in light favorable to Domson and give it the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dakota Pork Indus. v. City of Huron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9409900\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/638/884/\">\n    2002 S.D. 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9409900\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/638/884/\">\n    638 N.W.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 885 (\"All reasonable inferences drawn from the facts must be viewed in favor of the non-moving party.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b644.] Domson presented a sufficient case for negligent design of the project plans to survive summary judgment. Project design was among the engineering services KLJ provided Domson,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Dakota Engineering/KLJ admitted that it owed Domson a duty. Domson's expert further opined that \"KLJ's engineering services on this project [were] below an acceptable standard found on civil engineering projects generally.\" This statement regarding the standard of care was broad enough to include the design errors Kostaneski identified in the project documents. Disputed issues of fact exist regarding whether: (1) the construction delay resulting from the incomplete artifact study increased Domson's damages on the contract; and (2) the error in the project's plans that misidentified a pipe created additional damages under the contract by requiring Domson to return the grade to the \"field changed elevation.\" Domson \"need only present evidence from which a jury might return a verdict in his favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.
