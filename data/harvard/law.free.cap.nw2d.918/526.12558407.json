On order of the Court, the applications are again considered. MCR 7.305(H)(1). In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we REVERSE the judgment of the Court of Appeals and we REINSTATE the defendant's conviction and sentence. Assuming, without deciding, that either the trial court or trial defense counsel was responsible for the failure of a witness to appear on the defendant's behalf, it was still incumbent upon the defendant, as the appellant, to establish at the evidentiary hearing that the witness would provide materially favorable testimony on retrial.
