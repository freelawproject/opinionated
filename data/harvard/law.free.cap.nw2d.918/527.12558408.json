Appellant must also submit a copy of this order with the payment and must refile the pleadings that are being returned with this order as acknowledgement of his responsibility to pay the balance of the filing fee. Failure to comply with this order shall result in the appeal being administratively dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   If plaintiff timely pays the partial fee and refiles the pleadings, monthly payments shall be made to the Department of Corrections in the amount of 50 percent of the deposits made to appellant's account until the payments equal the balance due of $253.00. That amount shall then be remitted to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pursuant to MCL 600.2963(8), appellant shall not file a new civil action or appeal with this Court until the entry fee in this case is paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Clerk of the Court shall furnish two copies of this order to appellant and return the appellant's pleadings with this order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
