Because we reject relator's constitutional challenges to section 237.045 and conclude that the statute applies to respondent-utility's crossing application, we affirm the commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2014, respondent Qwest Corporation d/b/a CenturyLink QC (CenturyLink) submitted an application to relator BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) to lay underground line that would run for 206 feet roughly parallel to BNSF's tracks in St. Louis Park (the proposed line). The proposed line would provide telecommunications services to a radio station, replacing an older line that had malfunctioned. In the interim, CenturyLink had installed a temporary, above-ground line to service the radio station, but that cable had been cut on several occasions, requiring emergency repairs. In response to CenturyLink's application, BNSF provided a proposed \"wire crossing agreement\" that included a \"license fee\" of $27,000. Thereafter, the parties unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a mutually agreeable fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2015, CenturyLink filed a request with the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MnDOC) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20237.04\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 237.04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) for a determination of the just and reasonable compensation it should pay BNSF for the proposed line. BNSF objected to the request, and MnDOC initiated contested-case proceedings in March 2016. Then, following the legislature's adoption of a new statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20237.045\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 237.045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , CenturyLink rescinded its request to MnDOC and moved to dismiss the contested-case proceedings. Over BNSF's objection, MnDOC adopted the recommendation of the administrative-law judge (ALJ) to grant the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2017, CenturyLink submitted a new application to BNSF under section 237.045. BNSF objected to the application, asserting that the new statute does not apply to the proposed line, that the statute is unconstitutional because it permits an uncompensated taking, and that the statute is preempted by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CenturyLink then filed a petition for resolution of the dispute with respondent Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC). Following a public-comment period, the MPUC issued an order concluding that section 237.045 applies to the proposed line and declining to address BNSF's constitutional issues. BNSF sought reconsideration, which the MPUC denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   BNSF appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

A condemnation is a peculiar type of regulation, one specifically limited in scope to the ownership or use of one particular piece of property. When considering a standard regulation-which is normally a rule of general applicability-using [STB]'s framework for both a categorical analysis and an \"as applied\" analysis makes sense: the regulation may be categorically preempted on its face, or based on the specific facts of the case it may be preempted \"as applied\" due to its effect on railroad transportation.
