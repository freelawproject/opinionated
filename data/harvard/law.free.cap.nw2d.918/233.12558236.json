(collectively, respondents). After Getz sued respondents for negligence, a jury returned a special verdict that assigned 20 percent fault to Getz and 80 percent fault to Peace. The jury also found that Getz had incurred damages for past medical expenses in the amount of $224,998.16. As a medical-assistance enrollee, Getz received Medicaid benefits through contracted managed-care organizations (MCOs) operating under the state's PMAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondents moved for a determination of collateral sources pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20548.251\">\n    Minn.

The district court first reduced Getz's award for past medical expenses by $20,000 to offset the no-fault-insurance benefits she received. The district court then reduced the amount of the total award $45,979.41 based on its interpretation that the statute does not except from offset the discounts negotiated for Medicaid beneficiaries by an MCO operating under the PMAP. Getz appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Are discounts negotiated by an MCO operating under Minnesota's PMAP \"payments made pursuant to the United States Social Security Act\" that constitute collateral sources excepted from offset under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20548.251\">\n    Minn.

We held in\n   <em>\n    Renswick\n   </em>\n   that Medicare-negotiated discounts are likewise payments, but they are unambiguously excepted from offset by the exception clause as \"payments made pursuant to the United States Social Security Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7067815\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/819/198/#p210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Respondents contend that the phrase \"pursuant to\" within the exception clause requires that any negotiated discounts excepted from offset either be directly negotiated by state or federal authorities or be directly mandated by the federal act. Because our precedent dictates that the language of the exception clause providing that \"payments made pursuant to the United States Social Security Act\" is unambiguous, our examination focuses on the statute's plain and ordinary meaning. The collateral-source-offset statute does not define the phrase \"pursuant to,\" so we use dictionary definitions to analyze its plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shire v. Rosemount, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6827451\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/875/289/#p292\">\n    875 N.W.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (Minn. 2016) (considering dictionary definitions to determine plain meaning of a word). The word \"pursuant\" is defined as \"[p]roceeding from and conformable to\" and \"in accordance with.\"\n   <em>\n    The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   1423 (4th ed. 2006). The word \"to\" means to be \"in accord with.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1814. The word \"to\" is a preposition modifying the adjective \"pursuant\" and is used to introduce an object or subject; here, the United States Social Security Act. In full, the phrase \"pursuant to\" means \"in carrying out,\" \"in conformity with,\" and \"according to.\"\n   <em>\n    See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1011 (11th ed. 2003). This is consistent with the supreme court's interpretation of the same phrase applied in a federal statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Risdall v. Brown-Wilbert, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8187343\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/753/723/\">\n    753 N.W.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 n.6 (Minn. 2008) (\" '[P]ursuant to' is defined as '[i]n compliance with, 'in accordance with,' 'as authorized by' and 'under[.]' \"). Contrary to respondents' argument, the plain language of the statute contains no requirement of\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   state or federal action in negotiating discounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We next determine whether the discounts negotiated for Getz as a Medicaid beneficiary and PMAP enrollee were payments made in accordance with the United States Social Security Act. \"Medicaid, enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, is a publicly funded program to ensure medical care to certain individuals who lack the resources to pay for the costs of essential medical services.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin ex rel.

The statute does not except only such \"payments made\n   <em>\n    by the state or federal government\n   </em>\n   pursuant to the United States Social Security Act.\" The exception clause does not specify\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   must make such payments; it only specifies the law governing and authorizing the excepted collateral source payments: the United States Social Security Act.
