It will further be observed that 30 shares of the stock of the Bank of California has been sold for $9,442.50, and the proceeds, together with money in hand, will be almost all expended in payment of claims and expenses of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">In calculating the commissions, I have included the proceeds of the stock sold, together with the money on hand, in the. first $20,000, allowing full commissions thereon, and included $20,119.39 of the value of the stock distributed in kind in the \u201cestate above the value of twenty thousand dollars,\u201d and allowed only half rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Thus the executor has full rates on all the estate not distributed in kind and such portions of the estate that are distributed in kind as are required to make the aggregate of $20,000, and has half rates on the remaining estate distributed in kind, and involving \" no labor beyond the custody and distribution thereof.\u201d This is just to the executor, and just to the beneficiaries: See Estate of Clark, 3 Oof. Prob. Dec. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">The following is the basis on which the commissions are calculated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">On $1,000 at 7%, $70,00\u2014Pull rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">On $9,000 at 4%, $360.00\u2014Pull rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-15\">On $10,0QO at 3%, $300.00\u2014Pull rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-16\">On $20,119.39 at 1%, $210.19\u2014Half rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-17\">$40,119.39 $931.19</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-18\">October 28, 1908.
