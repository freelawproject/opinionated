The rule laid down in 1 <em>Greenleaf on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 558, approved, and <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Mintsey, </em>5 <em>Rich. </em>372, cited. In this case, the witness testified that he was the custodian of the paper and that it had never gone out of his possession; that he had thoroughly searched his office and could not find it; but'afterwards said h$ would not swear positively that.the paper had never gone out of his office or that he had never given .it to any one.
