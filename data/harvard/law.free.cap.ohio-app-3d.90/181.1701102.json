In its first assignment of error appellant contends that the trial court erred in granting default judgment in favor of appellee, Miami System Corporation, d.b.a. Data Fold Forms. In its second assignment of error appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>judgment. Because appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is rendered moot by our disposition of its second assignment of error, we need not address appellant\u2019s first assignment of error pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). As to appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in not granting appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Appellee filed a complaint alleging breach of contract against appellant on March 19, 1991. Negotiations began between the parties\u2019 attorneys to resolve the matter. Appellant\u2019s attorney, located in Pennsylvania, understood that there was an agreement that appellant did not need to answer appellee\u2019s complaint until the negotiations reached an impasse. Negotiations continued. On July 2, 1991, appellee\u2019s attorney sent appellant\u2019s attorney a letter which stated that if there was no commitment by appellant to satisfy its debt by July 12, 1991, appellee\u2019s attorney would have no alternative but to proceed with the litigation. On July 17,1991, appellee filed a motion for default judgment. Neither appellant nor its attorney was served with the motion. On September 13, 1991, appellee\u2019s attorney sent a letter to appellant\u2019s attorney informing him that the court had set a telephone report for September 19, 1991, at 2:00 p.m., and that should he wish to participate he should contact the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On October 11, 1991, appellee\u2019s counsel informed appellant\u2019s counsel by letter that \u201cthe court has set Thursday, October 24, 1991 at 1:30 P.M. before Referee Clear for default.\u201d Not being aware of the pending default judgment motion and believing this to be another telephone report, appellant\u2019s counsel did not participate. Appellant and appellant\u2019s counsel both received, by letter from appellee\u2019s counsel dated October 25, 1991, copies of the referee\u2019s report granting default judgment to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On November 7, 1991, appellant\u2019s recently retained local counsel filed, without leave of court, an answer and counterclaim on its behalf. Appellee filed a motion to strike those pleadings. On November 27, 1991, appellant filed a motion for leave to file an answer and counterclaim out of time and an opposition to appellee\u2019s motion, to strike. No objections to the referee\u2019s report were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">On December 16,1991, appellant\u2019s counsel appeared before the judge originally assigned to the case in order to argue the pending motions. The matter was continued at that time to a date undetermined. The case was subsequently reassigned to a different judge because of a potential conflict of interest. A hearing on the default judgment was held on January 13, 1992. Because neither appellant nor its counsel was informed of the hearing date, appellant\u2019s counsel failed to appear. At the hearing the trial court sustained appellee\u2019s motion for default judgment. No ruling was made as to appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file its answer out of time and no hearing was had as to appellee\u2019s damages claim. Appellant was not served with a copy of the default judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>On March 13, 1992, appellant filed its motion to set aside the default judgment. Appellee filed its opposition on April 6, 1992. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion by an entry journalized June 10, 1992. Appellant filed its appeal on July 7, 1992, as to the January 13, 1992 default judgment entry and the June 10, 1992 denial of the motion to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">To prevail upon its Civ.R. 60(B) motion appellant, as the moving party, had to establish below that (1) it had a meritorious defense or claim to present if relief was granted; (2) it was entitled to relief under one of the grounds set forth in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5); and (3) the motion was made within a reasonable time, and if the grounds for relief were 60(B)(1), (2), or (3), not more than one year had elapsed since the judgment was entered. <em>GTE Automatic Elec., Inc. v. ARC Industries, Inc. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, paragraph two of the syllabus. The evidentiary materials presented by the movant \u201cmust present \u2018operative facts\u2019 and not mere general allegations to justify relief.\u201d <em>Hornyak v. Brooks </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 105, 106, 16 OBR 111, 113, 474 N.E.2d 676, 678. The trial court\u2019s disposition of a Civ.R. 60(B) motion is subject to reversal only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Griffey v. Rajan </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 514 N.E.2d 1122, 1123-1124. An abuse-of-discretion standard \u201cimplies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. Our review of the record reveals that each of the requirements set out in <em>GTE </em>was met in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We conclude that appellant met the threshold standards for a Civ.R. 60(B) motion in that it set forth a meritorious defense in its answer filed with its motion for leave to file out of time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in the affidavits and exhibits attached to the supplemental memorandum to its Civ.R. 60(B) motion. Therein appellant contended that the goods delivered by appellee were materially defective and not fit for the purpose intended, resulting in damages to appellant. It further alleged that a substantial part of the goods for which appellee sought payment was never ordered by appellant and remained in appellee\u2019s inventory. If appellant can prove its allegations, it would have a meritorious defense to appellee\u2019s claim. \u201cUnder Civ.R. 60(B), a movant\u2019s burden is only to allege a meritorious defense, not to prove that he will prevail on that defense.\u201d <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc. v. Adams </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 520 N.E.2d 564, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The timeliness of appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion is not contested by appellee. We agree with the parties that the filing of a Civ.R. 60(B) motion eleven days after appellant\u2019s attorney first received notification that the trial court had granted appellee\u2019s default judgment motion and two months after the trial court had entered the order is within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We further conclude that appellant was entitled to relief under Civ.R. 60(B). The rule states, in pertinent part, that: \u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect * * Civ.R. 60(B)(1) is a remedial rule entitled to liberal construction with a view to effectuate just results. <em>Rose Chevrolet, Inc., supra. </em>The movant \u201chas the burden to demonstrate by operative facts a <em>prima facie </em>case of \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 showing that the ends of justice will be served by vacating the judgment. To this extent, the quantum of evidence necessary depends upon all surrounding facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Childs v. Kelley </em>(Jan. 23, 1991), Hamilton App. No. C-890468, unreported, 1991 WL 6360. \u201c Where timely relief is sought from a default judgment and the movant has a meritorious defense, doubt, if any, should be in favor of the motion to set aside the judgment so that cases may be decided on their merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doddridge v. Fitzpatrick </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 9, 13, 7 O.O.3d 5, 7, 371 N.E.2d 214, 217, quoting <em>GTE Automatic Elec. v. ARC Industries, supra, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Appellant\u2019s attorney stated by affidavit that default judgment was taken against his client while he was under the impression that the parties were negotiating; that they had informally agreed that no formal answer or responsive pleading was required until the negotiations proved ineffectual; and that settlement options were being discussed as late as October 23,1991, three months after appellee had filed its default judgment motion with the court. Furthermore, the attorney swore that he was not served with a copy of the motion for default. We hold the lack of notice of the default judgment motion, while negotiations were still in progress and when the appellee\u2019s counsel knew the appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s identity, to be probative of excusable neglect. <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. v. Sutton </em>(Nov. 30, 1983), Hamilton App. Nos. C-820324, C-830297, unreported, 1983 WL 5335. While the fact that the appellant\u2019s attorney had expressed a clear intention to defend the claim to appellee\u2019s attorney was arguably an appearance sufficient to trigger the applicability of the seven-day notice provision of Civ.R. 55(A) for the hearing held before the referee on October 24, 1991,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see, <em>e.g., AMCA </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Internatl. Corp. v. Carlton </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 88, 10 OBR 417, 461 N.E.2d 1282; <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co., supra; Baines v. Harwood </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 345, 622 N.E.2d 372; <em>Browning v. Health Ent. of Am., Inc. </em>(June 26, 1987), Crawford App. No. 3-86-1, unreported, 1987 WL 13484, we find even more compelling that appellant was entitled to notice of the trial court\u2019s own January 13, 1992 hearing on appellee\u2019s motion for default judgment. At that time and before the trial court\u2019s action on the default judgment motion, appellant had made an appearance by filing its answer and counterclaim contesting appellee\u2019s allegations, which entitled it to such notice. See <em>Suki v. Blume </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 289, 9 OBR 536, 459 N.E.2d 1311.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We hold that the trial court was unreasonable under the facts and circumstances of this case, see <em>AAAA Ent., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redev. Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597, 601, and had no basis for not granting appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion where appellant had demonstrated the existence of a meritorious defense and entitlement to relief under one of the grounds set forth in Civ.R. 60(B), and where such motion had been timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s June 10, 1992 order and remand this cause for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-8\">Shannon, P.J., Hildebrandt and Gorman, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. The trial court did not address appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file its answer and counterclaim out of time prior to filing its default judgment entry. We hold this failure to respond to the motion or to even acknowledge that it had been filed was error and we will address it under our discussion of the second prong of the Civ.R. 60(B) motion requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">. While appellee argues that its October 11, 1991 letter was sufficient notice of the default judgment motion, we disagree. When a party has pled or otherwise defended such that it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\"appeared\u201d in the action, it is entitled to notice of a default judgment motion pursuant to Civ.R. 55(A). Civ.R. 5(A) provides that every written notice must be served upon each of the parties and Civ.R. 5(D) states that papers filed with the court cannot be considered until proof of service is endorsed thereon or filed separately. \"Thus, in general, service must be given to all parties when a written notice is filed, or the notice cannot be considered by the court.\u201d <em>Clay Hyder Trucking Lines, Inc. v. Riley </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 224, 225, 16 OBR 240, 241, 475 N.E.2d 183, 185. The record demonstrates that the motion for default judgment did not contain a certificate of service as required by the rule. Likewise the letter upon which appellee claims it provided notice was not filed by appellee with the court nor did it contain a certificate of service. Thus, any claim by appellee that the appellant was provided with sufficient notice of the default judgment motion is meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
