Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245, because it contains no explanation as to why the nonmedical factors do not so impact upon the medical impairment as to cause permanent total disability; (2) even if the decision did comply with <em>Noll, </em>it is not supported by evidence; and (3) respondent commission is statutorily required to promulgate guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">With respect to the third objection, the report of the referee is adopted since the issue has been disposed of by <em>State ex rel. Blake v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 453, 605 N.E.2d 23, which denied a writ under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">However, we find the first objection to have merit. The commission decision which is the subject of this action does not comply with <em>Noll </em>in that it does not set forth reasoning explaining the basis for the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision. The commission order in pertinent part states:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\u201cThe claimant is a 62 year old, has a 7th grade education and has worked as a pipefitter [sic ] and machine repairer. Although his education is limited, his prior work experience would appear to be skilled and would probably have some transferable skills. * * * It would appear with his skilled work experience the claimant retains the skills to retrain for work within the medical restrictions of Doctors Hartwig, and Hawkins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The key words in this decision are \u201cappear to be skilled\u201d and \u201cprobably have some transferable skills.\u201d The phrase \u201ctransferable skills\u201d is essentially boilerplate language which has no independent significant meaning without reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to how the skills could be transferred from one job to another. There simply is no explanation of how the work of a pipe fitter or a machine repairer (jobs which the medical evidence relied upon indicate relator no longer can perform) can be transferred to another job. Similarly, the word \u201cskilled\u201d standing alone has little significance. In a broad sense, a pipe fitter is \u201cskilled\u201d if he is able to perform his work well. This merely means a person may be \u201cskilled\u201d at a given job, but the breadth of the skill is limited. There is no indication in the report of any wide range of skills possessed by relator enabling him to perform a wide range of jobs. The use of the words \u201cskilled\u201d and \u201ctransferable skills\u201d leaves us as much in the dark as to the reasoning of the commission as we would be without those words being present. The objection on this ground is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The second objection is based upon the lack of evidence. Assuming that somehow the' commission\u2019s decision could be construed to comply with the requirements of <em>Noll, </em>there is simply no evidence relied upon by the commission supporting the conclusion with respect to the nonmedical factors. The commission report refers to no evidence other than the reports of Drs. Steiman, Hartwig, and Hawkins, and then indicates that the medical restrictions set forth by Drs. Hartwig and Hawkins are those relied upon. These restrictions are delineated in the decision as being \u201crestrictions on prolonged bending, stooping, lifting, and similar activities.\u201d Dr. Hawkins opined that relator could not perform the duties of a pipe fitter, but, from a medical standpoint, \u201ccould do some work in a standing or walking position with limitations on bending, stooping, lifting, pushing, pulling and similar duties.\u201d However, he also opined that \u201c[Rehabilitation at this age, in the presence of the structural abnormalities in the low back, would be impracticable.\u201d It is unclear whether Dr. Hawkins is talking from a medical-impairment standpoint or from a nonmedical-factor standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Dr. Hartwig stated similar restrictions, except that he felt that relator could perform employment in \u201ca sitting type of job,\u201d but that \u201clifting or forward bending type duties are not advisable.\u201d He further opined that \u201crehabilitation from a medical standpoint is appropriate, as long as restriction from prolonged standing, forward flexion, bending and lifting could be enforced.\u201d He does not comment upon the impact of nonmedical factors upon rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In short, there simply is no evidence upon which the respondent commission indicates it relied supporting its conclusion that the nonmedical factors do not so impact upon the thirty percent medical impairment found as to prevent relator from working at sustained remunerative employment. There may well be some evidence before the commission which justified its conclusion that a thirty-percent medically impaired, sixty-two-year-old former pipe fitter and machine repairer with only a seventh grade education and who no longer can perform the duties of a pipe fitter or machine repairer can perform some type of sustained remunera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tive employment. However, the commission has not set forth any evidence relied upon supporting this conclusion, nor has it explained how it reached its conclusion from the evidence it did rely upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The only other evidence referred to was the report of Dr. Steiman, which also does not purport to constitute evidence as to the impact of the nonmedical factors upon the medical impairment. As set forth in paragraph six of the referee\u2019s report to this court, the statement of facts prepared for respondent commission states in part: \u201c4. Special Training and/or Special Vocational Skills: None.\u201d This, likewise, does not support the finding that relator, with his age and education and past work experience as a pipe fitter and machine repairer, which he no longer can perform, is so skilled that, despite his thirty-percent medical impairment, he is capable of sustained remunerative employment at some other \u201cskilled\u201d job.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Accordingly, the first two objections are well taken, but the third is not. The findings of fact in the referee\u2019s report are approved and adopted as those of the court, but the conclusions of law and recommendation are not accepted other than with respect to the statutory duty of the respondent commission to promulgate guidelines. For these reasons, a limited writ of mandamus will issue, ordering respondent Industrial Commission to vacate its order denying relator\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation and to issue a new order determining that application, with an explanation of the reasoning for the decision and of the evidence relied upon supporting such decision in compliance with <em>Noll, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>Objections sustained in part, limited writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-8\">Petree and Deshler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
