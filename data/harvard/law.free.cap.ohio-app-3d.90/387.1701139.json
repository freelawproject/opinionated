Roger, appeals from the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of his employer, Greyhound Lines, Inc. (\u201cGreyhound\u201d), and thereby denying his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue raised in Roger\u2019s only assignment of error is whether an injury sustained on the employer\u2019s premises by an employee while walking a picket line, during a strike organized by his union, is compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C). We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">All facts relied upon by the trial court in its memorandum of decision granting Greyhound\u2019s motion for summary judgment were contained in Roger\u2019s answers to the interrogatories propounded by Greyhound, and, therefore, are undisputed for purposes of Civ.R. 56. Those facts establish that on March 27, 1990, a strike related to renewal of the collective-bargaining agreement between the Amalgamated Transit Union and Greyhound was in progress. Roger, a member of the union, was on picket duty at the east gate of Greyhound\u2019s Cincinnati terminal. A Greyhound bus entered the gate and hit him, causing the injuries which were the subject of his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Dayton Regional Board of Review affirmed the district hearing officer\u2019s denial of Roger\u2019s claim, and the Industrial Commission denied his appeal. He then appealed to the common pleas court under R.C. 4123.519, which held that Roger\u2019s injury was not received in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Under Ohio workers\u2019 compensation law, an injury sustained by an employee is compensable only if it \u201cwas received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C). In <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 551 N.E.2d 1271, 1274, the Ohio Supreme Court recognized the \u201cconjunctive nature\u201d of the \u201ctwo pronged\u201d requirements of the coverage formula: (1) \u201cin the course of\u2019 the employment, and (2) \u201carising out of\u2019 the employment. To establish a compensable injury, the court in <em>Fisher </em>held that the employee must satisfy both requirements, subject to the liberal construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tion of workers\u2019 compensation statutes in favor of awarding benefits to employees as provided in R.C. 4123.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The first prong of the coverage formula, \u201cin the course of employment,\u201d relates to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, supra, </em>at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274. This prong focuses on whether the employee is acting for the employer, or for himself, or for another at the time of the injury. In his treatise Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio (2 Ed.1971) 75, Section 5.3, James L.-Young has proposed consideration of the following constituent factors relative to this prong:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">a. the fact of payment or the expectation of payment;</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">b. the source of payment;</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">c. control over the activity and by whom it is exercised, a most important factor;</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">d. the situs of the employment, which may be fixed, semi-fixed or variable;</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">e. the situs of the accident;</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">f. a major factor is time, and there the time of the injury and the time of employment are both significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">These factors concentrate on what constitutes personal activity and what constitutes work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">In this appeal, it is significant that Roger was subsisting at the time of his injury on strike benefits paid by his union, from which his union dues were deducted. His activities on the picket line were controlled by a schedule the union posted. Although he retained his status as a Greyhound employee during the strike, Roger\u2019s presence on the picket line at the expense and direction of his union can only be viewed as personal activity and not as activity incidental to his employment duties. Union picketing of the employer during an organized strike is not the type of activity that satisfies those constituent factors referred to by Young, and is not consistent with the concept of doing something for the employer during the employee\u2019s course of employment. In accordance with our holding, Professor Larson, \u201ca leading scholar in this area of the law,\u201d see <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, supra, </em>has stated that \u201cpicketing and other strike activities are not within the course of employment.\u201d 1A Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1984) 5-413, Section 27.33(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">The second prong of the coverage formula, \u201carising out of\u2019 the employment, relates to the causal connection between the employment and the employee\u2019s injury. <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274. Citing the syllabus in <em>Lord v. Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 441, 20 O.O.3d 376, 423 N.E.2d 96, the court in <em>Fisher </em>stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cWhether there is a sufficient \u2018causal connection\u2019 between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment to justify the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including: (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Mayfield, supra, </em>at 277, 551 N.E.2d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The undisputed facts in this appeal may arguably satisfy the first two factors announced in <em>Lord v. Daugherty, supra, </em>but Roger\u2019s presence on the picket fine cannot be deemed a benefit to Greyhound, despite his argument that the picketing was in furtherance of renewing the collective-bargaining agreement between Greyhound and the union. Section 501(2) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 defines a \u201cstrike\u201d as a \u201cconcerted <em>stoppage of work </em>by employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 142(2), Title 29, U.S.Code. In <em>Leach v. Republic Steel Corp. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 221, 223-224, 27 O.O.2d 122, 122, 199 N.E.2d 3, 5, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that \u201ca \u2018strike\u2019 is a <em>cessation of work </em>by employees in an effort to obtain more desirable terms with respect to wages, working conditions, etc. * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The establishment of this confrontational process between the union and the employer during stoppage of work can scarcely be said to benefit the employer or the employer\u2019s interests. Roger\u2019s activity, at the time of his injury, was in pursuit of his own competing interests with Greyhound rather than his common interests with Greyhound, and, contrary to his assertion, is distinguishable from injuries sustained by an employee at an employer-sponsored social event held to benefit the employer by creating a harmonious working atmosphere through heightened employee morale. See <em>Kohlmayer v. Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 10, 53 O.O.2d 6, 263 N.E.2d 231; 1A Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, <em>supra, </em>5-168, Section 22.33. Accordingly, his claim likewise fails under the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong of the coverage formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Because no genuine issues of material fact remained to be litigated; because Greyhound was entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and because reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, that conclusion being adverse to Roger, the trial court properly granted Greyhound\u2019s motion for summary judgment under Civ.R. 56(C). See <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267. Accordingly, Roger\u2019s single assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b423-8\">Shannon, P.J., and Hildebrandt, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\">.
