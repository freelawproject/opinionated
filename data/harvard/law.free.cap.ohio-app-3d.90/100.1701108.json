(\u201cWendy\u2019s\u201d), appeals from the judgment entered upon a jury\u2019s verdict awarding $58,650 to plaintiff-appellee Shirley M. Johnson (\u201cappellee\u201d) on appellee\u2019s claim that she fell at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant and sustained permanent injuries as a result of Wendy\u2019s negligence. Wendy\u2019s assigns as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by failing to direct a verdict in favor of the appellant because appellee Johnson failed to offer evidence of proximate cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by failing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because appellee Johnson failed to offer evidence of proximate cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by failing to direct a verdict in favor of the appellant because appellee Johnson failed to offer evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">Assignment of Error No. 4</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by failing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because appellee Johnson failed to offer evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Assignment of Error No. 5</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the appellant by admitting the [sic ] over objection, duly and timely made, testimony of plaintiffs expert witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Assignment of Error No. 6</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict and the judgment of the lower court is [sic ] against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">Assignment of Error No. 5</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">We shall first address Wendy\u2019s fifth assignment of error maintaining that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of appellees\u2019 expert witness, Michael J. Frenzel, a safety consultant. Wendy\u2019s specifically argues that Frenzel\u2019s testimony was \u201ctotally speculative,\u201d \u201cnot even remotely relevant,\u201d and was designed to \u201cvilify the design and construction of the Wendy\u2019s building in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>concerted effort to unfairly prejudice the jury.\u201d We disagree with each of these assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Upon laying the proper foundation, counsel for appellees inquired of Frenzel whether he had an opinion as to whether the ingress/egress location where appellee fell was unsafe or otherwise dangerous in its design, use or arrangement. Frenzel responded affirmatively and opined that the layout of that particular Wendy\u2019s restaurant is dangerous because \u201cit invites a misstep based on the area, on the layout as I saw it, and measured it and observed other people, entering and exiting and also where [appellee] came to rest on the far side of the driveway. I believe that in all probability she missed the step and that downward step gave her the momentum to carry on to the side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">This opinion is not \u201ctotally speculative.\u201d Instead, the opinion is based upon Frenzel\u2019s observation of the curb where appellee fell and based upon his experience as a safety consultant. Likewise, this opinion testimony is relevant to the issue of whether a dangerous condition existed at the time and place of appellee\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">We find Wendy\u2019s claim that Frenzel\u2019s intent was to vilify the design and construction of the Wendy\u2019s building is without merit. Rather, Frenzel\u2019s testimony was offered to prove that a dangerous condition existed at the Wendy\u2019s restaurant at the time and place appellee fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Accordingly, we overrule Wendy\u2019s fifth assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Assignments of Error Nos. 1 &amp; 2</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Through its first and second assigned errors, Wendy\u2019s maintains that appellees failed to offer evidence that appellee\u2019s fall and subsequent injury were proximately caused by the unsafe or dangerous condition existing at the exit of the restaurant. Wendy\u2019s specifically directs our attention to appellee\u2019s failure to explain why or how she fell. Instead, appellee testified at trial that as she was holding the door of the restaurant for her sister to exit the restaurant, she remembered \u201cfalling backwards and the feeling of surprise.\u201d No eyewitnesses were available at trial to explain the exact cause of appellee\u2019s fall. Thus, Wendy\u2019s position is that appellees offered nothing more than mere conjecture as to the cause of appellee\u2019s fall and cites us to the following authority:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">\u201cIt is firmly settled by the authorities that negligence is a fact necessary to be shown; it will not be presumed. Thus, where liability depends upon the carelessness or fault of a person or his employees, the right of recovery must be. based on competent evidence. <em>It is incumbent on the plaintiff to show how and why an injury occurred </em>\u2014 to <em>develop facts from which it can be determined by the jury that the defendant failed to exercise due care and that such failure was a proximate cause of the injury. A verdict for plaintiff based on conjecture, guess, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>random judgment or supposition cannot be sustained. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Boles v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 381, 388-389, 41 O.O. 403, 406, 92 N.E.2d 9, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We begin with the observation that a person who sustains an injury from a fall is not necessarily precluded from asserting a successful negligence claim simply because she cannot remember the exact cause of her fall. This case illustrates how a permissible inference may be drawn from the injured plaintiffs limited factual testimony surrounding the fall and the observations and conclusions drawn by an expert witness. See <em>Harper v. Castle Apts., Inc. </em>(Nov. 25, 1987), Summit App. No. 13115, unreported, 1987 WL 25769.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Appellee\u2019s sister, Sara Wilkes, testified that immediately prior to the fall, appellee was standing outside the restaurant and facing the inside as she held the door open for Sara. Appellee testified that while she was holding the door, she fell backwards and landed in the driveway of Wendy\u2019s parking lot. Appellee denied that her shoes, a slippery object or illness caused her fall. Instead, appellee simply stated that she fell backwards. This testimony, combined with the preceding excerpts of Frenzel\u2019s opinion testimony, leads us to the conclusion that sufficient evidence was before the jury to permit it to draw the permissible inference that appellee\u2019s fall and subsequent injury were proximately caused by the dangerous condition that existed at the exit of the Wendy\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">This is not a case where a plaintiff simply testifies that she fell and that a dangerous condition existed in close proximity to the fall. Rather, this is a case where the plaintiff fell at the exact spot where a dangerous condition existed. We believe the jury\u2019s finding of proximate cause was not based upon mere conjecture, guess, random judgment or supposition, but was, instead, based upon a reasonable inference from the underlying facts. Appellees did not have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the cause of appellee\u2019s fall, but only needed to offer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it was more probable than not that appellee\u2019s fall was caused by the dangerous condition that existed at the restaurant. We believe that it was better left to the trier of fact to determine from the evidence of this case what was more probable in causing appellee\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Accordingly, we overrule Wendy\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Assignments of Error Nos. 3 &amp; 4</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Through its third and fourth assignments of error, Wendy\u2019s maintains that appellees, failed to offer evidence of Wendy\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">In order to establish negligence, a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the defendant had a duty of care to plaintiff, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach of that duty proximately resulted in the plaintiff sustaining injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Here, appellees presented evidence that Wendy\u2019s had a duty to create a safe ingress and egress to its restaurant. Appellees further offered evidence that Wendy\u2019s breached that duty by permitting a dangerous area at the door of the Wendy\u2019s restaurant and that the dangerous condition caused appellee to fall and sustain injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Accordingly, we overrule Wendy\u2019s third and fourth assigned errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Assignment of Error No. 6</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Through its sixth and final assignment of error, Wendy\u2019s maintains that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">It is well established that judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of a case will not be reversed by an appellate court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C.E. Moms Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">For the reasons previously stated, we find some competent, credible evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision, and we hereby overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment entered in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-12\">William B.
