Walker (appellant) from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County convicting him on one count of aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(3), a felony of the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">On October 24, 1992, Lloyd Fisher, a police officer for the city of Marion, was called to investigate a burglary which had allegedly occurred the night before at the home of Donn Craner. The officer testified at appellant\u2019s trial that his investigation eventually led him to appellant, who admitted during the officer\u2019s initial questioning that he had participated in the burglary along with two \u201cfriends.\u201d Craner himself had discovered the identity of one of the friends, Rebecca Holbrook, who subsequently returned to Craner all of the stolen items except for a pendant, which she had lost or sold, and a beaded leather \u201cammuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tion\u201d pouch which appellant admitted he had taken. Holbrook implicated appellant in the burglary during her initial conversation with the investigating officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Appellant was arrested and charged with aggravated burglary. Following a trial to the court on March 11, 1993, appellant was found guilty as charged. The court then ordered a presentence investigation. Appellant was subsequently sentenced to an indefinite five-to-twenty-five-year term of imprisonment. He has appealed his conviction, asserting four assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u201cThe trial court did not have jurisdiction to try the defendant because the court failed to strictly comply with O.R.C. \u00a7 2945.05 and obtain a proper waiver of defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The first assignment of error is not well taken. We disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that his waiver of a jury trial failed to meet the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 and Crim.R. 23(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based upon ,our review of the record, including a reading of the transcript of the trial, we find that the requirements of the law were satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">On March 5, 1993, appellant filed the following signed, written \u201cwaiver of jury trial\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u201cBeing fully aware that I have a constitutional and statutory right to trial by jury with respect to the charges placed against me in this action, I do hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to be tried by jury, and I choose instead to be tried by a judge of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">\u201cI further stipulate and acknowledge that this waiver is executed by me knowingly, and voluntarily, without threats or promises of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">This waiver was subsequently noted by the trial court as being a part of the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, we find that the above waiver language substantially complies with that required by R.C. 2945.05. In addition, the transcript reveals that appellant reaffirmed his waiver orally, in open court, following an admonition and explanation by the trial judge immediately preceding the trial. See <em>State v. Morris </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 12, 8 OBR 13, 455 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>1352 (\u201c[A] written waiver signed by the defendant prior to trial and followed by a one sentence inquiry by the trial judge is sufficient to insure defendant\u2019s rights\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 14, 8 OBR at 15, 455 N.E.2d at 1355 (citing <em>State v. Johnson </em>[Mar. 5, 1981], Cuyahoga App. No. 42722, unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Appellant contends that, in addition to the mandate that the waiver must be written, R.C. 2945.05\u2019s requirement that the waiver be \u201cmade\u201d in open court mandates an actual \u201csigning\u201d of the written waiver before the trial judge in open court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant further argues that his interpretation of the statutory requirement is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">However, in <em>Jells, </em>the appellant contended that the trial court erred in not conducting a \u201cthorough\u201d enough inquiry as to appellant\u2019s understanding of his waiver of a jury trial. The court therein had, in open court, reviewed the defendant\u2019s written waiver, and inquired .of him whether he had voluntarily executed the signed waiver. The Supreme Court determined that this brief colloquy was sufficient to establish that \u201can intelligent, voluntary, and knowing waiver was made.\u201d The court stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cThere is no requirement in Ohio for the trial court to interrogate a defendant in order to determine whether he or she is fully apprised of the right to a jury trial. The Criminal Rules and the Revised Code are satisfied by a written waiver, signed by the defendant, filed with the court, and made in open court, after arraignment and opportunity to consult with counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 559 N.E.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The analysis was ended at that point, however, and the court made no attempt to clarify the meaning of the statutory language which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\u201cSuch waiver of trial by jury must be made in open court after the defendant has been arraigned and has had opportunity to consult with counsel.\u201d R.C. 2945.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">In light of <em>Jells </em>and Morris,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>we interpret the provision to mean that there must be further evidence on the record, in addition to the signed writing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>that a defendant has voluntarily made an informed waiver of his constitutional right to a trial by jury. We conclude that a valid waiver of the right to a jury trial is accomplished only by completion of a two-step process, set forth by the statute and reinforced by Crim.R. 23(A). First, a defendant must sign a written statement affirming that he is knowingly and voluntarily waiving his constitutional right to a trial by jury, uninfluenced by promises or threats of any kind. Additionally, there must occur, in open court, a colloquy between the trial judge and the defendant himself, extensive enough for the judge to make a reasonable determination that the defendant has been advised and is aware of the implications of voluntarily relinquishing a constitutional right. We do not take the statute to mean, as urged by appellant, that the written waiver must be actually signed in open court, as long as the signed writing has been made a part of the record and the waiver is reaffirmed in open court. The record in this case clearly reflects that both procedural requirements were satisfied. Therefore, finding that appellant voluntarily made a knowing and intelligent waiver of a jury trial, we overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u201cDefendant was deprived of his right to effective counsel pursuant to the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and Sections 10 and 16 of Article I of the Ohio Constitution when upon a review of all of the circumstances it is shown the defendant did not have a fair trial and substantial justice lacking <em>[sic.].\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The United States Supreme Court has concluded that the Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel is satisfied only by \u201ceffective\u201d representation. <em>McMann v. Richardson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, 773, fn. 14. Under the two-pronged test for effective assistance of counsel pronounced in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, a defendant must show that \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Ohio has, essentially, adopted the <em>Strickland </em>analysis for determining whether counsel\u2019s performance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 17 OBR 219, 220, 477 N.E.2d 1128, 1130. See, also, <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 253, 574 N.E.2d 483, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">As cautioned in <em>Strickland, </em>\u201c[jJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id., </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694. Further, a reviewing court in Ohio must presume that \u201ca properly licensed attorney\u201d is competent to conduct a criminal defense. <em>State v. Hamblin </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 153, 155-156, 524 N.E.2d 476, 478-480. Strategy and tactical decisions exercised by defense counsel \u201cwell within the range of professionally reasonable judgment\u201d need not be analyzed by a reviewing court. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 699, 104 S.Ct. at 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d at 701. The burden falls upon the appellant to \u201c \u2018overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action\u2019 \u201d falls within the scope of reasonable trial strategy. <em>Frazier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 253, 574 N.E.2d at 488 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d at 694-695). As stated by the court in <em>Strickland, </em>even professionally unreasonable errors by defense counsel do not violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel absent an actual effect on the outcome of the trial. See <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373, 379. Again, it is the appellant\u2019s burden to show that the verdict rendered would \u201c \u2018reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 538 N.E.2d at 380 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695-696, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699). Thus, the \u201cbenchmark\u201d for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. <em>Frazier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 254, 574 N.E.2d at 489; see, also, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, 80 L.Ed.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We will address appellant\u2019s specific allegations of ineffectiveness of counsel, mindful of the appropriate standards as reiterated, <em>supra. </em>Appellant complains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to file a pretrial motion to suppress evidence, and that he called a defense witness to the stand whose testimony on cross-examination resulted in the admission of evidence damaging to appellant\u2019s defense. Appellant first argues that his trial counsel should have filed a pretrial motion to suppress the incriminating statements made by appellant during the testifying officer\u2019s interview with him, because the officer failed to administer the <em>Miranda </em>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, the Supreme Court set out the guideline for states to follow in order to preserve criminal suspects\u2019 Fifth Amendment right to avoid coerced self-incrimination. <em>Miranda </em>mandates that all individuals who are taken into official custody must be advised of their constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and be given the chance to voluntarily waive those rights before being interrogated about suspected misbehavior. Thus, law enforcement officials will ensure that statements made by suspects are voluntary and not coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Although the <em>Miranda </em>court suggested that the failure to administer the warnings would create a presumption of coercion when a suspect is in police custody, the court later refused to read <em>Miranda </em>so restrictively, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u201cWe must conclude that, absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 298, 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1296, 84 L.Ed.2d 222, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has cautioned courts against extending <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>protections further than originally intended:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u201cIn deciding whether particular police conduct is interrogation, we must remember the purpose behind our decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards [v. Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378]: preventing government officials from using the coercive nature of confinement to extract confessions that would not be given in an unrestrained environment.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Mauro </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 520, 529-530, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 1937-1938, 95 L.Ed.2d 458, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">We find that, for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>appellant herein was not \u201cin custody,\u201d nor was he subjected to intimidating or coercive \u201cinterrogation\u201d which would render the statements at issue inadmissible as evidence at trial. The action of the officer in this case does not in any way undermine the objectives expressed in <em>Mauro, supra. </em>Appellant was interviewed not in an \u201cinterrogation room,\u201d but in his own residence; he was not restrained in any way. No one else was present in the room. We find no coercive elements in these facts which would have rendered the simple investigatory questions asked of appellant a \u201cploy\u201d to \u201csubjugate the individual to the will of [an] examiner\u201d in order to elicit an incriminating response. See <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 307 (\u201c \u2018Interrogation,\u2019 as conceptualized in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d). See, also, <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 457, 86 S.Ct. at 1618, 16 L.Ed.2d at 713 (\u201cthe coercion inherent in custodial interrogation derives in large measure from an interrogator\u2019s insinuations that the interrogation will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>continue until a confession is obtained\u201d). Furthermore, we find no evidence even of \u201csubtle compulsion,\u201d which the Supreme Court rejected as equating with coercion in <em>Innis. Id., </em>446 U.S. at 301-302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d at 308 (\u201csince the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We conclude that appellant\u2019s statements were given voluntarily, free of any compelling or deceptive influence. Accordingly, we are not inclined to scrutinize the strategy utilized by appellant\u2019s trial counsel in his decision not to file a motion to suppress evidence properly obtained. Strategy \u201cwell within the range of professionally reasonable judgment\u201d need not be analyzed by a reviewing court. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 699, 104 S.Ct. at 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d at 701. We further <em>note </em>that, as stated by the <em>Miranda </em>court, \u201cConfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement * * *. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment * * *, [and] [a]ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We also conclude that defense counsel\u2019s decision to call Jackie Morris as a witness was a tactical' one. Morris incriminated others in the burglary by her responses to counsel\u2019s direct examination, and although counsel did not foresee the prosecutor\u2019s questions on cross-examination, the results of the examination were not unduly prejudicial to appellant. We find that any tactical errors defense counsel may have made were not so serious as to satisfy the test for ineffective counsel, nor did appellant suffer unfair prejudice as a result of the alleged deficiencies. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u201cUpon a full review of the trial court\u2019s transcript and record it is clear the defendant was denied [a] fair trial and due process of law because of the cumulative error in this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Appellant argues only that, even if no single error on defense counsel\u2019s part was egregious enough to deprive appellant of a fair trial, a cumulation of such errors has resulted in unfairness to appellant. Appellant further argues that, because he received an ineffective defense, he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to appoint another attorney, one of his own choosing, to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The record demonstrates that, before the state\u2019s presentation of its case, the court heard appellant\u2019s \u201cmotion\u201d for new counsel. After asking appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>several questions relevant to his request, and questioning defense counsel, the court denied appellant\u2019s \u201cmotion,\u201d stating as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u201cYou\u2019ve not given me any specific instances which indicate to me that Mr. Spohn has done less than he should have in your case. So unless you can cite some specific instance for me, we are going to proceed with trial now. Your letter seems \u2014 merely seems to me you had a preference for attorney Tom Matthews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The court further determined that appellant had simply misinterpreted or misunderstood much of his attorney\u2019s advice. We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Since we find no prejudicial error in the court\u2019s actions or in defense counsel\u2019s representation of appellant, we find no cumulation of errors which would warrant a reversal of the conviction. The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u201cThe court\u2019s verdict of guilty was against the manifest weight of the evidence and without sufficiency of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt for a finding of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Appellant complains that, whereas the most incriminating evidence in the state\u2019s case was evidence of his own statements to the investigating officer, and those statements were improperly admitted, the verdict was against the manifest weight of the (admissible) evidence. However, since we determined, <em>supra, </em>that appellant\u2019s statements were admissible, this argument is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The elements of aggravated burglary which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt are, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">\u201cNo person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> * * * with purpose to commit therein any theft offense * * * or any felony, when * * * [t]he occupied structure involved is the permanent or temporary habitation of any person, in which at the time any person is present or likely to be present.\u201d (Footnote added.) R.C. 2911.11(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">The prosecution established at trial that appellant, either as a principal or an accomplice, entered the home of Donn Craner by force, during late evening hours when persons are likely to be at home, and admittedly was in possession of property which he knew was stolen from Craner\u2019s house. We find, \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d that a \u201creasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492, 503. Thus, the verdict is not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and the assignment of error is not well taken. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-7\">Shaw and Hadley, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-14\">. In <em>State v. Tate </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 50, 13 O.O.3d 36, 391 N.E.2d 738, the Supreme Court found that, although under Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution the Criminal Rules supersede any analogous statutes to the extent of any conflict, R.C. 2945.05 \"remains effective as prescribing the mandatory procedure for waiving the right to a jury trial,\u201d \"since there is no conflict between Crim.R. 23(A) and R.C. 2945.05.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 13 O.O.3d at 37-38, 391 N.E.2d at 739-740.
