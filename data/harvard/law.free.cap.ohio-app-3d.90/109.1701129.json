Plaintiffs-appellants, Elizabeth and Casimer Roszak, timely appeal the decision of the lower court which granted the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant-appellee, Princess Cruises, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Appellants\u2019 amended complaint alleged that Mrs. Roszak, while a passenger on a vessel owned and/or operated by Princess Cruises, was injured, due to the negligence of Princess Cruises and/or its employees, when a fellow passenger fell on top of her. Princess Cruises duly answered and denied any allegations of negligence. As an affirmative defense, Princess Cruises asserted that the \u201cplaintiff did not commence this action within one year as required by the passage contract which plaintiff entered into with defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Princess Cruises moved for summary judgment on the ground that appellants\u2019 claim was time-barred by a clause in the passage contract limiting the time in which a passenger may file suit for injury against Princess Cruises to one year after the date of injury. Attached to Princess Cruises\u2019 motion is the affidavit of Mary Van Hyning, an employee of Princess Cruises. Van Hyning averred that:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">\u201cPlaintiff claims she suffered an injury aboard the Sky Princess on February 7, 1991. The ship was at anchor off the island of St. Maarten at the time of the alleged injury. The Sky Princess was stopped at St. Maarten as an intermediary port during a seven day voyage from and returning to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The document attached to this affidavit is an example of the ticket of passage issued to the plaintiff by Princess Cruises, Inc. as agent for the carrier. The entire contract of passage is printed on the passage ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201cPrincess Cruises, Inc. forwards the passage ticket to all passengers prior to the voyage. Upon boarding the ship for the beginning of the voyage the top page or \u2018embarkation copy\u2019 of the ticket is surrendered to the appropriate personnel aboard ship. The remainder of the passage ticket, including all the terms and conditions, is retained by the passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cParagraph 16 of the passage ticket contains an express provision regarding the proper forum for bringing any law suits relating to the voyage. The passage ticket requires that any such law suit must be commenced within one year of the incident that is the basis for the law suit. The law suit is also required to be brought in a court located in the County of Los Angeles, California, and in no other location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The sample passage ticket is composed of seven full pages, including three front pages nominally titled, in red ink, \u201cOFFICE COPY,\u201d \u201cEMBARKATION COPY,\u201d and \u201cPASSENGER COPY.\u201d Each of the front pages contains on the bottom left-hand corner the following notice, also in red ink:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u201cIMPORTANT NOTICE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u201cThis ticket includes the Passage Contract Terms on the succeeding pages which are binding on you. Please read them carefully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The title to the passage ticket and the notice are the only provisions on the passage ticket in red ink.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">On the last page of the passenger ticket is found the following time limitation for personal injury claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">\u201c16. TIME LIMITATION; NOTICE BY YOU OF CLAIMS AND SUITS; ONLY PLACE TO SUE.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">\u201cIn cases involving claims for bodily injury to or death of any Passenger, no lawsuit may be brought against the Carrier, Captain, any of the officers, crew and agents of the ship unless (i) written notice giving full particulars of the claim is delivered to the carrier within six (6) months and a law suit on such claim is commenced \"within one (1) year from the date of the bodily injury or death and (ii) valid service of the lawsuit is made within 120 days of the suit * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Appellants\u2019 brief in opposition to Princess Cruises\u2019 motion for summary judgment argued that appellants were not sufficiently placed on notice of the time limitation in the passenger ticket and that the terms of the passenger ticket do not apply to launch boats. Mrs. Roszak\u2019s affidavit was attached to her brief in opposition. Mrs. Roszak averred:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">\u201c4. My entire ticket was delivered to me by the travel agency in an opaque envelope provided by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">\u201c5. I did not read the contract of passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201c6. Upon boarding the Sky Princess, we surrendered our tickets to Defendant\u2019s ticket-taking personnel. No contract of passage was retained by us, nor were we told to read the contract for passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201c7. I sustained personal injuries while aboard a launch which was transporting me back to the ship from the island of St. Maarten, when an unsupervised passenger stood up on the moving launch and fell onto me.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u201c8. In order to board and ride the launch, we were not permitted to present our ticket of passage, but rather, we were required to present a separate, laminated ticket provide[d] in our room after the cruise began. The Gulf War was then being prosecuted, and so security was tight and Defendant\u2019s instructions regarding the separate launch ticket were explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u201c9. This separate launch ticket contained no language regarding time limitations for filing suits for personal injuries, nor any other terms and conditions regarding passage on the launch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Princess Cruises filed a reply brief with a second affidavit of Mary Van Hyning attached thereto. Van Hyning averred that the launch upon which Mrs. Roszak claimed to have been injured was a launch owned and operated by Princess Cruises for the purpose of taking passengers to and from the ship. Van Hyning further averred that the passenger ticket issued to Mrs. Roszak covers her travel aboard the ship and its launches. Finally, all passengers were given cards for the purposes of identifying them as the ship\u2019s passengers, and such passengers were required to use these cards when boarding and debarking from the launches in order to prevent non-crew or non-passengers from gaining unauthorized access to the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Appellants filed a motion to strike appellee\u2019s reply brief as being filed without seeking leave of court pursuant to Loc.R. 11 of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, General Division. Thereafter, appellee filed a motion for leave to file its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Without ruling on appellants\u2019 motion to strike or appellee\u2019s motion for. leave, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Princess Cruises. The next day, January 7,1992, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for leave and held appellants\u2019 motion to strike as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants timely appeal, raising the following sole assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendant-appellee because genuine issues of material fact exist, and defendant-appellee was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error, appellants argue the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Appellants contend that the time limitation in which to file against Princess Cruises as contained on the passage ticket is not \u201cconspicuous\u201d or \u201ceye-catching\u201d so as to put them on notice of such time limitation. Appellants also argue that the time limitation on the passage ticket does not apply to incidents occurring on a launch boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The validity and enforceability of such time limitation as contained on the instant passage ticket appears to be of first impression for Ohio courts. See, <em>e.g., Petruzzi v. Casey </em>(Apr. 26, 1990), Franklin App. No. 89AP-1508, unreported, 1990 WL 54266. However, the passage ticket in question is a maritime contract and, therefore, its interpretation is governed by maritime law. <em>The Moses Taylor </em>(1867), 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 411, 18 L.Ed. 397; <em>Lubick v. Travel Serv., Inc. </em>(D.C.V.I.1983), 573 F.Supp. 904, 906. Section 183b(a), Title 46, U.S.Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allows owners, operators, and agents of seagoing vessels to limit their liability for personal injury claims to suits in which notice has been given to the carrier within six months of the injury and where the suits have been commenced within one year. See <em>Barbachym v. Costa Line, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1983), 713 F.2d 216. However, federal courts decline to enforce a sea carrier\u2019s use of a contractual limitation period contained within a passage ticket unless the passage ticket contract sufficiently alerts the passengers to the restriction of their rights. <em>Spataro v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Kloster Cruise, Ltd. </em>(C.A.2, 1990), 894 F.2d 44, 45. A \u201creasonable effort\u201d must have been made to warn passengers of the restriction. <em>Lousararian v. Royal Caribbean Corp. </em>(C.A.1, 1991), 951 F.2d 7, 8; <em>Silvestri v. Italia Societa Per Anzioni Di Navigazione </em>(C.A.2, 1968), 388 F.2d 11; <em>DeNicola v. Cunard Line, Ltd. </em>(C.A.1, 1981), 642 F.2d 5; and <em>Barbachym, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The specific inquiry into whether a sea carrier has met the standard of reasonableness is set forth in .the following two-pronged test:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u201cFirst, a court must examine the facial clarity of the ticket contract and whether its language and appearance make the relevant provisions sufficiently obvious and understandable. The second prong focuses on the \u2018circumstances of the passenger\u2019s possession of and familiarity with the ticket,\u2019 which involves scrutiny of \u2018any extrinsic factors indicating the passenger\u2019s ability to become meaningfully informed of the contractual terms at stake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lousararian, supra, </em>951 F.2d at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The reasonableness of a passage ticket in particular circumstances is a question of law, the determination of which, barring a genuine issue of material fact, is appropriate for resolution at the summary judgment stage. <em>Id.; DeNicola, Spataro, </em>and <em>Barbachym, supra. </em>A material fact is one \u201cthat might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 211; see, also, <em>Duke v. Sanymetal Products Co. </em>(1972), 31 Ohio App.2d 78, 81, 60 O.O.2d 171, 172-173, 286 N.E.2d 324, 327. An issue is \u201cgenuine\u201d if a rational trier of fact could find for the opponent on the evidence presented. <em>Anderson, supra. </em>A motion for summary judgment forces the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus. The nonmoving party must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson, <em>supra, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d at 211. The inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in the depositions and affidavits must be construed in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46; <em>Aglinsky v. Cleveland Builders Supply Co. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 810, 814, 589 N.E.2d 1365, 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In the present case, we conclude that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact which would preclude summary judgment in favor of Princess Cruises. Initially, appellants attack the sample passage ticket as insufficient because Van Hyning\u2019s affidavit does not state that the sample passage ticket is an exact copy of the one given to appellants. Rather, Van Hyning averred that the attached passage ticket \u201cis an example of the ticket of passage issued to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>[appellants] by Princess Cruises, Inc.\u201d Further, Van Hyning averred that \u201cPrincess Cruises, Inc. forwards the passage ticket to all passengers prior to the voyage.\u201d In opposition, Mrs. Roszak does not aver that she did not receive the passage ticket. Instead, Mrs. Roszak avers that her \u201centire ticket was delivered to me by my travel agency in an opaque envelope provided by the agency.\u201d She also admits she did not read the ticket. Appellants\u2019 mere assertions that Mrs. Roszak did not read the passage ticket does not raise a material issue of fact, nor does it dispute Van Hyning\u2019s affidavit that the sample passage ticket was \u201can example\u201d of the ticket issued to appellants. See <em>Lousararian, supra; </em>and <em>Kientzler v. Sun Line Greece Special Shipping Co., Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y.1991), 779 F.Supp. 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Appellants next assert that the passage ticket did not sufficiently place appellants on notice of its terms and conditions. Appellants contend that the notice is not sufficiently \u201cconspicuous\u201d or \u201ceye-catching.\u201d See <em>Silvestri, supra, </em>388 F.2d at 18. However, a mere examination of the ticket in question refutes appellants\u2019 assertions. The first three pages of the passage ticket, in red ink, provide an \u201cimportant notice\u201d that the \u201cticket includes the passage contract terms on the succeeding pages which are binding on you. Please read them carefully.\u201d The passage contract notice provision herein is sufficiently similar to those found to be reasonably communicative in <em>Lousararian, Kientzler, Spataro, DeNicola, </em>and <em>Lubick</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Appellants next argue that the passage contract does not apply to injuries sustained while aboard a launch boat. However, the ticket includes a \u201claunch\u201d boat 'within its definition of \u201ccarrier.\u201d Accordingly, appellants\u2019 contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Finally, appellants argue that because Mrs. Roszak\u2019s affidavit avers that the passage ticket was delivered inside an opaque ticket jacket and that the passage ticket was surrendered to the ticket collector, a material issue of fact exists regarding actual notice of the contractual terms. However, appellants do not assert that the ticket was never delivered. In fact, Mrs. Roszak admits it was delivered. She further admits that she did not read the passage ticket. \u201cProvisions that appear on the ticket as part of the contract of passage embodied in the ticket are binding regardless of whether they were read by the passenger, provided they are not unlawful in content.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Furness, Withy &amp; Co., Ltd. </em>(W.D.N.Y.1951), 103 F.Supp. 314, 316. The passenger\u2019s possession of and familiarity with the ticket does not depend on actual knowledge of the terms in the contract of passage, but focuses instead on the opportunity for such knowledge. <em>Lousararian, supra, </em>951 F.2d at 11. Under the present circumstances, we conclude appellants had sufficient opportunity to read the passage ticket and gain-familiarity with its terms. Appellants admit having received the passage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ticket, but state it was not read by Mrs, Roszak. Appellants offer no evidence tending to show that Mrs. Roszak was not afforded an opportunity to read the passage ticket contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We therefore conclude the trial court did not err in granting Princess Cruises\u2019 motion for summary judgment and overrule appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-7\">Patton, P.J., Blackmon and Nugent, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\">. Although appellants do not raise the issue of the trial court\u2019s failure to rule on their motion to strike appellee\u2019s reply brief as an assignment of error, see App.R. 12(A), appellants, in their brief, contended it was inappropriate for the trial court to grant appellee's motion for summary judgment since appellee\u2019s reply brief was filed in violation of Loc.R. 11. Loc.R. 11(D) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\"Reply or additional briefs upon motions and submissions may be filed with leave of court only upon a showing of good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">It is well settled that motions not ruled on prior to final judgment are deemed overruled upon entering final judgment. <em>Solon v. Solon Baptist Temple, Inc. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 347, 8 OBR 458, 457 N.E.2d 858; <em>Frieden v. Frieden </em>(June 14, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 57032, unreported, 1990 WL 82299. Thus, appellant\u2019s motion to strike was implicitly overruled. Additionally, while it could be argued that under <em>Solon </em>appellee\u2019s motion for leave was also implicitly overruled, the trial court clearly did not intend to overrule it. See journal entry granting appellee\u2019s motion for leave. In any event, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering appellee\u2019s reply brief. Any error in filing the reply brief without leave of court is therefore harmless. See, <em>e.g., Stewart v. Academy of Medicine </em>(Apr. 18, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 48932, unreported, 1985 WL 7989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">.
