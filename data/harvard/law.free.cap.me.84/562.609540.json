One who wilfully deposits more than one vote during the same balloting for a town officer is guilty of an offense for -which he may be indicted and tried, and, if found guilty, be punished by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court. So held in <em>Com. </em>v. Silsbee, 9 Mass. 417. And we think it is equally an offense for one to so vote for a school district officer at a school district meeting. It is equally corrupt, equally a fraud, and should receive the same punishment. We think the' indictment in this case is good, that the demurrer thereto was. properly overruled, and that the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b583-6\">Peters, C.
