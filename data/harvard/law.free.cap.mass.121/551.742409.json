Answer, a general denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Bacon, J., the plaintiff put in evidence the docket record of the proceedings in the action in which the judgment was recovered, and also the papers in the case, the record not having been extended. It appeared that execution had been issued on the judgment, but not returned into court; but there was no evidence introduced by the plaintiff to show what had been done by virtue of the execution, or of any proceedings thereon, nor was any evidence introduced to show its loss or to give any account thereof. The judge thereupon ruled that the plaintiff could not recover; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-8\"><em>B.
