Evidence was offered of the value of the estate left as the homestead, not denying that, if the respondent\u2019s objections to the report were removed, that valu\u00e9 would be at least eight hundred dollars. All of which offers of evidence were severally refused by the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-4\">The respondent further asked the judge to rule that the report of partition should not be accepted and confirmed, because there was no allegation in said report by the commissioners that they had excepted, as homestead for the respondent, property to the value of eight hundred dollars, or that the rights and property, excepted as homestead for the respondent, were of the value of eight hundred dollars; and further, that said report should not be accepted because a certain provision was inserted, in the exception of the property and rights given to the respondent in said report, which was as follows : \u201c Also the southeasterly portion of the cellar as the same is now partitioned off, and a right to enter and use such portion of the cellar by building and using a stairway under the present front stairs of the main house.\u201d These requests the judge refused, and ordered the report to be accepted and confirmed. The respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-5\"><em>A. </em>6r. <em>Biscoe, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-6\"><em>W.

The evidence offered may have been rejected simply because, assuming all the facts which it tended to prove, no cause was shown, in the discretion of the court, for recommitting the report. The estate described as a homestead is to be presumed to have been of the value of $800, according to the statute. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>104.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
