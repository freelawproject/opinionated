At the time of the purchase the defendant was, and so stated to the plaintiff, the agent, for the sale of passage tickets, of one Sheahan of the city of New York, who was the general agent of the company. By the printed terms of the ticket it was to hold good for one year, and it was further agreed and understood that, if the ticket should be returned unused, within that time, the money paid therefor should be refunded. Ten months after the purchase of the ticket, the plaintiff, called upon the defendant and told him that she had received word from those, to whom she had sent the ticket, that they could not use it until the following March, and asked him if it would hold good until then. The defendant replied that the ticket should hold good until then, and that, if it was not then used, he would refund the money to her when she brought back the ticket. The ticket was never used. Subsequently to March the plaintiff often conferred with the defendant upon the matter, in all of which instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the defendant promised to refund the money when she brought back the ticket. Soon afterwards the plaintiff returned the ticket, but the defendant did not refund the money but promised to do so, and has often so promised since, saying at one or more times that he already had eighty dollars of it in his possession. For some time there had been a litigation between the defendant and Sheahan concerning the accounts between them, since the beginning of which the defendant has promised to pay the money to the plaintiff when he obtained it from Sheahan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">If upon these facts the plaintiff had a good cause of action against the defendant, judgment was to be rendered accordingly; otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-5\"><em>J F.
