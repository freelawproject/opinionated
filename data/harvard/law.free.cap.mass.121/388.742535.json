He had the debtor before a magistrate who had authority to act in such a case. The District Court and the justice thereof have the same jurisdiction, power and authority as police courts and the justices thereof under the Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>124, \u00a7 9, and the St. of 1872, <em>c. </em>200, \u00a7 1. Having authority to act in the case, it is to be presumed that he acted under that authority, and that the court was not in session at the time, notwithstanding the form of the certificate. <em>Richardson </em>v.
