Dexter, of Edgartown, and deputy sheriff of Dukes County.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-9\">The writ was served by the sheriff; and the bond to the defendant, taken and returned by him, purported in the body thereof to be made by \u201c Howard M. Smith, infant, by his next friend Edward T. T. Smith, as principal,\u201d and by two sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>At the first term, the defendant filed a demurrer, assigning the following reasons therefor: \u201c1. That the description of personal property in the writ is too vague, uncertain and indefinite ; that it is not in conformity to law, and is insufficient in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-4\">\u201c 2. Because the officer serving the writ had no authority in law to serve the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">\u201c 3. Because no valid bond was taken by the officer in serving the writ, as required by law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">The plaintiff afterwards filed the following paper: \u201c Plaintiff\u2019s answer to causes of demurrer assigned by defendant: And now the plaintiff comes by Ms counsel and answers, and says that he denies the several causes of demurrer to the writ and declaration and the service thereof, and denies that any cause of demurrer exists against the same as the defendant hath alleged, and hereby takes issue upon the same, and affirms in answer to the same: 1. That the description of personal property in the writ is not vague, uncertain and indefinite.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">\u201c 2.

The plaintiff requested the judge to rule that the bond given in the action was a proper bond and given in conformity to law, and that the sheriff who served the replevin writ in the action upon the defendant therein, who was one of his deputies and had attached the property replevied upon a writ of Brown against Smith, pending in the Superior Court, and-so held it at the time of the replevin, had, at the time of such service, legal right to serve the same upon the defendant, and that the service upon the replevin writ in the action was a good service of the writ upon the defendant aforesaid, and made in conformity to law. The judge declined to so rule, but ruled that the bond was insufficient in law, and that the sheriff who served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the writ had no authority in law to serve the same, and sustained the defendant\u2019s demurrer upon the second and third grounds.
