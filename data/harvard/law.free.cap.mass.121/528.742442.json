Rollins, the defendant\u2019s testator, towards the erection of a chapel for the plaintiff. Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before <em>Pitman, </em>J., who allowed the following bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-8\">\u201c It appeared that said church was organized in the manner shown by the records, and the trustees of the same chosen April 5, 1871, and said Rollins was chosen the treasurer of said trustees, and said church was reorganized, on account of some flaw in the organization, in August, 1872, with the same board of trustees\u2014all of which appears in said records,\u201d but is not material to be particularly stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-9\">\u201c In April, 1871, after said organization, an informal meeting of persons interested in building a chapel for said church was held at the house of said Rollins, of which certain persons acted as chairman and secretary. A subscription was thereupon opened to see how much could be raised for that purpose. Various persons announced their willingness to give different sums, and the secretary, at the time, in their presence and with their knowledge, wrote down their names, and the amounts so promised by each opposite thereto. Rollins was one of those so promising. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and said that his name might be put down for $500. He after-wards within a short time acknowledged and ratified such subscription orally. Being treasurer of the trustees, he also received some payments from individuals on account of such subscriptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\">\u201c Some months after this meeting, and long before August, 1872, some trouble arose between Rollins and the other members, and Rollins at their request withdrew from the office of treasurer, and thereafterwards voluntarily ceased all participation in the affairs of the society, except that he remained one of its trustees until the end of the year for which he was chosen, and was present at the reorganization in August, 1872. No demand was made on him for payment. He died in March, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">\u201c The chapel was built before Rollins\u2019s death, by and for the use of the plaintiff. There was conflicting evidence as to whether anything was done, or any liability incurred or obligation assumed, by the plaintiff in reliance upon the subscription of Rollins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">\u201c The defendant contended that nothing was done, nor any liability or obligation incurred or assumed, by the plaintiff in reliance upon the subscription of Rollins; that there was no consideration for the promise, and that the plaintiff was not the party to maintain this action; and asked the court so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">\u201c But the court, without passing upon the question of fact, whether the plaintiff, relying upon the subscription of Rollins, had done anything or incurred or assumed any liability or obligation, ruled that upon the facts above stated there was a sufficient consideration for the promise of Rollins, and that the plaintiff was the proper party to bring the action, and accordingly found for the plaintiff. The defendant excepts to these rulings.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-8\"><em>J. W. </em>Hammond, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-9\"><em>D.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adc\">The performance of gratuitous promises depends wholly upon the good will which prompted them, and will not be enforced by the law. The general rule is that, in order to support an action, the promise must have been made upon a legal consideration moving from the promisee to the promisor, <em>Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>107 Mass. 37. To constitute such con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>sideration, there must be either a benefit to the maker of the promise, or a loss, trouble or inconvenience to, or a charge or obligation resting upon, the party to whom the promise is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">A promise to pay money to promote the objects for which a corporation is established falls within the general rule. In every case, in which this court has sustained an action upon a promise of this description, the promisee\u2019s acceptance of the defendant\u2019s promise was shown, either by express vote or contract, assuming a liability or obligation, legal or equitable, or else by some unequivocal act, such as advancing or expending money, or erecting a building, in accordance with the terms of the contract, and upon the faith of the defendant\u2019s promise. <em>Fisher </em>v. Ellis, 3 Pick. 322. <em>Bryant </em>v. Goodnow, 5 Pick. 228. <em>Amherst Academy </em>v. <em>Cowls, </em>6 Pick. 427. <em>Williams College </em>v. Danforth, 12 Pick. 541. <em>Thompson </em>v. Page, 1 Met. 565. <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>6 Met. 310. <em>Watkins </em>v. Eames, 9 Cush. 537. <em>Mirick </em>v. <em>French, </em>2 Gray, 420. <em>Ladies' Collegiate Institute </em>v. French, 16 Gray, 196. <em>Athol Music Hall Co. </em>v. Carey, 116 Mass. 471. To the latter class belongs <em>Hanson Trustees </em>v. Stetson, 5 Pick. 506, in which the subscriptions were to increase a ministerial fund, and the court \u201c found it a fact agreed \u201d (whether in the case stated, or by counsel at the argument, does not clearly appear by the report) \u201c that, in consequence of the accumulation of the fund by these means, the great purpose, viz., the settlement of a minister, has been effected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Where one promises to pay another a certain sum of money for doing a particular thing, which is to be done before the money is paid, and the promisee does the thing, upon the faith of the promise, the promise, which was before a mere revocable offer, thereby becomes a complete contract, upon a consideration moving from the promisee to the promisor; as in the ordinary case of an offer of reward. <em>Freeman </em>v. Boston, 5 Met. 56. <em>Loring </em>v. Boston, 7 Met. 409. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>National Security </em>Bank, 107 Mass., 45, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The suggestion in 5 Pick. 508, substantially repeated in 6 Met. 316, and in 9 Cush. 539, that \u201c it is a sufficient consideration, that others were led to subscribe by the very subscription of the defendant,\u201d was in each case but <em>obiter </em>dictum, and appears to us to be inconsistent with elementary principles. Similar promises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of third persons to the plaintiff may he a consideration for agreements between those persons and the defendant; but as they confer no benefit upon the defendant, and impose no charge or obligation upon the plaintiff, they constitute no legal consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The facts in the present .case show no benefit to the defendant, and no vote or contract by the plaintiff, and, although it appears that the chapel was afterwards built by the plaintiff, it is expressly stated in the bill of exceptions that the learned judge who presided at the trial did not pass upon the question of fact whether the plaintiff had, in reliance upon the promise sued on, done anything or incurred or assumed any liability or' obligation. \u25a0 It does not therefore appear that there was any legal consideration for the promise upon which this action is brought. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
