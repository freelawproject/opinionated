M. Andrews, the only party defending, introduced evidence tending to prove that there was no consideration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>note. The plaintiff then offered evidence tending to prove that he, some time in May, 1868, lent the defendants $475, which was the consideration of the note declared on, and then put in the testimony of one Symonds, the treasurer of the Salem Savings Bank, tending to prove that the plaintiff had money deposited in the Salem Savings Bank, and that some time in March, 1868, it was withdrawn by his mother. The mother testified that in March, 1868, on the order of the plaintiff, she drew from the said savings bank the sum of $475, which she immediately sent to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">It appeared that the plaintiff was a clerk in the employ of the defendants on wages, and the evidence in question was offered and admitted to explain and corroborate his testimony in his deposition as to having in his possession the funds which he claimed to have lent the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-5\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the first named defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-6\"><em>O.

The evidence objected to does not appear to have been admitted for any other purpose than to show that the plaintiff had money which he might have lent to the defendants. If the defendants denied that the plaintiff had such money, this evidence was competent. If not, it was immaterial. The bill of exceptions does not show that the defendants could have been prejudiced by its admission. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
