On demand, for value received, I promise to pay Edwin F.

The defendant asked the judge to rule that the note was void in law, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover thereon, because the note was made and delivered on Sunday. But the judge declined so to rule, and gave judgment for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b24-13\"><em>A. J.

The note having been made and delivered in the State of New York, and not appearing to be payable elsewhere, its validity depended on the law of that state. <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>109 Mass. 378. What that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>law was, was a question of fact, upon which no evidence appears to have been given at the trial, or can be introduced for the first time at the argument of the exceptions in this court. <em>Knapp </em>v. Abell, 10 Allen, 485. The contract was not void by the common law; and there is no presumption that the law of another state corresponds with a statute of this Commonwealth. <em>Abell </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>4 Denio, 305. <em>Whitford </em>v. <em>Panama Railroad, </em>23 N.
