Sts. <em>c. </em>160, \u00a7 28, charging that the defendant, at a time and place named, maliciously threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>to accuse one Joseph H. Robinson of the crime of an indecent assault upon the wife of the defendant, with the intent then and thereby to extort money from Robinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Putnam, J., it appeared in evidence on behalf of the government, that the defendant said to Robinson, substantially as follows: \u201cYou made an indecent assault upon my wife, and I will prosecute you unless you pay me seventy-five dollars.\u201d On behalf of the defendant the evidence was that he said to Robinson substantially as follows : \u201c You made an indecent assault upon my wife, and I want satisfaction; \u201d that thereupon Robinson said to him \u201c What can I do for you ? \u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201c I will charge you seventy-five dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">The defendant offered his wife as a witness, for the purpose of showing by her the truth of the accusation made by him against Robinson, as tending to prove that the charge was not made by him maliciously. The judge excluded this evidence, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-6\"><em>J.

If Robinson had in fact made such an assault upon the defendant\u2019s wife, the defendant might lawfully demand reparation. If the wrong which he offered to prove had in fact been committed, the demand which the defendant made for payment may have been without the intent to extort money, necea - saiy to constitute the crime alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
