Subsequently it was found that she had no authority to bind the estate, and his executors commenced an action against these defendants to recover the amount of the note payable to him. That action went to judgment, which was recovered on October 10, 1873, and the execution, which issued November 1, 1873, was satisfied by the defendants, out of their own funds, and without calling or intending to call upon the religious society for reimbursement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">The judge, at the request of the plaintiff, ruled that these facts, if proved, would not constitute a defence to the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and directed a verdict for the plaintiff, which was rendered; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-4\"><em>W.
