The witness was then asked what he seized. It appeared that he had made a return upon the warrant. The defendant objected to any evidence of what was done except by the return. The judge permitted the witness to state what he found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-4\">The government then offered evidence tending to prove that over the store 291 Federal Street there was a sign of \u201c 291.

The defendant objected to the introduction of the sign at that stage of the case; but the judge admitted the evidence, the district attorney stating that he proposed to show that the defendant kept the place. Evidence was afterwards offered by the government, tending to show that the defendant was the proprietor of the place. It was contended by the defendant, and there was evidence tending to show, that the premises consisted of two stores divided by a partition with a door in it connecting the two stores ; that the defendant carried on a grocery store at the part nearest to Summer Street.
