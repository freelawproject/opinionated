All the earth above the grade line between Cherry Street and the Hopkinton Railroad tracks, excepting such portions of said earth as shall be required on the line of said way to bring the work up or to the grade line, is to be removed across the railroad tracks and discharged within the bounds of or width of fifty feet in a straight line from railroad tracks, and also from Cherry Street, and to bring the surplus filling up to a level with said railroad tracks, and to be continued in like manner so far as the material will go.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\">\u201c Second.

Charles H. Tilton made application to the court to have the entry stricken off, and the action brought forward for trial, contending that he had an assignment of the sum due to the plaintiff, and that the settlement was made in fraud of his rights. The court so ordered, and the action was tried on the question whether Tilton had such an assignment, and whether the selectmen had notice thereof. Tilton introduced in evidence the following paper, under seal, signed by the plaintiff, and dated June 21, 1873 :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-11\">\u201c Know all men by these presents, that I, Francis Cutler, in consideration of eight hundred dollars to me paid by Charles H. Tilton, do hereby assign and set over the obligation hereto annexed, signed by Warren Morse, Willard Aldrich, Road Commissioners for Ashland, Mass., bearing date A. D. 1873, and all moneys now due and to become due thereon, unto the said Charles H. Tilton, his executors, administrators and assigns, not holding myself liable for the payment of the same ; the losses, if any, and the recovery thereof in my name, or otherwise to his use to be wholly at the risk of the said Charles H. <em>Tilton; </em>and I hereby authorize the said Tilton, on the receipt of moneys due on said obligation, to execute and give full receipts and discharge therefor in my name.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>There was evidence tending to show that this assignment was made for a valuable consideration, subsequently to the papers signed by the commissioners; that the error in the date was a mistake; and that all the papers were annexed to the agreement, when delivered to Tilton. There was conflicting evidence as to the notice to the selectmen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-4\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that Tilton had no assignment of any sum due from the town to Cutler. The judge refused so to rule, and ruled that the assignment was sufficient in form to assign the debt due from the town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b609-6\"><em>T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A16\">The assignment by the nominal plaintiff to the real plaintiff was of \u201c the obligation hereto annexed, signed by Warren Morse, Willard Aldrich, Road Commissioners for Ash-land, Mass.,\u201d and of \u201c all moneys now due and to become due thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The obligation thus identified was a contract, not under seal, purporting to be a \u201c specification for building a town way in Ashland,\u201d \u201c as by the road commissioners reported to and allowed by the town at a meeting held the 27th day of August,\u201d and providing that the road should be built in a certain time and manner, and \u201c to the satisfaction and acceptance of the road commissioners of Ashland,\u201d and that the price (the amount of which was not mentioned, but had previously been fixed by agreement between the contractor and the road commissioners, acting under authority of the town, at $800) should be paid at certain times named therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The contract does not contain any express promise, either of the town, or of the road commissioners, to make such payment. But the subject and the terms of the contract clearly show that it is made on behalf of the town. And the signature is to the same effect, just as if the words had been transposed, thus: \u201c For Ashland, Mass., Warren Morse, Willard Aldrich, Road Commissioners.\u201d The contract must therefore be considered, according to the intention of the parties as manifested upon its face, to be the contract of the town, and not the personal con \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tract of Morse and Aldrich. <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>16 Mass. 461. <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Lee Congregational Society, </em>8 Allen, 460, 463. <em>Tucker Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>98 Mass. 101, 104, 105. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>106 Mass. 561. <em>Rathbon </em>v. <em>Budlong, </em>15 Johns. 1. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Estes, </em>2 Fairf. 267. <em>Deslandes </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>2 El.&amp; El. 602. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sizer, L. </em>R. 4 Ex, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The memorandum, afterwards appended to the contract before the assignment, and forming part of it as delivered to the assignee, is not to be construed as a separate instrument, but as an addition to, and explanation of, the contract as first drawn up; and, so construed, (whatever might be its operation if of itself a distinct and complete agreement,) likewise bound the town and not the commissioners personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>23 Pick. 120, the contract contained an express promise by the committee, and was signed by their individual names, without more. In <em>Tippets </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>4 Mass. 595, and in <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>West Brookfield, </em>9 Allen, 1, the contract was under seal, and could not, by the stricter and more technical rules which govern such instruments, have effect as the deed of the corporation, because there were no words in the body thereof expressing any agreement in its behalf. Those cases are thus distinguished from the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">For these reasons, we concur in opinion with the Superior Court, that the assignment was sufficient in form to assign the debt due from the town. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
