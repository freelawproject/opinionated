It inserts the usual exception in the covenant to deliver up the premises in good order at the end of the <em>term; </em>and contains the usual proviso that, in case the premises shall, during the term, be destroyed by fire, \u201c the rent hereinbefore reserved \u201d \u201c shall be suspended or abated \u201d until the premises shall have been put by the lessor in proper condition for use and habitation, or, at his election, the lease shall be determined. This proviso for an abatement of rent extends as well to the case of the lessor\u2019s electing to determine the lease, as to the case of his rebuilding. \u201c The rent hereinbefore reserved \u201d can apply to nothing but the rent previously mentioned as having been paid in advance; and the only way of abating such rent is by the lessee\u2019s recovering back a proportionate part thereof.
