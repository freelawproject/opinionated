The railroad of the respondent had been in operation several years before the location of the petitioner\u2019s railroad, and crossed at grade a certain highway in the town of Berlin. The petitioner located its road over and across the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>near said grade crossing, and over and across the highway, and established the grade of its railroad about twenty feet above the railroad of the respondent and above the highway, crossing the railroad and highway by means of a bridge resting upon stone piers and abutments; one or more of the piers being upon the respondent\u2019s land near the grade crossing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-3\">The respondent offered evidence, the form of which evidence, if competent, was not objected to, as follows: Until the erection of the piers by the petitioner, the respondent had operated its railroad, and had run trains across the grade crossing safely and without accident. The crossing was a reasonably safe one, and the view up and down the respondent\u2019s railroad was free and unobstructed to travellers upon the highway when approaching the crossing. No flagman had ever been employed at the crossing, and there had been no necessity for a flagman at the point, and no request had been made by any one for such flagman. By the erection of the piers the view of travellers on the highway up and down the respondent\u2019s railroad was greatly obstructed, and the crossing was thereby rendered unsafe and dangerous without a flagman, both to the public and to the respondent in the use of its road. The selectmen of Berlin by due process of law requested the respondent in writing to station a flagman at the crossing, stating in their request that the crossing had been rendered unsafe by reason of the erection of the piers, and that their request was made by reason thereof. Upon application to the county commissioners by said selectmen, the commissioners, after due notice to the respondent, but without notice to the present petitioner, decided that the stationing of such flagman was necessary for the security of the public, and the respondent thereupon, before the filing of the original petition to the county commissioners for the assessment of damages, stationed a flagman at the crossing and has ever since maintained one at great expense, and will be compelled to employ a flagman constantly in the future, by reason of the erection and maintenance of the piers. The respondent sought to recover damages by reason of the necessity of the employment of the flagman. The above facts offered in evidence were alleged in the petition of the respondent to the county commissioners, and were proved to their satisfaction, and they awarded damages therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The petitioner objected to the admission of any and all of the above evidence, on the ground that it was immaterial and incompetent, and contended that the petitioner was not liable to compensate the respondent for the alleged injury, and that the same did not constitute an element of damages. The presiding judge so ruled and excluded the whole of the testimony, and the parties thereupon submitted to a verdict of the jury, awarding damages to the respondent, to the amount of $108, the agreed value of said land. The respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b144-4\"><em>G. A.

Their order requiring the flagman in this case cannot affect the measure of damages, because it may be changed by them at any time, and because it was made since the time of the location of the new railroad, by relation to which the damages must be assessed. The claim in question cannot be allowed consistently with the decisions already referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
