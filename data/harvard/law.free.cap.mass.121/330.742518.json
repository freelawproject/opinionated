The corporation accepted the lease and entered upon and occupied the demised premises. Subsequently the defendant signed a guaranty to secure the payment of rent and taxes under the lease and the performance of the covenants contained in it. <em>Held, </em>that he was liable on his guaranty for rent and taxes due from the corporation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-11\">Contract.

Witness my hand and seal this eighth day of October, 1873. W. A. Gordon. [Seal.] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">The declaration then set forth an account in detail of the rent and taxes due, alleged demand on the Cumberland Stone Company, and notice of the non-payment thereof to the defendant, and that the defendant owed the plaintiffs the several sums set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">The defendant demurred, on the ground that the declaration did not state any cause of action against the defendant; and \u201c the defendant, for specification of the particulars in which said defects exist, says that the copy of the alleged lease as set forth in said declaration does not show that such lease was ever signed or executed by the Cumberland Stone Company, the alleged lessee, or by any person for or in behalf of said company. And so it does not appear by the plaintiff\u2019s declaration that there was any existing covenant, contract or liability, to or iipon which the alleged guaranty of the defendant applied or took effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">In the Superior Court, the demurrer was overruled, judgment was entered for the plaintiffs; and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-7\">6r. <em>3. </em>Kingsbury, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-8\"><em>A. </em>Kemenway, for the plaintiffs, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-9\">Endicott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aim\">The agreement purports to be a lease, entered into by the plaintiffs and the Cumberland Stone Company, wherein the plaintiffs are the lessors and the company the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>It is executed by the plaintiffs and by William A. Gordon, the defendant. There are no words to indicate in what capacity or in whose behalf Gordon signed it. But the declaration alleges that the company accepted it, and entered at once into occupation of the premises described in the lease, and continued in occupation under the lease at the date of the writ. These allegations are admitted by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Whatever may have been the defects in the original execution of the lease, the company, having treated it as a contract between the plaintiffs and itself, by entering upon and occupying the premises, was bound by its provisions, and became liable to pay the rent and taxes therein stipulated. <em>Lamson &amp; Goodnow Manuf. Co. </em>v. Russell, 112 Mass. 387. The guaranty, therefore, by the defendant, signed soon after the execution of the lease, related to a valid contract subsisting between the parties, and this action may be maintained against him for the rent and taxes due from the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The demurrer does not raise any question as to the due execution of the lease by the plaintiffs, and that question is not open to the defendant. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
