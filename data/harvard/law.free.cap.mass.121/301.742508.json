Haven and Kate Haven were then employed by him, and that their mother lived in a tenement over the plaintiff\u2019s shop in Lynn; that Michael had, among other duties, the care of the plaintiff\u2019s horses, which were kept at the plaintiff\u2019s stable in Lynn, connected with his shop; and that the general housework in the plaintiff\u2019s family, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the cooking, was done by Kate; that on Saturday evening, April 25, Kate went to Lynn to attend a fair, and visit her mother, and missed the train to Swampscott, by which she had intended to return that night to the plaintiff\u2019s house ; that she had no permission from the plaintiff to be absent during the night, and was expected by him to return that evening; that she was informed that the next train was late and that it was doubtful about its coming at all, and, as it was then damp and rainy, she concluded to stay at the house of her mother during the night; and, as it was late, she thought it more convenient to stay and go to her place of work in the morning, and she stopped at her mother\u2019s as a matter of convenience, her house being near the station; that on the next morning, it being Sunday, Michael took the plaintiff\u2019s horse and carriage, and carried Kate to the plaintiff\u2019s house in Swampscott from his place of business in Lynn; that they started at about ten minutes before six in the morning, there being then several inches of wet snow on the ground, and went directly through Union Street to the plaintiff\u2019s house, where Michael left Kate and returned directly to Lynn; that while on his way returning to the plaintiff\u2019s stable in Lynn, and while he was in Union Street, the injury occurred; and that the special object and purpose of their travelling and going to Swampscott at that time was that Kate might prepare the breakfast that morning for the plaintiff\u2019s family and attend to his housework.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-4\">.Upon this evidence, the judge ruled that the said travelling on the Lord\u2019s day was not a work of necessity or charity, within the Gen.
