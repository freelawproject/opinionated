J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFS\">The power conferred by the Legislature upon</p>\n<p id=\"A1j\">the city council to pass by-laws and ordinances is limited to such as are reasonable, and the penalties prescribed by which do not exceed twenty dollars for one offence. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>16 Pick. 121. St. 1836, <em>c. </em>42, \u00a7 20. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>18, \u00a7 11; <em>c. </em>19, \u00a7 2. A by-law or ordinance, imposing a penalty which may exceed this limit, is beyond the power conferred by the Legislature, un \u25a0 reasonable, and wholly void. The ordinance before us undertakes to authorize the imposition of a penalty of not less than one dollar, nor more than five dollars, for every hour that a person shall keep his wagon in the market, without authority of the clerk of the market, after notice to remove and until actual removal. The offence thus punished is a single continuous offence; and the ordinance, affixing a penalty which, computed according to its terms, may exceed twenty dollars for a single offence upon one and the same day, is void. <em>Mayor, \u00bf-a. of New York </em>v. <em>Ordrenan, </em>12 Johns. 122. It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other objections to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
