The record of the action of Caldwell and another against Healey and trustee was in evidence, by which it appeared that the plaintiffs recovered judgment against the principal defendant; that the trustee was discharged, and, as well as a claimant of the funds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>was awarded costs. The judge ruled that as the trustee was discharged in the Police Court, the claimant of the funds in its hands having prevailed, there had been no breach of the condition of the bond, and found for the defendants.

The plaintiffs, having declared upon the bond in this form, has no ground of exception. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
