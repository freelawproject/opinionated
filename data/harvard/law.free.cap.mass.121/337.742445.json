Woods <em>vs. </em>City of Boston.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b355-4\">Suffolk.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AAJ\">November 16. \u2014 22, 1876.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"APlu\">Ames &amp; Lord, JJ., absent.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b355-5\">At the trial of an action for injuries caused by a defect in a highway, it appeared that the plaintiff, on the afternoon of a bright and pleasant day, stepped into a hole in the sidewalk and was injured, and that there was no ice or snow upon the sidewalk. The plaintiff testified that, at the time, she was not looking at the sidewalk, and that, if she had seen the hole, she should have stepped past it. <em>Held, </em>that the question, whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care, was rightly submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">Tort for personal injuries sustained by reason of a defect in a highway, which the defendant was bound to keep in repair.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">At the trial in this court, before Lord, J., it appeared that, at the time of the accident, the plaintiff, who lived in East Boston, was walking, on her way to take the ferry at the foot of Eastern Avenue; that she came down Fleet Street, crossed Commercial Street, and stepped upon the brick sidewalk at or near the corner of Eastern Avenue ; that she then thought she saw her husband upon Commercial Street in a northerly direction, and took a few steps upon Commercial Street in that direction, but, becoming convinced she was in error, she turned around, retraced her steps to the corner of Eastern Avenue, turned the corner, took a few steps down Eastern Avenue, stepped into the alleged defect, fell, and injured her ankle; that this happened at about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of a bright and pleasant day, there being no snow or ice upon the sidewalk, which was about ten feet in width. The evidence as to the size and nature of the alleged defect, and of its position on the sidewalk, was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">The plaintiff, in answer to the question whether she knew of any reason why she did not see the place into which she stepped, testified as follows: \u201c I don\u2019t know any reason why, except I did n\u2019t expect it was there. I was n\u2019t looking at the sidewalk. I suppose I was looking at the ferry. It is most natural, if I was looking at it, I would most likely see it.\u201d She also testified: \u201cIf I had been looking on the sidewalk for the hole, I would have stepped past it. I don\u2019t think, if I saw it, I should have gone into it. I can\u2019t say why I was not looking at the side<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>walk. I know I was n\u2019t looking for an accident, or expecting it, until it came on to me. It came on to me like an\u25a0 earthquake. \u2019\u2019 The defendant requested the judge to rule that there was no evidence of due care on the part of the plaintiff at the time she met with the accident. The judge declined to give this instruction, but submitted the case to the jury under general instructions as to what would constitute due care, to which no exception was taken. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-4\"><em>R. M. Morse, Jr. O. P.

It cannot be said to appear conclusively that she was careless, because she failed to keep her eyes constantly upon the sidewalk before her. Whether she was in the exercise of that due care which persons of common prudence would exercise under like circumstances, was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>104 Mass. 137. <em>French </em>v. <em>Taunton Branch Railroad, </em>116 Mass. 537. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Seekonk, </em>119 Mass. 85. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Salem, ante, </em>294. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
