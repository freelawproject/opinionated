Welch, under whom both the plaintiff and the defendant claimed <em>title; </em>the plaintiff under a bill of sale from Welch, dated August 10, 1874, and the defendant under a bill of sale from Welch, dated October 8, 1874. There was evidence tending to show a delivery of the horse by Welch to the plaintiff. There was evidence tending to prove, and the judge found, that the defendant knew that the title and right of possession of the horse were in the plaintiff, and fraudulently sued out the writ of replevin for the purpose of obtaining possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>horse, and removing him from the Commonwealth, and depriving the plaintiff of him; and that he did, with that intent, obtain possession of the horse under the writ, and secretly remove him from the Commonwealth, and kept him concealed from the plaintiff. It was admitted that no demand had ever been made upon the defendant for the horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">On this evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that there was no evidence of conversion, and that the plaintiff could not maintain this action without evidence of a demand. But the judge declined so to rule, and ruled that upon this evidence there was evidence of conversion, and found that there was a conversion by the defendant, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\"><em>D. 0. </em>Allen, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-6\"><em>J.
