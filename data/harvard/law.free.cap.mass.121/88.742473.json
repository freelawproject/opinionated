The answer admitted that the sum, to which the defendants were limited by the statute, would be insufficient to pay the expenses of the highway and bridge, including the damage to private property, necessary for the same.

In the next section of the act they are authorized to take and appropriate, for the purposes of said highway and bridge, the private property of any persons or corporations, whose damages for such taking are to be assessed according to the rules applicable in the case of highways. In the third section, it is provided that \u201c the expense of the construction of the aforesaid highway, bridge and approaches,\u201d shall be paid in the first instance by the county of Franklin, and authority is given to the treasurer of that county to borrow money to an amount not exceeding the above named cum.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The plain meaning of these provisions is that the entire expense of the intended highway, bridge and suitable approaches is in no event to exceed the sum of forty-two thousand dollars.
