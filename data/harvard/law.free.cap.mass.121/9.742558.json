Such money therefore remained the property of the purchaser, his right to recover it depended upon the common law, and neither his property nor his right of action was affected by the repeal of the statute. The case is governed by <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>101 Mass. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
