Savage, during their natural lives, and, upon the decease of either of them, the principal of his or her share shall be equally divided among the heirs at law of such deceased persons.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\">The codicil, dated April 19, 1849, was as follows : \u201c I hereby revoke and annul the bequest and devise of the fifth part of the residue of my estate in trust for the benefit of the children of my late sister Catharine H. Savage, which is contained on the 3d page of my said last will, and substitute the following in the place of it, namely: And the other fifth part of the residue of my estate and property I give to John G. King of said Salem, my trustee in said will named, upon this trust, that he shall pay and divide the net income of said fifth part every year to and among Samuel Phillips Savage, Mrs. Jane C. De M. Thatcher and Sarah W. Savage, who are three of the children of my late sister Savage, during their natural lives; and upon the decease of either of them, the principal of his or her share shall be divided among the issue of such deceased person, and if he or she leave no issue, then among their heirs at law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">The bill alleged that Jane C. De M. Thatcher and Sarah W. Savage were dead, and their shares had been distributed; that Samuel Phillips Savage died on October 11, 1874; that he had two sons, George Savage and Henry Savage, and two grandchildren, George H. Savage and Emily K. Savage, children of Henry; that Henry and his two children were living at the time of the death of Samuel, and that George, as the trustee was informed and believed, had been absent from the Commonwealth for many years, and whether he was still living, or whether he had any children or issue living at the time of the decease of Samuel, the trustee was ignorant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">The question presented by the bill was whether Henry Savage was entitled to receive the entire principal of his father\u2019s share to the exclusion of his children, or whether the principal sum should be divided into three equal parts, and paid to Henry, George H. and Emily K. respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">The defendants appeared and filed answers, admitting the facts alleged in the bill, and alleging that George Savage died in China in 1861, leaving no children or issue. The answer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Henry Savage claimed the whole of the trust estate in the hands of the plaintiff. The answer of George H. and Emily K. Savage claimed each one third of the trust estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">The cause was heard upon the bill and answers by <em>Hndicott, </em>J., and reserved for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-5\"><em>A. L. Huntington, </em>for the grandchildren.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-6\"><em>A. S. Wheeler, </em>for Henry Savage.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b324-7\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqF\">In every case in which this testator by his will gave an estate for life, he gave the remainder over to the children of the life tenant, and in no case gave anything to the issue of such a child, otherwise than by providing that if the child had deceased, its issue should \u201c take the share of their deceased parent.\u201d In such a provision, the word \u201cissue\u201d would be limited to children. <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>7 Ves. 522. <em>Pruen </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>11 Sim. 132. And, by the devise for the benefit of the four children of his sister, Mrs. Savage, during their lives, \u201c and upon the decease of either of them, the principal of his or her share shall be equally divided among the heirs at law of such deceased person,\u201d the heirs would take <em>per stirpes, </em>according to the statute of distributions. <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>8 Met. 450. <em>Tilling-hast </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>9 Met. 143. Under either provision, the issue of a child still living would take nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The codicil is to be read in connection with, and as part of, the will, and is to receive the same construction, except so far as a different intention is clearly manifested, <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>11 Pick. 371. The inevitable inference is, that in the clause which substitutes, for the devise for the benefit of the four children of Mrs. Savage, a devise for the benefit of three of those children for life, \u201c and upon the decease of either of them, the principal of his or her share shall be divided among the issue of such deceased person, and if he or she leave no issue, then among their heirs at law,\u201d the testator intended that the word \u201cissue \u201d should be likewise limited to children, to the exclusion of the issue of a child still living. <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Edwards, 12 </em>Beav. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\n<em>Decree for Henry Savage.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
