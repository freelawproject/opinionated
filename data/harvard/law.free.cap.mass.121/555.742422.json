Plea, <em>nul disseisin. </em>Trial in the Superior Court, before Colburn, J., without a jury, who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-14\">Both parties claimed under George Taft. The demandants claimed under a warranty deed from Taft, dated September 10,1872, and recorded March 17, 1873; but it appeared that Taft continued in the occupation of the demanded premises as the apparent owner until after January 30, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The tenant put in evidence an attachment of the premises, made on January 30, 1873, in due form, in an action by him against Taft, the entry of the writ in court, and judgment in his favor, and claimed title under an execution and a levy thereunder, by virtue of said attachment. The levy was made on November 12, 1873. The execution was dated October 21, 1873, and recited that the tenant recovered judgment at the term of the Superior Court, held \u201c on the first Monday of September last, to wit, on the fourteenth day of October, A. D. 187 .\u201d The fees and expenses of the levy, as taxed by the officer who made it, and which were included in the amount for which it was made, were $52; of which the sum of $2.00 for recording was twice charged. There was evidence that the officer had only paid this sum once.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-4\">The demandants requested the judge to rule that the levy did not appear to have been made within thirty days after judgment, but that it did appear not to have been so made; and that the levy had been made for too large a sum and was therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">The judge refused so to rule, and ordered judgment for the tenant; and the demandants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-6\"><em>B.
