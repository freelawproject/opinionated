By said lease rent was payable on the last day of each and every month, for that month. On August 31, 1874, thirty-one days after entry, Evans filed in the registry of deeds for the county of Suffolk a sworn certificate of two \"witnesses of entry for the purpose of foreclosure, and the same was on that day recorded, and no other certificate was either made, filed or recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-4\">On August 1,1874, the rent for the month of July was paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs. From that time until October 28,1874, no rent, was paid to any one by or in behalf of the defendant. On October 6, 1874, Evans made an entry for the purpose of foreclosing the right of redemption under the mortgage and for the purpose of collecting the rents, and recorded the certificate thereof on October 8, 1874. The rents for the months of August and September were demanded of the defendant by the plaintiffs on October 15, 1874, and the defendant was at that time notified by the plaintiffs that they should hold him responsible therefor. The defendant had knowlege of the entry on October 6,1874. The defendant paid Evans the rents for August and September, on October 28, 1874, taking from him a written agreement to return them if the plaintiffs should ever recover the same of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">Upon these facts the plaintiffs asked the judge to rule that :he second entry was a waiver of the first entry. The judge declined so to rule, but held that as matter of law the second entry was not a waiver of the first entry, and on this ground found for the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-6\"><em>F. Groodwin F.
