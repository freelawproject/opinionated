Davis, of Boston, be, and he hereby is, appointed a trustee under the will of the said Seth Adams, deceased, of the residuary fund by said will devoted to a public charity, in place of the said Isaac Adams, who has declined to accept the said trust, with all the same powers, rights and duties as if he had been originally appointed one of the trustees under the said will; and the said James 0. Davis is ordered, before entering upon the duties of his trust, to give a bond, without sureties, in the sum of twenty thousand dollars to the judge of the Probate Court for the county of Middlesex, with condition for the faithful discharge of the duties of the said trust. And it is ordered that the said cause shall be retained for further directions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\">On August 18, 1876, the same judge made a precisely similar decree, appointing Aquila Adams a trustee in the place of Charles W. Cook.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">On December 5, 1876, the defendant claimed an appeal from these decrees, and .the attorney general and the two new trustees consented that the claim of appeal might be entered with the same effect \u201c as if it had been entered within thirty days from the date of each of said decrees ; \u201d and on December 7, <em>Ames, </em>J., ordered the appeal to be transmitted to the full court for hearing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-6\"><em>P.

Sts. <em>e. </em>113, \u00a7 8, any party, aggrieved by a final decree \u00f3f a single justice in equity, may take an appeal, within thirty days, by entering a claim of appeal upon the docket, and such appeal shall thereupon be pending before the full court. By \u00a7 10, \u201c from all interlocutory decrees made by a single justice, any party aggrieved may appeal, in like manner, <em>to </em>the full court.\u201d By \u00a7 11, \u201c all interlocutory decrees not appealed from shall be open to revision on appeals from final decrees, so far only as it appears to the full court that such final decrees are erroneously affected thereby.\u201d And by \u00a7 13, \u201ca party, having by accident or mistake omitted to claim an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>from \"any final decree, within the time allowed for that purpose,\u201d may obtain leave to appeal by petition to the full court within one year after the entry of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Whether the decree of a single justice is final or interlocutory, an appeal therefrom does not depend upon his allowance or discretion, but is a matter of right. The time for claiming an appeal cannot be extended by consent of parties or by the justice whose decree is appealed from. <em>North British Railway </em>v. <em>Wauc</em>hope, 4 Macq. 352. <em>Callan </em>v. May, 2 Black, 541. <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Cass </em>County, 5 Wall. 823. <em>Gardner </em>v. Dudley, 12 Gray, 430. If an appeal is not taken within the time prescribed, the full court cannot acquire jurisdiction thereof, otherwise than upon a petition for leave to appeal according to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The appeal, in this case, not having been claimed within thirty days after the decree appealed from, must therefore be dismissed for want of jurisdiction; and we have no occasion to consider whether that decree is final or interlocutory only; or whether interlocutory decrees are subject to appeal on leave obtained from the full court upon petition, in like manner as a final decree, or, if not appealed from within thirty days, are conclusive, except so far as they may erroneously affect the final decree and be included in an appeal from that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On January 13, 1877, Ames, J., made a decree rescinding the former decrees, the attorney general filed a general replication, and the judge made two new decrees precisely like the former ones; and the defendant appealed from the new decrees. The decree which rescinded the former decrees was not appealed from. The case was argued by the same counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Gray, C. J. It is within the general equity jurisdiction of this court to remove or appoint trustees under wills or other written instruments, upon sufficient cause shown. Gen. Sts. <em>o. </em>100, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9; <em>g. </em>113, \u00a7 2. <em>Bowditch </em>v. Banuelos, 1 Gray, 220. <em>In re Eastern </em>Railroad, 120 Mass. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The testator by his will named three executors, and devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate to them, \u201c and the survivors or survivor of them, their successors in said trust, their heirs and assigns forever,\u201d in trust to constitute a perpetual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>fund, to be held and invested by the trustees, with power'to sell and reinvest, and the net income thereof to be managed and dispensed for certain charitable purposes by a corporation to be established by the Legislature, and to be composed of said trustees and their successors, and such persons as they should associate with themselves in the act of incorporation, or as should be afterwards elected out of contributors to the fund; and provided that, in case of a vacancy in the board of trustees, the place should be filled by an election by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The permanent trust, to hold, sell, invest and reinvest for the benefit of the charity, was not annexed to the office of executor, but was a distinct trust, although at first vested in the same persons who were named as executors. <em>Tainter </em>v. Clark, 13 Met. 220. <em>Clark </em>v. Tainter, 7 Cush. 567. <em>Carson </em>v. Carson, 6 Allen, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Two of the persons named in the will have resigned, leaving the defendant sole executor and sole trustee. An act of incorporation not having yet been obtained, no provision is made in the will for filling the vacancies in the office of trustee. The will manifests the intention of the testator that the board should constantly consist of three trustees, and the words \u201c the survivors and survivor of them \u201d express no more than would have been effected by law, and do not restrict the power of the court to appoint new trustees in accordance with that intention. Gen. Sts. <em>e. </em>89, | 14; <em>e. </em>100, \u00a7 9. <em>Dixon </em>v Homer, 12 Cush. 41. The magnitude and importance of the trust, and the facts that there is now but a single trustee and that his fitness is in controversy, afford peculiar reasons for exercising this power.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
