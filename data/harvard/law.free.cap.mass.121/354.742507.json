Sts. <em>c. </em>161, \u00a7 54, charging that the defendant, at a time and place named, \u201c devising and intending by unlawful ways and means to obtain the money, goods and chattels of Ehoda Corser, and with intent to cheat and defraud said Ehoda Corser, did then and there unlawfully, knowingly and designedly, falsely pretend and represent to said Ehoda Corser that a certain promissory note of the tenor following, that is to say, \u20181464.00. Worcester, Mass. April 2d, 1873. One year after date, I promise to pay to the order of Ehoda Corser four hundred and sixty-four dollars, with interest payable annually at the rate of twelve per cent., value received. John Ooonan,\u2019 was a valid and genuine note, and that the signature thereto was genuine, and that said note was secured by a real estate mortgage; and that the said Ehoda Corser, then and there believing said false pretences and representations, so made as aforesaid by said Parmenter, and being deceived thereby was induced, by reason of the false pretences and representations so made as aforesaid, to deliver and loan, and did then and there deliver and loan to said Parmenter, the sum of four hundred and sixty-four dollars lawful money, of the money and property of said Ehoda Corser, and did then and there take and receive from said Parmenter said note in consideration of said sum of money so as aforesaid delivered and loaned; and the said Parmenter did then and there receive and obtain said sum of money of said Ehoda Corser, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>means of the false pretences and representations aforesaid, with intent to cheat and defraud said Khoda Corser of said sum of money. Whereas in truth and in fact, said note was not a valid and genuine note, and the signature thereto was not genuine, and said note was not secured by a real estate mortgage, all of which the said Parmenter then and there well knew. So the jurors aforesaid, on their oaths aforesaid, do say that the said David F. Parmenter, by means of the false pretences aforesaid, on the second day of April, in the year eighteen hundred and seventy-three, at Worcester aforesaid, unlawfully, knowingly and designedly did receive and obtain from said Khoda Corser, said sum of money the property of said Khoda Corser, with intent to defraud said Khoda Corser of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-4\">In the Superior Court, before the jury were empanelled, the defendant moved to quash the indictment for the following reason : \u201c Because the indictment does not allege that the defendant represented that the note was secured by a mortgage of any value on any property of value, or that said mortgage was signed by a person of any responsibility, or that said note was secured by a mortgage in favor of the person alleged to have been defrauded, nor does it state whether the makers or indorsers were secured by the mortgage.\u201d Aldrich, J., overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">The defendant was then tried, and the government was allowed, against the defendant\u2019s objection, to introduce evidence tending to show that the defendant represented to the person alleged to have been defrauded, that the note in question was secured by a mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">In the margin of the note were these words: \u201c This note is secured by real estate mortgage.\u201d The defendant requested the court to rule that this constituted a fatal variance, which the judge declined to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">\u25a0 The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant moved in arrest of judgment on the same ground as his motion to quash. The judge overruled the motion; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-8\"><em>W. A. Crile $ O. A. </em>Merrill, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-9\"><em>O.

Ho such objection appears, and no error is therefore to be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The objection that there was a variance between the note produced and the note described in the declaration is decided to be unfounded. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>117 Mass. 532. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>118 Mass. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The objection that the false pretences must have been in writing does not appear to have been raised upon the trial; nor does it appear affirmatively that they were not in writing; nor is the case at bar within the class of cases in which the statute requires the false pretences to be in writing. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>161, \u00a7 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
