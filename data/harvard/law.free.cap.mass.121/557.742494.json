The description of it in the deed to the plaintiff, and in the deed to her grantor, was as follows : \u201c Beginning on the southerly side of the old county road leading through East Lexington to Boston, at the westerly corner of land now or late of Curtis Capell; and running easterly and southerly on said road, there called Main Street, one thousand nineteen feet, to land now or late of Blaisdell; \u201d [thence by various courses and distances which it is unnecessary to set forth here;] \u201c thence north by land now or late of said Capell, one hundred sixty-eight feet, to the corner begun at, on the county road; with the privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-8\">The plaintiff asked the judge to rule that under this deed the land of the plaintiff extended to the centre of the highway. The judge refused so to rule, and instructed the jury that the legal effect of the deed was to show that the land thereby conveyed to the plaintiff did not extend to the centre of the highway, but only to the southerly line of the highway. The jury found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-9\"><em>W.
