The case was reserved for the full court on the bill and answers, and a report by <em>Devens, </em>J., and was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">William Phelan, being seised in fee of the land in question, mortgaged the same to one Shannon, who assigned the mortgage and the note secured thereby to Joseph H. Leavitt, who foreclosed the mortgage on April 23, 1857. Phelan, on October 6, 1858, conveyed the land by deed of quitclaim to said Leavitt, who, on the same day, conveyed the same by deed of quitclaim to Joseph S. Leavitt, to whom also Phelan and his wife released any interest they might have. On the same day Joseph S. Leavitt made and delivered to Phelan a deed, which, after reciting the above conveyances, proceeded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">\u201c Now know ye that I, the said Joseph S. Leavitt, do hereby acknowledge and declare that I take and hold the said premises conveyed to me as aforesaid only in trust; that I do not claim to have any right or interest in the said farm of land or its appurtenances, ways, easements or any part thereof/ by the conveyance so made to me to my own use or benefit, but only to and for the sole use and benefit of the said William Phelan and his heirs; and I, the said Joseph S. Leavitt, for myself and my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenant with the said William Phelan and his heirs, by these presents, that I, the said Joseph S. Leavitt, my heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>and will, at any time after the expiration of five years from the date hereof, upon the request of the said William Phelan, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, (and at their cost,) in writing made, signed by three credible witnesses, by good assurances and conveyances in law, convey to the said William Phelan and his heirs, or to such other person or persons as he or they shall nominate, direct or appoint, by a writing signed by him or them, and witnessed by three credible persons thereunto subscribed, the said estate hereinbefore set out, together with all and any dower interest of the, said Sarah aforesaid that may come unto the said J. S. Leavitt issuing out of any estate of the said William Phelan, reserving always to the said William Phelan, a right to revoke any appointments he may make before the execution and passing of the conveyances which may be requested.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">In 1868, Joseph S. Leavitt died, leaving a will by which he devised the residue of his property to Joseph H. Leavitt and another, as trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">In 1873, William Phelan, not having made any request for a conveyance of the land, died, leaving a will by which he devised all the estate real and personal of which he might die seised or possessed to trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">After the death of Phelan, the plaintiffs made a demand in writing, signed by three credible witnesses, on the trustees of Joseph S. Leavitt for a conveyance of the land; and the question reserved was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to such conveyance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-7\"><em>J. A. Crillis, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A66\">The declaration of trust, after reciting the method by which the title is finally vested in Leavitt, declares that Leavitt has no interest in the property and does not hold it to his own benefit, but for the sole use and benefit of \u201c William Phelan and his heirs.\u201d Leavitt then covenants with \u201c William Phelan and his heirs \u201d that the said Leavitt and his \u201c heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, will at any time after the expiration of five years from date, \u201c upon the request of the said William Phelan, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, (and at their cost,) in writing signed by three credible witnesses, by good assurances and conveyances in law convey to the said William Phelan and his heirs, or to such other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>person or persons as he or they shall nominate, direct cr appoint, by a writing signed by him or them, and witnessed by three credible witnesses thereunto subscribed, the said estate.\u201d It is contended that, although down to this point the language of the instrument might be construed as referring to Phelan alone, the word \u201c heirs \u201d simply indicating the nature of his estate in the property, yet here is a distinction taken between Phelan and his heirs. The language \u201c he or they shall nominate,\u201d and \u201c signed by him or them,\u201d shows that the parties contemplated the idea of Phelan\u2019s death, and intended to make clear provision for such contingency, and that the word \u201c heirs \u201d designates the persons who are to claim the property in question. This view is further strengthened by the succeeding language, by which there is reserved \u201c to the said William Phelan a right to revoke any appointments which he may make before the execution and passing of the conveyances which may be requested,\u201d giving to Phelan the right to revoke, but withholding this right from the heirs, who have thf power to make one request or nomination only. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Cordis, </em>4 Allen, 466, 480. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Thorndike, </em>5 Allen, 257. <em>In re Philps\u2019s Will, </em>L.
