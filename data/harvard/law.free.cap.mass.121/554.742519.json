On February 21, 1874, the tenant was arrested upon the execution and committed to jail. On February 25, 1874, he went before a magistrate, and gave notice of his desire to take the poor debtor\u2019s oath, and the magistrate issued the proper notice to the demandant and appointed February 28, 1874, for a hearing. On that day the parties all appeared, and the hearing was postponed until April 24, 1874. Meanwhile, on March 4, 1874, by agreement of all parties, the recognizance was discharged, all future proceedings upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>examination were discontinued, and the demandant consented that the tenant should be discharged from arrest. On March 5, 1874, an officer, by virtue of the same execution, seized the land in controversy. It was appraised, and duly set off by metes and bounds to the demandant, and seisin and possession delivered to him by the officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-4\">In the Superior Court, Putnam, J., ordered judgment for the demandant; and the tenant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b573-5\"><em>W.
