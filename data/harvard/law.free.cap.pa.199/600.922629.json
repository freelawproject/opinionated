The Imperial Council of the Order of United Friends is a New York corporation, chartered on December 21, 1881, under the act of May 12,1875, entitled \u201c An act for the incorporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>of societies and clubs for certain lawful purposes,\u201d and also an act dated May 12,1881, entitled \u201c An act concerning charitable, benevolent and beneficial associations and societies as a corporation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-4\">2. The legal location of the imperial council of the order was established in the city of Albany, county of Albany, in the state of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-5\">3. The principal objects of the association were to unite and combine the efforts of all its members, to improve the condition of its membership, morally, socially and materially by kindly counsel and instructive lessons; to promote benevolence and charity by establishing a relief fund, from which a member of the association, who has complied with all the laws, rules and regulations, or a person or persons, by such a member lawfully designated, or the legal heir or heirs of said members, may receive a benefit in a sum not exceeding $3,000, which shall be paid when a member, by reason of disease or accident, shall become permanently disabled from following his or her usual, or some other, occupation, or upon satisfactory evidence of the death of such member, and when all the conditions regulating such payment have been complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">4. The association had power to make and levy such assessments upon grand and subordinate councils, or the subordinate membership as might seem necessary, to meet liabilities on account of the death or disabilities of members.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-7\">5. Grand and subordinate councils were established in various states of the union, including Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-8\">6. When assessments were called, they were collected from the subordinate councils in the various states by the imperial recorder, and by him sent to the imperial treasurer of the Order of United Friends.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-9\">7. The plaintiff in the bill is the imperial treasurer of the Order of United Friends, and was so on April 11, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-10\">8. On April 11, 1899, upon the petition of a majority of the trustees, directors and managers of the Imperial Council of the Order of United Friends, and upon notice to the attorney general of New York, setting forth the insolvency of said order, at a special- term of the Supreme Court, held in the city of Albany, New York, Isaac B. Barrett, Esq., was appointed tern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>porary receiver of said order, upon his executing and filing a bond in the penal sum of $57,000; said receiver was clothed with all the powers, and subjected to all the duties in section 1788 of the civil code of procedure. And it was further ordered that all who claimed to be creditors of said order be restrained from commencing any action against said order, and from further prosecuting any pending action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-5\">On April 14, 1899, said receiver duly executed and filed his bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-6\">9. On April 15, 1899, said receiver made a formal demand upon the plaintiff as imperial treasurer of the Order of United Friends for the moneys in his hands as treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-7\">10. At that time there was in the hands of the plaintiff the sum of $32,175.49, standing to his credit as imperial treasurer on the books of the Third National Bank, in the city of Philadelphia ; said moneys belonged to the Imperial Council of the Order of United Friends, and did not belong to the subordinate council or grand council organized in the State of Pennsylvania ; the same were collected by assessment upon the membership at <em>large of </em>said imperial council in various states, and but fourteen per cent was contributed by councils in Pennsylvania, and but a small minority of said membership did then and now reside in the state of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-8\">11. The moneys so assessed and collected were collected for the purpose of paying all just claims of beneficiaries of deceased members, wherever resident, and were not specially collected to pay the claims of beneficiaries residing in Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-9\">12. The said sum in the hands of the plaintiff constitutes about one fourth of the assets of the Order of United Friends, and the claims against said order amount to about $140,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-10\">13. On April 10, 1899, Rose M. Shaughnessy issued a writ of foreign attachment out of C. P. No. 2, of Philadelphia county, J. T., 1899, No. 8, and attached the funds in the hands of the plaintiff, and summoned the Third National bank as garnishee. Said attachment was served at 10:47 A. M., April 10, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-11\">14. The said Rose M. Shaughnessy .is a citizen of the state of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b626-12\">15. Subsequently similar writs of foreign attachment issued as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>At the suit of</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-6\">Emma G.

Haines, April 11,1900, \u201c</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-11\">All of said plaintiffs are citizens of the state of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-12\">Two attaching plaintiffs, including Shaughnessy, are beneficiaries of certificates maturing through the deaths of members prior to April 1, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-13\">16. On April 17, 1899, the plaintiff filed the present bill, setting forth that the preferences sought to be obtained by the attaching plaintiffs were inequitable, and prayed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-14\">(1) That the court will declare the issuing of said writs of foreign attachment and the attempted, preference sought thereby, to be illegal; and that the same shall be dissolved, or that they be required to interplead with an ancillary receiver when appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-15\">(2) That an injunction issue, restraining the prosecution of said writs of attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-16\">(3) That a receiver be appointed ancillary to the receivership of Isaac B. Barrett, and that such receiver be directed to collect and distribute the funds in the hands of your orator as imperial treasurer under the direction of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-17\">(4) That all other persons, members or beneficiaries of members in the order, be enjoined from issuing process against the funds in the hands of your orator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-18\">(5) That your orator be authorized and empowered to pay over to such ancillary receiver the funds in his hands to await further action of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-19\">(6) Further relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-20\">17. There exists in the state of New York under her laws a method of winding up the affairs of insolvent corporations, and of equitably distributing its assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-21\">The court also finds the further fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-22\">18. By the laws of the state of New York, the filing of the receiver\u2019s bond relates back to the time of the receiver\u2019s appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>OPINION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-4\">The questions raised are the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-5\">1. Are the attaching plaintiffs creditors ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-6\">2. If they are, does the appointment of a receiver by a court of the state of New York defeat the attachments issued after such appointment by creditors not residing in the state of New York?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-7\">\u20223. If they are such creditors, is the attachment of Rose Shaughnessy, a resident of the state of New York, issued prior to the appointment of the receiver, defeated ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-8\">1. As to the first question, Are the attaching plaintiffs creditors ? the plaintiff contends that they are not creditors, relying on Fraternal Guardians\u2019 Estate, 159 Pa. 594, and The Order of Tonti\u2019s Assigned Estate, 173 Pa. 464.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-9\">Those cases, however, are not in point. They decide the rights, as against each other, of several classes of members of an organization, one of said classes claiming also to be creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-10\">In the present case none of the defendants were ever members of the corporation. They were beneficiaries\u2014a totally different class: Dobson v. Hall, 1 Pa. Dist. Rep. 401. The right to the benefit was never in the member. It was in the beneficiary, and no one other than she could maintain an action for its recovery. She took in her own right alone as the beneficiary of the fund, and did not represent any right or interest of her deceased husband: Hamill v. Supreme Council of The Royal Arcanum, 152 Pa. 537-542, per Gbeen, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-11\">The theory of the Supreme Court seems to be that by virtue of a contract between the corporation and the member, the former becomes, on the latter\u2019s death, bound to pay the stipulated sum to the beneficiary, and this constitutes a debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-12\">\u201cThe legal acceptation of debt,\u201d says Blackstone (vol. 3&gt; p. 154), \u201cis a sum of money due by certain and express agreement,\u201d and still a more explicit definition is given hr Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary (p. 185) : \u201c A liquidated money obligation, for which, generally speaking, an action will lie (Webster v. Webster, 31 Beav. 393), but which obligation may be either legal or equitable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b628-13\">\u2022 And so Lord Justice Bindley, in Webb v. Stenton, L. R. 11 Q. B. Div. 526, said: \u201c Is a trustee a debtor to his cestui <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>que trust? You cannot say he is unless he has got in his hands money which it is his duty to hand over to the cestui que trust; then, of course, he is a debtor, and there is no difficulty in attaching such a debt.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-5\">That the defendants are creditors seems to us quite certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-6\">The next question raised involved a determination of the effect of the action of the New York court in appointing a receiver for the plaintiff corporation on the ground of insolvency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-7\">While a receiver has no extra-territorial authority, yet his appointment will, on the ground of comity, be recognized in Pennsylvania: (Bagby v. Atlantic, etc., R. R. Co., 86 Pa. 291.) This doctrine is subject, however, to the limitation that the receiver\u2019s claims do not come in conflict with the rights of citizens of our own state: Bagby v. Atlantic, etc., R. R. Co., 86 Pa. 294; Hilliard v. Enders, decided by the Supreme Court on July 12, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-8\">In accordance with this principle, it has been held that foreign attachment will lie at the suit of a salesman, resident of Pennsylvania, against a foreign corporation for a debt due him by the corporation, eveii though receivers have been appointed after the creation of the debt: Lett v. Thurber Whyland Co., 15 Pa. C. C. Reps. 666.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-9\">And where receivers were appointed in the district court of Columbia for an insolvent Virginia corporation, the court (McPherson, J.) declined to give this appointment such effect as would enable it to prevail over contemporaneous and subsequent attachments by Pennsylvania courts: Smith v. Fidelity Bldg., Loan &amp; Investment Assn., 4 Pa. Dist. Rep. 817.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-10\">The whole question has been treated with his usual learning and thoroughness by Hare, P. J., in the case of Perkins v. Clear Spring Paper Co., 17 Phila. 168, decided by this court in 1885. He there uses this language: \u201c It is accordingly well settled in Pennsylvania that when the claims of a foreign assignee are brought into conflict with those of our own citizens, the latter will have the preference, because it is hardly just, and certainly not expedient, to remit them to a distant jurisdiction for what is close at hand and can be obtained at home: \u201d Milne v. Moreton, 6 Binney, 353.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-11\">Accepting this view, we are bound to decide in favor of those who are residents of Pennsylvania. Their attachments can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>not be defeated by the extra-territorial appointment of a receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-5\">This leaves still to be determined whether Rose Shaughnessey\u2019s attachment can stand, she being a citizen of New York. Her proceedings were taken fully a day before the appointment of a receiver was made, but the order of the New York court is express in forbidding all persons to commence any action and to further prosecute or take any further proceedings in any action theretofore commenced and now pending. While our rule requires us to protect our own citizens, we ought not to stand between another state and its citizens, so as to enable the latter to defy the government to which they owe allegiance. This would be a breach of the rule of comity as we have established it: Perkins v. Clear Spring Paper Co., 17 Phila. 168; Bagby v. Atlantic, etc., R. R. Co., 86 Pa. 291.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-6\">And the fact that she was diligent cannot avail her here. She is subject to the order of the court of her own state, and if we awarded her the money, she would be held to refund it. Such a proceeding on our part inducing a multiplicity of actions, would be a breach of comity. We think, therefore, she must be referred to the courts of her own state for the determination of her rights, and that pending the decision of said courts, shall be restrained by injunction from prosecuting her claim under the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-7\">The prayer for the appointment of an ancillary receiver is granted, and such moneys in the hands of the imperial treasurer as are in excess of the amounts required to satisfy the claims of the defendants whose attachments have been sustained and the defendant Shaughnessey\u2019s attachment, should be paid over to him, when duly qualified; and Isaac N. Solis, Esq., is hereby appointed such ancillary receiver, security to be given by him in the sum of $40,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-8\">Exceptions filed to the adjudication by the receiver were subsequently dismissed and exceptions filed by the executor of Rose M. Shaughnessy were sustained and a decree was entered in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-9\">That the order heretofore made appointing Isaac N. Solis receiver of the funds and assets of the Order of United Friends situate within the state of Pennsylvania and not bound by the attachments issued by the defendants in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cause, is ratified, approved and confirmed, and that the prayers for an injunction against the defendants, Hannah Blank, Sallie E. Hilt, Emma G. Grier, Francis T. Giblin (executor of Rose M. Shaughnessy, deceased), Caroline Conroy, Fannie G. Haines and Sarah Jones, and all prayers for relief against them in said bill contained, be and the same are hereby refused; that the said plaintiff (treasurer of the corporation) be authorized to pay to the receiver so appointed the funds in his hands, except so much thereof as may be necessary to meet the attachments thereof by the said defendants with interest and costs, say all sums in excess of the sum of 825,000, and the Third National Bank be authorized and directed to honor his check for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b631-6\"><em>Hampton L.
