And the said orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia county by readjudication of the account of the said John Ruhl, administrator of Sophia Yung, deceased, on July 14,1900, awarded the balance aforesaid shown by the said account, one third, or $832.61, to Johann Krebs, and one sixth, or $416.30, each to Christina Korb and Daniel Groh, with interest upon the several amounts from June 1, 1891, and ordered and decreed that the balance in the hands of the said accountant be distributed and paid as awarded. That the said awards to the said Johann Krebs, Christina Korb and Daniel Groh having remained unpaid, although payment thereof had been demanded, the said orphans\u2019 court did, to wit: on August 16, 1900, order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>and decree that the said John Ruhl, administrator of Sophia Yung, pay over to Gustavus Remak, Jr., Esq., attorney for Johann Krebs, Christina Korb and Daniel Groh, the sum of $2,576.60, within ten days after personal service of said order upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">The statement further averred refusal to pay the above amounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">Henry Kunzig, the surety, filed an affidavit of defense in which he averred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">I am informed that the account of John Ruhl, administrator of Sophia Yung, deceased, was adjudicated on July 2, 1891, as set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement, and the sum of $2,497.83, being the entire balance in the hands of the accountant, was awarded to Magdalena Ruhl; that no exceptions were filed to the said adjudication, and that under the rule of said court the said adjudication became absolute on the third Saturday following. I am informed that pursuant to said decree, the said John Ruhl, administrator as aforesaid, delivered and paid unto the said Magdalena Ruhl the entire amount of said award, prior to the presentation of the petition to review the award, as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement. I was not notified by citation or otherwise of the presentation of the petition to review the said adjudication, mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s statement, and was not made a party thereto, and by reason thereof was unable to protect myself against the effect of the said petition for review, and the adjudication of the account which was subsequently made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">I left this country May 8, 1900, and sailed for Europe and did not return till September 25,1900, and had no notice whatever of the proceedings relating to the review until after the last mentioned date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">I am informed that the said readjudication was in violation of the act of October 13, 1840, inasmuch as the said petition for review was not presented for a period of eight years and six months after the final decree confirming the said account, and that the said act limits the presentation of such petitions, to the period of five years after such final decree.

Justice Bbown,</author>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The liability of this appellant was fixed by the decree of the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia county, which we have this day affirmed, that John Ruhl, administrator of the estate of Sophia Yung, deceased, pay to the appellees the sums awarded them on the readjudication of his account. Ruhl and his sureties appealed from that decree, and we need not here repeat our reasons for affirming it, though they may be properly read in connection with our disposition of this appeal. The statement of appellees\u2019 cause of action alleges that the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia county, having found that the distribution ordered by it on the first adjudication had never been made by the administrator, ordered him to pay to them the respective sums awarded to them, and that he has neglected and refused so to do. The decree, the consequences of which this appellant now seeks to avade, is the judgment of the court having jurisdiction of the trustee, for whose good faith he stood sponser. His bond is that the administrator will pay, and the appellees are simply asking that he be compelled to comply with his obligation. In the court in which the liability of this surety is sought to be enforced, the decree of the other court, which definitely fixed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>it, cannot be assailed. In this proceeding, no plea but payment can avail, and no defense be made, save compliance with the court\u2019s decree. The appellant is now confronted with a liability which he knew, when he became surety for Ruhl, he would meet if there should be default by the latter. To avoid this liability, he was bound to avoid the decree against his principal in the orphans\u2019 court, where he would have been heard ex gratia, if not ex debito justitise, for any good reason that he might have urged against it. In that court only could he be heard in protest against it; in the court from whose judgment he has appealed, it is conclusive. Even now, the first court might hear him of grace, but not of right, if prepared to convince it of error in its findings of fact; and, if so heard there, the court of common pleas would properly control its judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The judgment was properly entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and it is now affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
