The legal estate was given to trustees, upon whom the performance of active duties was carefully and minutely enjoined\u2014duties which required the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>estate to remain in them. A separate use requires no activity of duty on the part of the trustee, and is created, if the beneficiary is married at the time, by any words showing the intention to exclude marital authority or interference (Scott v. Bryan, 194 Pa. 41) ; but the trust, while unnecessary to accomplish this part of the testator\u2019s intention (and he is presumed to know the law on the subject), had a manifest purpose for which it was necessary, viz: the prevention of the coalescence of the life estate with the remainder to heirs. And here, again, it must be presumed that he knew that the separate use would not be efficacious unless his daughter should be married when the will became operative (Neal\u2019s Appeal, 8 Outerb. 214, deciding that the execution of the will was the determining time, could not have been anticipated by him), and protection in that case could only be afforded by preserving the remainder as a distinct estate, not subject to the control of the beneficiary for life. In construing wills, courts are bound to give effect to every word and provision (ut res magis valeat quam pereat), where no rule or policy of the law is violated, and there is no more right in this case to say that the sole purpose of the father in giving to his daughter an equitable life estate was to create a separate use than there was in the case of the son, for whom, of course, a separate use was impossible, the language employed in each case being practically identical. Indeed, the necessity for supporting the trust is stronger in case of the daughter than in case of the son, irrespective of the separate use, since in the former it is expressly provided that \u201cher receipt\u201d for the moneys paid by the trustees shall \u201cbe the only discharge therefor\u201d\u2014words which, it would seem, create a spendthrift trust for her protection (Stambaugh\u2019s Estate, 20 Crumr. 585; Winthrop Co. v. Clinton, 196 Pa. 472. See, also, Yaux v. Parke, 7 W. &amp; S. 19), and this in itself furnishes an unanswerable reason for the separation of the life estate from the remainder : Rife v. Geyer, 9 P. F. Smith, 393. In this view of the case it becomes identical with Wolfinger v. Fell, 195 Pa. 12, 14, where the subject is elaborately considered by the present chief justice. See, also, Hemphill\u2019s Estate, 5 Pa. Hist. Rep. 690; 180 Pa. 95, and Livezey\u2019s Appeal, 10 Outerb. 201. The precise point was decided in Bacon\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith, 504, in an opinion by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Strong, where a trust, with active duties on the part of the trustee, for separate use for life of a daughter, with remainder to her heirs, was held to continue after the death of the daughter\u2019s husband (as it would not have done but for such duties, (Steacy v. Rice, 3 Casey, 75; Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith, 352, also an opinion by Judge Strong), and the life estate not unite with the remainder to her heirs, the distinction being between a mere dry trust requiring no duties on the part of the trustee after the purpose of the trust has ceased (Yarnall\u2019s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith, 335), and a trust for a purpose which continues: Earp\u2019s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith, 119; Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 27 P. F. Smith, 464. Utile per inutile non vitiatur.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">But the plain words of the will are all that is required to show that the creation of the trust for separate use was not the only, or even the main, purpose of the testator. The trustees are directed to pay to the daughter \u201c during her natural life, for her sole and separate use,. support and maintenance, and without any control of any husband she may take, and her receipt to be the only discharge therefor.\u201d Thus it will be observed the taking of a husband is spoken of hypothetically and contingently as an event which may or may not happen; any husband she \u201c may \u201d take, i. e., \u201c in case \u201d she should take; but the payment is to be during the whole of her natural life, and is to be for her \u201c support and maintenance,\u201d the only discharge therefor during her whole natural life being \u201c her receipt,\u201d whether she \u201c take \u201d a husband or not. This brings the case directly within the ruling in Dunn &amp; Biddle\u2019s Appeal, 4 Norris, 94, 98.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">Assuming, then, that the daughter had but a life estate, her right of disposition was only such as she had under the power of appointment conferred by the father\u2019s will, and to the extent that its exercise transgressed the rule against perpetuities, the .principal passed at her death to her \u201cheirs\u201d as purchasers. Her will (which showed her own understanding of the interest given by the father) gave, in execution of the power, the estate to a trustee to pay the income to her son in part during his minority, and the whole when he became of age for life\u2014 125,000 of the principal being given to him absolutely at the age of twenty-five years; at his death the residue to his children or issue and widow, in such shares as he should appoint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>by will, and in default of appointment, to the persons entitled to his estate under the intestate laws. But if he should leave a widow and no issue, then one third to such widow, f1,000 to the Children\u2019s Hospital, $1,000 to the Southern Home for Friendless Children, one half of the residue to her husband and one half to the children of her brother designated in the will in equal shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The original testator died February, 1855; the daughter in January, 1874; her husband, May 4,1898; and her son, February 22, 1900, leaving a widow, to whom he bequeathed his entire estate, but no children or issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">The life estate appointed to the son, and also the gift to him of $25,000 upon attaining the age of twenty-five years \u2014if that event occurred within twenty-one years of the death of his mother, the donee of the power (but not otherwise)\u2014do not infringe the rule against perpetuities (Gray on Perp. secs. 232, 523; Lawrence\u2019s Estate, 21 Crumr. 364) ; but the appointment to the witlow and unborn children of the son was clearly bad, as the appointees, by possibility, might not come into being within twenty-one years after the death of the donee. But are the limitations to persons in being in her lifetime, of ascertained portions of the estate, to be regarded as vested, and thus saved from the operation of the rule against remoteness ? If they were given simply in default of the execution of a power conferred upon the prior taker, they would be regarded as vested, subject to being divested, and the gift would be valid: 4 Kent, 204, 324; Perry on Trusts, sec. 250. But where interests are limited, not simply in default of the execution of a power, but on the failure, also, of a prior contingent estate, they are contingent. Thus in a devise to B, who is unmarried, for life, remainder to his children, but if he dies without children, to C (which is precisely this case), both remainders are contingent, though that to B\u2019s children may become vested when a child is born, subject to open and let in afterborn children: Doe v. Perryn, 3 Term Rep. 484; 4 Kent, 205; Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, 11 Crumr. 562. In the present case children of the son, had there been any, could not have taken under the primary appointment to them, because of the rule against perpetuities ; and yet, if the limitation to persons in being were good, the latter would take to the exclusion of the son\u2019s chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>dren, which would he a perversion of the will of the donee, and certainly not in accordance with her intentions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">It follows that there was a failure to make a valid appointment, except to the extent of the life estate to the son, and the gift to him of $25,000 (if he reached the age of twenty-five years within twenty-one years of his mother\u2019s death), and that as to anything beyond, the estate of the original testator, so far as it is included in the account, passes under his will to the daughter\u2019s \u201c heirs.\u201d Who are her \u201c heirs ? \u201d Her husband and son survived her, and the former, where the subject of the gift is personalty, is included in a limitation to the heirs of the wife: Gibbons v. Fairlamb, 2 Casey, 217; Eby\u2019s Appeal, 3 Norris, 241.
