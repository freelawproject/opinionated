In such a case, as the defense is to the entire claim, the affidavit is not required to state the defendant\u2019s version of the market price.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b490-10\">Argued March 28, 1901.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A85\">Appeal, No. 41, Jan.

Hamilton, Wilbur F. Hamilton and Edwin E. Hamilton, trading as W. C. Hamilton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>&amp; Sons, v. William S. W. Kirby and Frank H.

The contract called for peeled poplar. The defendants filed an affidavit of defense which was in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-8\">The defendants never agreed to furnish poplar wood wi fch the \u201c bark on \u201d and never consented with the plaintiffs that they should go into the market and buy wood such as they had not agreed to furnish them, and the defendants never allowed the plaintiffs the privilege of going into the market and buying the poplar wood with the \u201c bark on.\u201d The purchase of poplar wood with the \u201c bark on \u201d to take the place of and be substituted for the peeled poplar wood is absolutely new to the trade, not in accordance therewith, and entirely contrary thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\">Deponent avers that $8.75 per cord for poplar wood with the \u201cbark on \u201d was an extraordinary price and far above the market price on December 30, 1899, the date of the alleged purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-10\">The average price of cord wood, which is solid wood with the \u201c bark on \u201d and usually consists of chestnut, oak, poplar, and other woods, is from $3.00 to $3.50 per cord, delivered on a corresponding freight rate to Philadelphia, Pa. Poplar wood is no more expensive than chestnut or oak wood. A charge of $2.00 per cord for peeling the said wood is an excessive price for the work, inasmuch as the entire cost of felling the timber, sawing into lengths, splitting the wood to proper size, and peeling the bark costs from seventy-five cents to one dollar per cord, and if the wood with the <em>\u201c </em>bark on \u201d had been bought by the plaintiffs at the market price, the plaintiffs would have obtained their wood at less than their contract price with the defendants, and consequently could not have any claim against the defendants under the said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-11\">Deponent avers that the plaintiffs, in their statement of claim, acknowledge that there was no such wood in the market as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cVirginia white poplar wood,\u201d as called for in the contract, and therefore it was a physical impossibility for defendants to purchase the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The defendants deny the right of the plaintiffs to go into the market and purchase wood not called for in the said contract between the plaintiffs and defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">The proper season for securing peeled poplar wood is in the spring season, and December 80, the date of the alleged purchase, is the season of the year when wood is highest in price and most difficult to obtain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">The court discharged a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-9\"><em>Jere J. </em>Crowley, with him <em>Thomas W. </em>Barlow, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOe\">\u2014The appellants, under the circumstances, had the right to purchase in the market poplar wood with the bark on as a substitute for poplar wood peeled, which the appellees contracted to deliver, and charge them with the difference between the market price and cost of peeling the wood with the bark on, and the contract price of peeled wood: Benjamin on Sales, sec. 877; Theiss v. Weiss, 166 Pa. 16; Hinde v. Liddell, L. R. 10 Queen\u2019s Bench, 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-10\">Defendants\u2019 allegation as to market price paid by plaintiffs for substituted wood is not sufficiently averred: Port Kennedy Slag Works v. Krause &amp; Sons, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. <em>622; </em>Griel v. Buckius, 114 Pa. 190; Woods v. Vankirk, 5 Pa. Dist.

Home for Disabled and Indigent Soldiers, etc., 168 Pa. 352.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ary\">May 27, 1901:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A3pP\">Mb. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">The affidavit set forth two defenses, first, that the purchase of poplar wood with the bark on, as a substitute for peeled poplar, is contrary to the usage of the trade, and secondly, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>sum paid by the plaintiffs for the substitute was above the market price.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Where the seller fails to deliver an article contracted for, the purchaser has a right to go into the market and supply himself on the best terms he can, and then to look to his defaulting vendor to make up any loss from the breach of the contract. And if the exact article cannot be obtained with reasonable effort the purchaser may take the best substitute within reach. But what is the best substitute is a question of fact which if disputed must go to a jury; and on this question, ordinarily, the general usage of the business, if there is such a usage, is controlling evidence. The affidavit of defense avers that the substitution of poplar with the bark on for peeled poplar was \u201c entirely contrary \u201d to the usage of the trade. That raised a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Secondly, the purchaser in procuring the substitute cannot charge his vendor for more than a loss which was not reasonably avoidable. Therefore he must buy the substitute on the best terms obtainable, and that means prima facie, at the market price. The price paid by the plaintiffs being disputed by the affidavit, raised another question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The affidavit was not required to state the defendants\u2019 version of the market price. Where the defense is pro tanto only, the affidavit must state the exact extent to which it goes, so as to give the plaintiff the opportunity, if he desires, of accepting the defendant\u2019s version and taking judgment for the amount admitted: Cosgrave v. Hammill, 173 Pa. 207. But in this case the defense set up goes to the entire claim, not only upon the questions already noticed but also on breach of contract in the first instance by plaintiffs in the measurement of wood delivered, and other matters not necessary to discuss now.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
