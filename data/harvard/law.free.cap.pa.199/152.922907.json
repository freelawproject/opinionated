It was averred in the bill and not denied in the answer that the borough of Boyertown had passed an ordinance authorizing the railway company \u201c to lay a single railway track in the center of Reading avenue, erect and maintain poles for supporting wires for supplying electrical power. . . . Provided, further, that it shall not be lawful for the said railway company to use any other motive power over the route herein granted, other than electricity, unless so authorized by a subsequent duly approved ordinance of council.

The bill further averred as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">4. In pursuance of the authority purporting to be given by said letters patent and ordinance, the said Oley Valley Railway Company asserts the right and proposes to construct a street passenger railway in the center of the street in front of the plaintiff\u2019s properties, and to set up poles and wires for the purpose of operating the same by means of electricity, and to operate the said street passenger railway for the transportation of passengers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">5. The construction, maintenance and operation of said street passenger railway by the said railway company, will interfere with the free and unobstructed use of said street by the plaintiff and by other persons desiring to obtain access to the plaintiff\u2019s properties, and will specially injure the plaintiff\u2019s properties, and the said acts of the said corporation will be illegal and unwarranted by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">The answer averred, inter alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">4. We deny that the Oley Valley Railway Company asserts the right and proposes to construct and operate a street passenger railway in front of plaintiff\u2019s properties, or upon any street in the borough of Boyertown, as alleged in the fourth paragraph of plaintiff\u2019s bill. The said railway company proposes to construct and operate a railroad from the city of Reading to and into the borough of Boyertown under the authority of the general railroad laws of April 4, 1868, February 19, 1849, and their supplements, under which it is incorporated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and to operate said railroad for the transportation of freight and passengers as authorized by law, subject to such limitations within the borough of Boyer town, as are prescribed in the ordinance approved December 17, 1900, as aforesaid, and to set up poles and wires along Reading avenue and Philadelphia avenue, within the borough of Boyertown, as authorized by said ordinance, for the purpose of operating or propelling cars by means of electricity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">The court refused a preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the refusal of a preliminary injunction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-7\"><em>Isaae Hiester, </em>with him <em>O.

Justice Bbown,</author>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">That the Oley Yalley Railway Company, incorporated under the general railroad act of April 4,1868, proposes to construct a street passenger railway on the streets of the borough of Boyer-town, is so manifest that it is hardly conceivable how, in good faith, it can insist that its purpose is different. With the bill, answer and the borough ordinance of December 17, 1900, formally accepted by the appellee, before us, the only possible conclusion is, that it has undertaken to exercise a right expressly withheld from it by the statute creating it. Its effort is not even a cunning or ingenious device to evade the plain terms of the act, but a bold defiance of them, notwithstanding the protestations in its answer. The learned judge below should have so told it. In Gaw v. Bristol &amp; Bridgewater Railroad Co., 196 Pa. 442, upon which he seems to have relied, it was distinctly found as a fact, upon sufficient evidence, that it had not been shown that the intention of the company was to operate a \u201c railroad as a street passenger railway only, and not as a steam railroad, within the meaning of the law.\u201d There could be no such finding here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">For a case like this, the act of June 19,1871 was passed, and the appellant properly turned to it as authority to the court to issue its summary process for the protection of his property from injury resulting from the unauthorized and illegal act of the appellee. As it does not possess the right or franchise to do what it proposes to do, that process should go out. At this time, no other question need be considered and nothing else need be said. The decree refusing the preliminary injunction is reversed and the record is remitted to the court below, with direction that it order the preliminary injunction to issue as prayed for in the bill, the costs of this appeal to be paid as may be directed on final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
