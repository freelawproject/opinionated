It appeared that it was the plaintiff\u2019s practice to charge the taxes against the company, and not as expenses. On this subject the referee reported as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">It appeared from Mr. Balfour\u2019s cross-examination that he, as treasurer of the company, was the only person who drew or could draw checks upon the deposit account of the company, which was kept in the Quaker City National Bank, and that the checks showed on their faces the purposes for which they were drawn, as for fire losses, taxes, etc. A number of sample checks were produced before the referee. It was argued from this that as Balfour knew that the checks were drawn to pay taxes from the bank account of the company, he must have known that Kane was not paying the taxes as he did other \u201cexpenses of the company, and that, therefore, he must have known and acquiesced in Kane\u2019s practice of charging these taxes against the company. The argument does not, however, convince the referee. Mr. Balfour\u2019s practice in thus signing checks is not inconsistent with his belief and expectation that the amounts would be charged in the books against Kane\u2019s commissions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">Up to April, 1897, the relations of the parties were entirely friendly; no cause of difference had developed; Mr. Balfour reposed entire confidence in Kane, and left all the details of the business to him. Neither party seemed to have any thought that any difference of opinion existed between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">' The referee has concluded, as matter of law, that the words \u201c all expenses \u201d in this contract, includes the annual taxes paid by the company, and is further of opinion that the evidence of a usage or custom contrary thereto, or of any waiver of a right arising by virtue of that contract, must be sufficiently clear and distinct to enable the referee to find something equivalent to a new agreement upon the subject. Such is not the case here, and the referee accordingly is of the opinion, and so concludes, that the legal effect of the contract between the parties was not varied by any contrary usage, custom or waiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Exceptions to the referee\u2019s report were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in dismissing exceptions to referee\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-5\"><em>John G. </em>Johnson, with him <em>H.

The circumstances were peculiar. Everything was in the hands of the plaintiff. As to real ownership, Balfour was the company, but as to management the plaintiff was the company. The books though nominally the books of the company were in fact his books, kept by his employees under his orders and supervision. The entries therefore were evidence against him, but only in a limited and qualified way evidence for him. Clark, though the secretary of the company, was a mere figurehead wholly under the domination and control of plaintiff who put him in his position, paid his salary and gave him his orders. In regard to this very subject of the charge of the taxes against the company, Clark testified that Balfour told him counsel had advised that such charge was wrong and asked, \u201c What do you think about it? I said I was hardly capable of judging. ... I told him it would be a matter for him to see Mr. Kane about.\u201d This is not the language of an officer of the company taking care of its interests, but of an employee taking orders from Kane as his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Cotemporary construction of a contract by acts of the parties is entitled to very great weight, but it ought to appear with reasonable certainty that they were acts of both parties, done with knowledge, and in view of a purpose at least consistent with that to which they are now sought to be applied. In the present case there was no ratification shown or even knowledge of the entries as to taxes, which was sufficient to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>construction by the parties. The claim rests on inference from the entries in the boobs which, as already said, were in fact the boobs of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">On the meaning of the words, \u201c all expenses of the company \u201d as used by the parties, we entertain no doubt. The effect of the contract was that plaintiff was to run the entire business as sole manager, was to take twenty per cent of the gross premiums received, pay the expenses and keep the balance saved as his compensation. The expenses meant everything paid out in the course of the business for the purposes of running it, all costs, outlays and charges incident to its maintenance and prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Prima facie everything which the company would have had to pay out in the prosecution of the business in the ordinary way, was a part of the \u201cexpenses of the company\u201d which by his contract the plaintiff assumed. Taxes were a part of such expenses due annually as part of the price of doing the business, just as a license fee would be in the case of auctioneers or dealers within the license tax statutes. The parties in their contract made certain specified exceptions, and thereby excluded all others.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Appeal dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
