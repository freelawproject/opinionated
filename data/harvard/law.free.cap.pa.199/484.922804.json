In such a case the privilege accorded to the widow, who, by virtue of her dower, is regarded as a purchaser, is purely personal, and does not extend to the brothers and sisters, who are volunteers.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AM2\">Argued April 2, 1901.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3j\">Appeal, No. 60, Jan.

T., 1882, No. 458, sustaining exceptions to adjudication in the estate of Albert Forepaugh, deceased.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ACl\">Before McCollum, C.

He also gave to his adopted daughter the interest of $10,000 for her life, and at her death the principal to her children, and if she should leave no child, then equally to his said brothers and sisters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-13\">The total personal estate amounted to $16,777.71, and that sum was awarded in trust for the widow, her legacy, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>given in lieu of dower not being called to abate: Haddock\u2019s Estate, 16 W. N. C. 196.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\">On the death of the widow the stepdaughter claimed that ten thirty-fifths of the fund representing the ratio which the fund for her use bore to that for the widow, should be awarded to her for life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">There can be no doubt, we think, of the justice of this demand. The privilege accorded to the widow, who, by virtue of her dower, is regarded as a purchaser, was purely personal, and did not extend to the brothers and sisters, who are volunteers. The privilege died with the person whom it was intended to benefit, and as between the remaining parties the legacies abate proportionally, just as they would have abated if the bequest of the $25,000 had been to any other than a purchaser. The exceptions are sustained, and adjudication and award amended accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-8\"><em>Richard 0. </em>Bale,for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZK\">cited: Duncan v.
