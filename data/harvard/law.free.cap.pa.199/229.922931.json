Although the day was rainy, the view of the tracks was not obstructed. She twice saw the car which she expected to take. She stated that when she looked last the car was about half a square off; she continued: \u201c Then I started on, and I had an umbrella, and it was very windy and raining, and I did not hear anything until I was knocked over. Q. Where were you when you were struck ? A. I was about the middle of the last track.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">Defendant set up as a defense a release of damages executed by the defendant with her mark. The plaintiff testified that this paper was presented to her at the hospital when she was suffering great pain; that it was not read to her; that the agent of the defendant lifted her left hand and touched the index finger to the pen; that this was not her voluntary act, but represented the physical force of the agent: that she did not know that she was signing anything, and that she did not know that money had been left near the table at her bed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-9\">The court gave binding instructions for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-10\">Yerdict and judgment for defendant.

Justice Bbown,</author>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">This case was properly taken from the jury, and we must assume, in the absence of any reason given by the learned trial judge, that it was for the right one that the appellant\u2019s carelessness and negligence stood in the way of her right to recover, and not for the wrong one that, by her alleged release, she had discharged the company from all liability to her. At any rate, the judgment is what it ought to be, and, as there was a good and controlling reason for directing the verdict for the defendant, it cannot be disturbed because the court may have relied upon the wrong one and overlooked the right one. The evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence was slight, but sufficient to go to the jury; the court could not have correctly held that the paper purporting to be the release of the plaintiff bound her, for it could have been fairly found as a fact that it was not her act for the purpose appearing on its face; and, but for her negligence in contributing to her injuries, which is so plain that we must so pronounce it, she might recover. As it is, she cannot. The assignment that the court erred in instructing the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, is overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
