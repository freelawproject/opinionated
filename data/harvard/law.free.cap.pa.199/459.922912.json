First, because they are not judgment creditors; second, because the claim is barred by the statute of limitations; third, because of the laches of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-6\">I find the facts to b'e as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">1. That on August 27, 1887, the firms of Robert Hare Powel &amp; Company and Robert Hare Powel\u2019s Sons &amp; Company made an assignment for the ben\u00e9fit of creditors to the Guarantee Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Company; that John C. Bradley, Robert H. Powel, DeVeaux Powel and Henry B. Powel were all members of both firms. One of the firms was in the coal business, the other in the iron business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-8\">2. That at the time of the assignment, to wit: August 27, 1887, there was a deposit of $25,128.79 in the Fourth Street National Bank, defendant, to the credit of the firm of Robert Hare Powel &amp; Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-9\">3.

Brisbin et ah, trading as the Houtzdale Bank, to the amount of $11,719.29; Atlantic City National Bank to the amount of $4,100; Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 National Bank of Woodbury to the amount of $3,659.91; Central Banking Company, Mt.

Immediately after the assignment, the counsel for the assignee called on the cashier of the Fourth Street National Bank, defendant, and was informed by the cashier that the bank had made a loan of $100,000 to Robert Hare Powel\u2019s Sons &amp; Company (afterward reduced by a payment to $90,000), and that there had been a promise made by W. W. Kurtz, who applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>for the loan, \u201c that they would keep a balance of $25,000 m bank, which would go towards the liquidating of these debts, and that balance was to be kept there until the notes were paid off in full,\u201d and showed him the papers they had claiming the deposit should go toward paying the notes. After that no claim was made by the assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">6. The first knowledge the plaintiff had of the fund in the Fourth Street National Bank was about three years prior to the filing of this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">7. None of the plaintiffs are judgment creditors of Robert Hare Powel &amp; Company, but their claims have been proved and allowed by the auditor of the assignee\u2019s account of Robert Hare Powel &amp; Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">The court held that the statute of limitations barred the claim and accordingly dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-9\"><em>James W.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">This is a bill by creditors of two insolvent assigned estates against an alleged debtor to the estates and the joint assignee of both. There are some averments against the assignee which amount to a charge of concealed fraud upon its part, but even if they were true they would not affect the position of the main defendant, the Fourth Street National Bank, and are therefore irrelevant and immaterial in the present case. The assigned estates were those of two firms doing separate business under distinct names, but composed of the same partners. At the time of the assignments the bank had on deposit funds of one of the firms which it claimed the right to hold under special con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tract,-to meet maturing notes of the other. In August or- September, 1887,- the assignee called upon the bank in reference to the .deposit and was informed of the bank\u2019s claim to hold it. After examining the evidence on the subject the assignee acquiesced in the claim and took no further steps to assert the rights of the assigned estates or his own as assignee. The learned judge below rightly held that this was equivalent to a demand on the bank and a refusal by it to pay. It had all the substantial elements of a demand, and was clearly a refusal. A right of action therefore accrued at once and the statute of limitations began to run. This bill was not filed until eleven years afterwards. It was too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 want of discovery or knowledge of the deposit and of the assignee\u2019s acquiescence in its retention by the bank was wholly immaterial. The bank\u2019s refusal was openly made, to the only party it was bound to know or to account to in the matter. There was no element of concealment on its part which could in any manner affect the running of the statute in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Decree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
