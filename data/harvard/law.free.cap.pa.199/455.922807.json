Kohler, for life, with remainder to \u201csuch person or persons as would be entitled thereto if my said son John F.

Kohler died September 12, 1900, having survived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>his wife, and by his will, dated May 28, 1897, gave his entire estate to his \u201c adopted daughter Esther P. Kohler Keen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">By order of the court of common pleas of Bucks county, dated September 9, 1889, upon proceedings duly had, it was decreed that, \u201c the said Esther P. Keen, an adult person, shall have all the rights of a child and heir of the adopting parent, John F. Kohler, and be subject to the duties of such child, and that she shall assume the name of Esther P. Kohler Keen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">The auditing judge (Ashman, J.), found that said adopted daughter was the <em>\u201c </em>person \u201d who, upon the death of her father, \u201cwould be entitled by law,\u201d and awarded the fund to her. Exceptions to this finding were dismissed by the court in banc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-8\"><em>J. Campbell </em>Lancaster, with him <em>Charles E. </em>Lex, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4X\">Adopted children are not children of the person by whom they have been adopted, and the act-of assembly does not attempt the impossibility of making them such: Schafer v. Eneu, 54 Pa. 304; Sunderland\u2019s Est., 60 Iowa, 732; Meader v. Archer, 65 N. H. 214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-9\">It is submitted that the important consideration in this case is the fact that testator having made his will in 1853, having died in 1868, and the adoption act under which such adoption was made not having been passed- until 1889, not only could not his actual intention have been to benefit an adopted child, but his legal intention must be considered to be as of the time that he made his will: Mullock v. Souder, 5 W. &amp; S. 198; Packer v. Packer, 179 Pa. 580; Martindale v. Warner, 15 Pa. 471.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-10\">Though a will, it is true, does not take effect until after the testator's death, yet it is inchoate, though not consummate, from the execution of it, and for many purposes in law it relates to the time of the making of it: Packer v. Packer, 179 Pa. 580; Quin\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 444; Neal\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 214; Taylor v. Mitchell, 57 Pa. 209; Gable\u2019s Executors v.

Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The learned judge below very forcibly said: \u201c The will of John Kohler, father of the cestui que trust, was written thirty-six years before the decree of adoption, and that event therefore was not reasonably' within the contemplation of the testator. But as he gave the estate to those persons to whom the law would give it in the case of intestacy, he cannot be said to have had any particular class of heirs or next of kin in view, and he committed the question of determining who should take to the law itself.\u201d And it is only necessary to add that a testator who commits the distribution of his estate to the law, upon the happening of an event necessarily future, must reasonably be presumed to have contemplated the possibility of a change in the law in the mean time. McGunnigle v. McKee, 77 Pa. 81, and Johnson\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 346, were decided on this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
