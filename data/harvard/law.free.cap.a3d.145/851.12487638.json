The plaintiff, The Indian Spring Land Company, appeals from the trial court's judgment dismissing its appeal from the decision of the defendant Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency of the Town of Greenwich (agency)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   granting the plaintiff's application to construct a gravel access road subject to certain conditions. Upon review of \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1), we conclude that road construction directly related to farming operations is permitted as of right under the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 et seq. ; and, therefore, that the agency did not have jurisdiction to regulate the construction of the plaintiff's access road. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff is the owner of an unimproved tract of land consisting of approximately 121.5 acres located in a residential section of the town of Greenwich (town). Since acquiring it in 1912, the plaintiff has largely maintained the property as forest land, and, from at least 1975\n   to the present, the State Forester has designated the property as forest land within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 12-107a et seq. (providing, inter alia, for classification of land as forest land for property tax assessment purposes). The northeast compartment of the property, consisting of approximately 70.85 acres (northeast compartment), is the subject of the present appeal. The interior of the northeast compartment is essentially landlocked by surrounding public roads and private property and only accessible via a narrow strip of the plaintiff's property on Zaccheus Mead Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2011, the plaintiff retained a certified forester, Starling Childs of Ecological and Environmental Consulting\n   Services, Inc. (consultant), to perform a survey of the northeast compartment and develop a forest and land management plan in order to institute targeted and systematic forest management practices. The consultant prepared a management plan, dated November 18, 2011 (management plan), which contained the following information about the northeast compartment. The northeast compartment consists of mixed hardwood forest\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   typical of a southern Connecticut coastal forest ecosystem. Although the forest is of mixed age overall, many of the canopy trees present are between 80 and 100 years old and other trees growing in the area are between 40 and 60 years old. Numerous unused paths and former farm pastures are located in the northeast compartment, many of which have been colonized and overgrown by various invasive shrubs and vines\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   over the preceding thirty years. Several wetlands areas and small ponds are located within the northeast compartment. In 2010, a strong storm uprooted and damaged a significant number of trees in the northeast compartment and the resulting deadfall and broken limbs still litter the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The management plan recommended that the plaintiff periodically use mechanized forestry mowers, chainsaws,\n   and brush cutters, in addition to the application of herbicides and targeted propane torches, in order to remove the pervasive invasive species on the property and ensure the unimpeded health of native tree species. The management plan also acknowledged that removing the invasive shrubs and vines would eliminate a major habitat for the black-legged deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which serves as a vector for Lyme disease. The management plan further recommended that the plaintiff bring a high horsepower logging tractor onto the property in order to clear out the excess fallen trees and limbs so as to reduce the risk of forest fires during dry spells and provide more room for growth of the forest understory. As a means of accessing the northeast compartment, the\n   management plan recommended that the plaintiff construct a gravel access road from the strip of its property accessed by Zaccheus Mead Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 18, 2012, the plaintiff submitted an application, modified on various dates thereafter, to the agency seeking permission to perform invasive species mitigation and other forest management work and to construct a gravel access road leading from Zaccheus Mead Lane into the interior of the northeast compartment. The proposed route of the access road crossed a small wetland measuring approximately 5684 square feet, or 0.13 acres. In its application, the plaintiff proposed constructing a 17.5 foot concrete bridge that would span the wetland, yet leave the underlying wetland itself undisturbed. The agency considered the plaintiff's application at a public meeting on February 27, 2012, and ultimately concluded that it required additional information from the plaintiff in order to arrive at a decision. Several landowners with property abutting the northeast compartment-Sidney E. Goodfriend, Tina Jones, George J. Henry, and Ellen C. Weld (collectively intervenors)-attended the agency meeting\n   and expressed initial concerns regarding the plaintiff's proposal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 16, 2012, the plaintiff, through its consultant, responded to the agency's request for additional information on the proposed access road. The plaintiff's response analyzed the other possible means of ingress into the northeast compartment and ultimately concluded that the proposed point of access via the portion of its property on Zaccheus Mead Lane was the most prudent and feasible of the potential alternatives. Jones, Henry, and Weld filed a verified petition to intervene with the agency on March 20, 2012. Two days later, the plaintiff filed an additional report with the agency that outlined two alternative ways in which the bridge could cross the wetland located on the proposed route of the access road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 25, 2012, the agency directed Robert Clausi, the town's senior wetlands analyst, to conduct an onsite investigation and field study of the wetland to be affected by the plaintiff's proposal. Following his investigation, Clausi submitted a report to the agency on April 26, 2012, that recommended that the agency issue a letter of permission to the plaintiff pursuant to the agricultural exemption in \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1). The next day Goodfriend submitted to the agency his verified petition to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 29, 2012, as to the plaintiff's proposed forestry operations, the agency issued a letter of permission to the plaintiff, finding that those operations were permitted as of right and not subject to the regulatory oversight\n   of the agency. On the same day, however, as to the plaintiff's proposed construction of the gravel access road, the agency issued a permit with special conditions to the plaintiff, finding that the proposed construction was a regulated activity that must be conducted within the parameters set by the agency in the permit (permit). The special conditions attached to the permit significantly differed from the initial proposals that the plaintiff had made to the agency in its application. Most notably, rather than the 17.5 foot concrete bridge originally proposed by the plaintiff, the agency required that the wetland\n   be crossed using a twenty-five foot removable steel bridge. The conditions attached to the permit gave the agency final authority over the plaintiff's final road construction design and required the plaintiff to remove the steel bridge from the northeast compartment after \"each [six to eight] week harvest season.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 11, 2012, the plaintiff appealed the agency's decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43, primarily arguing that its road construction activities are directly related to its farming operations and are therefore permitted as of right under \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1). Over the next several months, the intervenors filed motions to intervene in the trial court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 22a-19 (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and also filed their own separate appeals from the agency's decision. On September 24, 2012, the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion to consolidate its own\n   action with the intervenors' separate appeals. The trial court heard argument in the consolidated action on March 22, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 19, 2013, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision, finding that the agency had the necessary jurisdiction to attach special conditions to the plaintiff's permit. The trial court also determined that road construction is not exempt from the regulatory oversight of municipal wetlands agencies under \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) and that the agency could therefore regulate the construction of the plaintiff's gravel access road in the northeast compartment. Concluding that it would be improper for it to determine whether the special conditions set forth in the permit were supported by evidence in the record, the trial court remanded the matter to the agency to reexamine the conditions in light of the record before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to the trial court's remand order, the agency held a hearing on November 25, 2013, in order to reexamine the special conditions attached to the plaintiff's permit. In reviewing the record before it, the agency determined that the plaintiff's proposed gravel road spanned several vernal pools\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   where various scientists had observed \"vigorous\" frog and salamander activity. The agency also determined that the record before it demonstrated that permanent structures spanning the wetlands could result in changes to the hydrology and temperature of the wetlands that could adversely affect their ecology and viability as amphibian breeding sites. Accordingly, the agency determined that the record\n   contained substantial evidence supporting the special conditions affixed to the plaintiff's permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following a status conference on the remand in the trial court, the agency held an additional meeting on April 28, 2014, in which it further discussed the information\n   on the record and voted in favor of imposing the special conditions. The plaintiff thereafter challenged the agency's actions on remand, arguing to the trial court that the record did not contain substantial evidence supporting the special conditions, particularly the special condition requiring that the steel bridge be periodically removed. On November 12, 2014, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision concluding that there was sufficient evidence in the record for the agency to conclude that the special conditions were necessary. The trial court observed that in order to find for the plaintiff, the court would be required to exercise its own discretion in place of the agency and evaluate the evidence in the record. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's appeal. The plaintiff appealed the trial court's judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199(c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The dispositive issue before this court is whether the phrase \"road construction or the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming operation\" in \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) properly subjects all road construction to the regulatory oversight of municipal wetlands agencies or whether road construction directly related to farming operations is permitted as of right and does not therefore require the approval of a wetlands agency. The plaintiff argues that the construction of its gravel access road is directly related to its farming operation and that the trial court therefore improperly interpreted \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) by reading the word \"or\" in the phrase \"road construction or the erection of buildings\" in a disjunctive\n   manner. The agency and the intervenors counter that the trial court properly construed the statute, and that its plain meaning provides the agency with jurisdiction to regulate the plaintiff's construction of the access road. We conclude that the trial court incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) and that, when properly construed, the agency did not have jurisdiction over the construction of the plaintiff's gravel access road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the present case requires us to discern the meaning of a statute, our analysis of \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) is guided by General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z and standard principles of statutory construction.

The statute therefore strikes a balance between ensuring the longterm viability of wetlands ecosystems and encouraging beneficial social and economic activities. See\n   <em>\n    Brecciaroli v. Commissioner of Environmental Protection,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"568841\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/168/349/#p354\">\n    168 Conn. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20A.2d%20948\">\n    362 A.2d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) (\"[the] laudable state policy [of the statute] must be balanced [against] the interests of the private landowner who wishes to make productive use of his wetland\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 22a-40 (a)(1), however, establishes an explicit exception for certain agricultural activities, including \"[g]razing, farming, nurseries, gardening and harvesting of crops and farm ponds of three acres or less essential to the farming operation....\" Under Connecticut law, the definition of \" 'farming' \" encompasses, among numerous other activities, forestry. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1(q). Accordingly, a landowner undertaking such activities may perform them as of right and need not seek the approval of a municipal wetlands agency. The statute does carve out some activities that are not subject to the blanket agricultural exemption and are therefore within the regulatory ambit of the municipal wetlands agencies: \"The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to include road construction or the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming operation, relocation of watercourses with continual flow, filling or reclamation of wetlands\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   watercourses with continual flow, clear cutting of timber except for the expansion of agricultural crop land, the mining of top soil, peat, sand, gravel or similar material from wetlands or watercourses for the purposes of sale....\" General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1). It is the phrase \"road construction or the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming operation\" that serves as the basis of the parties' present dispute over whether the agency had the\n   authority to attach special conditions to its permit authorizing the plaintiff's access road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiff argued before the trial court that its access road-which was directly related to its forestry activities and did not require the filling of any wetlands-was permitted as of right under \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) and that the agency did not have jurisdiction to impose the permit conditions that it did. In response, the agency argued that it could regulate the plaintiff's road because the plain meaning of \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) provides the agency with jurisdiction over all road construction of any type whatsoever. Specifically, the agency asserted that the word \"or\" in the phrase \"[t]he provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to include road construction\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming operation\"; (emphasis added) General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) ; should properly be construed to mean that road construction, even if directly related to a farming operation, should always be subject to the agency's jurisdiction. In other words, the agency urged that the word \"or\" should be read disjunctively so that the phrase \"not directly related to the farming operation\" modifies \"erection of buildings\" but not \"road construction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court agreed with the agency's position and concluded that the plain meaning of \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) provides municipal wetlands agencies with the jurisdiction to regulate all types of road construction. In reaching its conclusion, the trial court relied heavily on the Appellate Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Red 11, LLC v.

(Emphasis added.) Relying on the rule of statutory construction that a\n   word used multiple times in the same statute should be ascribed a consistent meaning throughout, the trial court read the word \"or\" at issue disjunctively, given the disjunctive reading of \"or\" elsewhere in \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) by the Appellate Court. See\n   <em>\n    In re Jusstice W.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20652\">\n    308 Conn. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20A.3d%20487\">\n    65 A.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ( \"where the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Additionally, the trial court found that construing \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) to subject all road construction to regulation was consistent with the overall purpose of the statute and furthered the legislative trend of providing wetlands with increased protection. Upon our own reading of the statute, however, we conclude that the trial court incorrectly construed the statute and that when read properly, the agency did not have jurisdiction to regulate the construction of the plaintiff's access road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, the plain language of the text of \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1), as evinced by the legislature's sentence structure and use of punctuation, makes it clear that road construction directly related to farming operations is exempt from the regulatory oversight of municipal wetlands agencies.

See generally W. Strunk &amp; E. White, The Elements of Style (Pearson 4th Ed.2000) pp. 2-3. Accordingly, as dictated by its punctuation and structure, \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) lists five distinct activities that are subject to agency oversight, namely: (1) road construction or the erection of buildings not directly related to farming operations; (2) the relocation of watercourses with continual flow; (3) the filling or reclamation of wetlands or watercourses with continual flow; (4) clear cutting of timber for purposes other than increasing crop land; and (5) the mining of soils or other materials from wetlands for commercial sale. There is no comma separating \"road construction\" from \"or the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming operation\" in \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) that would thereby require all road construction for any purpose to be subject to regulation,\n   as the agency urges. We therefore conclude that the modifying phrase, \"not directly related to the farming operation,\" applies with equal force to both \"road construction\" and \"the erection of buildings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had the legislature intended all road construction, and not just that unrelated to agricultural activity, to be regulated, it could have included a comma after \"road construction,\" thus setting road construction apart as its own separate category subject to regulation.

To adopt the interpretation of the trial court would, however, result in unreasonable outcomes. For example, to read \"road construction\" as a separate regulated activity from \"the erection of buildings not directly related to the farming operation\" would lead to a municipal wetlands agency regulating only certain parts of a discrete agricultural activity. Consider an agricultural landowner who decides to construct a new barn or silo for his farm on a portion of his property that contains wetlands. Under \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1), the landowner is permitted to undertake the new\n   building construction as of right and the local wetlands agency would have no jurisdiction over the landowner's activity. Under the trial court's interpretation, however, the local wetlands agency would have jurisdiction to regulate the construction of a farm road leading to the new barn but not the construction of the barn itself. Such a result is plainly unreasonable and does nothing to further the goals of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, we conclude that the meaning of the statute is plain on its face, such that it consistently vests jurisdiction in local wetlands agencies only where road construction and the erection of buildings is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   directly related to farming operations.\n   Additionally, we observe that the decision of the Appellate Court that the trial court relied on in reaching its own interpretation,\n   <em>\n    Red 11, LLC v. Conservation Commission,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066955\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/630/#p645\">\n    117 Conn.App. at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20917\">\n    980 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is distinguishable from the question of statutory interpretation in the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Red 11, LLC,\n   </em>\n   the Appellate Court was required to interpret the phrase \"filling or reclamation of wetlands or watercourses with continual flow\" in \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1). The principal issue before the Appellate Court was whether that phrase applied to all wetlands or only wetlands with continual flow.\n   <em>\n    Red 11, LLC v. Conservation Commission,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 644,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20917\">\n    980 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court read the word \"or\" in the phrase \"wetlands or watercourses with continual flow\" disjunctively. Id., at 645-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20917\">\n    980 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This was, however, due to the fact that in previous decisions the court had read the phrase \"with continual flow\" to apply only to watercourses and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to wetlands. Id., at 646-47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=980%20A.2d%20917\">\n    980 A.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no analogue in the present case; we have never held that the language \"not directly related to the farming operation\" applies only to the erection of buildings and not road construction. Although the trial court and the agency are correct that we should strive to interpret the language of statutes in an internally consistent manner;\n   <em>\n    In re Jusstice W.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20652\">\n    308 Conn. at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20A.3d%20487\">\n    65 A.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we need not clash with prior decisions and the overall purpose of particular statutes in doing so.

We briefly note that our decision in the present case leaves our decision in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   undisturbed. In\n   <em>\n    Taylor,\n   </em>\n   we addressed whether \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) permits an agricultural landowner to fill wetlands as of right in order to construct roads\n   directly related to the farming operation. Id., at 61-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.3d%201199\">\n    24 A.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We specifically declined in that instance to address the claim that we resolve in the present case, namely whether the construction of roads directly related to farming operations is itself permitted as of right.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.3d%201199\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 67 n. 10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.3d%201199\">\n    24 A.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   we determined that \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) does not permit the filling of wetlands for the purpose of road construction, regardless of\n   the road's relation to the farming operation, because the statute clearly provides for the regulation of activities that require wetlands to be filled. Id., at 70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20A.3d%201199\">\n    24 A.3d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In conclusion, the plain language of \u00a7 22a-40 (a)(1) provides that road construction directly related to a farming operation is excluded from the regulatory oversight of municipal wetlands agencies, unless the manner of that construction implicates some other matter within the scope of that oversight, as in\n   <em>\n    Taylor.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the agency had no jurisdiction to attach special conditions to the plaintiff's gravel access road into the northeast compartment, as the road was to be constructed solely for the purpose of transporting equipment onto the property to complete forestry work. We therefore conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the agency had jurisdiction over the plaintiff's access road and improperly rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the plaintiff's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 provides in relevant part: \"(a) The following operations and uses shall be permitted in wetlands and watercourses, as of right:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    \"(1) Grazing, farming, nurseries, gardening and harvesting of crops and farm ponds of three acres or less essential to the farming operation, and activities conducted by, or under the authority of, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for the purposes of wetland or watercourse restoration or enhancement or mosquito control.
