(Lyft) and Kim Lyons, a reporter for PG Publishing, Inc., d/b/a The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (collectively, PG) from two orders of the Public Utility Commission (PUC). Lyft challenges the PUC's rejection of the alleged proprietary status of its trip data for the period before it obtained experimental authority to operate as a transportation network company (TNC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lyft argues the\n   PUC misapplied the standard for a protective order, and that its decision is unsupported by substantial evidence. PG seeks review of the PUC's denial of its intervention to ensure public access to PUC proceedings, and more specifically to Lyft's trip data. PG asserts the PUC erred in denying it party status because its intervention at the administrative level is necessary to assure the public's right of access to PUC proceedings. As to proprietary status, we affirm the PUC; however, because PG achieved its interest in intervention, we dismiss PG's cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lyft offers a mobile ride-sharing application (Lyft App) that connects riders with drivers, who may at their discretion provide riders with transportation for compensation. Lyft filed two applications with the PUC for authority to provide experimental transportation service, one application covering Allegheny County, and one covering the entire Commonwealth. Following hearings, the administrative law judges (ALJs) assigned to the case issued initial decisions denying Lyft's applications. Lyft filed exceptions. Ultimately, the PUC approved the applications, granting Lyft experimental authority to operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a separate PUC proceeding, the Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement (BIE) filed a complaint against Lyft alleging violation of the Public Utility Code (Code), 66 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101 -3316. BIE also filed a petition for interim emergency order, requesting Lyft cease and desist its operations in Allegheny County. The ALJs granted BIE's cease and desist petition, and certified the matter to the PUC as a material question. The PUC granted BIE's petition and directed Lyft to cease and desist from using the Lyft App until it secured authority to operate, or until BIE's complaint was dismissed. Lyft and BIE subsequently settled the complaint without Lyft admitting any liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the hearings on the applications, the ALJs issued an interim order requesting evidence as to the number of trips Lyft provided in Pennsylvania through the Lyft App before receiving authority to operate. Specifically, it sought the number of trips in Allegheny County during the following three timeframes: (1) from the initiation of Lyft's service in February 2014 to June 5, 2014 (the date BIE filed the complaint); (2) from June 5, 2014 to July 1, 2014 (the effective date of the cease and desist order); and, (3) from July 1, 2014 to August 8, 2014 (the date the record in the complaint proceeding closed). Lyft filed a petition for a protective order pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205.423\">\n    52 Pa. Code \u00a7 5.423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recodified at \u00a7 5.365), asserting the proprietary nature of the trip data. The ALJs denied the protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ALJs held an additional hearing on September 3, 2014 (September 3rd hearing), where Lyft requested the ALJs to hold disclosure in abeyance pending the PUC's disposition of the matter. Lyft then presented testimony as to the protective order in a closed proceeding where Kim Lyons was removed. PG unsuccessfully challenged removal at that time. Thereafter, PG filed a petition for interim emergency order (Emergency Petition), seeking to intervene in the application proceedings for the limited purpose of opposing Lyft's protective order and any future attempts to seal the record from public access. PG also asked that the record of the September 3rd hearing be unsealed in its entirety. Lyft filed an answer to PG's Emergency Petition, to which PG replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Relevant here, Lyft filed a petition seeking interlocutory review of the ALJs' denial\n   of its protective order (Interlocutory Petition). Therein, Lyft asked the PUC to address whether \"the trip data of TNCs constitute proprietary information and/or a trade secret that must be restricted from public disclosure.\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 388a. Importantly, Lyft appended to its Interlocutory Petition an affidavit of its Director of Public Policy, Joseph Okpaku, which had not been submitted to the ALJs with its petition for protective order. PG asked the PUC for permission to respond, which the PUC granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2014, the Secretary of the PUC issued a Secretarial Letter directing PG and the parties to the application proceeding to address the factors currently set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205.365\">\n    52 Pa. Code \u00a7 5.365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   regarding orders to limit access to proprietary information. PG and Lyft addressed the alleged proprietary nature of the trip data. In its submission, PG also advocated the public's common law and constitutional\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights to access judicial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ultimately, the PUC concluded the trip data were not proprietary, and it ordered unsealing of the record within 10 days (Proprietary Order). In the same order, the PUC denied PG's Emergency Petition seeking to intervene because PG did not establish immediate or irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the merits, the PUC reasoned: \"[t]he information at issue, the aggregate number of trips Lyft provided prior to receiving authority to operate in Pennsylvania, is of obvious concern to the public and would only be protected from disclosure for extraordinary reasons. Lyft has failed to provide such reasons.\" PUC Op., 10/23/14, at 17. In so concluding, the PUC considered and rejected Mr. Okpaku's affidavit. After noting Lyft's submission of the affidavit was improper, the PUC found it unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The PUC confirmed the trip data are not \"the number of rides in a particular market or the concentration of pick-ups and drop-offs in specific segments of that market. Nor does the information include the start time, duration, location, destination, mileage, charges and other details of these rides.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205.365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It noted the total number of trips in one service territory does not reveal sales patterns, analogizing trip data to the gross sales data to which protection was denied in\n   <em>\n    In re Exelon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201510088\">\n    2000 WL 1510088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2000 Pa. PUC LEXIS 50, Dkt. No. P-00991752 (filed July 20, 2000).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Such aggregated data did not warrant protection as proprietary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because Lyft filed an application to operate in the Commonwealth, the PUC explained \"[t]ransparency is critical and will not be compromised on specious grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Application proceedings require consideration of the public interest in an applicant's service. Here, the PUC determined the public interest weighed in favor of disclosure because the number of trips during the period before Lyft received authority to operate posed a risk to public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lyft filed a petition for reconsideration, which the PUC granted. On reconsideration, the PUC affirmed the Proprietary Order (Reconsideration Order).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lyft sought a stay of the Reconsideration Order, which the PUC granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lyft petitions for review of the Proprietary Order as confirmed in the Reconsideration Order. Lyft asks us to reverse the\n   PUC as to the proprietary nature of Lyft's aggregate trip data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   PG requested limited intervention in Lyft's appeal, asserting a direct interest in ensuring public access to PUC proceedings and the trip data. Lyft moved to strike PG's request. Raiser-PA, LLC (Raiser), Lyft's primary TNC competitor, also asked to intervene to support the proprietary status of trip data, which the PUC moved to strike. After hearing argument on motions to strike, this Court granted PG intervenor status and denied Raiser's request. Significant to our reasoning below, PG participates in Lyft's appeal as a party. Raiser participates as\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   aligned with Lyft's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   PG filed a cross-petition for review of the Proprietary Order to the extent the PUC denied intervention. Lyft filed a notice to intervene in PG's appeal. This Court consolidated the matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After briefing and oral argument, these appeals are ready for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Substantively, we are asked whether the PUC erred in denying Lyft's protective order and determining trip data do not merit proprietary status. Lyft contends the PUC did not analyze the proper factors as to trade secrets and erred in holding the public interest in disclosure outweighed any proprietary interest. Procedurally, we are asked to reverse the PUC's decision\n   denying intervenor status to PG as an advocate of public access. PG claims a right to intervene in the public interest to ensure the application proceedings and the related record remain open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the matters before us, Lyft bears the burden of proving the necessity of a protective order, and PG bears the burden of proving a necessity for emergency relief in the form of intervention. Considering their respective burdens, we evaluate the parties' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Protective Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lyft argues the PUC erred in denying its protective order as to trip data. Lyft contends the trip data evidence qualifies as confidential proprietary information subject to seal. Lyft also asserts the PUC did not apply the proper analysis for determining whether the trip data qualified as a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section 5.365 of the PUC's regulations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205.365\">\n    52 Pa. Code \u00a7 5.365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (Regulation) governs protective orders in PUC proceedings. Patterned after Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure No. 4012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Regulation provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (a) General rule for adversarial proceedings. A petition for protective order to limit the disclosure of a trade secret or other confidential information on the public record will be granted only when a party demonstrates that the potential harm to the party of providing the information would be substantial and that the harm to the party if the information is disclosed without restriction outweighs the public's interest in free and open access to the administrative hearing process. A protective order to protect trade secrets or other confidential information will apply the least restrictive means of limitation which will provide the necessary protections from disclosure.\n   <em>\n    In considering\n   </em>\n   whether\n   <em>\n    a protective order to limit the availability of proprietary information\n   </em>\n   should be issued,\n   <em>\n    the Commission\n   </em>\n   or the presiding officer\n   <em>\n    should consider\n   </em>\n   , along with other relevant factors,\n   <em>\n    the following\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1) The extent to which the disclosure would cause unfair economic or competitive damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (2) The extent to which the information is known by others and used in similar activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (3) The worth or value of the information to the party and to the party's competitors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (4) The degree of difficulty and cost of developing the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (5) Other statutes or regulations dealing specifically with disclosure of the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

Proprietary Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, Lyft argues the PUC misapplied the Regulation by not assessing whether the trip data were proprietary before balancing any proprietary nature against public access. It contends the PUC should have used the six-factor test for trade secrets set forth in\n   <em>\n    Crum v. Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933104\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/907/578/\">\n    907 A.2d 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super.2006), which this Court employed when analyzing trade secrets under the Right-to-Know Law (RTKL).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Pub.

However, Lyft's argument is predicated on its presumption that the PUC is bound by this Court's precedent to apply the\n   <em>\n    Crum\n   </em>\n   test here. In so presuming, Lyft disregards that the definition of trade secret in PUC regulations differs from that contained in the RTKL or in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Act), 12 Pa.

That justification does not exist here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lyft offers no grounds for adopting the\n   <em>\n    Crum\n   </em>\n   test in the PUC context when PUC regulations define trade secret differently and provide a multi-factor test for assessing proprietary status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Regulation sets forth several factors regarding proprietary status, similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Crum\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the PUC did not err in applying the Regulation to discern proprietary status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We are equally unpersuaded that the PUC misapplied the Regulation.

No. R-912017 (filed November 5, 1991) (denying protective order as financial data was \"expressed in aggregate numbers, without sufficient detail to be of significant value to a competitor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After determining the trip data contain insufficient detail for disclosure to cause substantial harm to Lyft, the PUC weighed the public interest in disclosure. In so doing, the PUC considered the content of the trip data and the import of the timing of the trips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The PUC properly considered that the trip data showed that Lyft coordinated a number of trips in Allegheny County before it had authority to do so. As to balancing the interests, the PUC reasoned, \"the aggregate number of trips Lyft provided prior to receiving authority to operate in Pennsylvania, is of obvious concern to the public and would only be protected from disclosure for extraordinary reasons.\" PUC Op. at 17. The PUC concluded the public had a right to know about the extent of Lyft's non-compliance over various periods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After considering the factors in the Regulation as to proprietary status, and weighing Lyft's interest in protection against the public's interest in disclosure, the PUC determined the public interest merited denial of the protection sought here. As the PUC's analysis tracked the Regulation, Lyft's challenges to its approach lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Substantial Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, Lyft asserts the PUC's decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Lyft contends the evidence of record favored protecting the trip data. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Significantly, Lyft bore the burden of proving the trip data qualified for proprietary status. Yet, Lyft submitted no evidence to support its contention. As the PUC points out, Lyft presented only argument in its petition for protective order; it did not buttress its claims with any documentary or testimonial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lyft stated only the following regarding proprietary nature in its petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Lyft participates in a highly competitive industry, as evidenced by the rapid expansion of [TNC] service across the country and the number of TNC applications filed with the PUC in 2014 alone.\n   <em>\n    Public disclosure of the [trip] data\n   </em>\n   requested by the [ALJs'] Interim Order\n   <em>\n    would reveal operational information\n   </em>\n   that would not otherwise be provided to the public\n   <em>\n    and could be used by competitors to extrapolate the data\n   </em>\n   and model Lyft's existing and potential activities in other markets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   As such, the potential harm to Lyft is substantial, and the need for proprietary protection of this information outweighs any need for public disclosure at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   R.R. at 275a-76a (emphasis added). At best, this explanation is speculative and vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In tacit recognition of the lack of evidence submitted to the ALJs, Lyft attempted to submit an affidavit to the PUC to support proprietary nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the PUC explained that regardless of whether Lyft submitted Mr. Okpaku's affidavit to the ALJs for proper consideration, the facts alleged therein would not have altered the result. The PUC found the number of trips in Lyft's service area (Allegheny County) over a span of months, without further detail, constituted aggregate data. We agree with the PUC's well-reasoned conclusion that such aggregated data do not constitute a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    See ITT\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In its brief, Lyft suggests it did not have sufficient opportunity to present evidence regarding the proprietary nature of the trip data. From our review of the record, Lyft did not notify the PUC that it lacked an opportunity to present evidence on this issue. Although Lyft appended Mr. Okpaku's affidavit to its Interlocutory Petition, R.R. at 391a, 398a-401a, Lyft did not advise the evidence was previously unavailable. Because Lyft failed to raise these issues before the agency, the issues are waived.\n   <em>\n    Wheeling\n   </em>\n   (noting PUC is blameless for not considering issue on which the burden-bearing party failed to present evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In opposition to Lyft's petition for protective order, the record also contained two responses to Lyft's petition contesting the proprietary nature of the trip data. A protestor motor vehicle carrier subject to the Code emphasized the trip data offered insight into Lyft's management culture. R.R. at 336a-39a. PG's response amply articulated the interest in public access to the trip data.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20814906\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 371a-81a; 420a-27a. These submissions were adequate to support the PUC's conclusion that the public interest in disclosure outweighed the alleged proprietary interest of an applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In analyzing proprietary status under the Regulation, the PUC recognized the important public interest in ensuring entities have the requisite authority prior to holding themselves out to the public to perform a TNC service. Because Lyft did not submit any evidence of substantial competitive harm, and the record shows a public interest in disclosure, the PUC's decision is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Alleged Inconsistent Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Lastly, Lyft contends the denial of proprietary status is unfair because the PUC protected the trip data of its primary competitor, Raiser, in other proceedings. Essentially, because Raiser's trip data are currently designated as proprietary, Lyft argues its trip data must be similarly protected despite procedural and evidentiary differences. Lyft also asserts the continued proprietary status of Raiser's trip data allows Raiser to obtain a competitive advantage in the Allegheny County market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We are unpersuaded that the PUC treated aggregate trip data disparately. First, the type of proceedings in which the trip data were requested differed. Raiser was involved in a complaint and enforcement proceeding with BIE, not an application to provide services to the public. Second, Raiser's method of submission\n   differed from that of Lyft. Raiser did not request a protective order, and so did not trigger the analysis under the Regulation. Raiser requested to submit the information under a proprietary designation; Raiser declined to provide trip data in discovery requests in the complaint proceeding. As a result, Raiser was charged with significant civil penalties for discovery violations.\n   <em>\n    BIE v. Uber Tech. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 2015 Pa. PUC LEXIS 527, Dkt. No. C-2014-2422723 (ALJ Recommended Decision, filed Nov. 17, 2015). Of primary significance, Raiser's submission of trip data as proprietary was not contested. Thus, the ALJs were not provided with evidence regarding the public interest to weigh against the assertions of proprietary status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, in contrast, Lyft submitted a petition for a protective order under the Regulation. Also, a protestor and PG objected to the protective order. As a result, in the Lyft application proceedings, the PUC had a record of the interests countering those of Lyft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   That the ALJs in Raiser's complaint proceedings permitted trip data to be submitted with a proprietary designation does not trump the PUC's determination of proprietary status in Lyft's application to provide service. Because the PUC ruled on the question, future ALJs faced with the alleged proprietary status of aggregated trip data will have the benefit of the PUC's analysis, and now that of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we uphold the Proprietary Order denying proprietary status to Lyft's aggregated trip data, and the Reconsideration Order confirming its decision as to proprietary status of the information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Intervention in PUC Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Turning to the procedural question presented, PG argues the PUC erred in denying its Emergency Petition seeking to intervene for the limited purpose of accessing the closed record and to oppose future attempts to seal the record. PG notes the PUC treated it as a party, often agreeing with its position. However, PG asserts party status is necessary to ensure it receives notice of any future attempts to seal proceedings or submissions. PG also contends the PUC erred in requiring it to establish immediate or irreparable harm when it has a right to intervene to protect the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The PUC counters that PG participated in the PUC proceedings as to the public access issue. Further, PG was not aggrieved by the PUC's Proprietary Order because the PUC found in favor of PG's position on public access. Therefore, the PUC argues PG had no basis to file a cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   PG filed the Emergency Petition to request intervention.

First, PG suffered no prejudice from denial of its Emergency Petition because it fully participated in the administrative proceedings on the issue of public access, and, by its own admission, was \"essentially treated ... as a party.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PG's Br. at 15 n.2. Second, the PUC ultimately agreed with PG's position and held that the trip data were not protected from disclosure. Because PG sought intervention as a means to that end, PG was not aggrieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Third, the PUC granted Lyft's application for experimental authority to operate, thereby resolving the underlying litigation before the PUC. In fact, there are no scheduled hearings that may be subject to seal; instead, the record before the PUC is closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Order Closing the Record, filed September 17, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Fourth, despite the lack of formal party status before the PUC, this Court granted PG's request to participate as a party to Lyft's appeal here. Thus, PG may advocate the public access issue in any further appellate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Considering these developments together, it appears the results PG sought to achieve by intervention in the PUC proceeding have been attained. Confirming this conclusion, PG concedes a ruling on intervention is requested \"[i]f this Court\n   <em>\n    reverses\n   </em>\n   the PUC's decision that the trip data is [sic] subject to disclosure ....\" PG's Br. at 6 (questions 2 and 3 in the statement of questions involved) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   . at 19 (\"in the event that this Court decides to\n   <em>\n    reverse\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added). Thus, PG's cross-appeal is contingent on this Court's reversal of the PUC's decision on the merits. Because we unanimously affirm the PUC on the merits, there is no need to decide the intervention issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Moreover, \" 'an actual case or controversy must be extant at all stages of review\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    Pap's A.M. v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the PUC's Proprietary Order and the Reconsideration Order are affirmed as to the proprietary status of the trip data. Because PG obtained the relief it sought, and achieved its interest without the grant of party status, there is no further relief to be granted to PG on the intervention issue. Accordingly, PG's cross-appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this 31st day of August, 2016, the orders of the Public Utility Commission are hereby\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   regarding the proprietary status of the trip data. Because there is no further relief to be granted regarding the issue of intervention, and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying opinion, we\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   the cross-appeal of Kim Lyons and PG Publishing, Inc., d/b/a The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRING &amp; DISSENTING OPINION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   JUDGE McCULLOUGH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   I agree with the Majority insofar as it affirms the order of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) concluding that the trip data maintained by Lyft, Inc. (Lyft), did not constitute proprietary information and/or a trade secret, but respectfully dissent from the Majority decision insofar as it dismisses the cross-appeal of Kim Lyons and PG Publishing, Inc., d/b/a The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (PG), from the PUC's order denying its Emergency Petition seeking to intervene in the PUC proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Majority essentially concludes that the matter is moot, questioning \"whether a controversy remains regarding PG's emergency request for relief in the nature of intervention.\" Op. at 1247. In this regard, the Majority holds that PG suffered no prejudice from the denial of its Emergency Petition because it fully participated in the PUC proceedings on the issue of public access, the PUC ultimately agreed with PG's position that the trip data were not protected from disclosure, the litigation before the PUC was resolved and the record closed, and this Court granted PG's request to participate as a party in Lyft's appeal here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   However, there is an exception to the mootness doctrine \"where the conduct complained of is capable of repetition yet likely to evade review, where the case involves issues important to the public interest or where a party will suffer some detriment without the court's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

I believe the exception is applicable here both because this issue may arise in future proceedings before\n   the PUC and this matter involves issues important to the public interest, i.e., unregulated operation of a business in this Commonwealth and deprivation of PG's fundamental First Amendment right to gather news and disseminate that news to the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   To that extent, I disagree with the Majority's holding discussed above. The fact that the PUC ultimately ruled in PG's favor on the issue of proprietary information and that PG participated in Lyft's appeal to this Court does not warrant dismissal of PG's cross-appeal. As noted above, this case involved important issues of public interest, including the denial of a First Amendment right. Section 3.6 of the PUC's regulations, pertaining to petitions for interim emergency orders, provided PG with the appropriate procedural vehicle to assert this right and there was nothing here to justify the denial of PG's petition on either a procedural or substantive basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The record herein establishes that Lyft began operating in Pennsylvania in February 2014 without the approval of the PUC and continued to do so until at least July 2014, when the PUC granted a cease and desist order requested by the Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement. In resolving the issue regarding the proprietary nature of Lyft's trip data, the PUC ultimately determined that the public interest weighed in favor of disclosure because the number of trips during the period before Lyft received authority to operate posed a risk to public safety. Moreover, during the hearings before the PUC on this issue, PG's reporter, Ms. Lyons, was required to leave the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The long line of well-established case law authority of both this Commonwealth and the Federal Courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, made it clear that the First Amendment is the keystone of our Constitutional Republic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v.
