(firm), and Edward G. Fitzpatrick, an attorney in the firm. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court erred in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment by (1) adjudicating, rather than identifying, issues of fact, (2) concluding that their claims were barred by the statute of limitations, and (3) deciding that there were no issues of fact as to the defendants' alleged breach of fiduciary duty. We agree with the plaintiffs' first two claims and, therefore, reverse, in part, the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs commenced the present action by service of process on June 14, 2011. The complaint sounded in three counts: professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In count one, the plaintiffs alleged that, in March, 2005, they retained the defendants to obtain approvals from various land use boards in the town of Middlebury, including the Water\n   Pollution Control Authority (sewer authority), the Planning and Zoning Commission, and the Board of Selectmen, to enable them to develop a senior housing project (project). In August, 2005, the sewer authority conditionally approved the flow capacity for the project, and in September, 2005, sent a letter (2005 letter) to Straw Pond Real Estate, LLC, in care of Fitzpatrick. In the 2005 letter, the sewer authority set forth its conditional capacity approval and the conditions to which the plaintiffs were required to agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sewer authority instructed\n   the plaintiffs to sign the letter and return it.\n   The complaint further alleged that on certain dates in 2006 and 2007, Kenneth J. Pocius, an attorney for the sewer authority, communicated with Fitzpatrick about the status of the 2005 letter. According to the plaintiffs, Fitzpatrick failed to respond to Pocius or to inform them of his inquiries. In October, 2007, the sewer authority invited Fitzpatrick to attend its November, 2007 meeting, but Fitzpatrick was unable to attend the meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs alleged that Fitzpatrick did not tell them that they should attend the meeting. At the November, 2007 meeting, the sewer authority rescinded its conditional capacity approval for the project and thereafter so informed Fitzpatrick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs alleged that the sewer authority rescinded its conditional capacity approval for the project and refused to reinstate it due to Fitzpatrick's inattention to the 2005 letter and Pocius' inquiries about the status of the 2005 letter. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to inform them of the 2005 letter until December, 2007, after the conditional capacity approval had been rescinded. They also alleged that Fitzpatrick had failed to inform them of the action that they needed to take with respect to the 2005 letter or of the consequences of their failing to respond to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs appealed from the sewer authority's rescission of its approval to the Superior Court (sewer\n   appeal), but the appeal was dismissed on March 8, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sewer authority has denied the plaintiffs' efforts and subsequent application to regain capacity approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs further alleged that, in addition to obtaining initial approval from the sewer authority, the defendants acted on their behalf to secure other approvals needed for the project to move forward. Some of the plaintiffs' applications for those other approvals resulted in administrative appeals. The plaintiffs alleged that, from the time they retained the defendants until the time they commenced the present action, they had relied on the defendants, who were their lead counsel charged with getting all of the approvals needed for the project. On August 26, 2009, Fitzpatrick represented the plaintiffs at a global settlement conference to resolve all outstanding project related issues. According to the plaintiffs, the settlement conference failed to meet its objective due to the sewer authority's refusal to reinstate its capacity approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants continuously represented them on all permitting efforts related to the project up to, and including, the dismissal of the sewer\n   appeal in March, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs alleged that they relied to their detriment on the defendants' expertise in obtaining the necessary approvals for similar projects. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants caused them to believe that the harm caused by the defendants' acts and omissions with respect to\n   the sewer authority rescission could be mitigated and a viable final approval for the project obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants failed to exercise diligence and competence, and failed to communicate properly. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants \"put their own and other interests ahead of the plaintiffs' [interests] and failed to keep loyalty and fidelity to the plaintiffs' project as paramount.\" In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' acts and/or omissions were in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including rules 1.1 (competence), 1.3 (diligence), and 1.4 (communication). As a result of the defendants' claimed acts or omissions, the plaintiffs alleged that they have sustained and will sustain substantial damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants filed an amended answer and five special defenses on October 8, 2013. They admitted that the plaintiffs \"authorized\" them to acquire approvals for the project from land use boards and the Middlebury Board of Selectmen, and to negotiate pending zoning and Conservation Commission appeals. The defendants, however, denied that they filed sewer capacity applications on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants admitted that the plaintiffs received capacity approval from the sewer authority \" 'subject to technical approval, assessment and payment discussions and decisions,' \" and that the 2005 letter \"required a signature on the part of Straw Pond Real Estate, LLC, verifying its agreement, amongst other things, to the\n   assessment of hookup fees and expenses to which it did not agree....\" The defendants also admitted that Fitzpatrick received e-mail correspondence from Pocius.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants, however, denied that they failed to tell the plaintiffs about the 2005 letter until December, 2007, failed to inform them of the action they needed to take in response to the letter or the consequences of failing to respond to the letter, and that they \"continued to represent the plaintiffs during 'this entire time.' \" The defendants alleged that the plaintiffs had retained other counsel to represent them with respect to \"specific performance, breach of contract, and zoning appeal matters,\" and to prosecute certain appeals. In addition, although Fitzpatrick attended the August, 2009 settlement conference, the defendants denied that he was the plaintiffs' lead counsel. They denied that they had violated the Rules of Professional Conduct and that they failed to exercise diligence and competence, and failed to communicate properly. The defendants also denied that the plaintiffs sustained damages as a result of their alleged acts or omissions. Moreover, the defendants denied\n   that they breached their fiduciary duties and breached their contract with the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In their special defenses, the defendants alleged that all three counts of the complaint were barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 in that the action was commenced more than three years after the act or omission complained of. The defendants also alleged that, if the plaintiffs sustained any damages, those damages were proximately caused by the plaintiffs' own carelessness and negligence in that they failed to agree to the sewer authority's hookup costs and failed to authorize Fitzpatrick to accept the conditions stated in the 2005 letter. The defendants further pleaded that the plaintiffs failed to mitigate their damages. The plaintiffs replied to the\n   defendants' special defenses in a one sentence general denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 9, 2014, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to all counts of the complaint on the ground that each was barred by \u00a7 52-577.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the alternative, the defendants asserted that all counts of the plaintiffs' complaint fail, as a matter of law, in that the plaintiffs cannot establish a breach of the standard of care, a breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the parties' fee agreement, or that the plaintiffs' alleged damages were caused by the defendants. In their accompanying memorandum of law, the defendants represented that the plaintiffs fully were aware of the 2005 letter and that they declined to sign the letter because they disagreed with the $2.057 million hookup fees and the time constraints the sewer authority had imposed on them\n   with respect to obtaining other board and agency approvals. The defendants also argued that there was no evidentiary support for the plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendants appended numerous documents, including Fitzpatrick's affidavit, to their memorandum of law. In his affidavit, Fitzpatrick attested, in part: \"I personally met with and spoke to Ben Morris, the principal member of Straw Pond with whom I dealt, on multiple occasions concerning the project, including many discussions from September, 2005 through 2007, concerning Straw Pond's refusal to sign the ... 2005 letter of conditional capacity approval.... Ben Morris\n   communicated to me personally that Straw Pond and its affiliates refused to sign the ... letter because it did not agree to the conditions specified, especially the assessment of over [$2 million] in hook-up fees and the two year deadline for obtaining all government agency approvals.\" They also appended copies of the plaintiffs' briefs filed in the sewer appeal in which the plaintiffs admitted that they were aware of the conditions contained in the 2005 letter and that they intentionally refused to sign off on those conditions because they were inconsistent with the sewer authority's August, 2005 authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to count two, which alleged breach of fiduciary duty, the defendants asserted that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. They argued that a proper cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty requires factual allegations impugning an attorney's honesty, morality, or loyalty. The plaintiffs' complaint, they continued, solely alleged conduct that objectively pertains to the alleged breach of the standard of care. They asserted that the plaintiffs' allegations of disloyalty were merely conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 17, 2014, the plaintiffs filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment, contending\n   that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants had been retained to obtain project approval from the sewer authority. They appended numerous documents, including the transcript of Fitzpatrick's deposition testimony, and an affidavit of John Nelson, one of the plaintiffs' principals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs argued that the defendants had represented them at least through the global settlement conference held on August 26, 2009, and that the continuous representation doctrine tolled the running of the statute of limitations. Therefore, they concluded, the action was timely \"filed\" in June, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiffs also argued in their memorandum of law that Fitzpatrick had a conflict of interest in that, while he was representing the plaintiffs before the sewer authority, he represented other applicants seeking an allocation of the limited sewer capacity that was available, and at times he served as counsel for the Naugatuck Regional Water Authority, which provided sewer services for Middlebury. The plaintiffs argued that Fitzpatrick failed to disclose the alleged conflicts of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendants submitted a supplemental memorandum of law and presented evidence that in December,\n   2007, the plaintiffs retained Robert Fuller, an attorney, to pursue the sewer appeal, and Robin M. Pearson, an attorney, to file a new sewer capacity application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants argued\n   that by retaining Fuller and Pearson, the plaintiffs de facto terminated Fitzpatrick's representation for the purpose of obtaining sewer capacity approval for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court issued a memorandum of decision on December 5, 2014, in which it granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. On the basis of the evidence presented, the court concluded with respect to the count of professional negligence that the defendants were not the cause of the plaintiffs' alleged damages. With respect to the count of breach of fiduciary duty, the court stated that the plaintiffs submitted no evidence to raise an issue of fact as to the defendants' loyalty or honesty, but merely alleged a \"bald assertion of disloyalty.\" The court also found that the plaintiffs' claims were barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 52-577, and that the continuous representation doctrine did not toll the running of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a motion to reargue in which they claimed that the court had misapprehended or overlooked significant issues of material fact and that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti v. Aranow,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%201\">\n    154 Conn.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20265\">\n    105 A.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (genuine issue of material fact whether continuing course of treatment doctrine tolled statute of limitations in medical malpractice action), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    321 Conn. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    138 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (same), cast doubt on the trial court's reasoning. The\n   plaintiffs argued that their legal malpractice claim primarily was focused on the defendants' failure to advise them of the sewer authority's inquiries in 2006 and of the November, 2007 sewer authority meeting. The court denied the motion to reargue in a memorandum of decision issued on December 30, 2014, stating that it had considered the plaintiffs' argument, which they made in their objection to the motion for summary judgment, when it granted the motion for summary judgment. The court found, on the basis of the evidence presented, that the plaintiffs knew of the defendants' alleged negligence more than three years prior to commencing the present action and that the continuous representation doctrine did not toll the statute of limitations because, in late 2007 or early 2008, the plaintiffs hired other attorneys to deal with the sewer authority. The plaintiffs appealed from the granting of the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Summary judgment is a method of resolving litigation when pleadings, affidavits, and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

In coming to that conclusion, the court drew inferences from the affidavits before it and chose to credit Fitzpatrick, rather than Nelson, as to whether Fitzpatrick had informed the plaintiffs of the 2005 letter and that it was to be signed and returned. The court also was influenced by the language in the briefs the plaintiffs submitted in their sewer appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   which, according to the court,\n   established that the plaintiffs would not in any event have accepted the conditions that the sewer authority sought to impose on them. For these reasons, the court concluded that the\n   defendants had demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Fitzpatrick committed an act or omission that might constitute professional negligence because he did not inform the plaintiffs of the conditions in the 2005 letter, or that the plaintiffs were damaged by his alleged negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court decided issues of fact and too narrowly defined their claims of professional negligence. They argue that their malpractice claim is founded not only on Fitzpatrick's failure to inform them of the 2005 letter, but also on his failure to inform them of the sewer authority's ongoing inquiries and concerns in 2006 and 2007, his failure to respond to the sewer authority's inquiries, his failure to advise them as to how they should deal with the sewer authority, and, particularly, his failure to inform them that the sewer authority would discuss the project at its November, 2007 meeting, which Fitzpatrick did not attend. Nelson averred that the plaintiffs would have attended that meeting had they known about it. As to the court's findings that the plaintiffs' admitted in their sewer appeal that they did not agree with the conditions the sewer authority imposed in the 2005 letter, the plaintiffs argue in their reply brief to this court, for the first time on appeal, that arguments made in another proceeding are not judicial admissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree that the court improperly made credibility determinations when ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment, but disagree that the court improperly considered the plaintiffs' briefs in the sewer appeal.

We agree with the plaintiffs that the statements in the briefs of their sewer appeal were not judicial admissions. However, as explained in\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   the statements properly were before the court as evidence of the plaintiffs' refusal to sign the 2005 letter because they did not agree with the conditions contained in it. Given that the role of the court in deciding a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether there were genuine issues of material fact, in the face of the evidence in the sewer appeal briefs, the plaintiffs should have presented evidence to put in question whether they objected to the hookup fees and time limitations imposed by the sewer authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Any adverse party shall at least five days before the date the motion is to be considered on the short calendar file opposing affidavits and other available documentary evidence....\" Practice Book \u00a7 17-45. The record before us does not disclose any evidence submitted by the plaintiffs regarding their acceptance of or objection to the sewer authority's conditions or to explain the statements made in the briefs in the sewer appeal on their behalf. Moreover, the plaintiffs did not object to the court's considering the sewer appeal briefs in the trial court. We therefore disagree that the court improperly considered the sewer appeal briefs when deciding the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that the court decided issues of fact and focused its examination of their malpractice claim too narrowly by limiting it to Fitzpatrick's alleged failure to inform them of the 2005 letter.

The court credited Fitzpatrick's attestations that he discussed the 2005 letter with Morris, and found that Nelson's affidavit invited the court to infer that because Morris did not tell him of his conversations with Fitzpatrick they did not occur. \"Issue[s] of fact [encompass] not only evidentiary facts in issue but also questions as to how the trier would characterize such evidentiary\n   facts and what inferences and conclusions it would draw from them.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    United Oil Co. v.

When a court, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, is confronted with conflicting facts, resolution and interpretation of which would require determinations of credibility, summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We agree with the plaintiffs that their claims of professional negligence encompassed more than Fitzpatrick's alleged failure to inform them of the 2005 letter. Nelson attested that the plaintiffs did not know of the sewer authority's invitation for them to attend the November, 2007 meeting. He attested, in relevant part, that \"[i]f we had known that there was going to be a [sewer authority] meeting in November, 2007, where the subject of our sewer capacity allocation was going to be discussed, and if we had known that [Fitzpatrick]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   couldn't be at that meeting representing our interests, we would have taken steps to ensure that someone from our group was there to explain our position to the [sewer authority] and to represent our interests.\" In their motion to reargue, the plaintiffs contended that the November, 2007 meeting was the \" 'last clear chance' \" for them to negotiate with the sewer authority about the conditions of approval and to reach an accord or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For his part, Fitzpatrick testified at his deposition that he had no recollection as to whether he informed the plaintiffs of the November, 2007 meeting. We conclude, on the basis of our review of the evidence submitted in support of, and in objection to, the defendants' motion for summary judgment, that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning the November, 2007 meeting. It is unclear whether Fitzpatrick informed the plaintiffs of the meeting and what might have transpired if the plaintiffs had attended. We, therefore, agree with the plaintiffs that the court too narrowly focused the plaintiffs' claim of professional negligence solely on the alleged failure of Fitzpatrick to inform the plaintiffs of the 2005 letter. Because there are genuine issues of material fact related to the allegations of professional negligence, we conclude that the court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiffs second claim is that the court improperly granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the ground that their claims were barred by the statute of limitations, \u00a7 52-577. They argue that the statute of limitations was tolled by the continuous representation doctrine in that the defendants continuously represented them through at least the settlement conference held in August, 2009. We conclude that there\n   are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants were professionally negligent, and if so, whether the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Summary judgment may be granted where the claim is barred by the statute of limitations....

Despite the fact that they retained Fuller and Pearson in December, 2007, the plaintiffs insist that they did not terminate their attorney-client relationship with the defendants with respect to the sewer authority representation. The defendants have taken the position that by retaining Fuller and Pearson, the plaintiffs de facto terminated their relationship with them with respect to the sewer authority representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the trial court stated, among other things,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   that\n   the uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that the plaintiffs knew of the defendants' alleged negligence more than three years prior to their commencing the present action and that the continuous representation doctrine did not toll the statute of limitations because the plaintiffs had retained two other attorneys to represent them in their dealings with the sewer authority.

The court also found it to be undisputed that the plaintiffs did not commence the present action until June, 2011. To support their position that the defendants continuously had represented them, the plaintiffs relied exclusively on Fitzpatrick's participation in the August, 2009 global settlement conference, where the sewer authority was discussed along with land use agencies that needed to approve the project. The court concluded that there\n   were no genuine issues of material fact to support the plaintiffs' claim that the continuous representation doctrine was applicable.\n   An action alleging legal malpractice or negligence is a tort claim subject to the three year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-577. See footnote 8 of this opinion. \"Although allowing a statute of limitations defense may result in meritorious claims being foreclosed, that must be so. A statute of limitations promotes two important interests: (1) it reflects a policy of law, as declared by the legislature, that after a given length of time a [defendant] should be sheltered from liability and furthers the public policy of allowing people, after the lapse of a reasonable time, to plan their affairs with a degree of certainty, free from the disruptive burden of protracted and unknown potential liability ... and (2) to avoid the difficulty in proof and record keeping which suits involving older [claims] impose.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Targonski v.

Importantly, in the present case, both the plaintiffs and the defendants learned that the sewer authority withdrew its conditional capacity approval at approximately the same time in December, 2007, which was the consequence of the defendants' alleged failure to inform the plaintiffs of the 2005 letter and the November, 2007 meeting. Within one month, the plaintiffs retained Fuller to pursue the sewer appeal and Pearson to file another sewer capacity application. The defendants claim, therefore, that the plaintiffs ceased to rely on their professional judgment with respect to the sewer authority at this time. The defendants, however, continued to represent the plaintiffs before land use agencies and the Middlebury Board\n   of Selectmen to obtain approvals for the project. The plaintiffs contend that because Fitzpatrick was present at the global settlement conference held in August, 2009, where the sewer authority was discussed, Fitzpatrick continued to represent them with regard to the sewer authority.\n   \"[A] plaintiff may invoke the [continuous representation] doctrine, and thus toll the statute of limitations, when the plaintiff can show: (1) that the defendant continued to represent him with regard to the same underlying matter;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) either the plaintiff did not know of the alleged malpractice\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that the attorney could still mitigate the harm allegedly caused by that malpractice during the continued representation period.\" (Emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DeLeo v.

In this matter, the resolution of the plaintiffs' claims is complicated by the death of Morris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the court improperly concluded that the plaintiffs' claims were barred by the statute of limitations, it improperly granted the motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' claim of professional negligence.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In count two, the plaintiffs realleged all of the allegations contained in count one plus that the \"actions or omissions of the defendants described above, were in\n   breach of the fiduciary duties they owed to the plaintiffs.\" In their motion for summary judgment, the defendants asserted that summary judgment should be granted as to all three counts of the plaintiffs' complaint because the factual allegations in count one relate to the violation of duties owed by attorneys in general. In their memorandum of law in support of the motion for summary judgment, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty count failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. v.

A viable cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty requires factual allegations impugning the attorney's honesty, morality, or loyalty. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs' complaint alleged no facts and there is no evidence that the defendants failed to maintain loyalty to the plaintiffs. Although count two alleges \"actions or omissions of the defendants described above were in breach of the fiduciary duties they owed to the plaintiffs,\" the defendants argued that the allegation is a legal conclusion lacking factual support. In their supplemental memorandum\n   of law in support of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants stated that the plaintiffs' complaint contains no allegation from which to find a breach of duty after the alleged initial wrong, i.e., \"the alleged failure to advise the plaintiffs of the September, 2005 conditional capacity authorization.\" Moreover, the complaint contains no allegation that Fitzpatrick \"engaged in any new affirmative acts or omissions following the initial alleged failure to advise.\" An attorney's breach of duty is actionable only when supported by adequate factual allegations.\n   In their objection to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs summarized a portion of Fitzpatrick's deposition testimony and represented that Middlebury does not have its own sewage treatment facility. Middlebury therefore purchases sewer capacity from the town of Naugatuck. Moreover, at various times, while he was representing the plaintiffs, Fitzpatrick also either represented other applicants seeking an allocation of Naugatuck sewer capacity or that he served as legal counsel to the Naugatuck sewer authority. The plaintiffs argued that seeking the allocation of sewer capacity for other projects was a conflict of interest, but their complaint alleges no factual basis for that assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to count two, the court cited\n   <em>\n    Beverly Hills Concepts, Inc. v.

[A] fiduciary or confidential relationship is characterized by a unique degree of trust and confidence between the parties, one of whom has superior knowledge, skill or expertise and is under a duty to represent the interests of the other....

This allegation is a conclusion that is insufficient to advise the defendants or the court of the facts on which the plaintiffs intended to rely in proving that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty. On the basis of our plenary review of the complaint, we conclude that the plaintiffs' allegations that the defendants were negligent in failing to apprise them of the 2005 letter and other communications from the sewer authority fail to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty. Moreover, the complaint alleges that\n   the defendants violated the Rules of Professional Conduct concerning competency, diligence, and communication. It does not allege that the defendants had a conflict of interest or that they violated rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which concerns conflicts of interest. The plaintiffs' factual representations and arguments in opposing the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and here on appeal, therefore, are unavailing because they do not concern material facts alleged in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In conclusion, we agree with the defendants that count two of the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
