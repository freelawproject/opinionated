On certification to this court, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that: (1) the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez, J.,\n   </em>\n   in denying the defendant's motion to suppress narcotics evidence, correctly determined that the defendant was not seized until police officers performed a patdown search for weapons; and (2) the record was inadequate to review the defendant's claim that he was unreasonably seized, in violation of the federal and state constitutions, when two police cruisers simultaneously descended upon him from opposite directions in a small private parking lot behind a Subway restaurant and a uniformed officer verbally commanded him to stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with both\n   of the defendant's claims and conclude that the evidence the defendant sought to suppress was seized in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of the constitution of Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before setting forth the relevant facts and procedural history, we begin by observing that the standard of appellate review governing allegedly unconstitutional police searches and seizures differs from the standard that governs appellate review of other types of similarly fact intensive questions. It is well established that we\n   must \"undertake a more probing factual review\" of allegedly improper seizures, so that we may come to \"an independent legal determination of whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have believed that he was not free to\n   leave.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The officers had been assigned to patrol there because a\n   large number of teenagers were expected to attend a basketball game at nearby Central High School and teenagers tended to congregate on Madison Avenue after such games, clogging traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The officers testified that this area of Bridgeport is plagued by a high rate of violent crime. Both officers conceded, however, that the department considers essentially the\n   <em>\n    entire city\n   </em>\n   of Bridgeport to be a high crime area. There was no testimony that the crime rate in the neighborhood of Madison Avenue and Capitol Avenue is any higher than in other areas of Bridgeport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At approximately 7 p.m., the two officers were driving northbound on Madison Avenue in a marked police cruiser when they stopped at a red light at the intersection of Madison and Capitol Avenues. As they waited for the light to change, they briefly observed a man, later identified as the defendant, who is black, standing alone in the parking lot at 944 Madison Avenue, behind a Subway sandwich restaurant located on the corner. Although it is not evidenced in the record, it may reasonably be assumed-and the state conceded at oral argument before this court-that the Subway restaurant would have been open for dinner at that hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officers offered three reasons why the defendant aroused their suspicions at that time. First, Morales testified that, at the time the officers observed the defendant, \"[i]t was pre-dark, it was starting to get dark.\" He indicated that the defendant \"was loitering in the rear\n   <em>\n    in the shadows\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court does not appear to have credited Morales' testimony that, at 7 p.m. on January 28, 2011, in Bridgeport, it was just \"starting to get dark.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And for good\n   reason. On that particular winter evening, the sun had set two hours earlier, at 5:04 p.m., and even\n   the twilight had long since passed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, there was undisputed testimony that no lights illuminated the Subway parking lot at that time. Accordingly, the only reasonable inference is that\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   standing outside the Subway restaurant at dinnertime on that particular evening necessarily would have been standing in the \"shadows.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, both officers testified that the defendant aroused their suspicions because he was \"loitering\" in the Subway lot. In the police report they completed the evening of the incident, the officers wrote that \"we observed a heavy set black male wearing a tan colored hooded sweatshirt loitering behind the Subway [s]andwich [s]hop....\" In the section of the report entitled \"Point of Illegal Entry/Means of Attack,\" the officers entered: \"Loitering near Subway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the suppression hearing, however, both officers acknowledged that, at the time they first observed the defendant and decided to question him, they had no reason to believe that he was in violation of Bridgeport's loitering ordinance. Bridgeport Municipal Code \u00a7 9.04.010 provides: \"Any person who, without permission or legitimate purpose, loiters upon the property of another or upon city-owned property, and who upon command of any police officer or person in charge of city-owned property fails to quit such property, shall be punished as provided in Chapter 1.12 of this code.\" In this case, there were no signs indicating \"no loitering\" posted at that location, and the officers had no information that the defendant was on Subway's property without permission or legitimate purpose, nor that he had\n   been commanded to leave by a police officer or city official. Indeed, the officers readily conceded that the defendant might have been a resident of one of the apartment units located above the Subway restaurant. In addition, the period during which the officers were stopped at the red light, and had an opportunity to observe the defendant and conclude that he might be loitering, lasted only a few seconds. During that brief period, and given the poor lighting conditions, the officers were unable to determine even the defendant's skin color. All they could see was a \"silhouette and just a vague color of his jacket.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Third, the officers testified that their suspicions were aroused because the Subway restaurant had been robbed multiple times in the past, including within the past year. There was undisputed testimony, however, that no incidents of any sort had been reported in the Bridgeport police logs for that Subway location during the preceding four months. Nor did the officers receive any calls with respect to that location on the date in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In any event, after having observed nothing more than a nondescript individual standing outside a Subway restaurant for a few seconds at 7 p.m. on a Friday evening, the officers decided to interrupt their patrol of the high school traffic situation to question him. They testified that they intended to ask him why he was in the parking lot, and whether he lived in one of the apartment units above the Subway restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There was no testimony suggesting that either Morales or Lawlor had any reason\n   to believe that the defendant was armed or dangerous, nor that any sort of criminal activity was underway or recently had transpired at that location. Nevertheless, before stopping to talk to the defendant, they decided to radio their supervisor, Sergeant Ronald Mercado, for backup.\n   Morales testified that \"[w]e wanted to try to attempt to [identify] the party and we wanted [Mercado] to cover us.\" Later in the hearing, Morales reiterated that the two officers contacted Mercado because \"we wanted cover.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The small parking lot in which the defendant was standing formed an L shape around the rear of the rectangular Subway building. There were only two entrances/exits to the lot. The small end of the L exited onto Capitol Avenue, and the large end onto Madison Avenue. Otherwise, the lot was enclosed by the Subway building on the street corner side, and by various commercial buildings on the opposite side. The lot was private property. The defendant, who was standing in the middle of the lot, was the only person in the lot at the time of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Mercado reached the location to provide the requested \"cover\" for Morales and Lawlor, the three officers in two patrol cars entered the Subway lot from opposing directions and converged on the defendant simultaneously in the middle of the lot, near a staircase leading to the apartments located above the Subway shop. Morales and Lawlor entered the lot from the Capitol Avenue entrance, while Mercado entered through the Madison Avenue entrance. Both vehicles were marked police cruisers. All three officers were in uniform, and armed. The record does not reveal whether they activated the cruisers' light bars or sirens as they approached the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The precise sequence of events from the time the officers entered the Subway lot until they frisked the defendant is less clear. In their signed police report, the officers provided the following account: \"We ... drove into the rear parking lot of [the] Subway [s]andwich [s]hop when the [defendant] turned away from us when he observed our patrol unit, Sergeant Mercado\n   drove in from the Madison [Avenue] entrance and stopped the [defendant].... [The defendant] immediately stated 'I didn't rob nobody!' He kept moving his hands around in a nervous manner and yelling 'this is embarrassing!' while continuing to state his innocence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The officers' testimony at the suppression hearing, together with the trial court's subsequent factual findings, injected some ambiguity into three elements of the police report account of events: (1) whether Mercado entered the lot precisely at the same time as Morales and Lawlor; (2) the circumstances under which the defendant was stopped; and (3) the timing and nature of the defendant's nervous hand movements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, with respect to the timing of the two cruisers entering the lot and approaching the defendant, Morales' testimony mirrored and expanded upon the account in the officers' police report: \"As we entered from Capitol [Avenue] into the rear parking lot of Subway we observed the [defendant] still in the shadow of the parking lot. He immediately-when he saw our car, it's a marked unit, he immediately turned around and started walking away. That's-at the time when we went to go around the L shape of-toward Madison [Avenue] Sergeant Mercado entered in his marked unit and was able to stop the [defendant].\" Morales later summarized this sequence of events by stating that the two cruisers \"pulled in\" at \"about the same time\" and arrived at the defendant's location in the middle of the lot at approximately the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lawlor's testimony was consistent with that of Morales on this point. He testified that when he and Morales entered the lot from Capitol Avenue, the defendant immediately turned and started to walk away, and that Mercado entered the lot from Madison Avenue \"shortly thereafter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court found, however, that \"[t]he two officers and ... Mercado entered the parking lot\n   <em>\n    at the same time\n   </em>\n   and through the only two entrances into the eatery's parking lot.... As soon as the two officers arrived ... the defendant started to immediately walk away from the officers....\" (Emphasis added.) Because the police report, Morales, and Lawlor all indicated that Morales and Lawlor entered the lot from Capitol Avenue shortly\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Mercado entered from Madison Avenue, and the record contains no evidence to the contrary, we must understand the court's finding that the two cruisers entered at the same time to mean that the two cruisers arrived at the lot at\n   <em>\n    approximately\n   </em>\n   the same time, and that, as the defendant began to walk away from the first cruiser, Mercado entered and the two simultaneously converged on his position in the middle of the lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, with respect to when the defendant was stopped, Morales' testimony was again consistent with the police report. In response to direct questioning by the trial court to clarify the sequence of events, Morales indicated that Mercado made the first contact with the defendant as he attempted to walk away from the cruiser driven by Morales and Lawlor, and that Mercado stopped the defendant \"[b]y verbally commanding him to stop.\" Morales indicated that Mercado also \"might have been\" the one who began to question the defendant after he was stopped, although Morales was unsure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lawlor testified that it was Morales who \"made contact with [the defendant] first,\" spoke to the defendant, and \"handl[ed] more of the contact,\" while Lawlor himself observed the interaction. During that portion of the suppression hearing, however, Lawlor was not asked-and did not testify-about Mercado's role in the stopping and questioning of the defendant. Lawlor also did not testify as to how the defendant came to be stopped\n   when he began to walk away from the first cruiser, and the trial court made no findings in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Third, the record contains three accounts of the defendant's nervous hand movements. The police report states that, after Mercado stopped the defendant and he denied having robbed anyone, \"[the defendant] kept moving his hands around in a nervous manner and yelling 'this is embarrassing!' while continuing to state his innocence.\" Morales offered a far more detailed account at the suppression hearing. He testified that, after the officers exited their cars and the defendant denied having robbed anyone, and as the three officers approached him on foot, the defendant moved his hands in a nervous manner while he stood facing the officers, and repeatedly stated that he felt embarrassed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   These hand movements entailed \"going on the side, behind him fixing his pants,\" and were accompanied by complaints about a bad back. Morales variously described these movements as \"tussling with his pants\"; \"tussling with his belt buckle ... the belt area of his pants\"; and \"fidgeting with his hands ... moving his belt, his upper part of the pants....\" Morales testified that when the officers then ordered\n   the defendant to keep his hands where the officers could see them, the defendant refused to comply with those orders, which led the officers to pat him down for their safety. Lawlor, by contrast, testified without elaboration that the defendant moved his hands toward his waistband at the outset, as he turned to walk away from the approaching patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court found on this question that, \"as the defendant started to immediately walk away from the officers, he was observed by ... Morales and ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Lawlor to engage in movements around his waistband as he walked. While the police exited their vehicles and approached the defendant, he spontaneously yelled out 'I didn't rob anyone' and he kept saying that he was embarrassed.\" Although there was no evidence in the record to support the court's finding that\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   witnessed suspicious hand motions at the outset, while the officers were still in their vehicle pulling into the lot, the court was free to credit\n   <em>\n    Lawlor's\n   </em>\n   testimony that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   witnessed such motions at that time. The court made no findings with respect to Morales' testimony that the defendant later defied the officers' commands to keep his hands in plain view, after the officers had stopped him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In any event, it is clear that, soon after they entered the lot, exited their cruisers, and approached the defendant, the officers decided to pat the defendant down for their safety. Although they testified that they were concerned that he might have been carrying a weapon, the only fact they were able to articulate in support of that concern was that the defendant moved his hands near his waistband as he turned away from them. In fact, the officers did not find any weapons on the defendant when they frisked him. They did discover a bundle containing heroin, however, and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendant moved to suppress the narcotics evidence, contending that its discovery was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, in violation of the state and federal constitutions. The trial court denied the defendant's motion and the defendant subsequently entered a plea of nolo contendere to the counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell and failure to appear in the first degree, conditional on his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a. Consistent with the plea agreement, the court,\n   <em>\n    Arnold, J.,\n   </em>\n   imposed a total effective sentence\n   of ten years imprisonment, execution suspended after four years, and three years probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, arguing that he was seized when the police converged on him in the Subway parking lot or, at the very latest, when Mercado commanded him stop.\n   <em>\n    State v. Edmonds,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20763\">\n    151 Conn.App. at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%20607\">\n    96 A.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We granted the defendant's petition for certification and this appeal followed. See footnote 1 of this opinion. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In part I of this opinion, we consider whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the defendant was not seized until the officers patted him down for weapons and that certain of his claims in that regard are unreviewable.

The court's oral decision portrays an unremarkable\n   scene of three uniformed officers approaching the defendant as part of a routine investigation to obtain identification and determine his purpose for being in the lot. In addition to the facts set forth in the court's oral decision, the record does not contain any evidence suggestive of threatening or coercive police conduct. For instance, there is no evidence that the police engaged their lights or sirens when they entered the Subway parking lot, that they brandished their weapons, or that they impeded the defendant's ability to move, either physically or verbally.... We conclude, therefore, that the defendant was not seized when the police approached him because a reasonable person in the defendant's position would not have believed that it was impermissible to leave the scene.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Id., at *1. When the officers shined their flashlights at the vehicle, it instead continued down the street. Id. The officers then spotted that same vehicle in the rear of a nearby parking lot. Id. The officers entered the lot and parked thirty to forty feet away from the vehicle, near the only road providing entry to or exit from the area, and partially blocking that exit. Id. Their spotlights were aimed at the vehicle, but they did not activate their emergency lights or sirens. Id. One officer then approached the passenger\n   side of the defendant's vehicle, while his partner \"stood guard at the rear of the vehicle.\" Id. Both officers were uniformed and armed, although their weapons remained holstered. Id., at *2. Under those circumstances, the court concluded that the officers' actions constituted a seizure. Id. Specifically, the court concluded that, although the defendant was not physically detained, \"a reasonable person would not feel free to leave or otherwise terminate the encounter\" because the officers \"largely, though not fully, blocked any exit the [defendant's vehicle] may have had from the parking area and back onto the road....\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Indeed, the theory that the police seize an individual when they knowingly surround him or obstruct his free passage is firmly rooted in our state constitution and federal common law.

Importantly, nothing barred the defendant in Burroughs from simply driving off in the direction his vehicle was facing. By contrast, if a second police cruiser had entered the scene and pulled\n   <em>\n    in front\n   </em>\n   of the defendant's vehicle, boxing him in, he would not have been free to\n   leave. That is precisely what happened here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Beyond the fact that two marked police cruisers converged on the defendant from opposite directions, effectively blocking him from exiting the lot, several other aspects of the present case would indicate to a reasonable person in the defendant's position that he was not free to leave. First, the defendant was the only person in the parking lot at the time the police entered. Whereas an individual standing in a crowded area or traveling a public road has no reason to assume that a sudden police presence is directed toward him, in the present\n   case it would have been apparent to the defendant that the two cruisers and three officers who suddenly approached were there for him. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Oquendo,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527625\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/635/#p650\">\n    223 Conn. at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%201300\">\n    613 A.2d 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, and relatedly, it is important that the Subway lot was private property, where police would not be expected to routinely patrol. See\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"513127\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/255/96/#p102\">\n    255 Va. 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=496%20S.E.2d%2047\">\n    496 S.E.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A third, critical consideration is the fact that, as the defendant turned to walk away from the marked police cruiser driven by Morales and Lawlor, he was confronted by a second cruiser, driven by Mercado, which had entered from the opposite direction, appearing to thwart his passage. There is a common trope in espionage and other action genre films in which the protagonist turns to retreat upon confronting an enemy, only to see more would-be captors appear from the other direction. At that point, he, along with the audience, realizes that he is trapped. Both courts and commentators have applied this basic intuition in the search and seizure context, recognizing that cornering or \"pursuing a person who has attempted to terminate the contact by departing\" sends a clear signal that the person is not free to leave. 4 W.

Moreover, although there is no indication whether the cruisers' sirens and emergency lights were activated, we must at least assume, because the incident occurred approximately two hours after sunset, that the officers had illuminated their headlamps, and, therefore, that the defendant would have been illuminated in the glare of those headlamps as the cruisers approached him in the unlit lot.

These factors, therefore, further support the conclusion that a reasonable person, standing alone in a dark and private parking lot, who suddenly found himself blocked in by marked police cruisers, would not have felt free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Lastly, if we had any remaining doubt as to whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have felt free to disregard the three officers and leave the scene as they approached, those doubts\n   are dispelled by the fact that Mercado, upon entering the Subway lot, commanded the defendant to stop.

Accordingly, having considered all of the relevant circumstances and all of the undisputed evidence in the record, we are compelled to conclude that a reasonable person in the defendant's position would not have felt free to leave the scene, and that the defendant was seized no later than when Mercado successfully commanded him to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We next consider the state's assertion, which the Appellate Court found persuasive, that the defendant's claim that he was seized no later than when Mercado commanded him to stop is unreviewable on appeal.

We disagree, and conclude that the defendant's full argument is preserved for appellate review and that we are not barred from considering any of the undisputed testimony in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The following additional procedural history is relevant to our evaluation of the state's argument. The defendant filed with the trial court what fairly may be characterized as a boilerplate motion to suppress evidence. The motion alleged only that: (1) \"certain items seized by law enforcement officer(s) or his agent(s) ... were not seized pursuant to a search and seizure warrant\"; and (2) \"[t]he search and seizure violated the laws and constitutions of the United States and of the [s]tate of Connecticut in that ... [t]he search and seizure was unreasonable.\" No memorandum of law setting forth specific legal theories or arguments accompanied the motion, and the state neither filed an objection to the motion nor sought any clarification or specification as to the grounds or theories on which the defendant objected to the search and seizure. In fact, neither party presented its theory of the seizure issue prior to the opening of testimony at the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the suppression hearing, the state proceeded first with its case, consistent with its burden of proving that the officers' warrantless search and seizure of the defendant was constitutional.

The state called and examined two witnesses-Officers Morales and Lawlor-whom defense counsel cross-examined broadly about the circumstances surrounding the defendant's arrest. The prosecutor indicated that he had intended to call Sergeant Mercado as well, but that Mercado was on vacation in Florida and, therefore, unavailable to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When the prosecutor completed his redirect questioning of Morales, the trial court intervened to ask the officer a series of questions to clarify the timeline of events. The court specifically asked Morales one-half dozen questions about the circumstances under which\n   Mercado had stopped the defendant from walking away, and twice asked Morales to confirm that Mercado did so by verbally commanding the defendant to stop. After questioning Morales in this area, the court gave the prosecutor an opportunity to ask Morales follow-up questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After the state rested, the defendant briefly called one witness to establish a lack of recent criminal activity at the Subway in question. The court then invited the state to present its closing argument, and the prosecutor for the first time offered the state's theory of the search and seizure. It was only then, at the very end of the hearing, after the witnesses had been excused, both sides had rested, and the state had presented its argument, that the court invited defense counsel to argue her theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defense counsel began by advising the court that the court's primary duty was to determine when the defendant was seized, if at all. At varying times, she argued that the defendant was seized: (1) when the police cruisers surrounded him in the lot; (2) when the three officers exited their cruisers and approached the defendant; or (3) when the police patted him down. At other times, however, defense counsel framed the issue more broadly. Near the end of the hearing, for example, she argued that the \"bottom line\" was that the defendant \"was seized the minute that those police officers turned around and did a U-turn, came into the parking lot\n   <em>\n    and stopped\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the defendant\n   </em>\n   ]....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Despite the fact that defense counsel correctly advised the trial court that the court was obliged to determine whether a seizure occurred between the time that the officers entered the lot and when they verbally stopped the defendant, the trial court made no express findings in that regard. Instead, the court appears to have assumed that the frisk was the event of constitutional\n   significance, and to have concluded that a seizure was justified at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On appeal, the state argues that (1) the defendant failed to preserve his argument that a seizure occurred when Mercado commanded the defendant to stop, (2) the record is inadequate for us to review this allegedly unpreserved claim, and (3) the state relied to its detriment on the fact that the defendant opted not to raise this argument at the suppression hearing. All of the state's arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, we disagree with the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the defendant's claim that he was seized no later than when Mercado commanded him to stop is unpreserved and, therefore, can only be reviewed on appeal if it satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the\n   suppression hearing, defense counsel advised the trial court that it must determine precisely when the defendant was seized. Counsel, who did not bear the burden of proof on this issue and had just heard the officers' account of the events in question for the first time, offered three specific possibilities, ranging from the moment the officers entered the lot to the moment they approached the defendant on foot to the moment they frisked him. But defense counsel also argued that the constitutionally relevant time period was of longer duration: the \"minute\" during which the officers turned around, entered the lot, and \"stopped\" the defendant. Because the only explicit testimony as to how the defendant was stopped was Morales' testimony that Mercado verbally commanded him to stop, we have no difficulty concluding that that command is fairly encompassed by the seizure theory that defense counsel articulated at the suppression hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Appellate Court has recognized,\n   \"[c]losing arguments of counsel ... are seldom carefully constructed in toto before the event; improvisation frequently results in syntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear....

The state contends that the record is inadequate because: (1) the trial court made no express findings with respect to Mercado's verbal command to stop; and (2) the testimony of Morales and Lawlor as to this point allegedly conflicts. The first contention is of little moment, as it is well established that, when reviewing the constitutionality of an alleged seizure, we must parse the entire record, and not only the trial court's express findings.\n   <em>\n    State v. Burroughs,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3713201\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/836/#p843\">\n    288 Conn. at 843-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20A.2d%2043\">\n    955 A.2d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If there is uncontested testimony by the state's own witness indicating that Mercado seized the defendant before the defendant made any incriminating statements, and if the trial court did not affirmatively decline to credit that testimony, then it is fairly considered in the context of a constitutional analysis. This is especially true in light of the fact that the trial court clearly failed to focus on the constitutional import of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the events that transpired prior to the patdown, suggesting that we can read little into the court's failure to make express findings with respect to those events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The primary question, therefore, is whether Morales' testimony on this point is uncontested. Morales clearly\n   testified, on multiple occasions, that it was Mercado who \"stopped\" the defendant. The police incident report-which Morales authored, for which Lawlor provided assistance, and which an unidentified supervisor reviewed and signed\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -is in full agreement, stating that \"when the [defendant] turned away from us when he observed our patrol unit ... Mercado\n   drove in from the Madison [Avenue] entrance and stopped [him]....\" The trial court itself questioned Morales at some length to clarify this testimony. In response, Morales specified that Mercado verbally commanded the defendant to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For his part, Lawlor testified only that Mercado arrived shortly after Morales and he entered the lot, and that he could not recall where Mercado had parked. He gave no indication of what role Mercado played in the incident, if any, nor whether Mercado spoke to the defendant or issued any commands. When asked whether all three officers approached the defendant, Lawlor replied: \"I don't recall at what specific time but we approached him.\" Nothing in Lawlor's testimony, then, directly contradicted Morales' testimony that Mercado ordered the defendant to stop as, or before, the defendant made any incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In fact, the state's argument that Lawlor offered conflicting testimony is based entirely on the following brief colloquy between the prosecutor and Lawlor:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Q. Okay. Now, when you exited the vehicle did you make contact with the individual that was hanging out in back of the Subway?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"A. Well, contact was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"Q. By who?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"A. By-Officer Morales made contact with him first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Q. Okay. And then who made contact with him second?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"A. I was there, but Officer Morales was handling more of the contact first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"Q. So is it a fair assessment to say that Officer Morales spoke to the individual and you just kind of observed what was going on?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"A. Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   During this colloquy, no mention is made of Mercado and, in particular, there is no discussion of any role that Mercado might have played before Morales and Lawlor exited their vehicle. In fact, Lawlor's entire testimony during this portion of the hearing is limited to the roles that\n   <em>\n    he and Morales\n   </em>\n   played in the events in question, and he is not asked about Mercado's role until much later. In context, then, there simply is no reason to interpret Lawlor's brief reference to the fact that, after he and Morales exited their vehicle, Morales made the first contact with the defendant, to mean that Lawlor disagreed with Morales' testimony that Mercado initiated the stop. Indeed, the failure of either party to seek clarification of Lawlor's testimony as to this point suggests that this testimony was not interpreted to conflict with Mercado's testimony or with the officers' incident report. The most reasonable reading of the testimony, therefore, is that Lawlor was merely indicating that, of the two partners, it was Morales who interacted with the defendant. Accordingly, we are not precluded from considering Morales' uncontradicted testimony with respect to the time of seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Third, we are not persuaded by the argument that the state relied to its detriment on a belief that Mercado's verbal command to stop was not relevant to the case. As we already have explained, that issue clearly\n   was raised at the suppression hearing. The trial court, sua sponte, questioned Morales about the command at some length, and afforded the prosecutor an opportunity to pursue the issue on redirect. Defense counsel later argued that the \"bottom line\" was that the defendant was seized during the minute in which the officers stopped the defendant. That the state opted to largely ignore the constitutional significance of the period during which the officers entered the lot and confronted the defendant, and instead focused\n   almost exclusively on the reasonableness of the patdown search, was a strategic decision, and not the result of trial by ambuscade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Nor is there any indication that the state declined to call Mercado as a witness out of a belief that his role in the encounter was somehow irrelevant. Rather, the prosecutor indicated at the suppression hearing that he had intended to call Mercado as a witness but that Mercado was on vacation in Florida at the time. Accordingly, we reject the state's argument that, in determining when the defendant was seized, we may not consider the undisputed testimony of the state's own witness, as corroborated by the officers' official incident report, that Mercado, upon entering the parking lot, restrained the defendant by issuing a verbal command to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Having concluded that the defendant was seized no later than when Mercado commanded him to stop, we next consider whether the seizure was legal. It is well settled that a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop is constitutionally permissible only if three conditions are met: \"(1) the officer[s] must have a reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur; (2) the purpose of the stop must be reasonable; and (3) the scope and character of the detention must be reasonable when considered in light of its purpose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

For an officer's suspicion of criminal activity to be objectively reasonable, the officer \"must be able to point to\n   <em>\n    specific and articulable facts\n   </em>\n   which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the present case, we agree with the conclusion of the trial court that, from the time Morales and Lawlor first observed the defendant standing in the Subway lot until they and Mercado converged on his location, the officers had no reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal conduct. We further conclude that the two additional factors that arose as the officers were approaching-that the defendant turned to walk away, and that his hands moved near his waist as he did so-also do not support a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. Accordingly, we conclude that the warrantless seizure was illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   It is undisputed that, prior to the time the officers entered the lot to question the defendant, he did not make any suspicious statements or nervous gestures.

Because a typical man's hands hang only a few inches or so below his waist, under normal circumstances it is virtually impossible to turn and walk off in such a way that the hands do not appear to come into proximity thereto. Surely it cannot be the case that any man living in a high crime neighborhood who appears to move his hands in the vicinity of his waist as the police approach, or who engages in commonplace and innocuous conduct such as briefly adjusting his pants, thereby subjects himself to search and seizure.

Contrary to the dissent's assertions, the majority does not imply that a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   seizure occurs when the officers merely \"[pull] into a parking lot\" and \"sa[y] something indeterminate\" to a suspect. The majority instead concludes that a variety of additional facts, which reveal the true character of the encounter, demonstrate that the defendant\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   reasonably did not feel free to leave. These facts include: (1) two marked police cruisers converged on him nearly simultaneously in a parking lot from opposite directions; (2) the cruisers at least partially blocked his ability to leave the area on foot; (3) the defendant was the only person\n   in the parking lot; (4) the encounter occurred at night; (5) the cruisers' headlights were focused on only him; (6) the parking lot is private property; (7) when the defendant initially\n   <em>\n    tried\n   </em>\n   to exercise his right to leave, by turning in the opposite direction when the first marked cruiser pulled up in front of him, a second marked cruiser blocked his path in that direction; (8) three uniformed and armed police officers exited from the cruisers; and (9) one\n   of the officers commanded him to stop.

The most troubling aspect of the majority's determination is that it rests not on the record and findings of the trial court, but on the majority's own inferences and assumptions about the record and a misreading of the relevant case law. The majority's decision disregards the appropriate standard of review, muddles our search and seizure jurisprudence, and will ultimately have the practical effects of hindering law enforcement at the most fundamental level and further endangering citizens living in crime-ridden neighborhoods. Accordingly, I am compelled to dissent. In my\n   view, the Appellate Court properly concluded that the record was inadequate to permit appellate review of the defendant's previously unraised claim that he was seized upon a police officer's verbal order to stop.\n   <em>\n    State v.

I would also conclude that the Appellate Court correctly determined that the defendant was not seized until the police performed a patdown search of his person, at which point the police possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity.

I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Prior to charting the factual landscape of the present case, I set forth the proper standard of review rather than the incorrect reading of the standard that the majority applies for the purposes of this case. In reviewing a motion to suppress, this court accords great deference to the findings of the trial court. \"[T]he standard of review for a motion to suppress is well settled. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record.... [W]hen a question of fact is essential to the outcome of a particular legal determination that implicates a defendant's constitutional rights, [however] and the credibility of witnesses is not the primary issue, our customary deference to the trial court's factual findings is tempered by a scrupulous examination of the record to ascertain that the trial court's\n   factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the present case, the testimony of the arresting officers was central to the trial court's factual findings and legal conclusions. \"[W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [our review is plenary, and] we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in\n   the memorandum of decision....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20821\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Conversely, the majority opinion states that \"the standard of appellate review governing allegedly unconstitutional police searches and seizures differs from the standard that governs appellate review of other types of similarly fact intensive questions.\" While correctly recognizing that when presented with a claim of constitutional magnitude we must \"[conduct] a scrupulous examination of the record\" to ascertain whether each finding is supported by substantial evidence;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although\n   <em>\n    Burroughs\n   </em>\n   correctly states the standard of review in the context of the present case, the majority broadly applies\n   <em>\n    Burroughs\n   </em>\n   and does so in a manner inconsistent with the mandate that we are to leave undisturbed the factual findings of the trial court unless the findings are clearly erroneous in light of the record as a whole.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20A.2d%2043\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The majority does not suggest that the trial court's findings are in error and although the majority purports to defer to the trial court, a comparison of the facts as found by the trial court and the majority's facts demonstrate otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The majority also seeks to broaden the standard of review by purporting that \"we must take account of any undisputed evidence that does not support the trial court's ruling in favor of the state but that the trial court did not expressly discredit.\" In support of this position, the majority relies on our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The majority's reliance, however, is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    DeMarco,\n   </em>\n   this court recognized that in reviewing a motion to suppress, \"[i]f the [police] officers' own testimony as to what occurred\n   is internally consistent and uncontested by the defendant but, in fact, undercuts the trial court's ruling in favor of the state, a reviewing court would be remiss in failing to consider it.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20491\">\n    Id., at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20491\">\n    88 A.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, the majority is correct in taking note of undisputed evidence in the record that the trial court did not discredit. But where the majority errs is in taking this a step too far and using the evidence in the record to make its own findings and even resolve inconsistencies in the officers' testimony, which\n   <em>\n    DeMarco\n   </em>\n   expressly forbids.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20491\">\n    Id., at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20491\">\n    88 A.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to weigh conflicting testimony and make determinations of credibility, crediting some, all or none of any given witness' testimony....

Scrupulous review of the record requires us to examine whether the trial court's findings are supported by substantial evidence, not to decide what factual conclusions we ourselves\n   would draw from that same evidence. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

In broadening the appropriate standard of review, the majority ignores \"the fundamental distinction between the function of the fact finder, which is to make credibility determinations and to find facts, and the function of the appellate tribunal, which is to review, and not to retry, the proceedings\n   of the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

At approximately 7 p.m. on January 28, 2011, Officers Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor of the Bridgeport Police Department were on patrol in their cruiser in the vicinity of Madison Avenue and Capitol Avenue in Bridgeport. The officers were on alert that evening as the police anticipated a large influx of youth into the neighborhood due to a nearby high school basketball game and this area of Bridgeport was well-known among local police for robberies and other violent crimes. As Morales and Lawlor proceeded down Madison Avenue, they observed the defendant standing alone in the poorly lit parking lot of a Subway sandwich shop. Because Morales was aware that the Subway shop had been the target of previous robberies, he radioed his supervisor, Sergeant Ronald Mercado, who was on\n   patrol nearby, and informed him of the defendant's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   A brief description of the Subway parking lot in which the defendant was standing is helpful in understanding the facts in the present case. The Subway shop and its parking lot are located on a corner lot at the intersection of Madison Avenue and Capitol Avenue. The parking lot wraps around the building containing the Subway in an L-shape and has vehicle entrances from both Madison Avenue and Capitol Avenue. At the time of the defendant's arrest, the parking lot was open and was not enclosed by a fence, gate, or wall. Although the parking spaces in the lot are for the customers of Subway and a nearby bakery, the back side of the Subway building contains a flight of stairs that begins in the parking lot at the corner of the \"L\" and ascends to upper floor apartment units. To reach the stairs, residents of the apartments would have to walk through the parking lot. Several parking spaces are painted onto the asphalt along the long side of the Subway building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Morales and Lawlor drove into the parking lot from the Madison Avenue entrance at the same time that Mercado pulled in from the Capitol Avenue entrance. The defendant was standing near one of the parking spaces along the side of the Subway building. Although both police vehicles were marked, there was no testimony that the officers had activated the lights or sirens in either vehicle. As soon as the police arrived, the defendant began to walk away while making a number of movements around his waist. When the officers exited their vehicles and approached the defendant, he blurted out, \" 'I didn't rob anyone,' \" and repeatedly told the officers that he was embarrassed. Morales then performed a patdown search of the defendant, during which a plastic packet fell from the defendant's waistband. Its contents were later found to contain narcotics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The majority's failure to apply the proper standard of review results in an array of \"facts\" and groundless inferences that support the majority's own outcome, but that often run counter to the trial court's findings of fact or address details that the trial court never considered. As an addendum to my presentation of the facts as they were actually found by the trial court, I am obligated to point out each instance in which the majority draws a conclusion that has dubious or nonexistent support in the record in order to fully demonstrate both the majority's alteration of the standard of review and the threats that the improper standard poses to this court's fundamental role as an appellate tribunal. Upon my own review of the record, I have identified the following fifteen instances in which the majority finds facts that have insufficient or no support in the record:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   First, the majority \"assume[s]\" that the Subway outside of which the defendant was standing was open for business. The majority takes this for inviolable fact merely because at oral argument before this court the state acknowledged that the Subway\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have been open. But merely because an attorney says something does not make it an indisputable fact, particularly so here, where the record is utterly devoid of any information about the Subway shop's business hours or whether it was open on the day and time of the defendant's arrest. Furthermore, it is an elemental principle that arguments of counsel are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew v. Schweizer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"543888\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/217/671/#p684\">\n    217 Conn. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20A.2d%201014\">\n    587 A.2d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). If that principle is true in the trial court, it surely holds equal force in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Second, the majority decides that the \"only reasonable inference\" is that \"\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   standing outside of the Subway\" would \"necessarily\" have been standing in the shadows. (Emphasis in original.) The record does not support the majority's absolute conclusion that\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   in the parking lot would\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   have been obscured in darkness. Although the record does reflect that there were not any lights on in the parking lot at the time of the defendant's arrest, Lawlor's testimony also clearly indicates that he nonetheless was able to see the defendant's silhouette and the color of his jacket despite the impenetrable darkness in which the majority concludes he \"necessarily\" would have been cloaked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Third, the majority opinion concludes that the police cruisers \"simultaneously\" converged on the defendant, and then immediately contradicts itself by citing a statement to the contrary in the police report, namely that Morales and Lawlor entered the parking lot\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to Mercado's entrance. The trial court itself found only that the two cruisers entered the parking lot's two entrances at the same time, which is very different than the majority's would-\n   be finding that the cruisers \"simultaneously\" converged on the defendant and blockaded him where he stood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Fourth, the majority \"must understand\" the trial court's finding to \"mean that the two cruisers arrived at the lot at\n   <em>\n    approximately\n   </em>\n   the same time\" in order to support its preferred sequence of events, in which the cruisers \"simultaneously converged on [the defendant's] position in the middle of the lot.\" (Emphasis in original.) But why must we understand the trial court's memorandum of decision to mean anything other than exactly what it states: \"The two officers and Sergeant Mercado entered the parking lot at the same time and through the only two entrances into the [Subway] parking lot.\" The trial court's finding is supported by the officers' testimony, so why attempt to qualify or embellish it at all?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Fifth, the majority decides that the defendant could \"presumably\" have walked around the parked police cruisers onto either Capitol or Madison Avenues. The\n   majority points to nothing in the record that supports this other than its own presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Sixth, the majority assumes that \"it would have been apparent\" to the defendant that the police had entered the lot for the sole purpose of apprehending him. This is pure speculation. The defendant never testified and we have no way whatsoever of knowing what the defendant would have been thinking when the officers arrived in the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Seventh, the majority concludes, with absolutely no basis, that the police would \"not be expected to routinely patrol\" in the area where the defendant was arrested. There is no support in the record for this proposition. Indeed, there is support to the contrary, namely Morales' testimony that he had previously conducted police work in that area of Bridgeport and was currently assigned to a special detail patrol of that area, and the trial court's finding that the officers' conduct was \"normal\" and \"routine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Eighth, the majority describes, with much hyperbole, the defendant as being cut off in all directions by the police like the \"protagonist\" in \"espionage and other action genre films.\" This is an inaccurate reflection of the facts in the record as there is no indication that the officers blockaded the defendant with their cruisers all at once as the majority suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Ninth, the majority \"must at least assume\" that the police illuminated the defendant in the headlights of their cruisers despite the lack of any testimony or evidence whatsoever indicating that the officers focused their headlights on the defendant. Why \"must\" we \"assume\" this? We should not be assuming\n   <em>\n    anything,\n   </em>\n   let alone drawing legal conclusions based on those assumptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Tenth, the majority, despite never having witnessed the police officers testify, takes it upon itself to correct\n   an inconsistency in the testimony of the officers that the trial court itself never deemed necessary to address. No matter how \"reasonable\" the majority considers its own conclusion that Mercado spoke to the defendant first and Morales merely \"interacted\" with him, making such a resolution is fundamentally and solely the role of the trial court. At the suppression hearing, Morales testified that Mercado first spoke to the defendant, whereas Lawlor testified that Morales was the first to initiate contact with the defendant. But rather than just acknowledging the contradiction or requesting an articulation from the trial court, the majority simply resolves the factual inconsistency itself and in doing so may quite possibly have injected a factual error into its decision.\n   Eleventh, the majority determines exactly what the officers would have seen from their cruiser on Madison Avenue, namely an \"otherwise nondescript man ... if they could even discern that\" the individual was actually a male or not. Lawlor testified that he saw the defendant's silhouette and the color of his jacket. The trial court found that Morales and Lawlor \"observed [the defendant] standing alone\" in the parking lot. There is no need to speculate beyond the trial court's finding and the officers' given testimony as to what they did or did not see.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Twelfth, the majority speculates as to\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the defendant would have been standing in the Subway parking lot. Perhaps, the majority postulates, the defendant was \"waiting for his children to come out of the restroom\" or \"reviewing the menu\" or \"pondering whether he was in the mood for sandwiches or fish\" or \"taking a smoke break\" or \"just getting a breath of fresh air.\" Again, this is sheer speculation. The defendant never testified and we have no way of knowing what thoughts were in his mind prior to his arrest. And regardless, this is irrelevant to the issue before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Thirteenth, the majority assumes that \"police-citizen relations\" were estranged in the neighborhood of the defendant's arrest. There was no testimony to this effect and the trial court made no findings that the relationship between citizens and the police had broken down in the neighborhood where the defendant was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Fourteenth, the majority states that \"[the police] never even testified that they actually believed the defendant was carrying a weapon.\" Lawlor, however, clearly testified that the defendant was initially patted down for officer safety because the officers found the defendant's furtive movements around his waist \"concerning ... [b]ecause typically weapons are hidden such as guns in the waistband, knives.\" Despite the majority's insistence otherwise, the testimony demonstrates that, under the circumstances, the officers believed that the defendant may have been armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Fifteenth, the majority offers generic and unsupported approximations of the exact length of a typical human arm and the exact manner in which a typical human moves while walking in order to conclude that it would be \"virtually impossible\" for any person to behave in a manner contrary to the way the defendant behaved when the police approached him, specifically, in the present case, by making furtive movements around his waist. Again, the majority's statement has no basis, either in the record or reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Each of these fifteen examples represents an instance in which the majority has made factual findings-in many instances based on speculation. In thus expanding the scope of appropriate review and usurping the proper role of the trial court, the majority almost certainly ensures that some of its conclusions will rest in part on sheer factual error or unsupported inferences. This is patently unacceptable, particularly in cases-such as the present-that are of constitutional dimension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Having outlined the proper parameters of the standard of review, I now address the defendant's substantive claims and the majority's treatment of them. I first discuss whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the record was inadequate to review the defendant's claim, raised for the first time before the Appellate Court, that he was seized when Mercado allegedly gave him a verbal command to stop. Both the majority opinion and the defendant assert that the existing record is sufficiently developed to review this new claim. The state counters that the Appellate\n   Court was correct to find the record inadequate due to the defendant's failure to develop his claim at the suppression hearing, the absence of Mercado's testimony, and the conflicting testimony offered by Morales and Lawlor. I would conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the current record is insufficient to review the defendant's claim with any reasonable degree of accuracy.\n   <em>\n    State v. Edmonds,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20763\">\n    151 Conn.App. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%20607\">\n    96 A.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The majority begins by deciding outright-despite providing no factual analysis of the circumstances of the alleged verbal command-that the defendant was seized when Mercado ordered him to stop. Only then,\n   <em>\n    after already deciding the defendant's claim that he was seized at that moment,\n   </em>\n   does the majority consider whether the claim was even reviewable in the first place. The majority's approach, whereby it reviews whether it may review a claim after already deciding the claim, defies the most basic notions of our well developed jurisprudence. I am also seriously troubled that the majority reverses the decision of the trial court on the basis of its conclusion that the trial court incorrectly resolved a claim that the defendant never brought before the trial court, and, therefore, on which the trial court made no factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   As the defendant did not initially raise this claim at the suppression hearing, this court should review the unpreserved constitutional claim only if it satisfies all of the following conditions: \"(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Edmonds,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20763\">\n    151 Conn.App. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%20607\">\n    96 A.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority suggests that the defendant's claim that he was seized upon Mercado's command to stop\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   raised at the suppression hearing because the defendant asked the trial court to determine when he was seized and \"framed the issue more broadly,\" and the trial court asked Morales to clarify who first made verbal contact with the defendant. The other one half of the majority's equation,\n   however, is missing: the defendant never articulated that claim when specifically asked by the trial court to clarify his theories as to when the seizure occurred. Rather, defense counsel clearly stated that the theory of the defense was that the defendant was seized when the cruisers pulled into the parking lot or, in the alternative, when he was ordered to submit to a patdown.\n   As a result of the claim never having actually been raised, neither the defendant nor the state introduced evidence to develop this issue and, consequently, the trial court's findings of fact do not address when, if, or how Mercado told the defendant to stop. Additionally, because Mercado was unavailable at the time of the suppression hearing and therefore never testified, the record is devoid of Mercado's own account of what he actually said or did when he allegedly commanded the defendant to stop. Neither of the claims that the defendant raised at the suppression hearing hinged on Mercado's actions or words. Although the prosecutor indicated that he initially had wanted Mercado to testify, after informing the court that Mercado was unavailable, the prosecutor moved on to his examination of Lawlor. Nothing in the record reflects that either party felt Mercado's testimony was indispensable to resolve the defendant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Additionally, the testimony of Morales and Lawlor regarding Mercado's actions is contradictory. Morales testified that Mercado verbally ordered the defendant to stop. Conversely, Lawlor testified that it was Morales who first verbally engaged with the defendant. As this particular detail was irrelevant to the defendant's claims that he was seized when the officers pulled into the parking lot or when Morales performed the patdown, neither party sought to reconcile the contradiction or examine the officers further in order to precisely determine Mercado's actions. Indeed, after Lawlor made the\n   contradictory statement on direct examination, defense counsel extensively cross-examined Lawlor on a plethora of topics-the police report of the incident, Bridgeport's loitering ordinance, the exact logistics of how the officers approached the defendant-yet never once questioned him on his facially contradictory statement. Neither party subsequently used the contradiction in their arguments before the court nor did the court itself even make a finding of fact as to who first spoke to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the contradiction was clearly unimportant to both the parties and the trial court. As the Appellate Court noted, the defendant easily could have filed a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5 in order to request that the trial court make findings on Mercado's alleged verbal command, but he did not do so.\n   <em>\n    State v. Edmonds,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20763\">\n    151 Conn.App. at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20A.3d%20607\">\n    96 A.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the majority-rather than annexing the fact-finding province of the trial court-could have remanded the case to the trial court and requested that it make the factual findings necessary for us to resolve the defendant's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Because the parties never developed the testimony concerning the verbal command, the record currently before this court contains no information on exactly which officer gave the command, what the officer actually said, how he said it, the tone of voice in which he issued the command, where the officer was standing in relation to the defendant when he gave the command, whether the officer beckoned or gestured to the defendant while issuing the command, or whether the officer demonstrated a show of authority beyond that of his inherent authority as a law enforcement officer. Such information is pertinent to this court's analysis of\n   whether the verbal command constituted a seizure of the defendant. On the current record,\n   however, the feasibility of such an inquiry is severely curtailed, if not rendered practically impossible. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344796\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/209/#p230\">\n    298 Conn. at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20806\">\n    3 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In an attempt to circumvent the mandate of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   that this court may not review constitutional claims when the record is inadequate;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Merely because we do not have a previous case that is directly, factually analogous to the present case does not mean that we have an absence of authority to govern our decision. To be sure, it is often helpful for this court to examine case law from our sister courts, particularly when confronted with an issue of first impression or a split in authority.

The court is not faced, however, with such circumstances in the present case. The majority openly acknowledges that there \"is no Connecticut authority directly on point\" to support its result, and rightly so, because our own case law supports a result contrary to the majority's. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

The majority's use of case law from other jurisdictions in order to arrive at a result that is unsupported by our own prior decisions is simply unpersuasive and corrosive of the predictability and stability of our case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As I have stated, the record currently before the court is inadequately developed for the purpose of making a determination as to whether the defendant was seized when an officer issued a verbal command. Indeed, the very out of state cases that the majority offers in support of its own position lend support to the contrary: that a verbal command alone is not necessarily a seizure and must be evaluated under the particular factual circumstances of the command. See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although the majority insists that its conclusion is supported by case law, a fair and impartial reading of these cases clearly demonstrates otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Due to what can only be its tacit acknowledgment that the record is indeed inadequate to address this claim, the majority opinion instead premises its conclusion that the alleged verbal command was a seizure on the fact that Morales and Mercado had driven their police cruisers into the Subway parking lot from opposite directions. Although the fact that the police vehicles were present in the parking lot is certainly a factor for this court to consider in its analysis of whether the defendant was seized under the totality of the circumstances, it is not alone dispositive of whether\n   <em>\n    the verbal command itself\n   </em>\n   was a seizure. Rather than discussing the actual verbal command-the details of which, of course, are completely unknowable to us based on the record-the majority obfuscates its own analysis by arguing that because the police cruisers had entered into the parking lot, any verbal order after that point was necessarily a seizure. It is curious that the majority devotes such substantial length and depth to the issue of the police cruisers entering the parking lot, especially since the majority itself expressly declines to address the defendant's claim that he was seized upon the entry of the cruisers on the basis that his claim regarding the verbal command is dispositive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See footnote 9 of\n   majority opinion. And yet the majority's analysis is overwhelmingly devoted to the entry of the police cruisers while the professed dispositive claim, the alleged verbal command, is given only the most minimal attention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Conversely, the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant was not seized until Morales performed a patdown search. The defendant argues that the Appellate Court improperly determined that he was not seized prior to the patdown, either when the officers first entered the Subway parking lot or, as the majority concludes, when Mercado allegedly commanded him to stop. In response, the state asserts that the Appellate Court's determination was correct, given the benign nature of the officers' encounter with the defendant until the time of the patdown search. Because the defendant's claim that he was seized upon Mercado's verbal command is unreviewable on the existing record, my discussion is confined to whether the defendant was seized when he submitted to Morales' patdown search or rather, as the defendant\n   argues and the majority implicitly agrees, when the police initially drove into the two entrances of the Subway parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution, a person is seized when \"by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although all of the officers were in uniform and entered the parking lot in marked police cruisers, nothing in the trial court's factual findings or underlying evidence shows that the officers had activated their cruisers' lights, drawn their weapons, or taken any actions that amounted to a show of authority sufficient to cause a reasonable person to believe that he was unable to leave.\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the officers themselves testified, their initial purpose in entering the parking lot and approaching the defendant was to initiate a consensual encounter with him and verify his identity given the history of robberies in the immediate area. Importantly, the trial court found that the actions of the police in the present case were \"normal routine, legitimate and\n   good police investigative techniques,\" rather than a set of unusual circumstances. The majority makes much of Morales and Lawlor's decision to call Mercado for cover prior to entering the parking lot, but calling for cover is, and the trial court found it to be, routine police practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in the record demonstrates that the officers physically or verbally restrained the defendant prior to the patdown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Likewise, no evidence in the record indicates that the officers positioned their vehicles in such a way as to physically block the defendant from departing. Indeed, the officers' testimony demonstrates that after they pulled into the parking lot, the\n   exits were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   blocked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, during cross-examination, Lawlor used photographs of the Subway parking lot to demonstrate where the police cruiser was parked after entering the lot and his indications did not reveal that the cruiser was blocking the exit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the basis of this testimony and the other evidence before it, the trial\n   court did not find that the cruisers were used to physically barricade the exits from the parking lot. As nothing about the situation would have indicated to a reasonable person that he was not free to depart, there was no seizure. Such a result is consistent with this court's prior decisions under similar facts. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Benton,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20838\">\n    304 Conn. at 840-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20619\">\n    43 A.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no seizure where police officer stepped into road into path of oncoming cyclist);\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the parking lot was not contained by a fence or a wall, a reasonable person traveling on foot would not have felt himself unable to leave because two police cruisers pulled into the exits intended for motor vehicles rather than foot traffic. Given the open, unenclosed nature of the parking lot in which the defendant was standing, the present case is readily distinguishable from the sister state authority on which the majority relies, as those cases all involve instances in which persons or their vehicles were seized in contained areas. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Rustad,\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 58691-2-I,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20555945\">\n    2008 WL 555945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (Wn.App. March 3, 2008) (defendant seized where police cruiser partially blocked single exit from parking lot and police officers surrounded defendant's parked car);\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, I would conclude, contrary to the majority's implicit conclusion, that the Appellate Court properly held that the defendant was not seized prior to the patdown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The law enforcement community and citizens living in crime-plagued neighborhoods will likely meet today's decision with bewilderment and frustration. Indeed, the\n   majority opinion has grave and unsettling public policy implications. In essence, the defendant posits, and the majority agrees, that he was seized when two police cruisers pulled into a parking lot and when a police officer said something indeterminate to him. To characterize such police conduct as a seizure would convert a substantial number of ordinary interactions between the police and citizens into events of constitutional magnitude. The majority's result will adversely impact the \"laudable interaction between the officer and citizenry\" in the \"performance\n   of his duty to guard the public safety and welfare....\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the majority's conclusions are certainly drawn from a legitimate concern for the constitutional rights of defendants, its conclusion that a defendant may be seized merely when two police cars enter a parking lot or when a police officer utters an unknown phrase to a defendant is an impractical and imprudent rule that ignores the reality of police work, particularly police work in those areas inundated with violent crime. Under the majority's conclusion, police will be less likely to initiate consensual encounters with citizens, as such encounters can now easily be transformed into events of constitutional magnitude by the mere act of an officer's approach. Indeed, after today's decision it is difficult to imagine what police-citizen interactions will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be considered a seizure. Given the numerous streets, businesses, and parking lots that can be found in any large, urban area, the police will be hamstrung in their ability to thoroughly investigate and prevent crime because approaching a citizen to obtain information could easily evolve into a seizure. In turn, citizens living in dangerous areas will ultimately be less safe and such areas will become fertile soil for the growth of further crime. The majority accurately observes that in areas with a history of strained relations between the police and citizenry, some citizens may be intimidated by the mere approach of a police officer. But what better way to rectify such a situation than developing a positive dialogue between police officers\n   and the members of the communities that they serve? The majority's take undercuts the possibility of improving police-citizen relationships at the outset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In his concurring opinion, Justice Robinson responds to my concerns that today's decision will make it more difficult for law enforcement to carry out its investigative duties. If, as the majority concludes and\n   the concurring justices agree, a police officer cannot speak to a citizen without that interaction becoming the equivalent of taking that citizen into custody, then the police will be unable to effectively communicate with local communities in order to investigate criminal activity and gather information while on patrol. In the present case, we have no idea what the police actually said to the defendant and no way of knowing, given the incomplete state of the record. In this regard, the position that Justice Robinson takes in his concurring opinion further underscores the inadequacy of the record and my belief that its inadequacy places the particular question of whether the verbal command constituted a seizure beyond this court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Justice Robinson-joined by every other member of the majority in an ostensible concurrence-also raises a series of legitimate concerns regarding racial profiling and suspicionless police stops. Although I agree entirely with the concerns that his concurring opinion expresses, I note that issues of race are simply not implicated in the present case. I do not understand why the concurring justices find it necessary to raise and exhaustively discuss issues of race when it has no foundation in the established facts of the case. While the issue of racially motivated policing is currently a prominent topic in our national discourse, as Justice Robinson's concurring opinion itself acknowledges, this case \"is not the proper place or time\" to discuss \"complex societal issues\" such as those that the concurrence itself raises. See footnote 1 of Justice Robinson's concurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The issues of race raised by his concurrence should properly be discussed and debated in the public forum and it is not the role of this court to insert ourselves into that conversation when the parties themselves did not see fit to raise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Most importantly, at no point in the history of this appeal did the defendant or his counsel ever allege that the defendant was impermissibly stopped by the police on the basis of his race. In their testimony, the officers stated that when they first observed the defendant, they could only see his silhouette and that he was wearing a jacket. Nevertheless, Justice Robinson's concurring opinion chooses as its starting point that the defendant was stopped because he is a black man, an unfounded factual implication based on assertions that the majority makes without reference to the record. I have already discussed at length elsewhere in this opinion the utter lack of support in the record for such assertions. The theory that the defendant was the target of racial profiling by the police is yet another outgrowth of the inadequacy of the record in the present case and demonstrative of the factual uncertainties created by the majority's attempt to draw facts from the record that simply are not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Contrary to the conclusions of the majority, it is my opinion that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the defendant was seized when Morales performed a patdown of his person. There is no dispute in the present case that the patdown was a seizure: the police had both exerted the authority of their position and physically restrained the defendant. Once the police begin to perform a patdown search, a reasonable person would not believe he was free to disengage with the police and leave of his own volition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Only after having first determined that a defendant has been seized, this court asks whether the police\n   possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct when seized.\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

Lipscomb,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358061\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/68/#p74\">\n    258 Conn. at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=779%20A.2d%2088\">\n    779 A.2d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In my view, the established facts in the present case lead unfalteringly to the conclusion that the officers possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity at the time they administered a pat-down search of the defendant. The record reflects that robberies and other violent offenses were commonplace in the area of Bridgeport in which Morales and Lawlor were on patrol. The officers witnessed the defendant standing alone in the shadows of the empty parking lot of a Subway shop that had been previously robbed. Although the officers may have been curious as to why the defendant was present in that location, nothing under the circumstances was at that point sufficient to merit a seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The defendant's own words and actions immediately prior to the patdown, however, provided the police with the requisite reasonable and articulable suspicion. Both the trial court and the Appellate Court found this to be determinative and I would agree with their assessment. The record reflects that once the officers pulled into the Subway parking lot, the defendant began to walk away and make furtive movements around his waist. Lawlor later testified that he was concerned that the defendant may have had a weapon in his waistband. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Mann,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2605119\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/300/#p322\">\n    271 Conn. at 325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=857%20A.2d%20329\">\n    857 A.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Oddly,\n   the majority frames the entire question of whether the police possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion sufficient to support an investigative stop through the lens of whether the police possessed a \"reasonable and articulable suspicion of gun possession....\" This is not the correct standard. The analysis as to whether the police possess the requisite suspicion to support an investigative\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop does not vary depending on what manner of criminal activity the defendant is suspected of being involved in by the police, but rather on whether the police possessed a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in general.\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio,\n   </em>\n   supra, 392 U.S. at 21-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p21\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Despite the lack of testimony or findings of the trial court supporting its view, the majority discounts the significance of the defendant's movements around his waist by observing that \"a typical man's hands hang only a few inches or so below his waist,\" and \"under normal circumstances it is virtually impossible to turn and walk off in such a way that the hands do not appear to come into proximity [with the waist].\" This unfounded observation about human anatomy is insufficient to serve as the justification for resolving a constitutional claim. I disagree that we should retailor our prior case law holding that furtive movements around the waist are a factor that may contribute to a reasonable and articulable suspicion;\n   <em>\n    State v. Mann,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2605119\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/271/300/#p322\">\n    271 Conn. at 325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=857%20A.2d%20329\">\n    857 A.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; merely on the basis of the majority's groundless conclusion that the defendant was merely \"adjusting his pants....\" Once the officers exited their vehicles, the defendant spontaneously blurted out, \" 'I didn't rob anyone,' \" while standing next to the Subway shop that had a history of prior robberies. He then told the officers numerous times that he was \"embarrassed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Under the totality of the circumstances, it is clear to me that the defendant's actions and words in response\n   to the police presence provided the officers with a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct. Although each factor may be viewed as innocuous on its own, when taken together, the defendant's evasive behavior, furtive movements around his waist, presence in a high crime area at night, and unsolicited statement that he had not committed a robbery were sufficient to paint a portrait of potential criminal activity.

In my opinion, the Appellate Court correctly determined that the officers possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion when they seized the defendant.

This is something that I simply cannot accept, especially when the satisfactory resolution of these issues requires both critical analysis and open, honest and robust debate, given these very troubling times in our nation's history.

Finally, as the majority also notes, the officer also \"had no reason to believe that [the defendant] was in violation of [the applicable municipal] loitering ordinance,\" especially since it may reasonably be assumed that the restaurant was open for dinner at that time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    As mentioned in the portion of this dissenting opinion discussing the standard of review, the majority avoids this problem by making its own credibility and factual determination by resolving the conflicting testimony in favor of the version of events present in Morales' testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    In a subsequent portion of this dissenting opinion, I fully address the defendant's claim that he was seized upon the entry of the police cruisers into the parking lot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    In her concurring opinion, the Chief Justice-while agreeing that the defendant was seized \"no later than the time at which he was commanded to stop by the police\"-disavows the majority's analysis regarding the officers' entrances into the parking lot. Yet, the majority's conclusion that the verbal command was a seizure is ultimately premised on its analysis of how the police entered the parking lot in their police cruisers.
