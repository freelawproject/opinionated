The plaintiff claims that the hearing officer violated her constitutional rights to due process and to confront the witnesses against her, acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rendering his proposed final decision, and made his decision upon unlawful procedure. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183(j)(3)(Superior Court may overturn administrative decision \"made upon unlawful procedure\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, the plaintiff claims that the hearing officer: (1) violated her right under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution to confront the witnesses against her when he allowed the statements of Reed and another witness to the attack, Monique Jones, to be admitted as evidence despite the fact that they did not testify and were not available for cross-examination; (2) improperly forced one of the plaintiff's witnesses to leave the hearing before testifying, thereby depriving the plaintiff of due process; (3) issued a proposed final decision that was made upon unlawful procedure because the department lacked written rules of\n   procedure that applied specifically to hearings on dog disposal orders; and (4) acted arbitrarily and capriciously when he \"interjected his opinion\" about a substantive matter while questioning a witness for the plaintiff. We affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the plaintiff's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and legal conclusions, as set forth by the commissioner,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   are relevant to this appeal. On October 16, 2012, Hamden animal control officer Christopher Smith issued disposal orders concerning two dogs owned by the plaintiff. The disposal orders were based upon an October 3, 2012 incident in which Reed sustained bite injuries from the two dogs outside of her residence in Hamden. After the two dogs escaped from their fenced enclosure located at the plaintiff's residence, a witness, Corey Saulsbury, saw the\n   dogs approaching from the street on which the plaintiff resided and making a \"beeline\" toward a little girl, Reed's granddaughter, who began crying and screaming. The dogs first jumped on Reed's granddaughter and pawed her. Once Reed exited her upstairs apartment on the building's exterior stairs and came down to see what was happening to her granddaughter, the dogs jumped on her, bit her, pulled her, and dragged her from the stairs, eventually dragging her across the curb, grass, driveway, and sidewalk. Saulsbury observed the dogs \"pulling off chunks of [Reed's] neck and her back.\" At this point, Reed was on Saulsbury's automobile asking for help as the dogs pulled and bit her. Saulsbury attempted to use his automobile to hit the dogs in order to halt the attack. Later, two male bystanders retrieved a baseball bat and a pole and struck the dogs until they stopped attacking Reed and ran away. After the attack,\n   there was blood on the driver's side window of Saulsbury's automobile, where Reed had approached in an attempt to obtain assistance. The dogs were later located at the plaintiff's residence and a fourteen day quarantine order was issued for them. After conducting an investigation, in which he concluded that Reed did not strike the dogs at all, Smith issued disposal orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Reed's injuries required onsite treatment by emergency medical personnel and transport to a hospital in New Haven for further treatment for dog bite injuries to her head, the back of her neck, and her back. Reed remained hospitalized until her release on October 5, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The commissioner concluded in relevant part as follows: \"Because the dogs did not merely bite and release [Reed] after their physical contact with her, but continued to attack and bite her until they were physically beaten or removed from her body, it is not difficult to conclude that the injuries to [Reed] could have been even worse if these citizens did not risk their own welfare to come to her aid. The evidence in the record establishes that the attack and dog bite involving [the two dogs] that occurred on October 3, 2012, was a dangerous incident, impacting public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"There was no evidence in the record to support the assertion that [Reed] somehow provoked the attack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Instead, the record supports the fact that when [Reed] came down the stairs of her residence, apparently in response to the screams of her granddaughter ... the dogs surprised [Reed] and she tried to retreat. [The\n   dogs] immediately attacked, bit, and dragged [Reed], and [she] sustained injuries from the dog bites that required her to be transported by ambulance to a hospital for treatment for these injuries. [Reed] was admitted to the hospital for treatment from these injuries. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the notion that the attack and dog bites to [Reed] were severe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is, however, no magic to the word 'severe.' The record establishes that the attack and dog bites to [Reed] could alternatively have been called or deemed serious, or vicious, or aggressive, or any number of other adjectives. There is certainly 'a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred'.... The point is that the nature of the attack and dog bites to [Reed] by [the dogs] and her resulting injuries were significant enough to justify issuance of the disposal orders, or stated alternatively, the disposal orders were appropriately 'deemed necessary' by the [t]own of Hamden [a]nimal [c]ontrol [o]fficer.\" (Citation omitted; footnotes added.)\n   After the issuance of the disposal orders pursuant to \u00a7 22-358,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiff appealed to the commissioner. Thereafter, a notice of hearing was provided to the parties by certified mail, which provided the time and location of the appeal and the commissioner's authority for the hearing under \u00a7 22-358(c)in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA); General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; and the department rules of practice, \u00a7\u00a7 22-7-20through 22-7-38 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The applicable regulations and a copy of\n   the department's order of procedure\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   were provided to the parties' attorneys,\n   along with a copy of the notice of hearing. The department appointed a hearing officer, Sherman, and convened a formal administrative hearing to determine whether the orders should stand. The hearing was held and concluded in its entirety on October 23, 2013, before the hearing officer. The hearing officer issued a proposed final decision recommending affirmance of Smith's two orders. After reviewing the entire record, hearing oral argument from the parties, and considering the plaintiff's brief in response to the hearing officer's proposed final decision, the commissioner issued a final decision affirming the two disposal orders. The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which rejected the first, second, and fourth claims she raises on appeal to this court. The trial court found \"ample evidence to support the conclusion that the bites were severe and that disposal was an appropriate remedy,\" and dismissed the plaintiff's appeal. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff first claims that her right under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution to confront the witnesses against her was violated when the statements of Reed and Jones were admitted as evidence by the hearing officer, despite the fact that these two witnesses did not testify and were not available for cross-examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically,\n   the plaintiff argues\n   that the administrative hearing was \"quasi-criminal\" in nature, and, as such, the right to cross-examine one's accusers attaches. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, \"the [commissioner] should not be able to rely on or use any statements, allegations, conclusions, etc., by Reed or Jones in [his final] decision as neither was ... present for cross-examination.\" We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this issue. At the proceeding before the hearing officer, the town of Hamden submitted as evidence statements made to the police by Reed and Jones, as well as police reports containing references to statements made by Reed and Jones about the dogs' attack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the plaintiff's objections that such evidence was inadmissible hearsay because neither Reed nor Jones was present at the hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   the hearing officer admitted the evidence on the ground that hearsay is admissible in\n   administrative hearings. On appeal, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Schuman, J.,\n   </em>\n   concluded that the sixth amendment to the federal constitution was not implicated because the proceeding was not quasi-criminal in nature, and that the statements were properly admitted as reliable and probative hearsay evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Our analysis begins by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \"Our standard of review of administrative agency rulings is well established.... Judicial review of an administrative decision is a creature of statute ... and [\u00a7 4-183(j)] permits modification or reversal of an agency's decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) [i]n violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error or law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Tele Tech of Connecticut Corp. v.

The record does not disclose that the plaintiff attempted to pursue any of these options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We conclude that the hearing officer's admission of the hearsay statements of Reed and Jones did not violate the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and that these statements were therefore properly considered by the commissioner prior to issuing his final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff next contends that the commissioner erred in failing to find that the hearing officer improperly forced one of her witnesses to leave the hearing before testifying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the plaintiff claims that \"a witness essential to the matter, with facts surrounding the incident ... was forced to leave the hearing despite a medical condition that was the reason for her behavior.\" This claim is wholly without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The following additional facts are pertinent to this issue. The record discloses that the hearing officer twice admonished Satanya Hudson, a friend of the plaintiff, for creating some sort of disturbance in the hearing room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The precise nature of the disturbance is not apparent on the record. It further appears that Hudson\n   later left the hearing room to tend to a medical condition and never returned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commissioner found that the\n   hearing officer did not request, require, or force Hudson to leave the hearing, but merely asked that she not be disruptive, and that Hudson did not state or reveal that a medical condition caused her to be disruptive. He further found that it was not the hearing officer's responsibility to ascertain whether counsel for the plaintiff wanted to call Hudson to testify. On appeal, the trial court concluded that there was nothing in the record to support the plaintiff's claim that Hudson was forced out of the hearing room and that, in any event, the plaintiff failed to establish any prejudice arising from the episode as no proffer by counsel for the plaintiff regarding Hudson's proposed testimony was ever made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The premise of the plaintiff's claim is belied by the record, which is simply bereft of any indication that the hearing officer \"forced [Hudson] to leave and not testify\" or that she \"was not allowed back to testify.\" Notably, at no time during the hearing did the plaintiff object by claiming that Hudson had been forced to leave or had not been allowed back to testify. Additionally, as the commissioner found, \"[t]here was no request made to the hearing officer to have [Hudson] testify after a break or recess, there was no request to continue or hold open the hearing to have [Hudson] testify on another date, [and] there was no proffer by counsel for [the plaintiff] regarding the alleged nature of [Hudson's] testimony.\" Further, \"[t]here was no request to file an affidavit regarding the nature of [Hudson's] testimony ... and no request was made to late file such an exhibit.\" Thus, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that her right to due process of law was violated as a result of the hearing officer's verbal exchanges with Hudson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiff next argues that the proposed final decision of the hearing officer was made upon unlawful procedure because the department lacked written procedures that applied specifically to hearings on dog disposal orders, thereby depriving the plaintiff of due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the plaintiff, the hearing officer \"rel[ied] solely on the codified sections of the [UAPA] ... and the Department of Agriculture's rules of practice, both of which are\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   in nature and apply to all hearings before the department, and not\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   to appeals of dog disposal orders.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the plaintiff asserts, her right to due process was violated because the hearing officer lacked sufficient guidance as to how to conduct the administrative hearing. As support for this claim, the plaintiff relies on a transcript of a status conference in an unrelated case before the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut,\n   which the plaintiff claims, shows the lack \"of any written rules, procedures or guidelines used by the department ... as they relate to the department's practices and procedures pursuant to \u00a7 22-358.\" This claim, including its reference to the appended transcript, is raised for the first time before this court. We therefore decline to review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Practice Book \u00a7 60-5provides in relevant part that [this] court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.

The plaintiff, however, appears to argue that because the District Court status conference on which she relies took place\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the administrative hearing, she is entitled to rely on it in the present claim. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Even assuming, arguendo, that the status conference transcript supports the plaintiff's proposition, the record reflects that the department informed the plaintiff in a letter prior\n   to the hearing that \"[the] hearing will be conducted in accordance with the [UAPA] and the Department of Agriculture [r]ules of [p]ractice, [s]ections 22-7-20 through 22-7-38 as found in the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (enclosed).\" Thus, the plaintiff had notice of what procedural rules would-and, importantly, would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   -be used during the hearing. If, as the plaintiff asserts, \"there [were] no written guidelines, rules, or procedures for parties to follow\" specifically in administrative hearings on dog disposal orders, such lack of specific procedures was as apparent before the hearing as the plaintiff contends it is now. Thus, the plaintiff's claim did not \"ar[ise] subsequent to the trial.\" Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.

United States,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3516335\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/116/616/#p617\">\n     116 U.S. 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 617-18,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3516335\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/116/616/#p617\">\n     6 S.Ct. 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3516335\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/116/616/#p617\">\n     29 L.Ed. 746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1886), for instance, involved a proceeding by the United States to execute the forfeiture of cases of plate glass, which allegedly had been illegally imported without payment of the customs duty. The Supreme Court held that proceedings instituted for the purpose of declaring the forfeiture of property by reason of crimes committed by the owner, though civil in form, are quasi-criminal in nature, and, therefore, under the fourth and fifth amendments, the owner cannot be compelled to produce documents that justify the forfeiture by proving the criminal violation occurred.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3516335\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/116/616/#p617\">\n     Id., at 634-35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3516335\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/116/616/#p617\">\n     6 S.Ct. 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v.

In that case, police officers stopped an automobile and searched the rear and trunk without a warrant and without probable cause, ultimately finding thirty-one cases of liquor not bearing Pennsylvania tax seals, which constituted a violation of Pennsylvania law.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524671\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/693/#p702\">\n     Id., at 694-95\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524671\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/693/#p702\">\n     85 S.Ct. 1246\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In the present case, by contrast, the animal control officer was not required to find that the plaintiff violated any criminal law in order to justify his disposal orders under \u00a7 22-358(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    A municipality may assess on the owner certain fees, including a nominal \"redemption fee\" for owners claiming a captured or impounded animal, and a payment representing the cost to the municipality of quarantining a biting animal. General Statutes \u00a7 22-333. These fees, however, merely compensate a municipality for costs incurred while impounding an animal, and thus cannot be described as punitive in nature. Compare Black's Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) p. 629 (defining \"fee\" as \"[a] charge for labor or services, esp. professional services\"), with Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at p. 647 (defining \"fine\" as \"[a] pecuniary criminal punishment or civil penalty payable to the public treasury\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    And, although, pursuant to \u00a7 22-358(c), the state may punish an animal owner with a thirty day prison term and $250 fine for failing to comply with a quarantine order issued after a biting incident, such criminal penalty is distinct from a disposal order, and, in any event, is not at issue in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    At the administrative hearing, the plaintiff's prior counsel acknowledged that the plaintiff was not arrested.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 22-363provides: \"No person shall own or harbor a dog or dogs which is or are a nuisance by reason of vicious disposition or excessive barking or other disturbance, or, by such barking or other disturbance, is or are a source of annoyance to any sick person residing in the immediate vicinity.

[The plaintiff], through counsel, was given the opportunity to cross-examine all witnesses produced by the town, to put on her own witnesses and to submit documentary evidence.... There was no violation of fundamental fairness to [the plaintiff]. In assessing the common-law right to fundamental fairness, courts review whether there was due notice of the hearing, that the parties had the right to produce relevant evidence and that there was the right to cross-examine witnesses produced by its adversary.... Again, in this case, [the plaintiff] had notice and the opportunity to participate in a fair and impartial administrative hearing. [The plaintiff] had the opportunity to present all relevant evidence in this matter. All of the documents presented by [the plaintiff] were accepted as evidence and made part of the record for the final decision maker's consideration. [The plaintiff] had the opportunity to cross-examine all of the witnesses produced by the town. [The plaintiff] had the opportunity to call any and all witnesses that she determined to present for testimony before the hearing officer.
