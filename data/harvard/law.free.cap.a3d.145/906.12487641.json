The defendant was charged with murder and various other offenses in connection with the shooting death of Vajinder Toor in the town of Branford on April 26, 2010. Over the next several years, the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, restored to competency, and then found incompetent again. After the second finding of incompetency, the trial court conducted\n   evidentiary hearings on the question of whether the defendant should be forcibly medicated. The court ultimately concluded that the state had established by clear and convincing evidence that forcible medication of the defendant would not violate his federal due process rights under the test set forth in the decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sell v.

We disagree and affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On April 26, 2010, Toor, a physician, was shot and killed outside his residence in Branford. Later that day, the defendant, who also was a physician, was arrested and charged with Toor's murder, the\n   attempted murder of Toor's wife, carrying a pistol without a permit and possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle. On September 28, 2010, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Fasano, J.,\n   </em>\n   found the defendant incompetent to stand trial but restorable, and ordered that he be admitted to the Whiting Forensic Division of Connecticut Valley Hospital (Whiting) for treatment. Thereafter, Judge Fasano found that the defendant had been restored to competency and granted his motion to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2015, Thomas Ullmann, the supervisor of the Office of the Public Defender for the judicial district of New Haven, filed a motion for the appointment of counsel, in which he requested that the trial court revoke the defendant's status as a self-represented party and appoint a public defender to represent him on the ground that the defendant was incompetent\n   to represent himself. In support of this claim, Ullmann referred to hundreds of motions that the defendant had filed in the trial court, including at least seventy in which the defendant had sought permission to obtain information from Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (Kingsbrook) in Brooklyn, New York, where the defendant had worked for two years with Toor until the defendant was terminated in May, 2008. In other motions, the defendant claimed that he had been wrongfully terminated by Kingsbrook because of false accusations made by Toor, claimed that the defendant, not Toor, was the real victim, and questioned the identification of Toor's body by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    O'Keefe, J.,\n   </em>\n   found the defendant incompetent to stand trial and ordered that he again be admitted to Whiting for evaluation and treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court also ordered that a public defender represent the defendant\n   until it could be determined whether treatment could restore him to competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 14, 2015, the trial court conducted a second competency hearing for the purpose of determining whether the defendant had been restored to competency. Mark S. Cotterell, a psychiatrist and forensic monitor employed by Whiting, testified at the hearing that he had been involved in the evaluation of the defendant from late 2010 until early 2011 during the defendant's first admission to Whiting. After the defendant was sent back to Whiting in April, 2015, Cotterell again had been assigned to evaluate him and to prepare a report. In performing this task, Cotterell met repeatedly with the defendant and with members of his treatment team, and reviewed his treatment records. Cotterell testified that the defendant had been diagnosed with \"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.\" In Cotterell's opinion, the defendant was not competent to stand trial but could be restored to competency. Cotterell also testified that the least restrictive placement that would still be effective would be for the defendant to remain at Whiting as an inpatient. Cotterell further testified that there were medications that could help restore the defendant to competency, but the defendant did not believe that he had any psychiatric disorder and did not want to take any medications. According to Cotterell, studies showed that the success rate of such medications was \"anywhere from the mid-50 percent range up to about 70 percent.\" Cotterell also testified that, \"based on our clinical experience, we can probably get at least ... that much, if not sometimes more, simply because the research doesn't always include longer term treatment.\" At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial and that the \"normal treatment\" that Cotterell had described\n   was \"not going to work here.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court appointed Gail Sicilia, a psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse employed by Yale University, as the defendant's health-care guardian pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (k)(3)(A). Finally, the trial court ordered that Sicilia prepare a report setting forth her findings and recommendations concerning the forced administration of antipsychotic medication to the defendant.\n   On October 26, 2015, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether the defendant should be forcibly medicated. Cotterell testified at the hearing that, despite the ongoing efforts of the staff at Whiting, the defendant had not made any substantial progress toward competency since being admitted to Whiting in April, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cotterell recommended that the defendant be treated with the antipsychotic medications Olanzapine and Ziprasidone. Cotterell testified that these medications had \"a substantial likelihood of treating the symptoms\" that the defendant was experiencing, \"based on our clinical experience dealing with these kinds of patients and these kinds of medication.\" In addition, the published research indicated a \"greater than 50 percent chance ... that [those medications will result] in a substantial improvement in the [patient's] clinical state.\" Cotterell wrote in a memorandum documenting the proposed medication regimen for the defendant that the \"[n]otable potential side effects\" of Olanzapine are dizziness, dry mouth, joint\n   pain, constipation, orthostatic hypotension,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and tachycardia, and that there is \"some risk\" of weight gain, hyperglycemia or sedation. A notable side effect is one that is either frequent or significant, or both. The \"notable potential side effects\" of Ziprasidone are dizziness, stiffness, sedation, nausea, dry mouth, skin rash and low blood pressure, and there is a \"low [risk]\" of weight gain or sedation with long-term use. Cotterell testified that \"a lot of clients who use these medications ... don't actually experience sedation\" and that sedation was \"not something that [one] would expect to be universally present.\" In addition, he testified that the staff at Whiting would carefully monitor the defendant and any side effects from his medications that could interfere with his ability to present a defense at trial and would report their observations to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sicilia testified at the October 26, 2015 hearing that she had met several times with the defendant, and also with Cotterell and others who provided care to the defendant at Whiting. Sicilia's observations of the defendant were consistent with Cotterell's diagnosis. Sicilia testified that, in her opinion, it would be in the defendant's best interest to be treated with antipsychotic medications, both for purposes of restoring him to competency to stand trial and for his general mental health. Specifically, she believed that the defendant's \"delusions affect how he's functioning\" and that the medications would \"[decrease] the delusions to the point where he could ignore some of [them] ... go about his daily living ... [and] function at a higher level.\" When she suggested this course of treatment to the defendant, however, he adamantly refused, stating that he did not need medication and that he should not be\n   at Whiting. In Sicilia's professional opinion, there were no other treatments that would be less intrusive and that could restore the defendant to competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the October 26, 2015 hearing, the state filed a motion, along with a supporting\n   memorandum of law, requesting that the trial court order the administration of medication to the defendant, and the defendant filed a memorandum of law in opposition to forced medication. The trial court heard arguments on the issue on November 18, 2015, and, at the conclusion of the hearing, found that the state had proven all of the elements of the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Sell v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/#p180\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/#p180\">\n    539 U.S. at 179-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/#p180\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for establishing the constitutionality of an order of involuntary medication by clear and convincing evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court granted the state's motion for forced medication. Thereafter, the trial court supplemented its findings with a memorandum of decision in which it credited Cotterell's testimony that the recommended medications \"are effective in restoring patients to competency from the mid-50 percent range up to 70 percent.\" The court concluded that this rate of effectiveness constituted a substantial likelihood that the defendant would be restored to competency for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Sell.\n   </em>\n   The court also concluded that the\n   medications are \"substantially unlikely to have side [e]ffects that will interfere significantly with the defendant's ability to assist counsel in conducting a trial defense\" and that there are no less intrusive treatments that would be effective. Finally, the court credited Sicilia's testimony that the administration of the medications would be medically appropriate and in the defendant's best medical interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal followed. The defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that there is \"a need for [forced medication] sufficiently important to overcome the [defendant's] protected interest in refusing it....\"\n   <em>\n    Sell v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/#p180\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/#p180\">\n    539 U.S. at 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897706\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/166/#p180\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the defendant contends that the state failed to prove that it is substantially likely that forced medication will restore him to competency because a 55 to 70 percent probability of restoration to competency does not constitute a substantial likelihood for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Sell,\n   </em>\n   and, even if it did, the state failed to prove that there was a 55 to 70 percent probability that forced medication would restore the defendant to competency. In addition, the defendant challenges the trial court's findings that (1) it is substantially unlikely that the side effects of forced medication will deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial, (2) there is no less restrictive alternative to forced medication, and (3) the involuntary administration of medication is in the defendant's best medical interest. We conclude that the trial court applied the proper standard and that its findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following legal principles guide our analysis of the defendant's claims. \"It\n   is well established that [a]n individual has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs-an interest that only an essential or overriding state interest might overcome.

It surely is not an overstatement to observe that the government's ability to enforce the criminal laws in accordance with due process is the foundation on which social order rests and from which individual liberties emanate. Thus, when an individual commits a crime, he forfeits his liberty interests to the extent necessary for the government to bring him to trial. Recognizing this important governmental interest, the [United States] Supreme Court has held that in some circumstances, forced medication to render a defendant competent to stand trial for a crime that [that person] is charged with committing may be constitutionally permissible, even though the circumstances in which it is appropriate may be rare.

Most federal circuit courts of appeals have concluded, however, that the first prong, regarding the government's interest in restoring the defendant to competency, is a question of law subject to de novo review and the remaining prongs are factual questions subject to review for clear error.

First, most of the cases on which the defendant relies do not engage\n   in any analysis of the meaning of the term \"substantially likely\" but merely state conclusorily that a 50 percent probability does not satisfy that standard. See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For purposes of making this predictive judgment, however, we believe that the clear and convincing evidence standard pertains to the\n   <em>\n    confidence level\n   </em>\n   of the fact finder, not the specific degree of probability that the state must establish. See\n   <em>\n    Fish v.

We note, for example, that\n   \u00a7 54-56d (k)(2) provides in relevant part that \"the court may order the involuntary medication of the defendant if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (A) [t]o a reasonable degree of medical certainty, involuntary medication of the defendant will render the defendant competent to stand trial....\" A reasonable degree of medical certainty means that restoration to competency is more likely than not. See\n   <em>\n    Struckman v.

These standards alone will significantly\n   narrow the class of defendants who are potentially subject to forced medication to restore competency to stand trial. We see no reason why the United States Supreme Court would have intended that there must be a substantial\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   narrowing of that class by requiring proof of a very high probability that forced medication will restore competency. See D. Klein, supra, at 910 (requirement that government establish substantial likelihood that forced medication will render defendant competent to stand trial \"is unlikely to limit the instances in which trial courts allow involuntary medications\"). Put another way, if the government can establish that it has an important interest in bringing the defendant to trial, that it will not be able to do so unless the defendant is medicated and that medication is medically appropriate and in the defendant's best medical interest, we can see no reason why the government should be further required to establish, not just that it is\n   <em>\n    more likely than not\n   </em>\n   that forced medication will restore the defendant\n   to competency, but that it is\n   <em>\n    highly likely\n   </em>\n   that forced medication will have that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that, for purposes of determining whether forced medication is substantially likely to render a defendant competent to stand trial under\n   <em>\n    Sell,\n   </em>\n   \"substantially likely\" means more likely than not, or a greater than 50 percent probability. In our view, in light of the other three prongs of\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   that, in and of themselves, provide significant protection to defendants who are potentially subject to orders of forced medication, a more stringent interpretation of the phrase \"substantially likely\" in\n   <em>\n    Sell v.

Indeed, Cotterell testified that the likelihood of restoration could well exceed this estimate with longer term treatment. We therefore conclude that the trial court correctly determined that there was clear and convincing evidence that there was a substantial likelihood that the medications will restore the defendant to competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant contends, however, that, even if a greater than 50 percent success rate constitutes a substantial likelihood for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Sell,\n   </em>\n   Cotterell's testimony was not sufficient to support the trial court's finding that it was substantially likely that he would be restored to competency because Cotterell did not testify regarding the success rate for patients with the defendant's specific psychiatric diagnosis and characteristics, including his current age, his age at the onset of his symptoms, and the length of time that he has experienced the symptoms but, rather, testified only about the general effectiveness of the recommended medications. We are not persuaded by this argument. Cotterell testified that he personally had met with and evaluated the defendant, and that his opinion was based on his \"clinical experience dealing with\n   <em>\n    these kinds of patients\n   </em>\n   and these kinds of medication.\" (Emphasis added.) It is implicit in this testimony that, in Cotterell's professional judgment, there was nothing about the defendant's particular condition or circumstances that would significantly reduce the effectiveness of the medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To the extent that Cotterell relied on published research indicating a \"greater than 50 percent chance ... that [those medications will result in] a substantial improvement in the [patient's] clinical state,\" medical experts and courts simply have no choice but to rely on generalized studies when making such predictive judgments. See, e.g., D. Klein, supra, at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Wm.%20%26%20Mary%20Bill%20Rts.%20J.%20910\">\n    13 Wm. &amp; Mary Bill Rts.

Accordingly, in the absence of evidence demonstrating why a general\n   study has no application to the particular defendant, medical experts and courts properly may rely on such studies. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The evidence also showed that sedation was a \"[n]otable potential side [effect]\" of Ziprasidone, meaning that the side effect was either frequent or significant, or both, but there was only a low risk of sedation when used long term. In addition, Cotterell testified that \"a lot of clients who use these medications ... don't actually experience sedation\" and that sedation was \"not something that [one] would expect to be universally present.\" Cotterell further testified that the staff at Whiting would carefully monitor the defendant and any side effects from his medications that could interfere with his ability to present a defense at trial and would report their observations to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We conclude that this evidence supports the trial court's finding that the recommended medications are substantially unlikely to produce side effects that will interfere with the defendant's ability to conduct a defense. With respect to Olanzapine, the evidence demonstrated that sedation is not a notable risk of the medication, that is, that side effect is neither frequent nor significant. With respect to Ziprasidone, although the evidence indicated that sedation is a notable risk of the medication, the evidence also indicated that there is only a \"low\" risk of sedation with long-term use. We therefore agree with the state that the trial court reasonably could have concluded, on the basis of this evidence, that, although sedation may be a frequent or significant\n   <em>\n    short-term\n   </em>\n   side effect of Ziprasidone, that side effect significantly\n   <em>\n    diminishes\n   </em>\n   over time as the patient develops a tolerance for the medication. In addition, because the staff at Whiting will continuously monitor\n   the side effects of the medication and report their observations to the trial court, the court reasonably could have concluded that, if the defendant initially experienced significant sedation, there was no substantial likelihood that the defendant would be brought to trial before that side effect diminished sufficiently to allow the defendant to conduct a defense. In our view, the fact that a defendant is likely to experience a short-term side effect that could interfere with his right to a fair trial does not require the court to deny a request for forcible medication if it is substantially likely that the side effect will subside sufficiently to allow the defendant to conduct a defense. This is especially true when the medication will have no negative effect on the defendant's overall health. Accordingly, we reject the defendant's claim that the trial court's finding that it was substantially unlikely that forced medication would result in side effects that would interfere with his right to conduct a defense was not supported by clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We next address the defendant's claim that the trial court's finding that forced medication is necessary because \"any alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results\";\n   <em>\n    Sell v.

Sicilia testified that there were no treatments other than forced medication that would be less intrusive and that could still restore the defendant to competency. We conclude that this testimony\n   constituted clear and convincing evidence in support of the trial court's finding that alternative treatments were unlikely to achieve the substantially same results as forced medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In support of his claim to the contrary, the defendant contends that, during his first stay at Whiting in late 2010 through early 2011, he had been able to develop an effective therapeutic relationship with his privately retained therapist and had been restored to competency through psychotherapy and educational classes. The defendant presented no evidence during the competency hearings in 2015, however, to refute the evidence presented by the state with respect to this prong of\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   or that would support a finding that similar treatment would still be effective in restoring the defendant to competency. Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, we address the defendant's claim that the trial court's finding that forced medication \"is medically appropriate, i.e., in the patient's best medical interest in light of his medical condition\"; (emphasis omitted)\n   <em>\n    Sell v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In support of this prong of\n   <em>\n    Sell,\n   </em>\n   the state presented Sicilia's testimony that it would be in the defendant's best interest to be treated with antipsychotic medications, both for purposes of restoring him to competency to stand trial and for his general mental health. Sicilia further explained that the defendant's \"delusions affect how he's functioning\" and that the medications would \"[decrease] the delusions to the point where he could ignore some of [them] ... go about his daily living ... [and] function at a higher level.\" We conclude that this testimony constituted clear and convincing evidence in support of the trial court's finding that forced\n   medication would be in the defendant's best medical interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The defendant contends, however, that the state has not established that it is in his best medical interest to medicate him to reduce his delusional symptoms so that he is competent to stand trial, and then to stop the medications after trial. Specifically, he contends that the most likely result of forced medication in the long run will be to \"reinforce his delusional beliefs that Whiting, along with the courts and his lawyers, is out to get him.\" As with his other claims, however, the defendant presented no evidence at the competency hearings that would support this claim. Moreover, when the sole purpose of ordering the administration of medication is to restore a defendant to competency to stand trial, there is always a possibility that the beneficial effects of the medication will last only as long as the trial because the sole basis for the order will disappear when the trial concludes. If that possibility were enough to bar an order of forced medication, it would be barred in every case. Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In summary, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that it is substantially likely that forced medication will restore the defendant's competency to stand trial on the basis of Cotterell's testimony that the probability that the recommended medications will be effective is\n   greater than 50 percent. We further conclude that the trial court's findings that it is substantially unlikely that the defendant will experience side effects that will adversely affect his ability to conduct a defense, that there are no less intrusive treatments that will achieve substantially the same effect, and that forced medication is in the defendant's best medical interest were supported by clear and convincing evidence.
