The hospital argues, and we agree, that insufficient evidence was presented from which the jury reasonably could have found that Dr. Bodavula was the hospital's agent for purposes of assisting in the plaintiff's surgery and, therefore, the hospital could not be held vicariously liable for the\n   plaintiff's injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On July 23, 2008, the plaintiff underwent hernia repair surgery at the hospital. The surgery was to be performed by Dr. Joseph R. Gordon, her physician, who had recommended the procedure to the plaintiff during an examination at his office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Gordon was not employed by the hospital, but maintained staff privileges allowing him to attend to his patients admitted to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the start of the procedure, but without the plaintiff's knowledge, a fourth year medical resident, Dr. Bodavula, was assigned to assist Dr. Gordon with the surgery. Dr. Bodavula was enrolled in the surgical medical residency program, sponsored by Sound Shore Medical Center in New York, which included rotations at the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Gordon asked Dr. Bodavula about his experience with a surgical device called an optical trocar, which was to be used in the surgery. Dr. Bodavula informed Dr. Gordon that he knew how to use the device. Under Dr. Gordon's supervision, Dr. Bodavula\n   performed the initial insertion of the device into the plaintiff's abdomen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the surgery proceeded, Dr. Gordon became concerned that Dr. Bodavula was improperly using the optical trocar. At that point, Dr. Gordon took over for Dr. Bodavula and completed the plaintiff's surgery. Two days after the surgery, while recovering in the hospital, the plaintiff began to exhibit signs of infection and her body went into septic shock. It was discovered that the plaintiff's colon had been perforated during the surgery. The plaintiff began to suffer from multiple organ failure and was subsequently connected to a ventilator before being rushed into surgery to repair the perforation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff survived, but spent sixty-nine days in the hospital recovering from the perforation. Eight months after the initial surgery and due to the perforated colon, the plaintiff required surgery to remove part of her large intestine, and, as a result of the procedure, she developed permanent\n   digestive problems. The trial court stated in its memorandum of decision that the plaintiff has difficulty being away from the bathroom for any length of time, is regularly in pain, has significantly reduced stamina and is unable to walk more than one-quarter of a mile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiffs filed negligence claims against Dr. Gordon, his practice, Advanced Specialty Care, P.C., Dr. Bodavula, and the hospital. The plaintiffs alleged that Dr. Gordon and Dr. Bodavula were agents of the hospital and, therefore, the hospital was vicariously liable for their actions. Prior to the commencement of trial, the plaintiffs settled with Dr. Gordon and Advanced Specialty Care, P.C., for an undisclosed sum. In May, 2014, a jury trial commenced to address the remaining claims against Dr. Bodavula and the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Bodavula was enrolled in the surgical residency program at Sound Shore Medical Center in New\n   Rochelle, New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The program included rotations at Danbury Hospital. Dr. Bodavula testified that as a fourth year medical resident he spent approximately 50 percent of his time at the hospital. A rotation at the hospital would last one to two months. On the day of the plaintiff's surgery, the chief resident of the surgical residency program assigned Dr. Bodavula to assist Dr. Gordon. There was no evidence presented as to whether the chief resident was an employee of the hospital, but Dr. Bodavula testified that in regard to the chief resident, \"I'm also the same residence, as the same part of the same pool of residents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During his testimony, Dr. Bodavula was questioned about the hospital's House Staff Manual (manual). Dr. Bodavula testified that he could not recall whether he had received a copy of the manual. Despite not being able to recall if he had received the manual, he believed that he was expected to comply with the obligations that it established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later in the trial, the hospital stipulated that the manual had been distributed to residents in 2008. The entire 231 page manual was admitted into evidence as a\n   full exhibit. The trial court ruled that the manual was relevant to the question of whether Dr. Bodavula was an agent of the hospital. The manual was accompanied by a cover letter from the chief executive officer of the hospital: \"This House Staff Manual has been developed as a guide to enlighten and clarify the many services and support functions available to members of the House Staff at Danbury Hospital, as well as to inform you of House Staff and Danbury Hospital policies.... I wish you a rewarding educational experience!\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The first section of the manual addressed resident policies, including selection to the program, resident evaluations, responsibilities, hospital safety, and benefits. The section on benefits included details about rent-free housing, vacation and sick leave, as well as insurance. It also stated: \"Danbury Hospital will provide a salary to the Resident, as specified in the Danbury Hospital Resident Agreement.\" There was no evidence submitted as to a \"Residency Agreement\" between Dr. Bodavula and the hospital. He testified that he was not paid by the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The manual also covered the hospital's clinical support services. This section included information on the hospital pharmacy, instructions on how to order a consultation from a cardiologist, and protocols for implementing patient telemetric monitoring. Another section of the manual, titled \"Residency Program Information,\" provided details for eight distinct residency programs: anesthesiology, general practice dentistry, internal\n   medicine, cardiovascular disease fellowship, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, psychiatry, and surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The chapter on the surgical residency program provided an overview of the program: \"Since 1999 Danbury Hospital has been an integrated part of the surgical residency at Sound Shore Medical Center in New Rochelle, NY. The residency is affiliated with New York Medical College. Ten general surgical residents from Sound Shore Medical Center rotate at Danbury Hospital at any given time. Surgical residents have an opportunity to study under attending surgeons who have had their own training at multiple academic institutions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This residency program section of the manual also established the hospital's expectations that residents must satisfy in order to be deemed proficient at six core competencies required by a national accreditation organization. The section goes on to describe the program's assessment procedures including surgical skills evaluation by faculty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no evidence presented at trial that the faculty were employees or agents of the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The manual did not address the regulations and procedures governing a resident's participation in a surgical procedure. Dr. Gordon testified that it was within his discretion to determine the resident's level of involvement during a surgical procedure. He also testified that throughout a surgical procedure he maintained the authority to end the resident's participation: \"[A]s the attending surgeon, I have to sometimes exert my\n   authority and just take over, and I say, I'm taking over, and the resident steps aside.\"\n   After the plaintiffs rested their case, each defendant moved for a directed verdict. The trial court denied the motions. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The jury awarded the plaintiff $902,985.04 in economic damages and $9.6 million in noneconomic damages. Philip Gagliano was awarded $1.5 million in loss of consortium damages. The jury found that Dr. Bodavula was an actual agent of the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Bodavula and the hospital were found liable for 80 percent of the plaintiffs' damages. The remaining 20 percent of liability was assigned to Dr. Gordon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the verdict, the hospital and Dr. Bodavula filed separate motions to set aside the verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and remittitur. The court denied the six motions. With respect to the hospital's motions, the trial court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Dr. Bodavula was an agent of the hospital when he operated on the plaintiff. Specifically, the court found that credible evidence was presented to the jury that showed that Dr. Bodavula: wore a hospital badge; treated patients according to the instructions of the chief resident; reported to and was evaluated by hospital staff; was required to follow hospital obligations, protocols and\n   rules; and was assigned to the plaintiff's surgery by the chief resident. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the present case involves a motion to set aside the verdict made in conjunction with a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, on the basis of the same grounds, we will treat the two motions as one for purposes of our resolution of the hospital's claim.\n   <em>\n    Macchietto v.

The plaintiffs produced insufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could have found that Dr. Bodavula was the hospital's agent for purposes of assisting in the plaintiff's surgery and, therefore, the hospital should not have been held vicariously liable for the plaintiff's injuries. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the evidence presented was so lacking that it could not establish that there was an understanding between Dr. Bodavula and the hospital that the hospital would be in control of Dr. Bodavula's performance of the surgery. The plaintiffs suggest that the evidence demonstrated that the hospital controlled many aspects of a resident's work at the hospital and, therefore, the hospital must have also been in control of a resident's performance of surgical procedures, regardless of whether an attending physician was present and had overall responsibility\n   for the patient. It is plausible that some of the evidence, viewed out of context, could have suggested an agency relationship, but when the evidence is viewed in context and focused on the plaintiff's surgery alone, it was the court's duty to set aside the verdict because it was palpably against the evidence presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Medical residency programs are unique in that they have both academic and employment characteristics.

The evidence in this case suggested that the nature of the medical resident's relationship to the hospital was controlled by a residency agreement, but that agreement was not introduced into evidence. In fact, the plaintiffs did not produce any direct evidence to support their position that the hospital was in control of the surgical procedure. Instead, the plaintiffs relied\n   extensively on circumstantial evidence, including the content of the hospital's manual. The manual was entered into evidence without the necessary context to determine whether it contemplated an academic relationship or an employment relationship, or both. It was most notably not established that the provisions of the manual were intended to regulate surgical procedures. Furthermore, other circumstantial evidence produced by the plaintiffs, e.g., security badges, could not lead to a reasonable inference of agency by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The relationship between a resident and a hospital is unique.

After interpreting the agreement, Chief Justice Peters concluded that the resident's relationship to the hospital and the hospital's decision to dismiss him was an academic decision.

Without the residency agreement, this foundational analysis could not be performed in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The glaring absence of the residency agreement was all the more relevant because the surgical residency program was managed and shared among several organizations and parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the manual stated, this was an\n   integrated residency program involving three separate organizations: the hospital, Sound Shore Medical Center, and New York Medical College.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, faculty physicians with hospital privileges supervised residents during surgical procedures and evaluated their performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Critical factual evidence regarding the complex relationships involved in this surgical residency program was not presented at trial. The plaintiffs were not under any requirement to enter the residency agreement into evidence. However, without the residency agreement, the jury was left with an incomplete picture of the residency program and the precise nature of the hospital's relationship with its residents, including Dr. Bodavula, in order to allow for a finding of agency.\n   The plaintiffs did not present any evidence that specifically showed that Dr. Bodavula had agreed to act or was authorized to act as an agent of the hospital during the plaintiff's surgery. The critical question was\n   whether the hospital had a right to control Dr. Bodavula's performance of the surgery. See\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti v. Aranow,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20Conn.%20App.%201\">\n    154 Conn.App. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20A.3d%20265\">\n    105 A.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The hospital did not dictate how Dr. Gordon was to utilize the assistance of the resident, and there was no evidence of standard procedures that regulated the conduct of Dr. Gordon and Dr. Bodavula in relation to the surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   At all times, the only conclusion rationally drawn from the evidence was that Dr. Gordon was in command of the plaintiff's surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Gordon testified: \"[T]his is a resident in training and I'm his instructor, I'm watching his moves very carefully, and I'm standing, literally, right behind him, over his shoulder....\" The plaintiffs did not produce any evidence to contradict Dr. Gordon's testimony that he, and not the hospital, was in control of Dr. Bodavula's performance of the surgical tasks in the operating room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was the plaintiffs' burden to prove agency.

A close and careful reading of the manual reveals no contractual language or agreement between the parties creating an agency relationship for purposes of assisting in surgical procedures. Rather, the manual was controlled by the residency agreement and in fact referred to the residency agreement for specific details. As the benefits section of the manual stated: \"Danbury Hospital will provide a salary to the Resident,\n   <em>\n    as specified in the Danbury Hospital Resident Agreement.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the context of the residency program, the manual was insufficient to support the existence of an agency relationship in the conduct of surgery. In\n   <em>\n    Gupta,\n   </em>\n   Chief Justice Peters employed a functional analysis: \"Because of the hybrid nature of the residency agreement, we conclude that the agreement is more properly interpreted, under any particular set of circumstances, by a functional analysis of its terms in relationship to the nature of the alleged breach, rather than by an overarching search for the purpose or purposes of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Gupta v.

Chief Justice Peters noted: \"Arthur Corbin commented perceptively on the utility of a judicial search for the principal purpose of a contract when he wrote: 'How is a court to discover what was the principal purpose of the parties or whether they had any? It is certain, in practically all business transactions, that they had different purposes, at least in part. Their principal purpose, or their separate and diverse purposes, can not be determined by a process that is wholly independent of the words of the agreement.' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20A.2d%20111\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 586 n. 11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20A.2d%20111\">\n    687 A.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, the jury was left to determine the principal purpose of the parties' relationship solely through the 231 page manual, without \"the language of the residency agreement\"; id., at 582,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20A.2d%20111\">\n    687 A.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and without context. The manual did not describe the relationship between academics and work, or explain where the line between\n   the two diverse roles was drawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the jury was not in a position to consider whether the hospital had the right to control Dr. Bodavula's performance of the surgery because, as the\n   court in\n   <em>\n    Gupta\n   </em>\n   noted, if this was an academic relationship then the right to control test was not appropriate. \"We have used the right to control test to distinguish between an independent contractor and an employee.... That test has no relevance, however, to the criteria for differentiation between a student and an employee. Indeed, it is a premise of the right to control test that what is at issue is the control of the means and methods of work ... thus assuming the very point that is presently at issue.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 588,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=687%20A.2d%20111\">\n    687 A.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is an inherent level of control in the academic setting, but it is a different nature and degree of control than is present in the employer-employee relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, in the academic setting the term \"evaluate\" generally means that a person will be graded on their work,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   but in the employment setting it can refer to a method used to control a person's work. The plaintiffs highlighted for the jury's consideration a section of the manual that referenced \"surgical skills\n   evaluations,\" but without necessary context there was no way for the jury to determine whether this evaluation was an academic or employment exercise and, thus, whether it created an agency relationship between the resident and the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The scope and applicability of the manual limited its effectiveness for a finding of agency. The scope of the manual focused on protocols, not control of resident performance and execution of surgical procedures. The trial court, in its ruling, cited to the manual as requiring Dr. Bodavula to comply with the hospital's \"obligations, protocols, and rules,\" but the section of the manual that was referenced applied generally to all of the residency programs at the hospital. The chapter on the surgical residency program provided more tailored guidance. The introduction stated: \"Surgical residents have an opportunity to\n   <em>\n    study under attending surgeons\n   </em>\n   who have had their own training at multiple academic institutions.\" (Emphasis added.) The duties and responsibilities listed in the surgery chapter of the manual pertained to seeing and evaluating general surgery in-patients outside of the operating room. These inpatient surgical resident duties included conducting morning rounds, ordering laboratory testing, and updating progress notes. The duties did not include participating in surgical procedures. In fact, satisfactory completion of the listed duties was a prerequisite to observing and participating in surgical procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Surgical residents would be evaluated on their manual dexterity in the operating room and their overall surgical skills, but\n   these evaluations appeared to be a part of the resident's academic ascension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   There were also general issues of applicability pertaining to the manual that, again, limited its effectiveness for a finding of agency. It was unclear which provisions of the manual applied to surgical residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eight diverse residency programs were discussed in the manual. Some of the residency programs were organic to the hospital, yet others, including the surgery program, were shared across other organizations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that \"[the hospital's] manual belies its contentions that it had no ability to control, assign and/or structure the work that Dr. Bodavula would do in its organization.\" As support, the trial court cited to the manual to conclude that Dr. Bodavula received from the hospital: a salary, rent-free housing, vacation time, sick time, and professional liability insurance. However, Dr. Bodavula testified that the hospital did not pay him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   and no evidence was presented to show that Dr. Bodavula was provided housing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   or to show that he received any\n   employment benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no question that the hospital exercised some level of control over some of Dr. Bodavula's activities that were conducted at the hospital. However, the circumstances of this case raise a more specific question: whether the hospital was \"in control\" of Dr. Bodavula's performance of the plaintiff's surgery. The plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence to properly allow for the question to be affirmatively answered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The remaining circumstantial evidence that was presented was not sufficient to support a finding of agency. The plaintiffs produced evidence to show that Dr. Bodavula\n   was directed to the plaintiff's surgery by the chief resident of the surgical residency program, but the plaintiffs did not present any evidence to show that the chief resident was an agent of the hospital for the purpose of the conduct of surgery. In the memorandum of decision, the trial court cited to evidence that Dr. Bodavula was assigned to the plaintiff's surgery by the chief resident and saw patients according to the chief resident's instructions. According to the hospital's manual, the chief resident had authority to set the \"precise structure of the rotation....\" However, testimony from Dr. Bodavula and Dr. Gordon indicated that the chief resident's relationship to the hospital was similar in nature to Dr. Bodavula's relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the\n   uncertainty of the chief resident's relationship to the hospital, he or she could not serve as the link to a finding that there was express authority for Dr. Bodavula to act as the hospital's agent during the plaintiff's surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the trial court cited as support for its judgment that Dr. Bodavula wore a Danbury Hospital badge, but this evidence does not aid the analysis for determining agency. Hospitals regularly control access for security purposes. A grant of access to the hospital has no bearing on how surgery is performed. Dr. Bodavula's hospital badge does not prove that there was an understanding between him and the hospital that the hospital had the right to control Dr. Bodavula during the plaintiff's surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiffs failed to produce sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that Dr. Bodavula was an agent of the hospital for purposes of assisting in the plaintiff's surgery. As such, the hospital should not have been held vicariously liable. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we conclude that the evidence was \"so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside [the] verdict rendered\" in favor of the plaintiffs.
