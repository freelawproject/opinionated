On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal on the following grounds: (1) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in the presentation of the petitioner's self-defense claim; and (2) the habeas court improperly prohibited the petitioner from testifying that he was the victim of attacks prior to committing the homicide of which he was convicted. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal, and, accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant factual and procedural history. At the petitioner's criminal trial, the state presented evidence that in the early morning of July 3, 1994, the petitioner had been\n   a passenger in a van traveling on Benton Street in Hartford. Upon seeing the victim, Lazaro Rodriguez, and Janette Reyes, a friend of both the petitioner and the victim, walking along the street, the petitioner yelled out, \"Who own the street?\" Reyes assumed the petitioner was joking and responded that she did. The petitioner asked the question again, but this time he directed it to the victim.\n   The victim replied, \"What do you mean?\" The victim approached the van, and according to Reyes, the petitioner punched the victim in the face. The victim punched the petitioner back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the ensuing fight between the victim and the petitioner, the petitioner withdrew a knife from his pocket and stabbed the victim. The victim raised his arm to protect himself and jumped backward to get away from the petitioner. After continuing to stab him in the chest area, the petitioner told the victim, \"You dead man. You dead.\" The petitioner got back into the van and left the scene. The victim died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The petitioner fled to New York and ultimately was apprehended in California two months later. As he awaited trial, the petitioner informed his cellmate that on the night of the murder he had been at a bar and was \"looking to get out and take someone out.\" He told the cellmate that he had thought he was losing the fight when he took out his knife and began stabbing the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 5, 1997, following a trial before a three judge panel, the petitioner was convicted of one count of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. He thereafter was sentenced to fifty years incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The petitioner filed an appeal from his conviction, but he did not pursue the appeal and it was dismissed after his appointed appellate counsel was granted permission to withdraw pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) (establishing procedure by which appointed counsel may withdraw from criminal appeal on ground of frivolousness).

During the criminal trial, defense counsel introduced a statement made by the petitioner to the Los Angeles Police Department when he finally was apprehended. The statement contained the petitioner's account of what had occurred on the morning of the murder, and it generally was consistent with the self-defense theory the petitioner presented at trial and supported the petitioner's proposition that he had not been the initial aggressor in the confrontation with the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statement does not include\n   an express reference to the petitioner's state of mind during the confrontation with the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The habeas court concluded that the evidence presented by the petitioner was \"woefully lacking in trying to prove any ineffective assistance....\" It further rejected the petitioner's claims, noting that \"[t]he only thing that could be potentially considered evidence that wasn't presented to the three judge panel, was the self-serving testimony presented by [the petitioner].\" The court expressly found that the petitioner's testimony was \"less than fully believable\" and that he \"demonstrated evasiveness.\" These credibility determinations\n   as well as other evidence in the record overcome the petitioner's assertion on appeal that his testimony at trial \"would have strongly supported his defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the habeas trial, the petitioner's trial counsel testified that he had had several tactical reasons for advising the petitioner not to testify on his own behalf: (1) the petitioner would have come \"across as a street hustler\" to the jury, (2) the petitioner's statement to the Los Angeles Police Department had been admitted into evidence, and (3) there would be \"some impeachment as to [the petitioner's] record\" regarding the petitioner's gang involvement. Nevertheless, the petitioner argues that counsel should have advised him to testify. The petitioner claims that he would have testified as to relevant subjects not addressed in the statement he had made to the Los Angeles Police Department. The subjects include his subjective belief that the victim was about to use deadly force, that this belief was objectively reasonable, that he had not been the initial aggressor, and that he had been unable to retreat. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b)(1) (individual is not entitled to use deadly physical force if he can avoid using such force with complete safety by retreating). This testimony, the petitioner reasons, was necessary to establish a viable self-defense claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On our review of the record, we conclude that the habeas court properly determined that trial counsel's performance fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. The petitioner failed to overcome the presumption that counsel's strategic decision to advise the petitioner not to testify was reasonable and the result of counsel's professional judgment. Moreover, at his criminal trial, the petitioner was thoroughly canvassed by the court about his right to testify, and the petitioner does not now claim otherwise or that his waiver was not intelligently or voluntarily made. The circumstances of this case appear to present a classic\n   example of second-guessing trial counsel's performance after it has proved unsuccessful. See\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262903\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/130/291/#p297\">\n    130 Conn.App. at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20969\">\n    21 A.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, counsel's decision to advise the petitioner not to testify constituted reasonable professional judgment.\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The petitioner next argues that counsel should have sought to introduce photographic evidence depicting the crime scene with lighting conditions similar to those present in the early morning when the fight began. Such photographs, the petitioner asserts, \"would have impeached the testimony of [Reyes]\" as it pertained to the petitioner acting as the initial aggressor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the petitioner's criminal trial, photographs that depicted the crime scene during daylight hours were introduced into evidence. At the habeas trial, the petitioner introduced photographs that depicted the crime scene in dark early morning conditions. He claims that a comparison of the photographs introduced at the criminal trial and the photographs introduced at the habeas trial reveals that the lighting conditions shown in the latter would impair a witness' ability to \"accurately perceive anything visually.\" Had trial counsel submitted the photographs depicting the poor lighting conditions, the petitioner argues, Reyes' testimony about the petitioner initiating the altercation with the victim would have been called into question; without any such photographs, the trial judges had to speculate as to Reyes' ability to perceive events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its memorandum of decision following the habeas trial, the court described the evidence presented by the petitioner to prove trial counsel's ineffective assistance as \"woefully lacking.\" It added that, \"[a]s far as any new evidence that would undermine the confidence [in] the conviction, it is next to nothing,\" and \"[t]he court\n   hasn't [seen anything] ... that would in any way allow [it] to conclude that [trial counsel] did anything other than properly investigate this matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The record reveals that trial counsel thoroughly cross-examined Reyes with respect to the lighting at the time of the murder, her vantage point, and her general ability to observe the petitioner and the victim as they fought. The petitioner asserted that he had not been able to overcome the presumption that he was the initial aggressor because trial counsel did not impeach Reyes with photographs; yet, it is not clear how the introduction of the early morning photographs would have impeached Reyes' testimony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the petitioner has made no claim that the cross-examination itself was otherwise deficient. Counsel's strategic decision to challenge Reyes' ability to see the altercation through cross-examination-as opposed to introducing photographic evidence of the lighting conditions-was an exercise of sound professional judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The petitioner has failed to satisfy the performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland;\n   </em>\n   see\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The court precluded the petitioner's testimony as to certain attacks on him in the period of time prior to his stabbing the victim. He argues that this evidence \"would have been offered to prove that the petitioner had a subjective fear for his life during [the fight with the victim] and that his fear was objectively reasonable. Ultimately, such evidence would have been used to prove that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to elicit such evidence to prove that the petitioner was entitled to a claim of self-defense.\" We conclude that any error resulting from the exclusion of this evidence was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The standard of review for evidentiary claims is well established. \"Unless an evidentiary ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the [habeas] court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence.... The [habeas] court's ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court's discretion.... We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the [habeas] court's ruling....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Members of the Latin Kings, a gang, allegedly shot at the petitioner on April 15, 1994, and two of the petitioner's acquaintances allegedly attacked him\n   with a knife at a bar on June 24, 1994. The court sustained two objections made by the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, on the ground of relevancy. The petitioner submitted an offer of proof the following day; the court noted its filing, but it did not comment on it further. The petitioner posits that his testimony about the prior attacks would have been relevant to a finding of subjective fear and the reasonableness of the fear at the criminal trial, and, thus, the evidence was relevant to his substantive claim at the habeas trial that counsel was ineffective by advising him not to testify. Had he testified about the prior assaults, the petitioner reasoned, the tribunal would have heard additional facts tending to support his claim of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is unclear from the record whether the circumstances of the prior attacks had any similarity to the circumstances of the confrontation between the petitioner and the victim; if the circumstances of the prior attacks were entirely different from the circumstances of the fight in this case, it is possible that the prior attacks might not have been relevant to the petitioner's underlying self-defense claim. If it is assumed, however, that the circumstances were similar enough so that the testimony of the prior attacks was relevant to the self-defense claim, and it is further assumed that trial counsel knew or should have known of these prior assaults, then it is conceivable that the petitioner's testimony about these attacks would have been relevant to the petitioner's claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nevertheless, the preclusion of this testimony from the habeas trial was harmless in any event because, for the reasons we stated in part I of this opinion, trial counsel's overall trial strategy-even in light of the petitioner's allegations of the prior attacks-constituted reasonable professional judgment. Counsel testified at\n   the habeas trial that, among other reasons, he had advised the petitioner not to testify because his testimony would suggest possible gang involvement. The introduction of any evidence about an attack on the petitioner by a gang, then, would have been inconsistent with that strategy, in that it would at the very least raise the specter of gang involvement. Moreover, the evidence of the prior attacks, though perhaps marginally relevant to the self-defense claim, likely would not have changed the outcome of the criminal trial. Beyond having the potential to support the proposition that the petitioner generally may have been fearful, there is no indication that evidence about prior attacks had any correlation to the petitioner's specific self-defense claim as it pertained to the victim and to the fight in this case. For these reasons, the preclusion of the petitioner's testimony at the habeas trial could not reasonably have affected the conclusion of the habeas court that counsel provided effective assistance at the petitioner's criminal trial; therefore, the preclusion of the testimony was at most harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the habeas court properly denied the petition for certification to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The petitioner's statement provided in relevant part: \"Suddenly, [the victim] approached the van and began to strike me in the face with his fists. He hit me several times through the open window. I managed to open the van door and stepped out of the vehicle. [The victim] continued to attack me with his fists. He never let up. I was feeling the [effects] of the blows. I removed a pocket knife from my right jeans pocket. It had a three inch blade. I kept it in ... my jeans. I managed to open the blade as I crouched alongside the van trying to move away from him. I had the knife in my left hand and struck my left hand out toward [the victim] to stop the attack on me. I don't know if I struck him or not. I may have. I made repeated attempts to stab him. He beat me until we reached the back of the van. Then he backed away a couple of feet and was bouncing like a boxer. I did not see any blood on him. I had blood on my [shirt] but I thought it was mine.... I got into the van and the guy drove off.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    It is arguable that elements of intent could be inferred from the statement the petitioner made to the Los Angeles Police Department.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In fact, the photographs may have supported Reyes' testimony. Reyes testified that when she observed the fight between the petitioner and the victim, it had been nighttime, and it was very dark. She also testified that the only lighting came from a single streetlight. The photographs, which show the crime scene at nighttime, then, are consistent with Reyes' testimony.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    We need not address the petitioner's claim that prejudice resulted from counsel's performance.
