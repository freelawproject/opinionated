COVEY\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   John Khula (Khula) appeals from the Somerset County Common Pleas Court's (trial court) August 31, 2015 order granting the State Correctional Institution at Somerset's (SCI-Somerset) summary judgment motion (Motion) and dismissing Khula's first amended complaint. Khula presents two issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the trial court erred in concluding that Khula was not qualified to maintain his position; and (2) whether the trial court erred in concluding that SCI-Somerset had no obligation to engage in an interactive process with Khula or to afford him a reasonable accommodation. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 16, 1996, Khula began his employment with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as an Industrial Arts and Crafts Teacher at SCI-Houtzdale, at which time he was not required to obtain Vocational I Certification. On June 2, 2005, Khula interviewed for a Mechanical Trades/Drafting Computer-Aided Design position at SCI-Somerset. At the interview, Khula signed an acknowledgement of the Vocational Teacher Certification Requirements. On August 15, 2005, Khula accepted this new position at SCI-Somerset. Khula worked from 2005 until September 2007 without an Intern teaching certificate and evidenced no difficulty performing his teaching responsibilities. In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education (Department) issued Khula an Intern teaching certificate as a provisional means of maintaining certification under a three-year license which would expire in August 2010. During this period, although Khula completed all of the Vocational I Certification classroom requirements, he repeatedly failed the Praxis exam which was necessary to receive his teaching certification. Despite that each of Khula's annual performance evaluations from 2005 to 2010 reflected his satisfactory job performance, he was reminded that the Vocational I Certificate was required and that he should be working on its completion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 16, 2011, SCI-Somerset charged Khula with Failure to Attain Vocational I Certification. On February 25, 2011, a Pre-Disciplinary Conference (PDC) was conducted for Khula to respond to the charge. Khula explained that he was having difficulty passing the Praxis exam and that he felt something was wrong with him because he always had learning difficulties when he was younger. He requested more time to pass the test, either in the form of an emergency certification or simply an extension of time. SCI-Somerset held Khula's PDC in abeyance to give him the opportunity to re-take the test. Khula took the Praxis exam in March 2011, but failed it again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, Khula contacted the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR) for assistance, and was scheduled with John Bixler,\n   Ph.D. (Dr. Bixler) for psychological testing. Another PDC was held on April 18, 2011, at which Khula explained that he had anxiety taking the test and presented information from the OVR regarding the tests to determine if he had a learning disability. He explained his belief that he had a learning disability and, if that was the case, he could receive more time from the Praxis Center to take the test. Khula once again reiterated his request to have his job preserved while he attempted to pass the Praxis exam with accommodations. He was advised that only the testing center, not the institution, could grant him an accommodation. As a result of the second PDC panel hearing, SCI-Somerset terminated Khula's employment in early May 2011 for failure to meet essential statutory/regulatory teacher certification job requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 2, 2011, Khula received the results of Dr. Bixler's psychological examination, which revealed that Khula suffered from a learning disability, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), that inhibited him from passing the necessary exam without accommodation. Khula requested and was granted accommodations of additional time and a private/quiet room during the test session. He re-took the Praxis exam with the accommodations, but again failed. Khula did not subsequently re-take the exam because his unemployment rendered him without the funds to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Khula filed a Union Grievance on May 18, 2011, alleging that he was dismissed without just cause in violation of his collective bargaining agreement. On June 10, 2011, the grievance was denied; however, on February 21, 2013, the Union reached a settlement with SCI-Somerset, wherein Khula's dismissal would be treated as a resignation with the possibility of reinstatement if Khula passed the Praxis exam and obtained his required certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) Vol. 1 at 102-104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 27, 2013, Khula filed a complaint with the trial court against SCI-Somerset under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging disability discrimination. On April 24, 2013, SCI-Somerset filed preliminary objections to Khula's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 10, 2014, Khula filed his first amended complaint with the trial court against SCI-Somerset for disability discrimination/failure to accommodate. On January 28, 2014, SCI-Somerset filed an answer to Khula's first amended complaint. On August 5, 2015, SCI-Somerset filed its Motion. On August 31, 2015, the trial court granted SCI-Somerset's Motion and dismissed Khula's first amended complaint. On September 11, 2015, Khula filed a Notice of Appeal with this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also on September 11, 2015,\n   the trial court filed an order directing Khula to file a Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal (1925(b) Statement). Khula filed his 1925(b) Statement on September 24, 2015. On November 4, 2015, the trial court filed its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Initially, Section 5 of the PHRA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice,\n   <strong>\n    unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a) For any employer because of the ...\n   <strong>\n    non-job related handicap or disability\n   </strong>\n   ... of any individual ... to discharge from employment such individual ... if the individual ... is the best able and most competent to perform the services required. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 955 (emphasis added). Further, Section 4(p.1) of the PHRA defines \"the term\n   <strong>\n    'handicap or disability,'\n   </strong>\n   [as]: (1) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; (2) a record of having such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment[.]\" 43 P.S. \u00a7 954(p.1).

Continuing, the [C]ourt addressed the issue of reasonable accommodations. '\n   <strong>\n    Discrimination under the ADA encompasses not only adverse actions motivated by prejudice and fear of disabilities\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    but also includes failing to make reasonable accommodations for a plaintiff's disabilities\n   </strong>\n   .'\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11543560\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/296/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Particularly, Khula contends that his position was constructed in a manner that specifically avoided the teaching certification requirement. He further avers that the requirements for his position are not the same as those for school teachers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Khula was expressly hired by SCI-Somerset as a Mechanical Trades/Drafting Computer-Aided Design teacher. The State Civil Service Job Specifications (Specifications) define the position as \"professional education work in providing vocational instruction in a mechanical trade occupation area to inmates\n   <strong>\n    at a state correctional institution\n   </strong>\n   .\" S.R.R. Vol. 2 at 390 (emphasis added). The Specifications provide in pertinent part, that Khula's position is bound by the following \"NECESSARY SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: Possession of or eligibility for a current [Department] Vocational Certificate I or II for the specified parenthetical; or Possession of or eligibility for a [Department] Vocational Intern Certificate for the specified parenthetical; or Eligibility for a [Department] Emergency Certificate for the specified parenthetical [.]\" S.R.R. Vol. 2 at 391. Further, \"[e]mployees who are teaching school[-]age youth must maintain the minimum teaching certification for the specified parenthetical as defined by the [Department's] current regulations[,]\" as a \"CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT\". S.R.R. Vol. 2 at 391-392.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, on June 2, 2005, Khula signed the \"VOCATIONAL TEACHER CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS\" which reads: \"My signature indicates that\n   <strong>\n    I have been informed that I must obtain and maintain Pennsylvania teaching certification for the position for which I am applying\n   </strong>\n   [and], if certification is not obtained and maintained, I will be terminated since I will no longer meet the job requirements.\" S.R.R. Vol. 1 at 67 (emphasis added). The acknowledgement further describes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Vocational Certification Progression\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   During the first year of Department of Corrections['] employment, the employee must successfully complete the Occupational Competency Assessment, be accepted for admission into a Vocational Education Teacher Certification Program, and apply for the Intern teaching certificate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   One year after the [I]ntern teaching certificate is issued, the employee must have successfully completed (or be enrolled for) six (6) credits towards the Vocational Instructional I teaching certificate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Intern\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    teaching\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    certificate becomes invalid three years after the issue date.

Finally, Khula admits in his first amended complaint that \"[i]n order to remain eligible to maintain his position of employment, [ ] Khula was required to complete specific educational requirements and pass a Praxis exam to obtain certification.\" Khula's First Amended Complaint at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because Khula has always known that the Vocational I Certification was required for his continued employment, but he did not earn the Vocational I Certification, he failed to satisfy the job-related requirement to maintain his employment with SCI-Somerset. Khula focuses on the condition of employment with school-age students, claiming this is the difference between teaching at a school district and teaching at a corrections facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Khula's signed acknowledgement makes no mention of his students' ages, but rather expressly states his employment will be terminated if he did not obtain the Vocational I Certification. It was on this basis that Khula's employment was terminated, and not \"a prejudice [or] fear of disabilities[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7290868\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/992/924/#p932\">\n    992 A.2d at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11543560\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/296/\">\n    184 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   306 ).

Because SCI-Somerset had no control over the requested accommodation, and Khula had in fact received the requested accommodations, the trial court did not err in concluding that SCI-Somerset had no obligation to engage in the interactive process or provide the reasonable accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the trial court's order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   AND NOW, this 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of August, 2016, the Somerset County Common Pleas Court's August 31, 2015 order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY SENIOR JUDGE FRIEDMAN\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because Khula does not teach students under 21 years of age, he is not required to obtain Vocational I Certification. Therefore, I would conclude that the trial court erred in determining that Khula was not qualified to maintain his position. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Khula has worked in his current position at SCI-Somerset as a vocational teacher in Mechanical Trades/Drafting Computer-Aided Design since August 2005. Khula has consistently received commendable and satisfactory ratings in his job performance evaluations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The State Civil Service Job Specifications (Specifications) for Khula's position provide that \"[e]mployees who are teaching school[-]age youth must maintain the minimum teaching certification ... as a condition of employment.\" (S.R.R. at 391-92.) This Specification is consistent with section 912-B(b)(1) of The Administrative Code of 1929, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177,\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   , added by the Act of June 22, 1999, P.L. 99 (Act 15), 71 P.S. \u00a7 310-12(b)(1), which provides that \"[e]mployes who provide inmate education and training to\n   <em>\n    school-age\n   </em>\n   inmates shall hold appropriate State certification as required by Federal and State law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Khula, however, does not teach students under 21 years of age. (R.R. at 206a.) As stated in the Proposed Education Plan for the 2010-2011 year, \"no student under twenty-one years of age should be placed in a vocational program.\" (Ex. 3 at 23; S.R.R. at 342.) Steven Davy, Director of the Bureau of Correction Education for the Department of Corrections, testified that the age requirement \"was to make sure that any student that would be assigned to a vocational program was no longer covered by either the special education law or the regular education law.\" (R.R. at 237a.) Davy specifically acknowledged that Act 15 does not apply to vocational teachers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, because Khula is a vocational teacher who does not teach anyone under the age of 21, a Vocational I Certification is not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section 5 of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (a) For any employer because of the ... non-job related handicap or disability ... of any individual ... to discharge from employment such individual ... if the individual ... is the best able and most competent to perform the services required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 955.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Additionally, section 1630.4(a)(1) of the Americans with Disabilities Act regulations provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   It is unlawful for a covered entity to discriminate on the basis of disability against a qualified individual in regard to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (ii) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (ix) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.4\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). \"The term 'qualified,' with respect to an individual with a disability, means that the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position such individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201630.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"Removal of personnel in the civil service must be based on merit criteria which are relevant to proper execution of the employee's duties and which are job-related and touch in some logical and rational manner upon competency and ability.\"\n   <em>\n    Borough of Blawnox Council v.

Khula has demonstrated his competency and ability to perform his duties as a vocational teacher since 2005.
