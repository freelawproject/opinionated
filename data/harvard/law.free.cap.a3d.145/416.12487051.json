We conclude that the court properly dismissed that portion of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of his first and second habeas counsel on the ground of res judicata, and that the court also properly dismissed that portion of the petition alleging ineffective assistance of his third and fourth habeas counsel, albeit on alternative grounds than those on which the court relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On August 29, 1994, the petitioner was charged with murder in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-54a and with criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-217. On December 9, 1996, the petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge of criminal possession of a firearm and received a sentence of five years incarceration in the custody of the respondent. At a subsequent jury trial, in which he was represented by Fred DeCaprio (trial counsel), the petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to sixty years incarceration, to run concurrently with the sentence on the firearm charge for a total effective sentence of sixty years of imprisonment. The petitioner's murder conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The sixth petition included four counts alleging that first, second, third, and fourth habeas counsel were ineffective for failing to raise a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failure to file a motion for a competency evaluation. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the petitioner's claims as to the first two habeas counsel are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, but that the claims regarding third and fourth habeas counsel are not barred by that doctrine. Nevertheless, the claims regarding third and fourth habeas counsel are precluded, respectively, by collateral estoppel and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court as to the dismissal of the claims involving first and second habeas counsel on the basis of res judicata, and also affirm the judgment as to the claims involving third and fourth habeas counsel, albeit on the aforementioned alternative grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The standard of review of a motion to dismiss is well established.

Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415934\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/365/#p368\">\n    144 Conn.App. at 369-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20A.3d%20776\">\n    73 A.3d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Now, the petitioner claims that first and second habeas counsel failed to allege that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion for a competency evaluation. The petitioner appears to believe that merely providing a procedural gloss of the same factual allegations in a sixth petition in support of the same claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel raised in an earlier petition is adequate to avoid dismissal of the latter petition. The procedural mechanism that the petitioner alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to use-filing a motion under \u00a7 54-56d -is, however, the only means to formally present a claim of incompetency to a trial court. Nonetheless, the petitioner also alleges that these claims do not constitute the \"same ground\" or grounds as those litigated in the second and fifth habeas actions because the sixth petition alleges a new fact, namely, that trial counsel failed to file a motion for a competency evaluation under \u00a7 54-56d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The respondent argues that the habeas court was correct in dismissing the sixth petition as to the first two counts on the grounds of res judicata, as the petitioner already fully litigated his claims against first and second habeas counsel in the second and fifth habeas actions. Because the petitioner has asserted claims that previously were adjudicated fully on their merits and has made no showing that any new factual allegations contained in the sixth petition were not available to him when he filed his earlier petitions, we agree with the habeas court that the claims against first and second habeas counsel are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The habeas court therefore properly dismissed those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We first analyze the application of the doctrine of res judicata in the habeas context. \"The doctrine of res judicata provides that a former judgment serves as an absolute bar to a subsequent action involving any claims relating to such cause of action which were actually made or which might have been made.... The doctrine ... applies to criminal as well as civil proceedings and to state habeas corpus proceedings.... However, [u]nique policy considerations must be taken into account in applying the doctrine of res judicata to a constitutional claim raised by a habeas petitioner.... Specifically, in the habeas context, in the interest of ensuring that no one is deprived of liberty in violation of his or her constitutional rights ... the application of the doctrine of res judicata ...

We agree. Here, the claim involving third habeas counsel is barred by collateral estoppel because the judgment in the fifth habeas proceeding concerned the petitioner's claim against trial counsel, first habeas counsel, and second habeas counsel necessarily resolved an issue that would need relitigation if the claim involving third habeas counsel were to proceed in this case. To establish that third habeas counsel was ineffective for failing to allege a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a competency evaluation, the petitioner would be required to prove that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a competency\n   evaluation. This already was decided, after a full evidentiary hearing, by the fifth habeas court when it found that (1) there was never a doubt as to the petitioner's competency at the time of the trial, and (2) trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for a competency evaluation.

Specifically, he argues that res judicata does not preclude his claim that fourth habeas counsel rendered ineffective assistance because it was not previously litigated in any of the prior habeas proceedings. The respondent concedes that the count alleging ineffective assistance of fourth habeas counsel for failure to raise the issue of whether trial counsel was ineffective for failure to file a motion for a competency evaluation was\n   dismissed improperly. We agree with the petitioner that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply as to his claim against the fourth habeas counsel. Nonetheless, we affirm the dismissal of this count on the alternative ground that the petition fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   Practice Book \u00a7 23-29(2) provides that a petition may be dismissed by the court if \"the petition, or a count thereof, fails to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted.\" On the basis of our plenary review of the record, we conclude that the petitioner's claim involving fourth habeas counsel in his sixth petition fails to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted as fourth habeas counsel raised the very claim that petitioner, in the present petition, alleges was not raised. Specifically, fourth habeas counsel raised the claim that first and second habeas counsel were ineffective for failing to allege that trial counsel failed to investigate adequately and present the issue of the petitioner's competency at the time of plea and trial.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Commissioner of Correction,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415934\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/365/#p368\">\n    144 Conn.App. at 367-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20A.3d%20776\">\n    73 A.3d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This court explained that in the fifth habeas petition, the petitioner's claims \"were based upon his trial counsel's alleged failure to request a competency examination pursuant to ... \u00a7 54-56d and the failure of his two prior habeas attorneys to allege ineffectiveness by their predecessors in prior trial and habeas corpus proceedings.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20A.3d%20776\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In the current, sixth petition, the petitioner alleges that fourth habeas counsel, who represented him in the fifth habeas action, was ineffective for failing to allege that trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion for competency evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 54-46d. The petitioner's allegation that his fourth habeas counsel failed to raise such a claim fails as that claim was, in fact, raised by his fourth habeas counsel in the fifth habeas action. Thus, we conclude that the habeas court properly dismissed the count against fourth habeas counsel on the alternative ground that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

The petitioner makes the novel, but unpersuasive, argument that we cannot address alternative grounds for affirmance because the respondent failed to raise those grounds \"at trial in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 60-5,\" which states, in relevant part, that \"[t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.\" The term \"grounds\" is not equivalent to the term \"claim.\" We conclude that the petitioner misconstrues the law when he equates affirmance on alternative grounds with this court's considering an unpreserved claim. The respondent is not raising claims for appellate review; it is the claims of the petitioner that are at stake here. Simply raising alternative legal theories upon which we may affirm the judgment does not constitute request for review of an unpreserved claim that we are not bound to consider.
