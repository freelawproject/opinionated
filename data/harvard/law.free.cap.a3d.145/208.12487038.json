COVEY.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driving Licensing (DOT) appeals from the\n   Allegheny County Common Pleas Court's (trial court) May 28, 2015 order sustaining the appeal of Christopher Marnik, Jr. (Marnik) from the 18-month suspension of his operating privileges imposed pursuant to Section 1547 of the Vehicle Code (commonly referred to as the Implied Consent Law) (Law).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue for this Court's review is whether the trial court erred when it concluded that the arresting officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe that Marnik was driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). After review, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By letter dated May 10, 2013, Marnik was notified that due to his refusal to submit to a chemical test following an arrest for DUI on April 29, 2013, his vehicle operating privileges would be suspended for 18 months beginning June 14, 2013. On June 6, 2013, Marnik appealed to the trial court. The trial court held a hearing on May 29, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the hearing, Robinson Township Police Department patrolman Michael Gastgeb (Officer Gastgeb) testified that, on April 29, 2013 at approximately 1:20 a.m., he observed a disabled vehicle on the roadway with no occupant. According to Officer Gastgeb, no one was around the vehicle at that time. Officer Gastgeb stated that the vehicle had a bent tire and scratches on the passenger side consistent with a guard rail impact. Officer Gastgeb explained that the accident had occurred just prior to his arrival, since the vehicle had not been present when he passed that location just fifteen minutes earlier. Officer Gastgeb further indicated that while he was at the scene, Marnik approached, dressed in gym shorts and a t-shirt. Marnik stumbled, had glassy eyes, slurred speech and smelled of alcohol. Officer Gastgeb described his interaction with Marnik as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Q. And how long after you came upon this disabled vehicle did [Marnik] show up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   A. It was within a few minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Q. And what kind of balance did Mr. Marnik manifest at that time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A. [Marnik] was stumbling. He had [a] general[ly] hard time keeping his balance walking towards me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q. And what happened after [Marnik] approached you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. I asked him if that was his vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. What was his answer?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. He said, yes; it's my grandfather's vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. What did you next say to him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. I asked if he had been driving the vehicle and he said yes. And I asked if he was in an accident and he said he did not know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. He didn't know. Okay. What happened next after you asked him if he had been in an accident and he responded that he didn't know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Yes. I asked if he had been drinking tonight and he said, yes; I was earlier. At that time, [Marnik] refused to communicate with me and the other officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 17a-18a. Officer Gastgeb testified that Marnik did not possess car keys at that time. On cross-examination, Officer Gastgeb admitted he did not recall whether the vehicle\n   was running when he arrived and whether the keys were in the ignition, but that if such were the case, he would have noted it in his report, and it was not so noted. According to Officer Gastgeb, he never personally observed Marnik present in the vehicle; however, he advised Marnik that he was under arrest for DUI and transported him to Ohio Valley Hospital to have blood drawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Gastgeb explained that after he read the implied consent warnings to Marnik, Marnik refused to submit to the blood test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 24, 2015, the trial court sustained Marnik's appeal. The trial court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The objective evidence was that Officer Gastgeb observed a vehicle belonging to [Marnik's] grandfather parked on the roadway with a bent tire and scratches on its passenger side. Officer Gastgeb could not recall if the keys were in the ignition or if the car was running, although he recalled that he had testified at the preliminary hearing that he would have made a note of it on his Police Report if the keys were in the ignition. While Officer Gastgeb was at the scene, he observed [Marnik] approaching the car. Officer Gastgeb observed that [Marnik] exhibited several signs of intoxication and [Marnik] told him that he had drinks earlier. Officer Gastgeb did not ask him when he had been drinking or where he had been. When [Marnik] met with the Officer, [he] had no car keys with him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Nowhere is there any evidence that [Marnik] had any intoxicating beverage when he drove his car. There is simply no objective evidence from which to conclude that [Marnik] was in actual physical control of his vehicle while intoxicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   R.R. at 94a-95a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 18, 2015, DOT filed a motion for reconsideration. On March 26, 2015, DOT appealed to this Court. On March 19, 2015, the trial court granted reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, DOT withdrew its appeal. On May 28, 2015, upon reconsideration, the trial court again entered an order sustaining the appeal. DOT appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   DOT contends that the trial court erred when it held that Officer Gastgeb did not have reasonable grounds to believe that Marnik had driven the vehicle while intoxicated, since Marnik appeared alone and intoxicated at the scene shortly after his grandfather's vehicle had been damaged, admitted that he had been drinking earlier in the evening, admitted driving the vehicle, and did not explicitly deny being involved in the accident. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 1547(b) of the Vehicle Code states that if a person arrested for violating Section 3802 of the Vehicle Code refuses to submit to a chemical test, [DOT] will suspend his operating privileges for 12 months, or for 18 months if the person has previously refused chemical testing or had a prior suspension of his operating privileges under Section 1547 of the Vehicle Code. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547(b)(1).

Officer Gastgeb also testified that Marnik admitted that he had been driving the vehicle, and when asked if he had been in an accident, stated that he did not know. Although the trial court mentioned this testimony in its opinion, it did not, in its review of the objective evidence, explicitly address or make a factual finding regarding Officer Gastgeb's assertion that he had not seen the vehicle at the location when he had been there fifteen minutes prior, or Officer Gastgeb's testimony that Marnik admitted he had driven the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 94a-95a. Thus, Marnik maintains that the trial court must not have assigned that testimony \"any weight\" or found Officer Gastgeb's statements not credible. Marnik Amended Br. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is unclear whether the trial court accepted as credible Officer Gastgeb's testimony that Marnik admitted that he drove the vehicle. Specifically, the trial court stated, \"[n]owhere is there any evidence that [Marnik] had any intoxicating beverage\n   <strong>\n    when\n   </strong>\n   he drove his car.\" R.R. at 95a (emphasis added). Thus, this Court cannot determine whether the trial court accepted Officer Gastgeb's testimony that Marnik admitted he had driven the car at some time. We may not decide this case on conjecture. And thus, we remand this matter for the trial court to clarify whether it found credible Officer Gastgeb's testimony that Marnik admitted driving the vehicle, and that the vehicle was not present at the scene fifteen minutes prior to Officer Gastgeb finding it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court acknowledged in its discussion of objective evidence that when Marnik appeared, he \"exhibited several signs of intoxication and ... told [Officer Gastgeb] that he had drinks earlier.\" R.R. at 94a. \"Case law in DUI criminal cases teaches that alcohol is not intoxicating until absorbed into the bloodstream and that absorption takes place thirty to ninety minutes after consumption.\"\n   <em>\n    Hasson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040592\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/866/1181/#p1185\">\n    866 A.2d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the trial court found Officer Gastgeb's testimony credible that the accident must have happened in the fifteen minute period before he arrived, that Marnik appeared visibly intoxicated only a few minutes after Officer Gastgeb's arrival, and Marnik admitted that he had driven the car and been drinking earlier that evening, \"\n   <strong>\n    one reasonable interpretation\n   </strong>\n   [ (although certainly not the\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   possible interpretation) ] of the circumstances\" is that Marnik had been drinking\n   <strong>\n    prior\n   </strong>\n   to the incident, was intoxicated and driving the vehicle at the time the damage to the vehicle occurred.\n   <em>\n    Helt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9202303\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/856/263/#p266\">\n    856 A.2d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Marnik argues that the trial court correctly concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish reasonable grounds, and in support thereof, cites to\n   <em>\n    Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v.

Approximately twenty-five minutes later, accompanied by police, the driver of the other automobile found the licensee drinking at a tavern and identified him as the other driver. The police observed that the licensee appeared intoxicated and arrested him for driving under the influence. The licensee refused a breathalyzer test. This Court affirmed the trial court's order which sustained the licensee's appeal of his driver's license suspension. In doing so, this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   This [twenty-five] minute delay seems to us to be too long for the officer to reasonably conclude that [the licensee] had in fact been driving his automobile under the influence of alcohol.

He was arrested for driving while intoxicated.

Op. at 2.) Additionally, Marnik did not have the vehicle's keys with him when Officer Gastgeb encountered Marnik. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Officer Gastgeb did not recall if the vehicle's keys were in the ignition or if the vehicle's engine was running. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) However, Officer Gastgeb recalled that he had testified at the preliminary hearing that if the keys had been in the ignition, he would have\n   made a note of it in his police report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n   </em>\n   N.T., 5/29/14, at 17.) The trial court found that \"Officer Gastgeb never asked [Marnik] when he had\n   <em>\n    last\n   </em>\n   driven the vehicle,\" (Trial Ct. Op. at 2 (emphasis added)), when he had been drinking, or where he had been. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The trial court found that the record lacks any objective evidence that Marnik had recently operated or controlled the vehicle that night. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Therefore, I submit that it is immaterial whether the trial court credited Officer Gastgeb's testimony that\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   had recently driven the vehicle to the scene and that Marnik had admitted to driving the vehicle at some unspecified time in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For these reasons, I would affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1547.

Cases that have focused specifically on such factors have done so where an individual is found sleeping or unconscious in the vehicle and the primary question is whether the individual exercised control over the movement of the vehicle while intoxicated.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., Banner;\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vinansky v.

If the trial court finds Officer Gastgeb's testimony credible that the vehicle was not at the scene minutes earlier, there would be no question that the vehicle had been operated. Thus, the question in this case would be the identity of the operator and whether the operator was intoxicated at the time the vehicle was operated. If Officer Gastgeb's testimony is deemed credible, Officer Gastgeb could have reasonably concluded that Marnik had operated the vehicle and was intoxicated while doing so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
