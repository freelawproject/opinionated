He claims that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and, as to the merits, improperly denied a count of his habeas petition for failure of proof. We disagree with the petitioner and agree with the result reached by the habeas court, but on an alternative ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the petitioner's appeal. In February, 1999, the then fourteen year old petitioner was at an apartment visiting another person. While there, he and the victim exchanged words that led to a heated argument. When he was asked to leave the apartment, the petitioner did so. He went outside, below the apartment's balcony, and yelled at the victim to come outside. The victim went onto the balcony and the petitioner fatally shot the victim in the abdomen. In October, 1999, when the petitioner was fifteen years old, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a). That charge carried a maximum penalty of forty years imprisonment and a minimum of five years imprisonment. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-55a, 53a-35a (5). At the time of the guilty plea, the state noted that the agreement called\n   for thirty years incarceration with a right to argue for less. The\n   state indicated that, because of the petitioner's age, the recommendation was for ten years less than the maximum sentence permitted by statute. At sentencing, the defendant's attorney stated, \"Obviously, I'm going to argue to the court to consider his age; and I think it is a very critical component in this particular sentencing.\" The court concluded, \"This incident, with all the circumstances I've heard, he took the life of the victim here. There has not been any showing of any just cause. The state has given consideration in reducing the charge and the plea agreement both to the factors I have cited, having no prior record and his age.... The unfortunate circumstance of the age or the loss of loved ones around him is that he did not understand the value of human life and the blessing he ... did have, despite all the trials that he had been given as well.... The only way that the court can impress upon him the value of a human life, particularly at his age, is by the impact my sentence will have on his own.\" The court then sentenced the petitioner to thirty years incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October, 2008, the self-represented\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   petitioner filed an eighteen count petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In count eleven, which is the only count implicated in this appeal, the petitioner alleged that \"the sentence imposed was inappropriate and disproportionate in light of the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, the protection of public interest and the deterrent, rehabilitative, isolative and denunciatory purposes for which the sentence was intended.... [T]he sentence imposed was unduly excessive in light of the petitioner's youth and diminished capacity at the time of the crime.\" (Citation omitted.) The petitioner attached to his petition a number of documents, including transcripts from the underlying criminal proceedings and several scholarly articles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 1, 2014, the day the habeas trial was set to begin, the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. All right. So, Mr. Dumas, are you ready to proceed to trial today?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. Well, today's your trial day, so we're going forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: Yeah, but I don't understand habeas law, so that's why I didn't file nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The Court: So, you didn't file anything?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Court: ... Eleven is an eighth amendment claim, as I read it in the most liberal sense, as I'm required to do.... Today is your trial day, so what happens at trial is that you're supposed to go forward and present evidence on those claims.... So, what evidence do you have to support your remaining claims....\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Are you prepared to present witnesses today?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: No. The only thing I have, whatever is in that petition. That's it....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Court: ... Well, that's not evidence. Evidence is presented through witnesses and/or exhibits. So, you are telling me you have no witnesses that you wish to present on your claims?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[The Petitioner]: Right now, no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The Court: Well, I'm reading count eleven in the broadest sense possible since he's pro se, and I think that could potentially be an eighth amendment claim,\n   so I'm not dismissing that outright. However, I am going to deny the petition and dismiss it because the petitioner has not come forward with any evidence today, the day of his trial, to establish [count eleven]. The court has no choice but to deny the petition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judgment file stated that count eleven was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Thereafter, the court denied the petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In May, 2015, the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, filed a late motion for rectification of the judgment file and a motion for permission to file the late motion for rectification, arguing that the judgment file should be corrected to reflect a denial of the petition as to count eleven on the merits. This court denied the respondent's motion for permission to file a late motion for rectification. This court sua sponte ordered the habeas court to articulate whether it had intended to dismiss or deny count eleven. The habeas court articulated that \"count 11 of the petition ... was denied for lack of any proof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and that the court erred in denying count eleven for lack of proof. He contends that, although the eleventh count of his habeas petition largely relied on\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

The court observed that because the petitioner would be released from prison at the age of sixty-six and the average life expectancy of a male in the United States is seventy-six years, he would only have approximately ten more years to live outside of prison after his release.... The court explained that [a] juvenile is typically put behind bars before he has had the chance to exercise the rights and responsibilities of adulthood, such as establishing a career, marrying, raising a family, or voting. Even assuming the juvenile offender does live to be released, after a half century of incarceration, he will have irreparably lost the opportunity to engage meaningfully in many of these activities and will be left with seriously diminished prospects of his quality of life for the few years he has left....

Most relevant to the disposition of this case,\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   was decided while this appeal was pending.\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   held that, as a matter of law, the imposition of a thirty-one year sentence did not trigger relief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The petitioner in the present case was fourteen years old at the time of the offense and he received a thirty year sentence. Similar to the seventeen year old defendant in\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   who received a thirty-one year sentence, the petitioner in this case will be released before he is fifty years old even if he is not paroled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On June 27, 2016, we requested that the parties submit supplemental briefs on the question of \"whether this court should consider the merits of this appeal if the habeas court could not afford practical relief in light of [\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   ].\" The gravamen of the respondent's brief was that the subject area is now controlled by\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

We need not repeat the criteria set forth in\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   and cases cited therein; suffice it to say that if a thirty-one year sentence imposed on a juvenile offender does not violate the eighth amendment, then surely a thirty year\n   sentence does not.
