Hendrick is the \"representative payee\" for those two children's SSI benefits. In February 2014, the Hendrick assistance group received a monthly FANF benefit of $847.80, in addition to the SSI benefits received by the two children. Beginning in March 2014, DHHS included Hendrick and her six children in the FANF assistance group, and also included the two children's monthly, recurring SSI benefits of $654.00 as unearned income. DHHS informed Hendrick by notice dated February 25, 2014, that beginning March 15, 2014, her FANF cash assistance would be reduced to a monthly payment of $259.20. Thereafter, in April 2014, DHHS determined that Hendrick was no longer eligible for FANF assistance because her assistance group's total income exceeded the income limit. In making this determination, DHHS included the two children's recurring SSI benefits as countable unearned income. Hendrick, therefore, no longer receives FANF assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Birmingham is the mother of three children, one of whom receives SSI benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Birmingham is the \"representative payee\" for her child's SSI benefits. The Birmingham family applied for FANF assistance in July 2014. In determining Birmingham's eligibility for FANF assistance, DHHS included her child's monthly, recurring SSI benefit as countable unearned income in its FANF benefit calculation. Beginning August 15, 2014, the Birmingham assistance group received monthly FANF cash assistance of $17.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and their children, seeking a declaratory judgment that DHHS's \"inclusion of children's SSI in FANF assistance group income is unlawful and void\" pursuant to applicable federal law. In addition, the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that Rule He-W 654.04 \"is invalid because it impairs [their] legal rights.\" The plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction enjoining DHHS from including children's SSI in FANF assistance group income and an award of attorney's fees \"because this litigation will result in a substantial benefit to the public.\" We note that the plaintiffs \"seek invalidation of [Rule] He-W 654.04(c) only with respect to its inclusion of children's SSI as income to the [FANF] assistance group.\" The plaintiffs do not seek to invalidate Rule He-W 654.04(c) insofar as it counts an adult's SSI as income to the FANF assistance group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued that under controlling federal law, children's SSI must be used by a representative payee only for the benefit of the child with disabilities, not for the benefit of the FANF assistance group, and that state law to the contrary is invalid pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2. DHHS asserted that the inclusion of the children's SSI in calculating FANF eligibility does not interfere with the federal requirement that SSI benefits be expended for the use and benefit of the beneficiary. The trial court concluded that DHHS's inclusion of SSI benefits in the calculation of FANF eligibility is lawful. The court reasoned that \"[n]othing in the statute or corresponding regulations deprive[s] the representative payee of the ability to use the SSI funds for the beneficiary's current maintenance\" and that the representative payee may use SSI for the beneficiary's benefit \"even if that income is included in [DHHS's] calculation of FANF benefits.\" Accordingly the trial court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendant's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    III.

Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that Rule He-W 654.04(c) is invalid because under federal law a representative payee must use a child's SSI only for the child with disabilities, not for the FANF assistance group. They assert that DHHS's \"policy of treating children's SSI as FANF assistance group income violates the Social Security Act's purposes of: 1) ensuring a minimal level of federal support for children with serious disabilities; and 2) mandating that the representative payee spend the child's SSI benefits only for the use and benefit, and in the best interests, of the SSI recipient child.\" (Citation omitted.) DHHS argues that the inclusion of SSI benefits in FANF determinations does not interfere with the federal requirement that SSI benefits be expended for \"the use and benefit\" of the beneficiary. (Bolding and capitalization omitted.) It asserts that the requirement that income be used for the benefit of a specific child does not preclude its use for common expenses or its inclusion in a welfare benefit calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After briefing and oral argument, we invited the Solicitor General of the United States to file an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief addressing two questions: (1) whether it is unlawful for the State to terminate, reduce, or deny a household's TANF because a child with disabilities in the household receives SSI benefits; and (2) whether inclusion of the child's SSI as TANF assistance group income violates the federal Social Security Act and regulations. The Solicitor General submitted a brief on behalf of the United States asserting that \"Rule He-W 654.04(c) conflicts with the federal Social Security Act and implementing regulations.\" The Solicitor General argues that federal law requires representative payees to use SSI funds solely for the \"use and benefit\" of the beneficiary, and that \"by deeming SSI benefits available to the entire household, Rule He-W 654.04(c) conflicts with federal requirements\" and is therefore preempted.
