The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court (1) improperly denied his motion to correct the eighteen month sentence because the sentence violates the double jeopardy clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the federal\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   constitution, and (2) abused its discretion by excluding evidence that was relevant to the disposition of the motion to correct. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On February 16, 1999, the defendant, who was an inmate at the Garner Correctional Institution, was involved in a physical altercation with other inmates. At the time of the altercation, the defendant was serving a thirty-two year sentence of imprisonment for two 1994 murder convictions. Department of Correction (department) officers observed the defendant attempt to assault another inmate by charging at the inmate\n   with a sharp object in his hand. Department officers ordered the defendant to drop the object, but the defendant ignored their commands and charged at several other inmates with the object in his hand. After suppressing the altercation, department officers recovered the sharp object and determined that it was a shank that had been fabricated from white cloth, masking tape, and two metal prongs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the same day of the incident, department investigators interviewed the defendant, who pleaded guilty in a department administrative proceeding to three violations of prison policy: (1) impeding order; (2) contraband (dangerous instrument); and (3) fighting. Department officials then imposed the following disciplinary sanctions on the defendant: (1) three disciplinary reports; (2) loss of 120 days of statutory good time credit; (3) loss of commissary privileges for ninety days; (4) loss of visits for sixty days; (5) confinement to quarters for thirty days; (6) punitive segregation for seven days; (7) loss of telephone privileges for forty days; and (8) loss of mail privileges for sixty days. Furthermore, sometime in March or April of 1999, after determining that the defendant was a security risk, the department transferred him to the maximum security prison at Northern Correctional Institution (Northern). The\n   defendant was incarcerated at Northern for approximately one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 28, 1999, the state charged the defendant with one count of possessing a weapon or dangerous instrument in a correctional institution in violation of \u00a7 53a-174a (a). On October 13, 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to that charge. The court sentenced the defendant to a period of eighteen months of incarceration to run consecutive to the sentence he already was serving for his previous murder convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 9, 2013, the defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, which was amended on August 29, 2013 (amended motion). In the amended motion, the defendant asserted that the eighteen month sentence of incarceration violated the double jeopardy protections of the state and federal constitutions because the sentence and department sanctions constituted multiple punishments for the same offense. The defendant listed fourteen items that he alleged the department had imposed as administrative sanctions for his conduct in the 1999 prison incident. The first eight items were set forth previously in this opinion. The remaining six items related to (1) the defendant's transfer to Northern and (2) the effect of the eighteen month sentence on the defendant's ability to enter a halfway house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following an evidentiary hearing on the amended motion, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Roraback, J.,\n   </em>\n   denied the defendant's motion. The court concluded that the eighteen month sentence was not imposed in violation of the defendant's protections against double jeopardy. In particular, the court ruled that the department sanctions were not \"grossly disproportionate to the government's interest in maintaining prison order and discipline.\" Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to reargue the matter, which the court granted. The court, however,\n   affirmed its original ruling and denied the relief requested by the defendant. The court reiterated that the department sanctions did not violate the double jeopardy clause because they were not grossly disproportionate to the government's remedial interest in maintaining order and discipline. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his first claim, the defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying the\n   amended motion because the eighteen month sentence of imprisonment violates his constitutional right against double jeopardy. Specifically, he argues that imposing this sentence after the department already had sanctioned him violated the double jeopardy clause's prohibition on imposing multiple criminal punishments for the same offense. The state responds that, because the department sanctions did not constitute criminal punishment, the double jeopardy clause did not preclude the court from imposing the eighteen month sentence. We agree with the state and conclude that trial court properly denied the defendant's amended motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin with the standard of review and relevant legal principles. \"Ordinarily, a claim that the trial court improperly denied a defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence is reviewed pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Hudson's\n   </em>\n   second prong, a careful weighing of the relevant factors demonstrates that the\n   <em>\n    clearest proof\n   </em>\n   that the department sanctions are so punitive in purpose or effect as to override the legislature's intent does not exist in this case. We conclude that the department sanctions were not criminal in nature and that they therefore did not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, because we conclude that the department sanctions do not constitute criminal punishment, the trial court properly found that the eighteen month prison sentence did not violate the double jeopardy clause's prohibition on imposing multiple punishments for the same offense, and, therefore, properly denied the motion to correct an illegal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The defendant's second claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly excluded evidence regarding the\n   collateral consequences of the eighteen month prison sentence. Specifically, he argues that evidence suggesting that the eighteen month sentence had the consequence of delaying his release to a halfway house was relevant to the double jeopardy analysis. We do not reach the merits of this claim because the defendant has not briefed how he was harmed by the allegedly improper evidentiary ruling. Accordingly, we decline to review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. At two points in the evidentiary hearing, defense counsel attempted to admit evidence relating to how the eighteen month sentence affected the defendant's ability to\n   enter a halfway house. First, during direct examination of a department record specialist, counsel asked the witness \"if the defendant could go to a halfway house as a result of this eighteen month sentence,\" and \"if the defendant has a detainer because of this eighteen months.\" The state objected, arguing that the testimony was irrelevant. The court sustained the state's objection and explained: \"The consequences of the sentence, I don't think, are relevant. It's the fact that the sentence was imposed that is at the heart of this matter.... I don't think the court is going to be looking to the severity of the sentence or the duration of the sentence. Rather ... I think the inquiry is going to be whether any sentence was appropriate because, if double jeopardy is to be implicated, it would necessarily mean that no sentence could be imposed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Subsequently, with the defendant on the witness stand, defense counsel attempted the following examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Q. [T]his eighteen months, that's consecutive to the current sentence?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Q. Okay. Now does that affect your time that you're now serving-I mean, in a halfway house-can you get out to a halfway house?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"A. No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the state objected, the court sustained the objection and stated: \"Okay. And again, the court believes the inquiry goes not to the severity of any sentence that might be imposed, but as to the question of whether any sentence could lawfully have been imposed. So I'm going to sustain the objection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and [e]very reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court's ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.
