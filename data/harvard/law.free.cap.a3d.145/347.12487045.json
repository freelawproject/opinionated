The plaintiff\n   claims that the court improperly determined that the opinion letter filed in the present case failed to demonstrate that the author of the letter was a similar health care provider as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we conclude that the opinion letter submitted by the plaintiff was not from a\n   similar health care provider, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record discloses the following relevant procedural history. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants on March 20, 2008, and a revised complaint on November 12, 2008, in which she, in her capacity as executrix, asserted a wrongful death claim on the basis of the defendants' medical malpractice. In her revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged the following facts, the truth of which we assume for purposes of her appeal. On December 5, 2005, the plaintiff's decedent was admitted for treatment by Lynch at Middlesex Hospital Shoreline Medical Center, was subsequently transferred to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where Cabin rendered care, and the decedent later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff alleged that the decedent's death was caused by the negligence, carelessness, and breach of the duty of care of the institutional defendants through their agents, servants, and employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   plaintiff also\n   alleged that the decedent's death was caused by the negligence, carelessness, and breach of the duty of care of the defendant physicians, Lynch and Cabin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the plaintiff alleged that as a result of the breach of the duty of care by the defendants, the decedent died on December 5, 2005. The plaintiff additionally alleged that as a result the decedent sustained pain and suffering, incurred various medical care, funeral, and burial expenses, and lost his capacity to earn wages and carry out life's activities. Additionally, the plaintiff, in her individual capacity, alleged that as a result of the defendants' breach of the duty of care owed the decedent, she suffered a loss of companionship, support, love and consortium with her husband, the decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Attached to the complaint was a good faith certificate signed by the plaintiff's attorney. The plaintiff's attorney represented therein that, following a reasonable inquiry by him, he believed in good faith that grounds existed for a medical malpractice action against the defendants. Additionally, the plaintiff attached a document entitled \"Medical Evaluation Report\" authored by Robert Pieroni, a physician. The letter stated in relevant part: \"The communication between Doctors Lynch and Cabin and\n   agents of their hospitals was frankly abysmal, and their actions and inactions in their 'treatment' of [the decedent] were distinctly substandard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The opinion letter set forth the specific facts related to the decedent's condition at the time he arrived at Middlesex Hospital Shoreline Medical Center. Additionally,\n   the letter delineated the ways in which the defendants failed to provide adequate or appropriate care, which allegedly led to the decedent's demise. The letter's stationary indicated that Pieroni was certified as a specialist by various American boards of medicine, however, a specialty of emergency medicine was not one of the many listed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff's revised complaint on the grounds that the opinion letter submitted by the plaintiff did not comply with \u00a7 52-190a, because it was not authored by a \"similar health care provider,\" and that it was insufficiently detailed in that it did not provide for how the defendants\n   deviated from the standard of care. In support of their motion to dismiss, the defendants submitted as an exhibit an affidavit executed by Lynch. In the affidavit Lynch averred that he \"[was] an emergency room physician ... and [had] been board certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine since June 18, 2004.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion and attached as exhibits an affidavit made by the opinion letter author, Pieroni, as well as his curriculum vitae. In the affidavit, Pieroni averred that he \"previously and currently [performs] physician responsibilities in a hospital emergency room department and [has] experience in providing emergency medical care.\" Pieroni further stated that he \"[had] been previously called upon to assist emergency room physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of patients....\" He also declared that \"[a]s a board certified physician in internal medicine, family medicine, and other specialty areas, [he had] been trained to perform medical diagnosis and treatment in different settings including emergency department settings....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 5, 2009, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Wilson, J.,\n   </em>\n   entered an order sustaining the plaintiff's objection to the defendants' motion to dismiss. Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion to reargue their motion to dismiss, citing, inter alia,\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. New Milford Hospital, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066872\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/535/\">\n    117 Conn.App. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%201066\">\n    979 A.2d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774947\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/1/\">\n    300 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20865\">\n    12 A.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). The court later granted the defendants' motion to reargue, vacated its order of October 5, 2009, and heard reargument on the defendants' motion to dismiss. In an April 6, 2010 memorandum of decision, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court summarized the key arguments advanced by the parties as follows: \"[Lynch] argue[d] that the plaintiff's complaint must be dismissed pursuant to\n   \u00a7 52-190a (c)because the author of the plaintiff's opinion letter [was] not a 'similar health care provider' as defined by \u00a7 52-184c (c). [He] further [contended] that the letter [was] not sufficiently detailed to allege medical negligence, in that it neither [stated] a standard of care nor [illustrated] how [he] breached that standard. Lastly, [Lynch argued] that the letter [was] conclusory in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The plaintiff [countered] that \u00a7 52-190a (c)provides for dismissal only where a plaintiff neglects to attach an opinion letter to a complaint. In addition, she [argued] that the opinion author is a similar health care provider because he has sufficient experience in the field of emergency medicine, which is unlike other medical specialties in that it is defined solely by the setting in which the care is rendered. The plaintiff further [argued] that the sufficiency of the detail of a medical opinion letter is not properly raised in a motion to dismiss; and that, if the court [were to find] that it is, the letter is sufficiently detailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The plaintiff filed a supplemental objection to the defendants' motion to dismiss, in which she [countered], inter alia, that\n   the care rendered by [Lynch] was outside of his specialty. Therefore, the plaintiff [contended] that the opinion letter author [Pieroni] is a similar medical provider under \u00a7 52-184c (c), although [Pieroni] is not board certified in emergency medicine. In reply, the defendants [asserted] that\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   [v.\n   <em>\n    New Milford Hospital, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066872\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/117/535/\">\n    117 Conn.App. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%201066\">\n    979 A.2d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,] still controls this issue, focusing on [Lynch's] board certification relative to that of [Pieroni]. The defendants also [argued] in reply that the substance of the letter at issue is lacking, and that it is deficient as against the institutional defendants....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court concluded that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

The plaintiff argues that the opinion letter complies with \u00a7 52-190a, and, therefore, is sufficient to support a claim against Lynch and the institutional defendants. Thus, the plaintiff asserts that the dismissal of the action was unwarranted. The defendants claim that the court properly applied the holding of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   in concluding that the opinion letter's author did not meet the objective standard imposed by \u00a7 52-190a, requiring that the attesting expert be a similar health care provider to Lynch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a)provides in relevant part that \"[n]o civil action or apportionment complaint shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless ... the claimant or the claimant's attorney, ... obtain[s] a written and signed opinion of a similar health care provider, as defined in section 52-184c, which similar health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence and includes a detailed basis for the formation of such opinion....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"To interpret the requirements of \u00a7 52-190a (a), we must read it together with \u00a7 52-184c, the statute regarding similar health care providers. Subsections (b)and (c) of \u00a7 52-184cdefine a 'similar health care provider' for purposes of the statute. For physicians who are\n   board certified or hold themselves out as specialists, subsection (c) of \u00a7 52-184cdefines 'similar health care provider' as 'one who: (1) [i]s trained and experienced in the same specialty; and (2) is certified by the appropriate American board in the same specialty....' \"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

General Statutes \u00a7 52-184c (c). Accordingly, before bringing an action alleging medical negligence on Lynch's part, the plaintiff or her attorney needed to obtain and file a written and signed opinion from such a physician indicating that there appears to be evidence of such negligence. Because the plaintiff's expert is not board certified in emergency medicine, he does not fall within the statutory definition of a similar health care provider as set forth in \u00a7 52-184c (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiff, citing \u00a7 52-184c (c), contends that the opinion letter author is a similar health care provider for purposes of \u00a7 52-190a, even if his board certification is not in the exact same certification as that of Lynch. The plaintiff argues that the exception contained in \u00a7 52-184c (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   is applicable because Lynch was not providing treatment to the decedent solely within his claimed\n   specialty of emergency medicine. Specifically, the plaintiff notes that Lynch's diagnosis and treatment of the decedent's condition-air in the chest cavity-was not caused by any trauma and, thus, was a condition outside of his emergency medicine specialty. The plaintiff also relies on the fact that she did not assert any allegations in the complaint based on Lynch's specialization in emergency medicine, and further argues that the facts of this case are different than those in\n   <em>\n    Bennett.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff contends that this case, therefore, is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   simply because the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   alleged that the defendant physician was specialized in emergency medicine, whereas the plaintiff in this case did\n   not. She asserts that by not alleging that Lynch was acting within his medical specialty of emergency medicine while negligently treating the decedent, the exception in \u00a7 52-184c (c), regarding providing treatment or diagnosis for a condition not within a provider's specialty, applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is important to note, however, that the plaintiff did not allege in her revised complaint that Lynch was acting outside of his medical specialty when he rendered treatment to the decedent. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not restrict her claims against Lynch to properly interpreting a chest X-ray. Rather, the revised complaint alleges that Lynch failed to take a proper history of the decedent, properly diagnose, and conduct the proper diagnostic testing on the decedent, which would fall within the specialty of emergency medicine. See footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion. Moreover, the plaintiff essentially is arguing that merely by omitting language regarding Lynch's specialty, the exception in \u00a7 52-184c (c)applies; however, if that assertion were accepted, it would seem that by omitting such language regarding a defendant's specialty, a plaintiff could always plead his or her way around the statute. Additionally, even if the plaintiff's proposition that the\n   alleged negligence of Lynch was limited to the improper interpretation of a chest X-raywere accepted, this act would not appear to fall outside of his field of specialization as a board certified emergency medicine physician. Indeed, there were no facts alleged in the revised complaint to demonstrate that the interpretation of X-rays falls outside the purview of the emergency medicine specialty. The fact that Lynch was interpreting the chest X-rayin an emergency room setting also leads us to the conclusion that it was within his specialty of emergency medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Farrell v. Bass,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750728\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/90/804/#p812\">\n    90 Conn.App. 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=879%20A.2d%20516\">\n    879 A.2d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), this court upheld the trial court's finding that a plastic surgeon's direction to his patient to discontinue taking the medication Coumadin, a blood thinner, for two days prior to surgery was not sufficient to conclude that the plastic surgeon was providing treatment or diagnosis for a condition which is not within his specialty, as stated in \u00a7 52-184c (c). The trial court had concluded that any direction to the patient to discontinue Coumadinfor a time was given in the physician's role as a plastic surgeon. Id., at 814,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=879%20A.2d%20516\">\n    879 A.2d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in this case, Lynch's interpretation of the decedent's X-ray was done within his role as an emergency medicine physician rendering treatment in an emergency room setting. Thus, we conclude that Lynch was not providing treatment or diagnosis for a condition that was not within his specialty and, therefore, the exception in \u00a7 52-184c (c)does not apply to the facts of this case. Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-190a (a)and 52-184c (c), the plaintiff's medical opinion letter should have been authored by a physician who is both trained and experienced and board certified in emergency medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, the plaintiff contends that the medical opinion letter was sufficient to support a claim against the institutional defendants; however, as the trial court concluded, the plaintiff did not allege that the liability of\n   the institutional defendants arose from anything other than vicarious liability for the negligent conduct of Lynch as their agent. The plaintiff cites several Superior Court cases to support the proposition that a written opinion that addresses only the negligence of the physicians is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss in an action in which the alleged medical malpractice of a hospital or similar entity is premised on the conduct of its individual physicians, employees, or staff. The plaintiff argues that the fact\n   that Lynch was the only agent specifically named in the complaint does not limit the allegations in the complaint against the institutional defendants to just his negligent acts and argues that because they alleged negligence on the part of the institutional defendants' \"agents, servants, and employees,\" the written opinion letter authored by Pieroni is sufficient to support a claim against those defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Wilkins v.

In the present case, however, because Pieroni was not properly qualified to author the opinion letter as against Lynch, the letter would not support allegations directed at any subordinate providers whose negligence would be imputed to the institutional defendants. Accordingly, because we conclude that the medical opinion letter was insufficient as offered against Lynch, we conclude that it was insufficient as against the institutional defendants as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, because the opinion letter submitted by the plaintiff was not authored by a similar health care provider pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-190a (a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   and 52-184c (c), we conclude that the court properly dismissed the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    We refer in this opinion to Nancy Helfant in both capacities as the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Middlesex Hospital maintained and operated a public hospital in the city of Middletown and state of Connecticut known as Middlesex Hospital, and in the town of Essex, known as Middlesex Hospital Shore Line Medical Center.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The plaintiff resolved her case against Yale-New Haven Hospital and Henry Cabin prior to filing this appeal.
