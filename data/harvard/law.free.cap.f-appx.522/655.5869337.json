(collectively \u201cMSC\u201d) for negligence, under the Jones Act, and for unseaworthiness, maintenance and cure, and failure to treat, under maritime law. The district court granted the motion of MSC to compel Quiroz to arbitrate his claims, under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards, based on a provision in his collective bargaining agreement that \u201cany and all claims ... against MSC, ... shall be arbitrated in accordance with the terms and conditions in this Agreement.\u201d <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203. After Quiroz appealed, we directed the parties to address three issues we raised <em>sua sponte </em>about the jurisdiction of the district court and this Court. We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction over Quiroz\u2019s complaint and that we have jurisdiction to review the order compelling him to arbitrate. Because the order to compel arbitration is required by our precedents in <em>Lindo v. NCL (Bahamas) Ltd., </em>652 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir.2011), and <em>Bautista v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.2005), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">Quiroz complained that MSC was responsible for injuries that Quiroz suffered on December 4, 2010, while he was serving in navigable waters as \u201cFirst Pastryman\u201d aboard the MSC POESIA. Quiroz alleged that he suffered a \u201cdual radius and ulna fracture\u201d when his right arm was caught in a cake mixer paddle. Quiroz complained about the negligence of MSC for, among other things, failing to provide a safe working environment and adequate instruction and supervision. Quiroz also complained that the POESIA had been unseaworthy and that MSC had violated its duties to provide maintenance and cure and to treat Quiroz \u201cwith prompt, proper, adequate and complete medical care.\u201d Quiroz sought monetary damages for his injuries, and a \u201cjury trial of all issues so triable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Quiroz invoked jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship or, alternatively, maritime law. With respect to diversity, Quiroz alleged only that \u201c[t]he matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum specified by 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1332.\u201d In the alternative, Quiroz alleged that the \u201cmatter f[ell] under the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of [the] Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">MSC filed a motion to compel Quiroz to arbitrate his complaint and requested, in its prayer for relief, that the district court \u201center an Order dismissing the instant action and compelling [Quiroz] to proceed to arbitration.\u201d MSC argued that Quiroz had entered an employment agreement that provided he would arbitrate all claims against MSC, that agreement was enforceable under our decision in <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1294-1301, and any defenses he might raise \u201cto arbitration [could] not be considered in response to ... [the] motion to compel arbitration,\u201d under <em>Bautista, id. </em>at 1302-03, and <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1257. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>MSC attached to its motion a copy of Quiroz\u2019s employment contract in which he accepted the rank of \u201cFirst Pastry\u201d on the POESIA \u201caccording to the terms, and conditions, stated in the Collective Agreement.\u201d Quiroz\u2019s contract also provided that, \u201c[h]aving read the rules of the above mentioned Collective Agreement which to any extent, are literally referred to in the present act, and having also explained it, the parties have fully agreed and accepted to underwriting it.\u201d Article 31 of the Collective Agreement contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration of \u201cany and all\u201d claims against MSC under Pana-mian law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">Grievances and disputes which remain unresolved after a sixty (60) day period, must be referred to arbitration to the exclusion of any other legal or court proceeding as set forth in this Agreement. It is further agreed that any and all claims from a Seafarer against the Company, ... including Jones Act claims, claims for damages for personal injury, ... negligence, unseaworthiness, failure to provide prompt proper and adequate medical care, or maintenance and cure whether based in tort or contract or under the laws of any nation or jurisdiction shall be arbitrated in accordance with the terms and conditions in this Agreement.... The arbitration referred to in this Article is exclusive and mandatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">... [A]ny grievance or dispute, with the exception of a wage dispute which is governed by the MSC Wage Grievance Policy and Procedure (including mandatory arbitration procedures found therein) shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution International Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.... The law of the vessel\u2019s flag state[, Panama,] shall govern any such dispute. Each party shall bear its own attorney\u2019s fees, but MSC shall pay for the costs of arbitration as assessed by the AAA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Quiroz opposed the motion to compel and dismiss and argued that the arbitration clause was invalid and unenforceable. Quiroz challenged the formation of the contract to arbitrate on the grounds that it violated the Seaman\u2019s Articles of Agreement Convention, the Maritime Labor Convention, and Panamian law by denying him the opportunity \u201cto examine and review the terms and conditions of the arbitration provisions and ... to seek counsel to advise him with respect to [those] terms and conditions.\u201d In the alternative, Quiroz argued that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because he would be \u201ccompletely deprived of his remedies\u201d under the Jones Act and general maritime law if he was forced to arbitrate under Panamian law; the arbitration clause sought to defeat the remedial purposes of the \u201cJones Act and the general maritime law,\u201d under <em>Paladino v. Avnet Computer Techs., Inc., </em>134 F.3d 1054 (11th Cir.1998); and the arbitration clause was void as against public policy, as addressed in <em>Thomas v. Carnival Corp., </em>573 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The district court granted the motion of MSC to compel and dismiss, denied as moot all pending motions, and directed the clerk to close the case. The district court ruled that, under <em>Bautista, </em>it had to compel arbitration because the arbitration clause satisfied the four requirements for it to fall under the Convention. 396 F.3d at 1294-95 &amp; n. 7. The district court also ruled that Quiroz\u2019s affirmative defenses were \u201cnot viable at the arbitration enforcement stage\u201d and \u201cmust be asserted during the arbitral award enforcement stage\u201d of the action, under <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1280-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>After Quiroz appealed, we directed the parties to address three jurisdictional issues: (1) whether the district court entered a \u201cfinal decision with respect to an arbitration,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3), that was appealable; (2) \u201cwhether the complaint sufficiently alleged ... that it was based on diversity of citizenship\u201d; and, (3) if the complaint failed to allege diversity of citizenship, \u201cwhether an amendment in this Court, or the district court, [was] appropriate.\u201d With regard to our jurisdiction, MSC argued that the order compelling arbitration was not final because the district court failed to dismiss Quiroz\u2019s complaint and instead administratively closed the case. Quiroz argued that the order was final because \u201cthe district court closed the case (without entering a stay), leaving the court with nothing to do but execute the judgment.\u201d As to the jurisdiction of the district court, MSC argued that Quiroz failed to allege facts sufficient to invoke diversity jurisdiction, but a remand was unnecessary because the district court could have exercised federal question jurisdiction under the Convention or admiralty jurisdiction. Quiroz argued that his complaint had \u201csufficiently invoked the district court\u2019s ... <em>admiralty </em>jurisdiction\u201d and, in the alternative, he could cure any jurisdictional defects on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We apply a single standard of review to resolve the issues in this appeal. We review <em>de novo </em>issues of \u201c[w]hether we have jurisdiction,\u201d <em>San Francisco Residence </em>Club, <em>Inc. v. 7027 Old Madison Pike, LLC, </em>583 F.3d 750, 754 (11th Cir.2009), and \u201c[wjhether [the district] court [had] subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a matter,\u201d <em>Holston Invs., Inc. B.V.I. v. LanLogistics Corp., </em>677 F.3d 1068, 1070 (11th Cir.2012). We also review <em>de novo </em>an order to compel arbitration. <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1275 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We divide our discussion into three parts. First, we address whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Quiroz\u2019s complaint. Second, we address whether the district court entered a \u201cfinal decision with respect to an arbitration,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3), that we have jurisdiction to review. Third, we address whether the district court was required to compel Quiroz to arbitrate his complaints against MSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">\n<em>A. Quiroz\u2019s Complaint Failed to Allege Sufficient Facts to Invoke Jurisdiction Based on Diversity, But He Pleaded Facts that Invoked Jurisdiction in Admiralty.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Quiroz\u2019s complaint alleged jurisdiction based on both diversity of citizenship and admiralty, but failed to plead sufficient facts to invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the district court. To establish diversity jurisdiction, the complaint must allege that the action is between \u201ccitizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(2). Because Quiroz\u2019s complaint failed to allege his citizenship or the citizenship of MSC, the district court lacked jurisdiction based on diversity of the parties. <em>See Mallory &amp; Evans Contractors &amp; Eng\u2019rs, LLC v. Tuskegee Univ., </em>663 F.3d 1304, 1305 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Congress vested district courts with original jurisdiction over \u201c[a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1). From its inception, jurisdiction in admiralty has recognized a right of action for seamen who are injured in the service of their ship while in navigable waters. <em>See O\u2019Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>318 U.S. 36, 40, 63 S.Ct. 488, 490-91, 87 L.Ed. 596 (1943). \u201cIt allowed such recovery if the injury resulted from unseaworthiness of the vessel or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>her tackle, and permitted recovery of maintenance and cure, ordinarily measured by wages and the cost of reasonable medical care, if the seaman was injured or disabled in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40, 63 S.Ct. at 491. To invoke jurisdiction in admiralty, Quiroz had to allege facts establishing \u201cthe nature of [his] service as a seaman[ ] ..., his status as a member of the vessel, and his relationship as such to the vessel and its operation in navigable waters.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Marra Bros., </em>328 U.S. 1, 4, 66 S.Ct. 869, 871, 90 L.Ed. 1045 (1946) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Quiroz pleaded sufficient facts to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the district court. Quiroz alleged that MSC \u201cowned, operated, managed, maintained and/or controlled the vessel M/S POE-SIA,\u201d his \u201cemployer was an agent of\u2019 MSC, and he was injured \u201cwhile employed in the capacity of First Pastryman on board the M/S POESIA,\u201d which established his relationship with MSC and its vessel. Quiroz also alleged that the \u201cvessel was in navigable waters\u201d at the time of his injury and that he \u201cdebarked in Port Everglades, Florida,\u201d to obtain further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>B. We Have Jurisdiction to Review the Order Compelling Quiroz to Arbitrate.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The Federal Arbitration Act provides that a party may appeal \u201ca final decision with respect to an arbitration,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3), but \u201can appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order ... compelling arbitration,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 16(b)(3). These provisions respect the authority of the district court to retain jurisdiction to superintend the arbitration process, <em>see Brandon, Jones, Sandall, Zeide, Kohn, Chalal &amp; Musso, P.A. v. Medpartners, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 1349, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2002), or, alternatively, to \u201cend[ ] the litigation on its merits and leave[] nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment\u201d following arbitration, <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 86, 121 S.Ct. 513, 520, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The district court entered a \u201cfinal decision with respect to an arbitration\u201d of Quiroz\u2019s complaint. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3). To be final, the decision of the district court had to \u201cdispose[ ] of the entire case on the merits and le[ave] no part of it pending before the court.\u201d <em>Green Tree, </em>531 U.S. at 86, 121 S.Ct. at 520. The district court granted the motion of MSC to dismiss Quiroz\u2019s complaint and compel arbitration. When the district court granted the motion of MSC, dismissed as moot all other motions pending, and directed the clerk to close Quiroz\u2019s case, \u201cit disposed of all the issues framed by the litigation and left nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1294 (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>Emp\u2019rs Ins. of Wausau v. Bright Metal Specialties, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">MSC argues that the district court ordered an administrative closure instead of entering a final order, but we disagree. Our precedents establish that a district court administratively closes a case when it retains jurisdiction to perform specific acts and then closes the case instead of dismissing it. <em>Brandon, Jones, </em>312 F.3d at 1354-55; <em>see also Fla. Assoc. for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Bush, </em>246 F.3d 1296, 1298 (11th Cir.2001) (retaining jurisdiction to issue orders to execute and enforce compliance with a consent decree). In <em>Brandon, </em>we observed that, had the district court disposed of the complaint and \u201cclosed\u201d the case, \u201cthat conduct would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>[have] le[d] us to conclude that the order was final.\u201d 312 F.3d at 1354. Because the district court also granted the plaintiffs request \u201cto retain jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award and to award attorney\u2019s fees associated with the litigation and the arbitration,\u201d the order was not final because the \u201cretained jurisdiction contemplate[d] that more [was] yet to come in [the] litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1355. The order compelling Quiroz to arbitrate is final because it does not contemplate further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>C. The District Court Did Not Err By Ordering Quiroz to Arbitrate His Complaint Against MSC.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">District courts have a duty to enforce an agreement to arbitrate that falls under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards. The Convention provides that a contracting state \u201cshall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration ... [their] differences,\u201d Convention, Art. 11(1), and \u201cshall refer the parties to arbitration\u201d unless the agreement is invalid, <em>id., </em>Art. 11(3). After the United States ratified the treaty, Congress enacted legislation, referred to as the Convention Act, that recognizes that a district court exercises \u201coriginal jurisdiction over ... an action or proceeding\u201d that \u201cfall[s] under the Convention\u201d because it is \u201cdeemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the United States.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203. The Convention Act, like the Convention, encourages district courts to enforce commercial arbitration agreements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 206; <em>see Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 520 n. 15, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 2457 n. 15, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Under the Convention Act, the district court must address a \u201cvery limited inquiry\u201d in determining whether to enforce an agreement to arbitrate. <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1294 (quoting <em>Francisco v. STOLT ACHIEVEMENT MT, </em>293 F.3d 270, 273 (5th Cir.2002)). When a dispute arises about an agreement to arbitrate, the agreement is governed by the Convention if the following four factors are present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">(1) there is an agreement in writing within the meaning of the Convention; (2) the agreement provides for arbitration in the territory of a signatory of the Convention; (3) the agreement arises out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered commercial; and (4) a party to the agreement is not an American citizen, or that the commercial relationship has some reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1294 n. 7. If the agreement satisfies those four jurisdictional factors, the district court must order arbitration unless the agreement \u201cis null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\u201d Convention, Art. 11(3). We consider challenges to enforcement \u201cmindful that the Convention Act generally establishes a strong presumption in favor of arbitration of international commercial disputes.\u201d <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1295 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Quiroz argues that his agreement to arbitrate fails to satisfy the first jurisdictional factor, that there be an agreement in writing, but we disagree. Parties have an \u201cagreement in writing\u201d under the Convention if there is \u201can arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.\u201d Convention, Art. 11(2). Quiroz does not challenge the finding of the district court that he entered an agreement in writing. Instead, Quiroz seeks to superimpose an additional requirement that the agreement be \u201cvalidly formed\u201d in compliance with the Seaman\u2019s Convention, the Maritime Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Convention, and Panamanian law. But under the limited jurisdictional inquiry prescribed by the Convention Act, the district court had only to confirm that there was an agreement in writing in compliance with the Convention. <em>See Bautista, </em>896 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Quiroz also argues that his agreement was not valid under the Conventions and Panamanian law because he was denied an opportunity to review and consult with counsel before entering the agreement, but this contention is essentially the same argument about \u201cknowledgeable consent\u201d that we rejected in <em>Bautista. </em>The crewmembers in <em>Bautista </em>argued that their agreement to arbitrate was unenforceable unless their employer could prove they had been \u201cspecifically notified of the arbitration provision,\u201d but we held that neither the Convention nor the Convention Act required proof of \u201cnotice or knowledgeable consent\u201d and the imposition of \u201csuch an evidentiary showing ... would be squarely at odds with a court\u2019s limited jurisdictional inquiry\u201d under the Convention. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Although Quiroz argues that he did <em>not </em>\u201cfreely enter\u201d the agreement to arbitrate or \u201cunderstand his rights and responsibilities,\u201d he declared in his employment contract that he had \u201cread the rule[ ] ... [about arbitration in] the ... Collective Agreement, ... [had] also explained it, ... [and] fully agreed and accepted to underwriting it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Quiroz also argues that the arbitration clause is \u201cnull and void\u201d because its application of Panamanian law effectively deprives him of a remedy under the Jones Act and general maritime law, but his argument is foreclosed by our precedent. In <em>Lindo, </em>we recognized that the \u201cnull and void\u201d clause in the Convention limits the defenses available to enforcement of a seaman\u2019s arbitration agreement to \u201cthose limited situations, such as \u2018fraud, mistake, duress, and waiver,\u2019 constituting \u2018standard breach-of-contract defenses\u2019 that \u2018can be applied neutrally on an international scale.\u2019 \u201d 652 F.3d at 1276 (quoting <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1302). Quiroz\u2019s public policy defense \u201cby definition cannot be applied neutrally on an international scale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278 (internal quotation marks omitted). Quiroz contends that a public policy argument constitutes a valid defense to enforcement of an arbitration clause under <em>Thomas v. Carnival Corp., </em>573 F.3d 1113, but we held in <em>Lindo </em>that \u201cto the extent <em>Thomas </em>allowed the plaintiff seaman to prevail on a new public policy defense under Article II, <em>Thomas </em>violate[d] <em>Bautista </em>and our prior panel precedent rule.\u201d <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Quiroz also contends that the enforcement of the arbitration clause would effectively deny him meaningful relief and contravene our decision in <em>Paladino v. Avnet Computer Technologies, </em>134 F.3d 1054, but we disagree. <em>Paladino </em>involved enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate under the Federal Arbitration Act instead of the Convention and declared unenforceable an agreement mandating arbitration of federal statutory claims for which the employee could not recover damages. <em>Id. </em>at 1060-62. In contrast with <em>Paladino, </em>Quiroz\u2019s agreement is enforceable under the Convention and does not limit the authority of the arbitrator to grant Quiroz meaningful relief. If the application of Panamanian law deprives Quiroz of a remedy, he can raise his defense about public policy in an action to enforce the arbitral award. <em>See Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">We AFFIRM the order compelling Qui-roz to arbitrate his complaint against MSC.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
