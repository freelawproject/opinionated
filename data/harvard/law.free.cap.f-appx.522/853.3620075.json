Feng sought asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that he had suffered past persecution on account of his religious activities, but the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with the finding of the immigration judge that Feng was not credible. We dismiss in part and deny in part Feng\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-20\">Feng argues that he is eligible for relief under the Convention, but we lack jurisdiction to consider that argument. Feng failed to argue for relief under the Convention in his brief to Board. \u201c[A]bsent a cognizable excuse or exception, we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the [Board].\u201d <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). We dismiss that part of Feng\u2019s petition seeking review of the denial of his application for relief under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-21\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Feng was not credible, and the Board identified specific and cogent reasons to support that finding. <em>See Carrizo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>652 F.3d 1326, 1332 (11th Cir.2011). Feng based his application on two incidents in which police allegedly beat him for religious activities, but there were several inconsistencies in Feng\u2019s application, his testimony, and his corroborating evidence regarding his role in an underground church and his injuries. Feng submitted a warrant to arrest him purportedly issued in August 2009 because he had been a \u201cmajor member\u201d of a \u201cnon-government registered illegal underground\u201d church and, despite undergoing \u201cnumerous educations and punishments,\u201d had \u201cenlarged the organization of the church,\u201d but Feng later testified that he had not been a leader in the church, he had only two encounters with the police, and the church had closed after his arrest in July. Feng also submitted a Hospital Illness Certificate stating that on July 18 he suffered a hematoma and injuries to the \u201c[s]oft tissues ... around the whole body,\u201d his \u201cfour limbs,\u201d and his back, but Feng did not mention any injuries in his application and later testified that he was treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>and released from the hospital in 30 minutes and did not suffer any broken bones. Feng also testified falsely about the location of his residence in the United States and refused to respond when asked to provide his address, and the Board was entitled to consider Feng\u2019s lack of candor in determining his credibility. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Feng fails to provide an explanation for his inconsistencies that would compel a reasonable fact finder to reverse the adverse credibility finding and conclude that Feng established eligibility for asylum relief or withholding of removal. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We DISMISS Feng\u2019s petition for review of the denial of relief under the Convention and DENY his petition for review of the denial of asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
