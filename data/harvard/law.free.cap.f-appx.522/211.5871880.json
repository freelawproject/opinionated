The district court sentenced Holmes to a cumulative prison term of 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Holmes challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny his suppression motion without a hearing. He contends that he made a substantial preliminary showing of entitlement to a hearing because he showed that a police officer\u2019s identical affidavits used to obtain search warrants for adjacent premises included inaccuracies and omissions that raise an inference that the affidavits were entirely fabricated. According to Holmes, the warrants rested on intentionally falsified information.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence will be suppressed and excluded from consideration \u201cwhere a Fourth Amendment violation has been substantial and deliberate.\u201d <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). An affidavit supporting a warrant carries a presumption of validity. <em>Id.; United States v. Gunn, </em>49 F.3d 728 (5th Cir.1995). Nevertheless, a defendant challenging that presumption is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if he makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement was knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, included by the affiant in a warrant affidavit, provided that the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674; <em>United States v. El-Mezain, </em>664 F.3d 467, 570 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201cWe review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that an affiant\u2019s statements were not deliberately false or not made with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>627 F.3d 146, 159 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusions of law, which include the decision to deny an evi-dentiary hearing under <em>Franks.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Holmes contends that the following representations made to the judge who issued the search warrants were false or misleading and consequently called each affidavit into question as a complete fabrication: the affidavits mentioned a light on his porch, but there is no light fixture there; the affidavits mentioned that an informant saw a safe in his residence, but no safe was found when the warrant was executed; the affidavits stated that the utilities for the laundry business were in his name, but in fact the registration was in the name of his business; and the police officer intentionally misled the judge by not revealing that prior arrest warrants for Holmes for cocaine distribution concerned conduct occurring two years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u201cAn unsupported assertion that an affidavit contains a misstatement (or an omission) does not give rise to the inference that the affiant acted with reckless disregard for the accuracy of the information presented to the magistrate.\u201d <em>United States v. Runyan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 234 n. 6 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Mueller, </em>902 F.2d 336, 341-42 (5th Cir.1990). Moreover, our review of the affidavits and of the entire record compels the conclusion that Holmes fails to establish even an inference of deliberate or reckless falsity. Holmes\u2019s contentions concerning the utilities statements and the prior arrest warrants are nothing \u201cmore than conclusory.\u201d <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Holmes\u2019s contentions concerning the bedroom safe are refuted by the record, which shows that police did find a safe in the residence. And Holmes\u2019s contention concerning the porch light is unpersuasive, given that the district court had a clarifying affidavit before it when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ruled that a <em>Franks </em>hearing was unnecessary. Thus, we reject Holmes\u2019s invitation to conclude that the police officer\u2019s affidavits were made from whole cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Because we do not disturb the district court\u2019s decision to deny the suppression motion without a hearing, Holmes\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
