After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">A. Administrative Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">In his applications for benefits, Timmons alleged that he was unable to work as of April 30, 2006, due to his bipolar disorder, personality disorder, and two disc protrusions in his back resulting from a car accident. Timmons\u2019s applications were denied initially and on reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">Timmons, his mother, and a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) testified at a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Timmons also submitted 22 letters from friends, family members, and former coworkers and employers. The letters were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>written between October 2007 and October 2009 and described Timmons\u2019s history since childhood of mood swings, manic outbursts, and violent behavior, which has persisted into adulthood. Numerous letter writers stated that Timmons had trouble interacting with other people, could not control what he said or how he acted, and spoke loudly and excessively. Former coworkers and employers also described Timmons\u2019s inability to stay focused on work tasks and his confrontations with coworkers, which made it difficult for Tim-mons to keep a job for long.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">B. ALJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">After the hearing, the ALJ issued a decision denying Timmons benefits. Following the five-step evaluation process, the ALJ found: (1) Timmons had not engaged in substantial gainful activity from his alleged disability onset date; (2) Timmons had the severe impairments of polysub-stance abuse, schizoaffective disorder, thoracic compression fractures, and a disc bulge at L4-5; (3) Timmons\u2019s impairments, singly or in combination, did not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments in the regulations; (4) Tim-mons could not perform his past relevant work as an electrician, but had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform light work except that he required a sit/ stand option and he was limited to simple one- and two-step tasks and to occasional contact with the public, coworkers, and supervisors; and (5) given Timmons\u2019s age, education, work experience, and RFC, there existed jobs in significant numbers in the national economy that Timmons could perform, including tobacco leaf tier, ampoule sealer, and electrical parts assembler.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">In concluding that Timmons\u2019s mental impairments did not meet or equal a listed mental impairment, the ALJ found that Timmons had only mild restrictions in activities of daily living and social functioning and moderate difficulties with concentration, persistence, or pace and had experienced one or two episodes of decompensation of extended duration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In doing so, the ALJ noted that the letters Timmons submitted indicated that Timmons had difficulty concentrating and following instructions, had confrontations with coworkers and supervisors, talked incessantly, and had volatile moods. However, two consulting psychologists who had reviewed Tim-mons\u2019s records had concluded that Tim-mons could complete simple and complex tasks within an appropriate time frame and could carry out instructions and adequately relate to others in a work setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">In determining Timmons\u2019s RFC, the ALJ reviewed the various medical opinions and explained the amount of weight she assigned to each. On appeal, Timmons takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s handling of only two of these medical opinions, the opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>of Dr. Alvan Barber and Dr. Najib Kirma-ni, consultants who examined Timmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Dr. Barber conducted two separate physical examinations. After a September 2007 examination, Dr. Barber noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Timmons: (1) had 5/5 muscle strength in both his upper and lower extremities; (2) had 5/5 grip strength, but he had no deep tendon reflexes; (3) had no point tenderness in his sacroiliac joints; (4) felt pain when, in a supine position, his leg was raised to 90 degrees, but he had a negative Lasegue\u2019s Test; (5) was able to walk on his heels, walk on his toes, and squat; and (6) had a negative Romberg sign. Dr. Barber concluded that Timmons could walk, stand, and sit for a reasonable amount of time without discomfort. However, according to Dr. Barber, Timmons could be limited in his ability to lift and carry heavy objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">At a second, April 2008 examination, Dr. Barber reported that Timmons: (1) had not received treatment or medication for his back pain since 2006, and he had incontinence approximately once a week; (2) heard a popping noise in his spine; and (3) again felt pain when, in a supine position, his leg was raised, but his Lasegue\u2019s Test was negative. Dr. Barber came to the same conclusion regarding Timmons\u2019s ability to walk, stand, sit, and lift and carry heavy objects as he had in 2007, but Dr. Barber also noted that Timmons was unable to squat and Timmons\u2019s symptoms might be exacerbated by his excess weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Dr. Kirmani conducted a psychiatric evaluation. Dr. Kirmani\u2019s report noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Timmons: (1) was appropriately dressed and groomed and was able to relate to and cooperate with Dr. Kirmani; (2) was alert, had no speech or psychomotor abnormalities, and had a normal mood; (3) was fully oriented, had no hallucinations, had intact memory and judgment, and adequate insight. Dr. Kir-mani concluded that Timmons did not have a psychotic reaction, had no deterioration in personal habits, had no impaired ability to relate to Dr. Kirmani, and had no identified intellectual deterioration. Dr. Kir-mani opined that Timmons had depressive disorder, but that Timmons was able to make personal and social adjustments and had the ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The ALJ gave \u201cgreat weight\u201d to these two doctors\u2019 medical opinions. The ALJ explained that she did so because their opinions were \u201cconsistent with the medical evidence of record and are supported by the record as a whole\u201d and because \u201cthe doctors had the opportunity to personally examine the claimant before forming their opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">C. Appeals Council\u2019s Denial of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Timmons filed a request for review with the Appeals Council and submitted new evidence. To his appeal brief, Timmons attached three additional letters from people who had witnessed Timmons\u2019s continued problems with social functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Timmons also submitted a mental health evaluation conducted by Carol Beall, a licensed clinical social worker, on November 23, 2010, several months after the ALJ issued her decision. As a result of her exam, Beall observed that: (1) Timmons was well groomed, oriented, and maintained good eye contact; (2) he spoke rapidly, but his speech was coherent, relevant, and goal directed, but also often tangential; (3) his mood was labile, with tearfulness at times and hypomania at other times; (4) he did not have hallucinations or delusions, but he did have some religious preoccupation; (5) he had good insight into his mental health and addiction problems, but his symptoms remained problematic despite his compliance with treatment; (6) he had marked impairment of his memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>at times and fair concentration, but required some redirection; (7) he had no suicidal or homicidal ideation. In her clinical findings, Beall stated that Timmons was cooperative and friendly during the interview and open and honest about his mental health problems. Timmons\u2019s judgment was impaired at times, which impaired his ability to function, but he was willing to be \u201cmed compliant\u201d and sober.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Timmons claimed that the letters and Beall\u2019s evaluation showed that Timmons\u2019s limitations in social functioning were more severe than the limitations found by the ALJ. Timmons asked the Appeals Council to remand his case to the ALJ with instructions to reconsider and revise the RFC assessment and to obtain testimony from the VE regarding jobs he could perform with that revised RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The Appeals Council denied review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Appeals Council noted that it considered and made part of the record Timmons\u2019s new evidence, which it listed as Timmons\u2019s appeal brief and the treatment evidence from Carol Beall. The Appeals Council concluded that \u201cthis information [did] not provide a basis for changing the [ALJ\u2019s] decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The Appeals Council stated that Tim-mons\u2019s appeal brief was incorporated into the record. However, the three letters purportedly attached to that brief are not in the agency\u2019s certified administrative record filed with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">D. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">On judicial review, Timmons argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his ease should be remanded to the Appeals Council, under either \u201csentence four\u201d or \u201csentence six\u201d of \u00a7 405(g), for consideration of his new evidence. Timmons submitted copies of the three letters with his memorandum filed in the district court. The three letters, all written in June 2010, described Timmons\u2019s difficulties interacting with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Jason Amici, Timmons\u2019s neighbor, stated that he had known Timmons for three years and that Timmons talked excessively and loudly, was known to say things without respect for people\u2019s feelings, and had numerous run-ins with neighbors and friends. Amici estimated that Timmons had confrontations with someone approximately every week and that he had a difficult time communicating with normal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Jarod Lebrun, Timmons\u2019s friend for seven years, stated that over the years he and Timmons had had numerous confrontations due to Timmons\u2019s poor judgment. Timmons had a loud mouth, said demeaning things, and did not care what he said, who he said it to, or who heard it. Tim-mons\u2019s mood also changed frequently, and he had trouble interacting appropriately with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">Paul Walker stated that during the six years he had known Timmons, Tim-mons had exhibited many inappropriate behaviors, including saying things without consideration for people\u2019s feelings and cursing. Timmons had a history of altercations with friends, family, and neighbors. Walker said that it was an \u201ceveryday occurrence\u201d for Timmons to have strange thoughts and loud and rambling speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">A magistrate judge entered an order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As to Timmons\u2019s remand request, the magistrate judge found that the three additional letters Timmons tried to submit to the Appeals Council as new evidence, but that were not found in the administrative record, were cumulative of other letters already in the administrative record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Therefore, the magistrate judge concluded that these three letters were not new and material evidence and that a sentence six remand was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Timmons filed a motion for reconsideration, pointing out that the magistrate judge had not addressed his argument for a sentence four remand. The magistrate judge denied the motion for reconsideration, stating that Timmons\u2019s request was addressed in the portion of the order concerning Timmons\u2019s new evidence. Tim-mons filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">II. MAGISTRATE JUDGE\u2019S DENIAL OF REQUEST FOR A REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Timmons contends the magistrate judge should have remanded his case to the Appeals Council under either \u201csentence four\u201d or \u201csentence six\u201d of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) because of the new evidence he submitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, Timmons claims that a remand was necessary because the Appeals Council failed: (1) to acknowledge receipt of his three additional letters in its decision or to incorporate the letters into the record; and (2) to remand the case to the ALJ in light of Timmons\u2019s new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">A social security claimant generally is permitted to present new evidence at each stage of the administrative process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.900(b), 416.1470(b); <em>see also Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1258, 1261 (11th Cir.2007). The Appeals Council has the discretion not to review the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.967, 416.1467. However, the Appeals Council must consider \u201cnew and material evidence\u201d that \u201crelates to the period on or before the date of [the ALJ] hearing decision\u201d and must review the case if the ALJ\u2019s \u201caction, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b), 416.1470(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">There are two methods of remand under \u00a7 405(g) \u2014 \u201csentence four remands\u201d and \u201csentence six remands.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A sentence four remand is appropriate when the claimant submitted new evidence to the Appeals Council, which the Appeals Council did not adequately consider in denying the claimant\u2019s request for review. <em>Id. </em>at 1268. To obtain a sentence four remand, the claimant must show that, in light of the new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council, the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 1266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">In contrast, a sentence six remand is appropriate only when the claimant submits evidence for the first time to the district court that might have changed the outcome of the administrative proceeding. Id. at 1267-68. To remand under sentence six, the claimant must show the evidence is new and material and was not incorporated into the administrative record for good cause. Id. at 1267. New evidence is material, and thus warrants a remand, if \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>new evidence would change the administrative outcome.\u201d <em>Hyde v. Bowen, </em>823 F.2d 456, 459 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">A. Sentence Six Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The district court did not err in refusing to remand Timmons\u2019s case under sentence six. The parties agree that because the Appeals Council failed to refer to Tim-mons\u2019s three additional letters in its decision and did not include them in the certified administrative record, those letters should be considered evidence submitted for the first time to the district court under sentence six of \u00a7 405(g). Moreover, the government does not dispute that Tim-mons has shown good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">We agree with the magistrate judge, however, that the three letters are not \u201cnew and material\u201d because they are cumulative of numerous other letters already in the administrative record that described Timmons\u2019s difficulties interacting with others. Specifically, the three additional letters, like the letters already in the record, stated that Timmons speaks loudly and excessively, has mood swings, says things that hurt others\u2019 feelings, and is confrontational. The ALJ considered the other letters already in the record that described this behavior and concluded that those letters were not consistent with the medical evidence and the doctors\u2019 opinions as to the severity of Timmons\u2019s limitations in social functioning. Under the circumstances, Timmons has not shown a reasonable possibility that his three additional letters describing the same social difficulties would change the administrative outcome. <em>See Hyde, </em>828 F.2d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">In addition, we reject Timmons\u2019s contention that the three letters are not cumulative because they cover a different time period. Although the letters were written in June 2010, the letters described in general terms Timmons\u2019s behavior over a period of years and did not give specific dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">We also reject Timmons\u2019s claim that the letters are material because they refute the ALJ\u2019s finding that Timmons stopped experiencing social problems when he was sober. First, the ALJ never made such a finding. Instead, the ALJ found that Tim-mons had the serious mental impairments of polysubstance abuse and schizoaffective disorder and that these mental impairments resulted in functional limitations of (1) simple one- and two-step tasks, and (2) only occasional contact with the public, coworkers, and supervisors. The ALJ further noted that Timmons had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, Timmons received substance abuse treatment from September 2006 to March 2007, and Timmons testified that he had relapsed with drinking and was not attending Alcoholics Anonymous. The ALJ also noted that one consulting psychologist had observed that Timmons\u2019s functioning had improved with sobriety. The ALJ ultimately found that Timmons\u2019s mental impairments were effectively managed with medication and did not prevent him from performing light work with those two mental limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">We note that both the consulting psychologist\u2019s observation (that Timmons\u2019s functioning improved when he was sober) and the ALJ\u2019s finding (that Timmons\u2019s mental impairments were effectively managed with medication) are supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the record shows that, after Timmons received residential substance abuse treatment at Serenity House from September 2006 to March 2007, he received ongoing medication management from Act Corporation. Thereafter, his medical records and psychological evaluations from 2008 to 2010 indicate that he was doing well, with the exception of one period in the fall of 2009, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>when he was not compliant with his medication and admitted drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Specifically, according to Act Corporation\u2019s treatment notes, during a September 2009 follow-up, Timmons reported increased anxiety and admitted to drinking two beers in the past week. The importance of Timmons\u2019s sobriety was discussed \u2022with him. Two months later, Timmons reported panic attacks and admitted decreasing his medication without permission. Timmons was given Klonopin in the emergency room because he had not been taking his medication. The treatment notes stated that Timmons needed to attend AA meetings. By February 2010, Timmons was again taking his medications and reported that they were helping him. Treatment notes from this visit indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no evidence of substance abuse and that Timmons\u2019s attention/concentration, judgment, and insight were good, his speech, motor behavior, and impulse control were normal, his affect was in the normal range, and his thought process was organized. Progress notes stated that Timmons was doing well, was bright and conversational, and his mood was stable, although he was religiously preoccupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Second, the three letters do not, as Tim-mons suggests, refute the consulting psychologist\u2019s observation that Timmons\u2019s functioning improved during sobriety. Indeed, the letters do not mention Tim-mons\u2019s substance abuse or his sobriety at all. Furthermore, the letters do not indicate that additional limitations beyond those already in the RFC are necessary. For all these reasons, the district court properly concluded that a remand under sentence six was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">B. Sentence Four Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">The district court also did not err with respect to Timmons\u2019s request for a sentence four remand. A sentence four remand was warranted only if the new evidence considered by the Appeals Council \u2014 Carol Beall\u2019s mental health evaluation \u2014 showed that the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits was not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. <em>See Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1266-67. Nothing in Beall\u2019s evaluation suggests that the ALJ\u2019s limiting Timmons to simple one- and two-step tasks and to only occasional contact with co-workers, supervisors, and the public was inadequate to address Tim-mons\u2019s mental impairments. Even in light of Beall\u2019s evaluation, the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment and ultimate decision to deny benefits are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">III. PHYSICIANS\u2019 OPINIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Timmons argues that the ALJ did not adequately explain the weight given to the opinions of two examining physicians, Dr. Barber and Dr. Kirmani. As a result, Timmons asserts, the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">A. Evaluation of Medical Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">An ALJ uses a five-step evaluation to determine whether the claimant is disabled, which includes (1) whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) whether the claimant has the RFC to perform his past relevant work; and (5) whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), (c)(f), 416.920(a)(4), (c)-(f); <em>see also Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">In determining at steps four and five whether a claimant can perform his past relevant work or other work in the economy, the ALJ must determine a claimant\u2019s RFC by considering all relevant medical and other evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). In assessing RFC, the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given different medical opinions and the reasons for doing so. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987). Without this explanation, a reviewing court cannot determine whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. However, the ALJ\u2019s explanation of the decision need not account for every piece of evidence. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">In evaluating medical opinions, the ALJ considers many factors, including the examining relationship, the treatment relationship, the doctor\u2019s specialization, whether the opinion is amply supported, and whether the opinion is consistent with the record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c). Generally, the opinions of examining physicians are given more weight than non-examining physicians, and the opinions of treating physicians are given more weight than non-treating physicians. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(1)-(2), 416.927(c)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">B. Opinions of Brs. Barber and Kirma-ni</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Here, the ALJ adequately explained the weight she gave to the opinions of Dr. Barber and Dr. Kirmani. The ALJ reviewed each doctor\u2019s examination findings and then stated that she had \u201caccorded great weight\u201d to their medical opinions because they \u201care consistent with the medical evidence of record and are supported by the record as a whole\u201d and also because the doctors had \u201cpersonally examine[d]\u201d Timmons. The ALJ\u2019s explanation of its treatment of these two doctors\u2019 opinions is sufficient to allow for meaningful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Timmons argues that Dr. Barber\u2019s opinion was too imprecise or tentative to support the ALJ\u2019s RFC findings as to Timmons\u2019s exertional limitations, such as Timmons\u2019s ability to walk, sit, lift and carry. However, the ALJ was not limited to Dr. Barber\u2019s opinion or his clinical findings in making her RFC assessment. Rather, the ALJ considers all the relevant evidence in making an RFC assessment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). Other evidence in the record, including the treatment notes from Tim-mons\u2019s physical therapy and Timmons\u2019s own statements and hearing testimony as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>to his daily activities and physical abilities, provided additional information about Timmons\u2019s ability to walk, stand, sit, lift, and carry, and the ALJ was not required to specifically reference each piece of evidence in the decision. <em>See Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">For example, Timmons testified that he could sit and stand for about an hour and that he could walk for about a half an hour. In 2007, he reported that he could walk for about 30 minutes, stand for about 30 minutes, sit for two or three hours and could lift 15 to 20 pounds. Similarly, during Dr. Barber\u2019s 2008 examination, Timmons told Dr. Barber he could walk for 20 minutes, stand for 30 minutes, sit for two or three hours, and could lift 10 to 20 pounds. The physical therapy treatment notes stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Timmons pain was reduced from eight out of ten to zero out of ten, he was able to conduct his usual activities with no pain, and he could sit, stand, and walk. Timmons\u2019s physical abilities, expressed in his own statements and in the treatment notes, are consistent with the ability to perform light work with a sit/stand option. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Timmons also claims that the ALJ\u2019s failure to account for Dr. Barber\u2019s finding that Timmons could not squat is reversible error. Although the IJ noted Dr. Barber\u2019s finding that Timmons could not squat in her decision and gave Dr. Barber\u2019s opinion great weight, the IJ did not include a squatting limitation in her RFC assessment. The problem for Timmons is that squatting (also referred to as crouching) is not required for any of the jobs the ALJ found Timmons could perform. <em>See </em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, 529.687-138, 1991 WL 674769 (leaf tier), 559.687-014, 1991 WL 683782 (ampoule sealer), 729.687-010, 1991 WL 679733 (assembler of electrical accessories). Accordingly, the omission of a squatting restriction from the RFC assessment was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Nor did the ALJ err in failing to discuss Dr. Barber\u2019s finding that Timmons\u2019s obesity might exacerbate his symptoms. As already discussed, the ALJ considered the medical evidence and Timmons\u2019s own reports of his daily activities and physical abilities. This evidence supported a finding that Timmons could perform light work with a sit/stand option despite any effect his obesity had on his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Finally, Timmons takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s decision to give great weight to Dr. Kirmani\u2019s opinion that Timmons was able to make personal and social adjustments and to understand, remember, and carry out instructions. Timmons contends that Dr. Kirmani\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with other evidence in the record that Timmons had significant mental problems despite continuing treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to give Dr. Kirmani\u2019s opinion great weight. Although the record contains evidence of Timmons\u2019s difficulties with social functioning, Timmons himself reported to Dr. Kirmani that he got along with family, friends, neighbors, store clerks, and doctors. At the hearing, Tim-mons testified that he helped his parents with housework and yard work, that he mowed several neighbors\u2019 lawns for money, and that he could do a simple job if he had transportation. The treatment notes from Act Corporation and from Dr. Barber\u2019s examination indicated that Timmons was cooperative and communicated well. Another consulting psychologist, Dr. Michael Zelenka, reviewed the record and opined that Timmons was not significantly limited in his ability to, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) understand, remember, and follow simple and detailed instructions; (2) accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors; and (3) get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes. Dr. Zelenka opined that \u201cgiven some allowances for occasional prob[lem]s with [attention] and [concentration] and for occasional psychological] problems affecting productivity, and given limited public contact, [claimant] retains adequate mental ability to carry out instructions] and to relate adequately to others in a routine work setting.\u201d In other words, as the ALJ explained, Dr. Kirmani\u2019s opinion that Timmons could make personal and social adjustments and could understand, remember, and follow instructions is consistent with other evidence in the record. Thus, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to give great weight to Dr. Kirmani\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">IV. LIMITATIONS IN CONCENTRATION, PERSISTENCE, AND PACE</p>\n<p id=\"ANf\">Timmons contends that the ALJ failed to adequately reflect Timmons\u2019s limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace in her RFC assessment and in the hypothetical question she posed to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">At the fifth step, the Commissioner bears the burden to show that, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC and other factors, there exist in the national economy a significant number of jobs the claimant can perform. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(V), 416.920(a)(4)(V). If such jobs exist, then the claimant is not disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), 416.920(a). An ALJ may make this determination by posing hypothetical questions to the VE. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">For the VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question need not include \u201ceach and every symptom of the claimant,\u201d but must include \u201call of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1270. An ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question restricting the claimant to simple and routine tasks adequately accounts for restrictions related to concentration, persistence, and pace where the medical evidence demonstrates that the claimant retains the ability to perform the tasks despite limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace. <em>See Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180 (\u201c[W]hen medical evidence demonstrates that a claimant can engage in simple, routine tasks or unskilled work despite limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace, courts have concluded that limiting the hypothetical to include only unskilled work sufficiently accounts for such limitations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">In this case, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question adequately accounted for Tim-mons\u2019s moderate limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace. The ALJ asked the VE to assume the individual had the ability to do light work with a sit/stand option, but that the \u201cjob should be simple, one-two step task, there should be only occasional contact with the public, coworkers, and supervisors.\u201d The VE identified the three jobs of leaf tier, ampoule sealer, and electronic parts assembler. In response to follow-up questions, the VE explained that these three jobs were not assembly line jobs on a conveyor belt, but instead could be performed at a work station.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Notably, both non-examining, consulting psychologists, Dr. Zelenka and Dr. Lau-riann Sandrik, concluded that despite moderate limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace, Timmons could: (1) understand, remember and carry out both short and simple and detailed instructions; (2) perform activities within a schedule, maintain regular attendance, and be punctual within customary tolerances; (3) sustain an ordinary routine without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>special supervision; (4) work in coordination with or in proximity to others without being distracted by them; and (5) make simple work-related decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Dr. Sandrik further stated that Tim-mons \u201cappears mentally capable of completing simple and complex tasks within an appropriate time frame.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Zelenka stated that, with allowances for occasional problems with concentration and attention and occasional psychological problems affecting productivity, Timmons had the mental ability to carry out instructions in a routine work setting. Dr. Kir-mani, who examined Timmons, likewise found that Timmons could understand, remember, and carry out instructions. In light of this supporting medical evidence, the ALJ\u2019s restriction to simple, one- and two-step instructions in her hypothetical question sufficiently accounted for Tim-mons\u2019s limitations in concentration, persistence, and pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying Tim-mons disability and supplemental security benefits is supported by substantial evidence. We also find no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Timmons\u2019s request to remand his case to the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-7\">. As part of the determination whether a mental impairment meets or equals a listed impairment, the ALJ uses a \"special technique\u201d to evaluate the severity of mental impairments in four areas: (1) activities of daily living; (2) social functioning; (3) concentration, persistence, or pace; and (4) episodes of decompensation. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app\u2019x 1 \u00a7 12.001; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520a(c)(3), 416.920a(c)(3). To meet or equal a listed impairment, the claimant must, among other things, have two of the following: (1) marked limitation of activities of daily living; (2) marked limitation in maintaining social functioning; (3) marked limitation in concentration, persistence or pace; and (4) repeated episodes of decompensation of extended duration, which means either three episodes within one year or an average of one every four months, each lasting for at least two weeks. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app'x 1, \u00a7 12.00C. In Timmons's case, the ALJ found that Timmons did not meet any of the four criteria and thus did not have a listed mental impairment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-10\">.
