We DENY his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-22\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b241-23\">Pfluger, formerly a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army National Guard, was charged by indictment with conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, two counts of accepting illegal gratuities as a public official in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c)(1)(B), and conversion of property as an officer of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 654. These charges stemmed from a series of incidents that occurred while Pfluger was called to active duty and deployed in Iraq, serving at Forward Operating Base Ridgeway (\u201cFOB Ridgeway\u201d) in Anbar Province. Pfluger was accused of having accepted money, jewelry, and other gifts from Iraqi nationals in return for performing various official acts, including helping them obtain lucrative contracts and issuing them weapons permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-24\">Pfluger moved to dismiss all the charges against him, alleging that they violated an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>applicable statute of limitations. The district court denied this motion. Pfluger then pled guilty to all four counts pursuant to a conditional plea agreement, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss and any offense-level increase imposed at sentencing on the basis of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.2(b)(3) (\u201cIf the offense involved ... any public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive position, increase by 4 levels.\u201d). He waived all other rights to appeal or to challenge his conviction or sentence in postconviction proceedings, including those under \u00a7 2255. The district court accepted Pfluger\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, a term of supervised release, and restitution. Pfluger appealed to this court, challenging the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. We affirmed, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari on Pfluger\u2019s petition. <em>United States v. Pfluger, </em>685 F.3d 481, 481-82 (5th Cir.2012), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1279, 185 L.Ed.2d 186 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Pfluger retained new counsel and filed a \u00a7 2255 petition for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. He then moved for a stay of the district court\u2019s order that he report to the Bureau of Prisons for imprisonment. The district court denied his motion, and Pfluger began serving his sentence. Pfluger then moved for bail pending resolution of his \u00a7 2255 petition. The district court denied this motion, and Pfluger now moves this court pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 9.2 for release pending appeal from a judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Bail is warranted \u201cpending postconviction habeas corpus review only when the petitioner has raised substantial constitutional claims upon which he has a high probability of success, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.\u201d <em>Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court has yet to determine whether to hold an evidentiary hearing into Pfluger\u2019s habeas claims, and as a result we decline to address whether Pfluger has demonstrated a high probability of success on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>See United States v. Bishop, </em>No. 12-20084, 2012 WL 3205453, at *2 (5th Cir. Aug. 7, 2012) (\u201cWe cannot assess the probability of success of her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel until the district court holds an evidentiary hearing.\u201d). Regardless, Pfluger has failed to show the requisite extraordinary or exceptional circumstances to warrant post-conviction bail. <em>Cf. Johnston v. Marsh, </em>227 F.2d 528, 530 (3d Cir.1955) (declining to revoke bail ordered by a district court to a petitioner with a chronic condition who was \u201crapidly progressing toward total blindness\u201d as a result of conditions of his confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Pfluger\u2019s motion for release is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. <em>Calley </em>involved a habeas petitioner whose underlying conviction was in the military court system. <em>See Calley, </em>496 F.2d at 701. However, we drew the legal standard in <em>Calley </em>from the Supreme Court's denial of an application for bail in <em>Aronson v. May, </em>which involved a civilian challenging his convictions in federal district court. <em>See Aronson v. May, </em>85 S.Ct. 3, 13 L.Ed.2d 6 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Pfluger challenges the applicability of the <em>Calley </em>standard as it predated Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23. Rule 23 governs the transfer of custody pending review of a decision in a habeas action and detention or release of a prisoner pending review of such a decision. Fed. R.App. P. 23(a), (b), (c). It does not apply where, as here, a prisoner requests release prior to a decision in his habeas action. Pfluger\u2019s argument is therefore unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
