Mr. Bailey argues that the district court erred in determining that he had three qualifying prior convictions under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Mr. Bailey was arrested after law enforcement officers executed a search warrant in his residence and seized various items, including a firearm, ammunition, trace amounts of cocaine, a plastic bag containing 8.3 grams of cocaine, a plastic bag containing marijuana, cash, and drug paraphernalia. <em>See </em>Presentence Investigation Report \u00b6 14. Prior to committing the instant offense, Mr. Bailey had been convicted in state court for (1) sale or delivery of a controlled substance and for possessing a controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver (Case No. 90-4199); (2) sale or delivery of a controlled substance (Case No. 93-30897); (3) trafficking in 28-200 grams of cocaine (Case No. 02-31522); and (4) resisting an officer with violence to his person (Case No. 91-5074). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 38. Based on these convictions, the probation office recommended that the district court sentence Mr. Bailey as an armed career criminal pursuant to the ACCA. Mr. Bailey objected, arguing that the convictions were not qualifying predicate convictions. The district court overruled the objections and sentenced Mr. Bailey to the statutory minimum term of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The ACCA imposes a mandatory sentence of at least 15 years in prison for any felon who possesses a firearm or ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), if he \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d means any felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another ... or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d includes a state offense \u201cinvolving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In determining whether a conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for ACCA purposes, courts generally apply a categorical approach, looking no further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the offense. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1336 (11th Cir.2010). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d pursuant to the ACCA. <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Mr. Bailey argues that the narcotics convictions in Case Nos. 90-4199 and 93-30897 did not qualify as \u201cserious drug of-fensefs]\u201d because at the time he committed those offenses the statute of conviction, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13, applied to offenses that involved the sale, manufacture, or delivery of a controlled substance <em>and </em>to offenses that involved the mere purchase of a controlled substance. Relying on one of our prior cases, he argues that the judgments for those convictions did not resolve the ambiguity because \u201csale or delivery\u201d is a \u201cterm of art as it relates to that statute,\u201d and does not rule out the possibility that he was convicted of purchasing a controlled substance, which would not qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In <em>Hernandez </em>we held that the district court erroneously determined that Mr. Hernandez\u2019s prior conviction under the same statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> qualified him for a sentence enhancement as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1440.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We ruled that the district court had erred by consulting arrest affidavits to characterize the predicate offenses, emphasizing that the district court\u2019s \u201cinquiry in resolving the ambiguity of the [ ] convictions should ... be limited to examining easily produced and evaluated court documents, such as any helpful plea agreements or plea transcripts, any presentenc-ing reports adopted by the sentencing judges, and any findings made by the sentencing judges.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We agree with the district court in this case that it is \u201cclear on the face of the judgment[s]\u201d that Mr. Bailey was convicted of sale or delivery, although the statute at the time encompassed purchase as well. <em>See </em>Judgment in Case No. 90-4199, Govt\u2019s Ex. 1 (reflecting conviction for \u201cUni. Sale/Deliv. Cont. Subst.\u201d); Judgment in Case No. 93-30897, Govt\u2019s Ex. 2 (reflecting conviction for \u201cSale or Delivery of a Controlled Substance\u201d). In <em>Hernandez, </em>the language in Mr. Hernandez\u2019s state court judgments tracked the language in the statute and thus did not indicate whether the convictions were for the purchase of the controlled substances or for the sale of the controlled substances. Here, however, both judgments state \u201csale or delivery,\u201d with no mention of \u201cpurchase,\u201d and thus establish that Mr. Bailey\u2019s convictions\u2014for sale or delivery of a controlled substance and for possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell or deliver\u2014are serious drug offenses under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Mr. Bailey also argues that his conviction for trafficking in 28-200 grams of cocaine in Case No. 02-31522 did not qualify as a serious drug offense. Mr. Bailey acknowledges that he raised this objection solely to preserve it for further review \u201cbecause there is a conflict in the circuits.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14 (citing <em>United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186 (4th Cir.2001)). As Mr. Bailey recognizes, his argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See James, </em>430 F.3d at 1155 (holding that a violation of Florida\u2019s drug trafficking statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.135, constitutes an ACCA predicate offense because the \u201cstatute necessarily infers an intent to distribute [cocaine] once a defendant possesses 28 grams or more\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Finally, Mr. Bailey\u2019s argument that his conviction for resisting an officer with violence to his person in Case No. 91-5074 does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is also foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that a Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. The 1993 version of the statute at issue in <em>Hernandez </em>made it \"unlawful for any person to sell, purchase, manufacture, deliver, or possess with the intent to sell a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d at 1440.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a \"defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
