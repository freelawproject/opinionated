Crawford, a federal prisoner convicted of a crack cocaine offense, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction. Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendments 706 and 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 750. The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, due to Crawford\u2019s status as a career offender, Amendment 750 had no effect on his applicable guidelines range. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). As such, when a crack cocaine defendant is sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than under \u00a7 2D1.1(c)\u2019s drug quantity table, the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on amendments to the crack cocaine offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1(c) because the amendments did not lower the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Crawford\u2019s sentencing range of 360 months to life remains the same even after Amendments 706 and 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-16\">At his sentencing, Crawford was held accountable for 5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Using the drug quantity table, Crawford\u2019s base offense level was 40 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(2) (1991). However, Crawford was designated a career offender. Under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Crawford\u2019s base offense level was 37 and his criminal history category was VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(A) (1991). Following \u00a7 4B1.1\u2019s instructions, the district court applied the <em>greater </em>offense level \u2014 level 40 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) \u2014 with the criminal history category of VI, resulting in a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (1991). The district court ultimately imposed a 420-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Had Amendments 706 and 750 been in effect at Crawford\u2019s original sentencing, his base offense level (for 5 kilograms of cocaine base) would have been 36, instead of 40. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c)(2) (2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, because Crawford is a career offender, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court would have applied the greater offense level, which would have been the career offender offense level of 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1). An offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI yields a guidelines range of 360 months to life, the same range that actually applied at Crawford\u2019s original sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, ch. 5, pt. A. Thus, Amendments 705 and 750 did not lower Crawford\u2019s sentencing range, and, under our precedent in <em>Moore, </em>the district court lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Crawford\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-10\">. The record does not support Crawford's claim that his total offense level would be 35 because of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. At his original sentencing, the district court denied Crawford\u2019s request for an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. To the extent Crawford argues he now is entitled to such a reduction, that argument is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (instructing district court to substitute only the amended guidelines provision and \"leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\u201d); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not grant the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
