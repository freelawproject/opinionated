Douglas pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute approximately 14.2 grams of cocaine base. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The presentence investigation report (PSI) classified Douglas as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a), which resulted in a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court accepted those Guidelines calculations at sentencing. The Government filed a motion for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, based on Douglas\u2019s substantial assistance. The court granted the motion in part, noting that Douglas had three prior drug convictions and needed to be punished for his repeated conduct. The court sentenced him to 128 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively with a 16-month sentence for a related revocation of a prior term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Douglas asserts that, because he received a downward departure, he was not sentenced as a career offender, and that his original base offense level was controlling for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) purposes. He asserts the district court should have ordered a new PSI, and should have considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in ruling on his motion to account for his mitigating post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">A district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment unless the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements if it is based on an amendment that does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">When a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, the sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines ranges applicable to career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, not the levels set forth in \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. In <em>Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 750, lowered the base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine under \u00a7 2D1.1(c). <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325-27. We held the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their Guidelines ranges, which were calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30. We recently reaffirmed <em>Moore, </em>and held that a defendant who was convicted of a crack cocaine offense but sentenced as a career offender remains ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under Amendment 750. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The record shows that Douglas was sentenced as a career offender. Although he received a downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance, this departure did not alter the court\u2019s determination that Douglas was a career offender. Because Amendment 750 did not change his Guidelines range, a new PSI would not have changed his Guidelines range, and the court could not consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including any post-sentencing conduct. Thus, Douglas was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction in sentence, and the district court did not err in denying Douglas\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
