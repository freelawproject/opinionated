Billingsley, Joyce White Vance, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Birmingham, AL, Terrence Murphy O\u2019Rourke, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Huntsville, AL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b918-13\">Sigfredo Rubio, Rubio Law Firm, PC Birmingham, AL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b918-15\">Before MARCUS, WILSON and FAY, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b918-16\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b918-17\">Ana Anastacio appeals her <em>48-mo </em>nth sentence for fraudulent use of an immigration document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a) (Count 1), and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A (Count 2). Anastacio pleaded guilty to both counts, and the district court imposed two 24-month sentences, to run consecutively, for each count. Despite being given an opportunity to do so by the district court, Anastacio did not object to her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-18\">On appeal, Anastacio argues that her total sentence was procedurally unreasonable, and that the district court committed plain error when it failed to provide specific reasons and a meaningful explanation for the sentence imposed. She also argues that the district court committed plain error by imposing an 18-month upward variance from the applicable guideline range for Count 1, which was substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Upon review of the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We normally review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, where an appellant failed to object to her sentence in the district court below, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>694 F.3d 1192, 1195 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Hoffman-Vaile, </em>568 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record. <em>United States v. De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F.3d 1202, 1223 (11th Cir.2010). First, we must determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2375, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2012). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculated the guideline range, treated the guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory, failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F.3d at 1223. Although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the factors or to discuss each one individually. <em>See United States v. McNair, </em>605 F.3d 1152, 1231 (11th Cir.2010). The district court must adequately explain the chosen sentence, and in doing so \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">If we find that the sentence is procedurally reasonable, we must then determine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances, including whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors actually support the sentence at issue. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1203-04 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1066, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012). The weight given to any particular factor under \u00a7 3553(a) is left to the sound discretion of the district court, absent a clear error of judgment, <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc), and we generally do not second-guess the weight that the district court gave to any one factor. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010). We will only reverse a sentence as substantively unreasonable if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). The reasonableness of a sentence may also be indicated where the sentence imposed is well below the statutory maximum sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Anastacio\u2019s total 48-month sentence was procedurally reasonable. While she contends that the district court failed to provide specific reasons for the sentence imposed, the record proves otherwise: the district court explicitly considered the nature and circumstances of the offenses, the seriousness of the offenses, the suffering and loss inflicted upon Anastacio\u2019s victim, and the need for the sentence to reflect those considerations and promote respect for the law. Accordingly, the district court exhibited <em>\u201ca </em>reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority,\u201d <em>Agbai, </em>497 F.3d at 1230 (internal quotation marks omitted), and therefore did not plainly err in determining Anastacio\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Anastacio\u2019s 24-month sentence as to Count 1 was also substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Anastacio argues that the district court gave undue weight to the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense,\u201d and that several of the other \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors weighed in favor of a lesser sentence. However, the weight given to any particular factor is left to the sound discretion of the district court, absent a clear error of judgment. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190. The record shows that Anastacio used the victim\u2019s identity to obtain employment, to acquire an Indiana non-driver identification card, and to open mobile phone and satellite dish network accounts. As a result of Anastacio\u2019s illegal actions, the victim incurred unauthorized debts that adversely affected her credit score, was unable to meet her mortgage obligations and lost her home to foreclosure, was unable to obtain unemployment benefits, and was assessed additional tax liability from 2007 to 2010 for unreported income. Based on these facts, the district court appropriately considered Anastacio\u2019s conduct, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the seriousness of the offense under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2). Moreover, while Anastacio\u2019s 24-month sentence for Count 1 exceeded the applicable guideline range of 0 to 6 months, it was well below the statutory maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a). Thus, the district court did not plainly err in imposing an 18-month upward variance in Anastacio\u2019s sentence for Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
