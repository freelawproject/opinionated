Nationwide asked the court to declare that it had no duty to defend in a suit filed by James Coman, individually and as father and next friend of his minor son, A.J., against Creation\u2019s Own, one of its doctors, Daniel Rossignol, M.D., and others. The Coman suit alleged tortious actions by these defendants in treating A.J.\u2019s autism. The district court found that all eight counts alleged against the Creation\u2019s Own and Dr. Rossignol were claims based on the providing of medical services. Thus, coverage was excluded under the policy\u2019s \u201cprofessional services exclusion\u201d which \u201celiminates Nationwide\u2019s duty to defend suits seeking damages for bodily injury \u2018due to rendering or failure to render any professional service,\u2019 including medical or health treatment, advice, or instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Creation\u2019s Own presents no argument on appeal challenging the merits of this determination. Rather, it argues that the \u201cprecise exclusionary language upon which [Nationwide] attempts to rely as a basis for avoiding coverage\u201d came from a \u201cDruggist\u2019s Liability Exclusion\u201d that was not in the documents submitted with the complaint for two of the three policies covering the time period in question. Creation\u2019s Own argues it is entitled to relief because this unattached amendment, which \u201cserved as the entire basis of the trial court\u2019s Order,\u201d modified an earlier exclusion for \u201c[s]ervices in the practice of pharmacy\u201d that provided an exception for an \u201cinsured whose operations include those of a retail druggist or drugstore.\u201d Creation\u2019s Own argues that because it \u201cdid ... operate as a \u2018retail druggist\u2019 or \u2018drug store,\u2019 \u201d it falls into the exception to the pharmacy services exclusion and therefore is entitled to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">We affirm because Creation\u2019s Own has done nothing to challenge the district court\u2019s assessment that the injuries alleged were due to the providing of professional medical services. Neither did it provide any basis for disputing the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>finding that \u201cinjury due to the rendering of professional medical services is excluded from coverage under the Policy.\u201d We decline to consider issues not briefed on appeal and they are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Again, Creation\u2019s Own offered nothing to contradict the district court\u2019s findings, and has in no way meaningfully challenged the district court\u2019s opinion. The discussion of the \u201cDruggist\u2019s Liability Exclusion\u201d was not \u201cthe entire basis of the trial court\u2019s Order.\u201d To the contrary, this exclusion has no relevance to this appeal. The lack of relevance of the Druggist\u2019s Liability Exclusion is demonstrated by Creation\u2019s Own\u2019s reply brief, which did \u201cnot take issue\u201d with Nationwide\u2019s assertion that \u201cneither [Rossignol] nor [Creation\u2019s Own] provide pharmacy services.\u201d Because Creation\u2019s Own\u2019s alleged liability is not due to \u201cservices in the practice of pharmacy,\u201d the Druggist\u2019s Liability Exclusion offers no relief to Creation\u2019s Own from the judgment entered by the District Court in favor of Nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
