On appeal, Caloosa contends the district court erred in (1) concluding the \u201chorse and horse drawn units\u201d exclusion unambiguously precluded coverage for the suit, and (2) declining to reform the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Capitol issued liability insurance to Caloosa for the policy period of December 30, 2008, through December 30, 2009 (Policy). Under the Policy, Capitol agreed to defend and indemnify Caloosa for claims arising from personal injuries that occurred as a result of Caloosa\u2019s alleged negligence or other wrongful conduct. The Policy contained several exclusions, including a \u201chorse and horse drawn units\u201d exclusion. That exclusion states, in pertinent part, that the \u201cinsurance does not apply to any <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage </em>arising out of the use or operation of any horses or horse-drawn apparatus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">On or about August 29, 2009, John Free-land was injured after he fell off a horse inside a riding ring in a Caloosa common area. Freeland subsequently sued Caloo-sa, alleging several instances of negligence related to the design and maintenance of the riding ring. Caloosa tendered the defense and indemnification of the lawsuit to Capitol, but Capitol asserted that the claims were excluded from coverage under the \u201chorse and horse drawn units\u201d exclusion. Thus, Capitol refused to defend and indemnify Caloosa in the lawsuit. Caloosa subsequently filed this action seeking de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>claratory relief and reformation of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing \u201call evidence and reasonable factual inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable\u201d to the nonmoving party. <em>Turnes v. AmSouth Bank, NA, </em>36 F.3d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\n<em>\u201cHorse or horse drawn units\u201d exclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Caloosa contends the \u201carising out of the use or operation of any horses or horse-drawn apparatus\u201d language is ambiguous and must be construed in favor of coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Caloosa claims the injury did not \u201carise out of the \u2018use or operation of \u201d a horse, but rather, arose out of the defective riding ring, \u201cwhich caused injury to a person who happened to be on a horse.\u201d Caloosa also contends Freeland was injured by \u201criding\u201d a horse, rather than \u201cusing\u201d a horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Under Florida law, when construing an insurance contract to determine whether an exclusion applies, a court must interpret the policy according to its \u201cplain meaning, with any ambiguities construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Amerisure Mut. Ins. Co. v. Auchter Co., </em>673 F.3d 1294, 1301 (11th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The term \u201carising out of\u2019 is not ambiguous, and has been construed broadly by Florida courts to mean \u201coriginating from,\u201d \u201cincident to,\u201d or \u201chaving a connection with.\u201d <em>Taurus Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., </em>913 So.2d 528, 539 (Fla.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">The district court did not err in concluding the \u201chorse and horse drawn units\u201d exclusion unambiguously precluded coverage of Freeman\u2019s suit. The language plainly excludes coverage for accidents \u201carising out of the use or operation of any horse.\u201d Here, Freeman\u2019s lawsuit was based on injuries he sustained after being thrown off a horse. Thus, his injury was \u201cincident to\u201d his \u201cuse\u201d of a horse. Caloo-sa\u2019s argument that Freeman was not \u201cusing\u201d a horse, but rather \u201criding\u201d one is meritless. Just as people \u201cuse\u201d cars by driving them or riding in them, Freeman was \u201cusing\u201d the horse by riding it. <em>See, e.g., Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. McCaul, </em>949 So.2d 1137, 1138-39 (Fla. 3d DCA 2007) (finding that a passenger riding in a vehicle fell within a policy exclusion for \u201cuse\u201d of a car). Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding the plain language of the Policy excused Capitol from indemnifying and defending Ca-loosa in the Freeman lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">\n<em>Reformation of the Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">Alternatively, Caloosa asks us to reform the Policy based on a mutual mistake, or a unilateral mistake coupled with inequitable conduct. However, Caloosa\u2019s sole allegation of mutual mistake is \u201cLANDMARK\u2019S failure to procure coverage for the type of claims such as those set forth in the Underlying Lawsuit, and CA-LOOSA\u2019S failure to obtain that coverage.\u201d Because Landmark was Caloosa\u2019s agent, Caloosa\u2019s allegations only establish that, at most, Caloosa made a mistake in dealing with its own agent. Moreover, Caloosa never alleged a unilateral mistake by Capitol, nor has Caloosa identified any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of inequitable conduct on Capitol\u2019s part. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Capitol on Caloosa\u2019s reformation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\">. Caloosa also contends the \"horse and horse drawn units\u201d exclusion was outside the terms of the contract and impermissible because it was not referred to in the quote or insurance binder. The district court declined to consider this claim because it was not pled in the complaint; rather, Caloosa only asked for declaratory relief and reformation based on the Policy itself. We likewise decline to consider this unpled claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-9\">. Caloosa repeatedly references a \"rider of saddle animals\" exclusion in an attempt to create a latent ambiguity. This exclusion was not included in the Policy and does not create an ambiguity in the clear and unambiguous language of the \"horse and horse drawn units\u201d exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
