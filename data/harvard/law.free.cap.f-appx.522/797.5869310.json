Construing Driessen\u2019s complaint liberally, she alleges that the Juvenile Division violated her due process rights by failing to provide her with notice of a 2007 hearing terminating her parental rights and placing her children in a permanent guardianship, and by later failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>terminate jurisdiction over her children. On appeal, Driessen argues that the district court erred in dismissing her case for frivolousness on the ground that it was barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We take judicial notice that the Circuit Court for the Eleventh Judicial District of Florida is part of Florida\u2019s state court system. Title V of the Florida Constitution, entitled \u201cJudicial Branch,\u201d provides in \u00a7 25.382, \u201cState Courts System,\u201d that (1) As used in this section, \u201cstate courts system\u201d means all officers, employees, and divisions of the Supreme Court, district courts of appeal, circuit courts, and county courts. The \u201cJuvenile Division,\u201d is one of the Circuit Court\u2019s divisions, like the \u201cCivil Division,\u201d and \u201cCriminal Division,\u201d and is presided over by one or more Circuit Judges. Because the court is part of the state court system, it is entitled to sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
