Roebuck Auctions (\u201cRoebuck Auctions\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Kenneth Everett. After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendant Everett as well as the district court\u2019s order finding Everett was entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">On December 1, 2011, Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions conducted an auction of 16 unfinished condominium units, fixtures, and building materials in Panama City Beach, Florida. John Roebuck, the owner of Roebuck Auctions, served as the auctioneer.</p>\n<p id=\"AMPd\">Defendant Everett arrived at the auction site, completed his registration materials (which included signing certain documents), and received his bid card. Among the materials Everett signed was a bidder identification stub, which notified Everett that the auction company would charge a ten percent bidder\u2019s premium to the high bidder. The stub also stated that if the bidder defaulted on the agreement, the bidder would \u201cagree to pay all legal fees and damages incurred by Auctioneer as a result of [bidder\u2019s] default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The auction commenced, and Everett ultimately placed the high bid: $47,000 per condominium unit, for a total of $752,000, with an additional $75,200 for the bidder\u2019s premium of ten percent. It is undisputed that despite placing the high bid, Everett never closed on his purchase of the condominium units, citing the units\u2019 legal and financial problems as the basis for his decision to cancel the transaction. Everett also failed to pay the ten percent bidder\u2019s premium, despite Roebuck Auctions\u2019s demand for payment. This lawsuit is only about the payment of the bidder\u2019s premium on a sale of auctioned property that never closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"ASG\">A. Initial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">In February 2012, Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions sued Defendant Everett in Florida state court for breach of contract based on Everett\u2019s failure to pay the $75,200 bidder\u2019s premium. Roebuck Auctions sought a judgment against Everett in the amount of $75,200, plus interest, costs, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Defendant Everett subsequently removed the action to federal district court and filed a motion to dismiss Roebuck Auctions\u2019s complaint. In his motion to dismiss, Everett contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that Roebuck Auctions had not adequately stated a prima facie claim for relief because it had not alleged that it was a \u201clicensed auction business,\u201d pursuant to Florida Statute \u00a7 468.385(7)(b), or that it was \u201cotherwise exempt from licensure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">Roebuck Auctions then filed an amended complaint that addressed the grounds raised in Everett\u2019s motion to dismiss. As relevant to the issues on appeal, the amended complaint alleged that John Roebuck, the owner and sole managing member of Roebuck Auctions, was a licensed auctioneer and real estate broker under Florida law. The amended complaint contained no allegations addressing Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions\u2019s licensure status. As attachments to the amended complaint, Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions filed Internet printouts from an official State of Florida website showing John Roebuck\u2019s status as a licensed auctioneer and real estate broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">In his answer to the amended complaint, Defendant Everett reasserted as his \u201cSecond Affirmative Defense\u201d that Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Roebuck Auctions \u201cha[d] failed to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted because it failed to allege that it was licensed to perform the auction at issue in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">B. Summary Judgment Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Following discovery, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. Defendant Everett contended that in light of the undisputed material facts, he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on two grounds: (1) Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions was not a party to the document upon which it relied for its claim; and (2) even if Roebuck Auctions had standing to pursue its breach of contract claim, it could not collect a bidders\u2019 premium in this case because the owner of the auctioned property and Everett never entered into a valid and enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In its motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions likewise contended that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on Everett\u2019s undisputed placement of the high bid (after signing the Bidder Agreement and bid card that identified Roebuck Auctions as the auction company and hearing pre-auction announcements about the auctions terms and conditions) and subsequent failure to pay the bidder\u2019s premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Roebuck Auctions\u2019s own motion for summary judgment then addressed Everett\u2019s asserted affirmative defenses and the grounds for summary judgment alleged in Everett\u2019s motion. Specifically, Roebuck Auctions\u2019s motion addressed Everett\u2019s \u201cSecond Affirmative Defense,\u201d which was that Roebuck Auctions \u201cfailed to allege it was licensed to perform the auction at issue in the complaint.\u201d Roebuck Auctions argued John Roebuck being a licensed auctioneer was sufficient, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">It is undisputed that John Roebuck, the auctioneer who conducted the subject auction, was and is a duly licensed auctioneer pursuant to Chapter 468, Florida Statutes. There is no legal requirement that Roebuck \u201cregister\u201d his license to Roebuck Auctions in the manner of a real estate broker. Chapter 468 provides that auctioneers be individuals\u2014 there is no way for a fictitious business entity to be a licensed auctioneer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">The statute defines an \u201cAuction Business\u201d as a sole proprietorship or business entity that \u201cemploys auctioneers to conduct auctions.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 468.382(1). Section 468.385(2) &amp; (3), Florida Statutes, which sets forth the requirements for licensure, provides that no one may conduct an auction \u201cunless he or she is licensed\u201d and that one can\u2019t be licensed if \u201che or she\u201d is under 18 years of age or has committed any prohibiting act or offense. In sum, a licensed auctioneer must be an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3L\">Roebuck Auctions also filed a separate response to Everett\u2019s motion for summary judgment, but this response did not address the \u201cSecond Affirmative Defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">In his response to Roebuck Auctions\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Everett noted that Roebuck Auctions did \u201cnot dispute that it [was] not a licensed auction business.\u201d Everett further noted that Florida law provides for three separate types of auction-related licenses \u2014 for auctioneers, apprentices, and auction businesses \u2014 and the law further requires that <em>\u201c[e]ach auction </em>... be conducted under the auspices of a <em>licensed auction business.\u201d </em>Everett thus contended that Roebuck Auctions, \u201c[h]aving failed to establish that it maintained the required license,\u201d was \u201cprecluded from recovering any monies\u201d from him because \u201can unlicensed entity may not benefit as a result of its wrongdoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">Roebuck Auctions did not reply, or request leave from the district court to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>reply, to Everett\u2019s response to its motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The district court granted Everett\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Roebuck Auctions\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Summarizing the relevant statutes, the district court noted that Florida law separately defines \u201cauctioneer\u201d and \u201cauction business\u201d and requires both entities to be licensed: an auctioneer must be licensed in order to actually perform an auction, and the auction business under whose auspices the auction is held must also be licensed. In addition, under Florida Statute \u00a7 468.385(8), a license issued by the state \u201cto an auctioneer, apprentice, or auction business is not transferable.\u201d Thus, the district court concluded that in light of these relevant statutory provisions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACE\">[i]t is undisputed in this case that John Roebuck was a licensed auctioneer. However, it is also undisputed that High Bid, LLC, d/b/a Roebuck Auctions was not a licensed auction business. Plaintiffs argument that \u201cChapter 468 provides that auctioneers be individuals\u2014 there is no way for a fictitious business entity to be a licensed auctioneer\u201d is true in that the business itself can\u2019t be the auctioneer \u2014 obviously an auctioneer must be a person. The statute, however, makes it clear that the business must be licensed for auctions to be conducted under its name by a licensed auctioneer. Because Plaintiff is unlicensed, it cannot benefit from its wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">(citation omitted). In other words, the district court concluded that the agreement in the bidder identification stub that obliged Everett to pay the ten percent bidder\u2019s premium was unenforceable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court then entered judgment in Defendant Everett\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">C. Roebuck Auctions\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions then filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Roebuck Auctions raised two grounds in support of its motion: first, that the district court did not give Roebuck Auctions notice and a reasonable time to respond prior to granting summary judgment in Everett\u2019s favor on an issue not raised in Everett\u2019s motion for summary judgment, an issue \u201conly addressed preemptively by Roebuck [Auctions] with less than complete knowledge of the true basis for Everett\u2019s contention.\u201d Second, Roebuck Auctions admitted that it was not a licensed auction business, but argued that Florida Statute \u00a7 468.383(7) explicitly exempts auctions performed \u201cas a part of the sale of real property by a real estate broker\u201d from any auction licensure requirements. Because John Roebuck was a licensed real estate broker, and the auction at issue here was for the sale of real property, Roebuck Auctions contended that it was not required to obtain an auction business license.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">After Defendant Everett filed a response, and Roebuck Auctions (after obtaining permission from the district court) filed a reply, the district court denied Roebuck Auctions\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration. The district court concluded that Roebuck Auctions bore the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>of negating Everett\u2019s affirmative defense of non-licensure, and that Roebuck Auctions had clearly attempted to do so in its motion for summary judgment. However, Roebuck Auctions did not, at any time prior to filing its Rule 59(e) motion, argue that it was exempt from licensure; instead, Roebuck Auctions wrongly relied on John Roebuck\u2019s personal auctioneer license to attempt to negate Everett\u2019s affirmative defense. The district court refused to provide Roebuck Auctions with a \u201csecond bite at the apple\u201d when it could have raised its exemption argument during the summary judgment phase but failed to do so. Accordingly, the district court denied Roebuck Auctions\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">D. Attorney\u2019s Fees Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Following the entry of summary judgment in his favor, Defendant Everett moved for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.105(7), contending that (1) the bidder identification stub that Everett signed provided that the auctioneer, Roebuck Auctions, was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the event of a contractual breach; (2) Roebuck Auctions had sought to recover attorney\u2019s fees as part of its damages in this case; (3) Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.105(7) permits one-sided contractual attorney\u2019s fee provisions to apply to both parties to the contract; and (4) Everett was therefore entitled to an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Roebuck Auctions responded to Everett\u2019s motion by noting that in granting summary judgment to Everett, the district court effectively found the auction contract unenforceable due to Roebuck Auctions\u2019 non-licensure. In light of the unenforceable auction contract, any provisions contained therein, including the provision providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, was likewise unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The district court granted Everett\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, stating that although the auction contract was unenforceable due to Roebuck Auctions\u2019s \u201cfailure to show that it was properly licensed to conduct the auction, Florida law states that an \u2018innocent party<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> can enforce the contract to recover attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">On January 24, 2013, Roebuck Auctions filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s (1) order granting summary judgment to Everett; (2) order denying Roebuck Auetions\u2019s motion for reconsideration; and (3) order granting Everett entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">A. Summary Judgment &amp; Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards that bound the district court. <em>Whatley v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>189 F.3d 1310, 1313 (11th Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Florida Board of Auctioneers enforce a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating auctions and providing for the licensure of auction businesses and auctioneers. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 468.381-468.399. Under state law, \u201c[n]o person shall auction or offer to auction any property in this state unless he or she is licensed,\u201d and \u201c[n]o business shall auction or offer to auction any property in this state unless it is licensed as an auction business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 468.385(2), (7)(b). Certain auctions are exempt from the statutory requirements governing auctions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>auctioneers, including \u201c[a]uctions conducted as a part of the sale of real property by a real estate broker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 468.383(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Chapter 468 goes on to require that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">[e]ach auction must be conducted by an auctioneer who has an active license or by an apprentice who has an active apprentice auctioneer license and who has received prior written sponsor consent. <em>Each auction must be conducted under the auspices of a licensed auction business. </em>Any auctioneer or apprentice auctioneer conducting an auction, and any auction business under whose auspices such auction is held, shall be responsible for determining that any auctioneer, apprentice, or auction business with whom they are associated in conducting such auction has an active Florida auctioneer, apprentice, or auction business license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQq\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 468.388(4) (emphasis added). An \u201cauction business\u201d is defined as \u201ca sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation which in the regular course of business arranges, manages, sponsors, advertises, promotes, or carries out auctions, employs auctioneers to conduct auctions in its facilities, or uses or allows the use of its facilities for auctions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 468.382(1). An \u201cauctioneer\u201d is defined as \u201cany person licensed pursuant to this part who holds a valid Florida auctioneer license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 468.382(2). Additionally, \u201c[a] license issued by the department to an auctioneer, apprentice, or auction business is not transferable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 468.385(8). Thus, the Florida statutory scheme governing auctions requires (1) separate, non-transferable licenses for auctioneers and auction businesses, and (2) that auctions be conducted by a licensed auctioneer \u201cunder the auspices\u201d of a licensed auction business.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Here, we conclude, as did the district court, that Defendant Everett was entitled to summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions was not a licensed auction business, thus rendering the agreement to pay the bidder\u2019s premium unenforceable. To the extent that Roebuck Auctions contends that it was not given fair notice, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), of the district court\u2019s intention to grant summary judgment on this ground, we find this argument lacks merit. Defendant Everett, in his motion to dismiss and amended answer, raised as an affirmative defense the fact that Roebuck Auctions was not a licensed auction business. In its own motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff Roebuck Auctions responded to this affirmative defense and attempted to negate it by relying on John Roebuck\u2019s personal status as a licensed auctioneer. In light of the non-transferability of auctioneer licenses and the statutory requirement that \u201c[e]ach auction ... be conducted under the auspices of a licensed auction business,\u201d however, Roebuck Auctions clearly failed to negate Everett\u2019s affirmative defense. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 468.385(8), 468.388(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Further, in response to Roebuck Auctions\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Everett reasserted his affirmative defense, and Roebuck Auctions, rather than seeking leave of court to file a reply (as permitted by the Local Rules) maintained its reliance on John Roebuck\u2019s personal auctioneer license as sufficient to negate Everett\u2019s affirmative defense. Thus, Roebuck Auctions was on notice of this affirmative defense raised by Everett and had an opportunity to respond to this defense, despite the fact that its response was ultimately insufficient to carry the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Nor was the district court required to grant Roebuck Auctions\u2019 motion for reconsideration. For the first time, Roebuck Auctions\u2019s motion raised the argument that it was exempt from the auction busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ness license requirement because the auction was conducted \u201cas a part of the sale of real property by a real estate broker.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 468.383(7). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration only for an abuse of discretion, and the law in this Circuit is well-settled that a \u201cmotion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis prohibition includes new arguments that were previously available, but not pressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Roebuck Auctions has not identified any reason why it failed to raise the issue of the statutory exemption prior to the entry of judgment in Everett\u2019s favor, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to permit Roebuck Auctions to relitigate, with new argument, the issue on which summary judgment was granted. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cDenial of a motion to amend is especially soundly exercised when a party gives no reason for not previously raising an issue.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">B. Defendant Everett\u2019s Entitlement to Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of state law governing entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Smalbein v. City of Daytona Beach, </em>353 F.3d 901, 904 (11th Cir.2003). In addition, we review the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to grant or deny attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Davis v. Nat\u2019l Med. Enter., Inc., </em>253 F.3d 1314, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2001) (reviewing an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Florida law in a diversity suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Under Florida law, absent a specific statutory or contractual provision, a prevailing litigant has no general entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Dade County v. Pena, </em>664 So.2d 959, 960 (Fla.1995) (\u201c[Attorney\u2019s fees may only be awarded by a court pursuant to an entitling statute or an agreement of the parties.\u201d). Here, the language of the bidder identification stub obligated the bidder, Everett, to pay Roebuck Auctions\u2019s legal fees in the event that Everett breached the auction contract. Florida law permits such one-sided contractual attorney\u2019s fee provisions to be applied reciprocally: \u201c[i]f a contract contains a provision allowing attorney\u2019s fees to a party when [it] is required to take any action to enforce the contract, the court may also allow reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the other party when that party prevails in any action ... with respect to the contract.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 57.105(7). The parties do not contest that the \u201clegal fees\u201d provision in the bidder identification stub falls generally within this statutory language that permits reciprocal recovery, such that Everett could use the provision to obtain an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Roebuck Auctions contends, however, that although Everett was a prevailing party in the underlying suit (inasmuch as he successfully defended against Roebuck Auctions\u2019s suit on the basis of the identification stub\u2019s unenforceability), he is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees precisely because of the stub\u2019s unenforceability. Roebuck Auctions objects to Everett\u2019s attempt to, in effect, have his cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">\u201c[F]or the purpose of determining whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees is proper under a contract\u2019s prevailing party fee provision, \u2018there is a difference between contracts that never came into existence and contracts that exist but are later found to be unenforceable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tarr v. Honea, </em>959 So.2d 780, 781 (Fla. 4th DCA 2007) (quoting <em>Fabing v. Eaton, </em>941 So.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>415, 418 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006)). \u201c[WJhere a motion for attorney\u2019s fees is based on a prevailing-party provision of a document, the fact that a contract never existed precludes an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>David v. Richman, </em>568 So.2d 922, 924 (Fla.1990). However, \u201cwhen litigation ensues in connection with a validly formed contract, attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered under a prevailing-party provision of the contract even though the contract has been rescinded or held to be unenforceable.\u201d Id. Thus, the question before us is whether the auction \u201ccontract\u201d (i.e., as memorialized in the bidder identification stub) at issue (1) never came into existence due to Roebuck Auctions\u2019s non-licensure, or (2) whether the \u201ccontract\u201d was merely unenforceable due to Roebuck Auctions\u2019s non-licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Although Roebuck Auctions\u2019s status as an unlicensed auction business prevented it from enforcing the terms of the bidder identification stub, this does not per se mean that there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d with respect to the formation of a contract. To the contrary, the record reflects that Defendant Everett and Roebuck Auctions did enter into a contract, based on Roebuck Auctions conducting the auction and Everett placing the high bid after signing the bidder identification stub. Their contract\u2019s ultimate unenforceability does not alter the fact that a contract was formed between the parties. See <em>Katz v. Van Der Noord, </em>546 So.2d 1047, 1049 (Fla.1989) (\u201cWhen parties enter into a contract and litigation later ensues over that contract, attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered under a prevailing-party attorney\u2019s fee provision contained therein even though the contract is rescinded or held to be unenforceable. The legal fictions which accompany a judgment of rescission do not change the fact that a contract did exist.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In addition, this case is readily distinguishable from those cases in which Florida courts have concluded that the parties never entered into a contract <em>ex ante, </em>such as in the event of a rescinded offer prior to acceptance, mutual mistake, or a contract governing illegal subject matter that was void under state law. <em>See, e.g., Gibson v. Courtois, </em>589 So.2d 459, 460 (Fla.1989) (where offeror revoked offer prior to acceptance, \u201cno contract came into existence and no legal obligations attached.... Absent mutual assent, neither the contract nor any of its provisions [including an attorney\u2019s fees provision] come into existence.\u201d); <em>Carnival Leisure Indus. Ltd. v. Arviv, </em>655 So.2d 177, 180 (Fla. 3d DCA 1995) (where a state statute rendered \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d contracts governing the repayment of money lent for the purpose of being wagered, the statute likewise \u201cinvalidate^] the nonseverable provision for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Given Florida law in this area, we conclude that Roebuck Auctions has not shown that the district court erred in granting Everett entitlement to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders (1) granting summary judgment to Defendant Everett, and (2) finding Everett was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">.

Fla., Local Rule 7.1(C)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\">. On appeal, the parties do not dispute that the district court in effect found the agreement unenforceable due to Roebuck Auctions\u2019s failure to establish that it was a properly licensed auction business, despite the fact that the district court did not explicitly so state in its summary judgment order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
