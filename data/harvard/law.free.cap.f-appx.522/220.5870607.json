Plaintiff Richard Franklin filed a notice of appeal on July 26, 2012, more than thirty days after the district court\u2019s entry of judgment; it was thus facially untimely. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Franklin tried to file what was liberally construed as a motion to alter or amend the judgment. This motion would have extended Franklin\u2019s time to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). However, the district court struck that motion for violation of the local rules. When Franklin filed it again, the deadline for appeal-extending postjudgment motions had expired. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(c). Franklin\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion therefore did not toll the time for appeal. <em>See Hoffman v. Meckling, </em>139 F.3d 899, 1998 WL 127864, *1 (5th Cir. Mar. 11, 1998) (unpublished) (where district court unfiled and struck appellants\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion for violation of local rules, the motion did not toll the time for appeal, even though the court later granted motion for leave to refile the motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">Franklin seems to argue that the defendants\u2019 April 19, 2012 motion to enjoin him from seeking employment with BNSF Railway Co.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and bringing further lawsuits against BNSF related to his claims in the instant case without prior court permission, extended the time for him to file his notice of appeal because this motion was filed under the same cause number as this case. He contends that since the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to enjoin on July 6, 2012, his notice of appeal was timely. This argument is mer-itless because the defendants\u2019 motion is not one of the six types of motions that can extend the time to file a notice of appeal. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4). Franklin\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed, and thus we lack jurisdiction over this appeal as to the final judgment. <em>Moody Nat. Bank of Galveston v. GE Life &amp; Annuity Assur. Co., </em>383 F.3d 249, 250 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr. of Ill., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>(1978)). Franklin\u2019s notice of appeal, liberally construed, also does not indicate an attempt to appeal the injunction order. We therefore do not have jurisdiction to review the injunction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">This appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-20\">. As defendants note, the correct name for Franklin\u2019s former employer is \"BNSF Railway Co.\u201d BNSF chose to defend the action without forcing Franklin to amend the name.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
