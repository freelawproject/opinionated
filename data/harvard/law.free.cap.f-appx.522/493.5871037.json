Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-19\">The ALJ was required to follow a \u201cfive-step sequential evaluation process ... to decide whether [O\u2019Bier was] disabled.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. The ALJ properly followed that process. O\u2019Bier argues, however, that the ALJ erred at the second step in that process by concluding that her depression was not a severe impairment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). A claimant\u2019s impairment is severe if it significantly limits her ability to perform basic work activities. <em>Bowen v. Yuckert, </em>482 U.S. 137, 141, 107 S.Ct. 2287, 2291, 96 L.Ed.2d 119 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-20\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that O\u2019Bier\u2019s depression is not severe. Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, a psychiatrist, examined O\u2019Bier and observed that she had adequate understanding and memory to perform \u201cvarious work related mental activities.\u201d He found that \u201cfrom the strict psychiatric standpoint Ms. O\u2019Bier should be able to function adequately in any job situation.\u201d The state agency psychologist found that O\u2019Bier had no severe mental impairment, and that she had only mild limitations in the activities of daily living, social functioning, concentration, persistence, or pace. In fact, the only evidence in the record that suggests that O\u2019Bier\u2019s depression would affect her ability to work is her own testimony and the opinion of Dr. Umesh Mhatre. The ALJ, however, found that O\u2019Bier\u2019s testimony about her alleged depression was \u201conly partially credible\u201d because she gave conflicting stories about substance abuse, engaged in daily activities that were inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tent with her alleged disabilities, and went on long trips with her boyfriend in his tractor trailer despite her allegations that she could not sit for long periods of time. The ALJ also discredited the opinion of Dr. Mhatre because he gave two inconsistent opinions about the severity of O\u2019Bier\u2019s work restrictions. And even if Dr. Mhatre\u2019s opinion had been credible, the opinions of Dr. Sanchez and the state agency psychologist still provide substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that O\u2019Bier\u2019s depression was not a severe impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
