The district court granted Johnson a certificate of ap-pealability (COA) on the issue whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance \u201cbecause \u2018the trial court was never presented with Petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim through his trial counsel that the search of his impounded vehicle by [Texas Department of Public Safety] officer Snyder was an unlawful search.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-22\">Because claims of ineffective assistance of counsel involve mixed questions of law and fact, they are controlled by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). <em>Gregory v. Thaler, </em>601 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.2010). Thus, a petitioner will not receive relief on such a claim absent a showing that the state court\u2019s disposition of the claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a petitioner must establish both \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient\u201d and \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d The combined standards of <em>Strickland </em>and \u00a7 2254(d) are \u201cdoubly deferential. We take a highly deferential look at counsel\u2019s performance, through the deferential lens of \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1403, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s determination of these questions de novo. <em>See Richards v. Quarterman, </em>566 F.3d 553, 561 (5th Cir.2009). In the circumstances here at issue, Johnson must show that the disputed evidence would have been suppressed had it been objected to and that, absent the excludable evidence, there is a reasonable probability of a different verdict. <em>See Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 375, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986). He has not made this showing because the remaining evidence adduced at trial suffices to uphold his conviction. <em>See Sweed v. State, </em>351 S.W.3d 63, 68 (Tex.Crim.App.2011); <em>Adi v. State, </em>94 S.W.3d 124, 128 (Tex.App.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The testimony of Johnson\u2019s accomplice showed that Johnson and others conspired to commit and committed theft by taking trucks from dealerships with the intent to deprive the dealerships of those vehicles. <em>See Sweed, </em>351 S.W.3d at 68; <em>Adi, </em>94 S.W.3d at 129. This was not, however, the only evidence \u201ctending to connect\u201d Johnson to the offense. <em>See Joubert v. State, </em>235 S.W.3d 729, 731 (Tex.Crim.App.2007). Rather, testimony from several police officers was consistent with the accomplice\u2019s version of events and further tied Johnson to the offense. <em>See Sweed, </em>351 S.W.3d at 68; <em>Joubert, </em>235 S.W.3d at 731; <em>Adi, </em>94 S.W.3d at 129. Johnson has not shown that he is entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance claim. The district court\u2019s judgment as to this claim is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Additionally, Johnson requests a COA on his claim that the district court erred by denying his request for an evidentiary hearing. To obtain a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1998). Because the record was adequate to dispose of his claims, Johnson was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Clark v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 273, 284 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1400, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). His COA request is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
