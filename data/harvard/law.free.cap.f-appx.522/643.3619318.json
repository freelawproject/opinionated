After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-22\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), a prisoner cannot file a \u00a7 1983 suit \u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). \u201cThis provision entirely eliminates judicial discretion and instead mandates strict exhaustion.... \u201d <em>Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.3d 1152, 1155 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]o properly exhaust administrative remedies prisoners must \u2018complete the administrative review process in accordance with the applicable procedural rules\u2019.... \u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 218, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (quoting <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 88, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">Figueroa alleged in his complaint that Nurse Bass provided inadequate medical care on June 20, 2007, after another inmate stabbed Figueroa. But Figueroa filed his first grievance with the prison concerning Bass\u2019s alleged inadequate medical care in November of 2008. As rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>vant here, Florida\u2019s Inmate Grievance Procedure requires a formal grievance to be filed within fifteen days of the incident. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 33-103.011(1)(b). Although there is an exception to this strict timing requirement when a prisoner \u201cclearly demonstrate^]\u201d that \u201cit was not feasible\u201d to timely file despite his \u201cgood faith effort,\u201d the Florida Department of Corrections ultimately found that Figueroa made no such showing. <em>Id. </em>r. 33-103.011(2). And Figueroa gives us no legal or factual basis upon which we could reverse that state-law determination. <em>See id. </em>(stating that the extension is only available when the required showing is made \u201cto the satisfaction of the reviewing authority ... or the Secretary\u201d); <em>see also Woodford, </em>548 U.S. at 83-84, 95-96, 101-03, 126 S.Ct. 2378 (holding that a prisoner cannot satisfy the exhaustion requirement by filing an untimely administrative grievance or appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Figueroa argues that the prison denied him legal assistance, which he claims was necessary because he had a limited understanding of English, but he ultimately filed several grievances and did not allege any facts that would explain why he could not have done so earlier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Figueroa therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as the PLRA requires. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case is</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. Figueroa alleged in his complaint that he was denied access to grievance forms until almost a year after the incident, which could raise a substantial question concerning the availability of administrative remedies. Although we have not decided the issue, <em>see Bryant v. Rich, </em>530 F.3d 1368, 1373 n. 6 (11th Cir.2008), other circuits have held that denial of grievance forms could render administrative remedies unavailable for purposes of the exhaustion requirement. <em>See, e.g., Dale v. Lappin, </em>376 F.3d 652, 656 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Figueroa, however, does not raise this argument on appeal, so he has abandoned it for purposes of this appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
