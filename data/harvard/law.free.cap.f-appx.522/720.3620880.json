The district court granted a certificate of appeala-bility (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether Glover\u2019s trial lawyer, Michael Zelman, was ineffective (1) for failing to inform Glover of his right to testify at trial; (2) for seeking to exclude evidence that Glover was incarcerated during a substantial portion of the charged conspiracy; and (3) for advising Glover that he faced a ten-year sentence regardless of whether he pleaded guilty or proceeded to trial. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a section 2255 motion, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and fact determinations for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>We accord \u201csubstantial deference to the factfinder in reaching credibility determinations with respect to witness testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient and that (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). If the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one element, we need not address the other. <em>Id. </em>at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Under the first part of the test, the proper measure of counsel\u2019s performance is reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and our review of counsel\u2019s performance must be \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2065. A \u201cstrong presumption\u201d exists that \u201ccounsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Under the second part, prejudice requires a showing that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2068. A \u201creasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In his first claim, Glover contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when Zelman failed allegedly to inform Glover of his right to testify at trial. Glover said that, had he been given the opportunity, he would have testified at trial \u201cto refute all of the government\u2019s allegations pertaining to his alleged conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">A criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to testify at trial, and this right cannot be waived by defense counsel. <em>United States v. Teague, </em>958 F.2d 1525, 1532 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc). Defense counsel is responsible for \u201cadvising the defendant of his right to testify or not to testify, the strategic implications of each choice, and that it is ultimately for the defendant himself to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1533.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Even assuming (without deciding) that Zelman performed deficiently by failing to advise Glover of his right to testify, Glover has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that his proposed testimony\u2014a blanket denial of the government\u2019s allegations\u2014would have altered the outcome of the trial. Kilvin Jasmin, an alleged co-conspirator, testified at Glover\u2019s trial about Glover\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. The jury heard several audio recordings of conversations between Glover and Jasmin during which the two men discussed selling drugs, monitoring police activity, and Glover\u2019s payment for selling drugs. The government also introduced evidence of Glover\u2019s own statement to police that he had been selling drugs for Jasmin.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">In the light of this strong evidence of Glover\u2019s guilt, no reasonable probability exists that, had Glover testified, he would have been found not guilty. Because Glover has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Zelman\u2019s performance, he is unentitled to habeas relief on this claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">Next, Glover argues that Zelman was ineffective for seeking to exclude evidence that Glover was incarcerated during a substantial period of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Glover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>contends that evidence of his incarceration proved that he was not responsible for the full amount of drugs or for all the acts alleged in the indictment. Because evidence of Glover\u2019s arrest and imprisonment was introduced ultimately to the jury, Glover asserts that Zelman\u2019s \u201cstrategic decision\u201d to try to exclude this information was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">A lawyer\u2019s \u201cstrategic decisions made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Strickland) </em>104 S.Ct. at 2066. And \u201cour strong reluctance to second guess strategic decisions is even greater where those decisions were made by experienced criminal defense counsel\u201d such as Zelman. <em>See Rhode v. Hall, </em>582 F.3d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">At trial, the government sought to introduce evidence of Glover\u2019s arrest on unrelated charges to show that, although Glover stopped working for Jasmin in November 2007 (when Glover was arrested), he did not withdraw voluntarily from the conspiracy. Zelman objected to the evidence as prejudicial. The court overruled the objection, explaining that the prejudicial effect was outweighed by the government\u2019s need to prove that Glover participated in the conspiracy until his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Evidence that Glover was arrested is inherently prejudicial and \u2014 as the government argued \u2014 that Glover\u2019s participation in the conspiracy ended only after he was arrested was harmful to Glover\u2019s defense. Thus, we cannot say that Zel-man\u2019s strategic decision to try to exclude evidence of Glover\u2019s incarceration fell below the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Glover has failed to demonstrate that Zelman\u2019s performance was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">In addition, because evidence of Glover\u2019s incarceration was introduced ultimately and because Glover was held responsible only for his pre-arrest conduct and for the drugs that he sold personally, he suffered no prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">In his third claim, Glover contends that Zelman was ineffective for advising Glover that he faced a maximum ten-year sentence regardless of whether he pleaded guilty or proceeded to trial. Glover says that he told Zelman that he wanted to plead guilty, but that Zelman told Glover that he could \u201cbeat this case\u201d if he proceeded to trial. Glover asserts that, but for Zelman\u2019s erroneous advice, he would have pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">We apply the <em>Strickland </em>analysis to ineffective assistance claims about a lawyer\u2019s advice on whether a defendant should plead guilty. <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1503-04 &amp; n. 7 (11th Cir.1995). To succeed on such a claim, a defendant must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1504 (alterations omitted). A defendant cannot show prejudice if he offers no evidence that he would have accepted a plea offer absent his lawyer\u2019s errors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge credited Zel-man\u2019s testimony (1) that he explained to Glover the likelihood of success at trial and the possible penalties Glover faced; (2) that Zelman never advised Glover that he would receive only <em>a </em>ten-year sentence; and (3) Glover never was interested in accepting a plea offer and insisted on proceeding to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">We grant substantial deference to these credibility findings. <em>See Devine, </em>520 F.3d at 1287. And, given that Glover\u2019s eviden-tiary hearing testimony contradicted directly his sworn allegation that Zelman told him that he would receive a ten-year sentence whether he pleaded guilty or proceeded to trial, the magistrate abused no discretion in discrediting Glover\u2019s testimony. Glover has failed to show that Zelman performed deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Glover also offered no proof that he would have accepted a plea offer absent Zelman\u2019s alleged error. Thus, he failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice. <em>See Coulter, </em>60 F.3d at 1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\">. On appeal, Glover argues for the first time that the district court abused its discretion by not conducting an evidentiary hearing on whether Zelman was ineffective for failing to advise Glover of his right to testify. Because this argument is outside the scope of the COA, we need not address it. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (explaining that \"appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-16\">. According to the <em>second </em>superseding indictment, the conspiracy ran between March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>2007 and September 2008. Glover was arrested on unrelated charges on 29 November 2007 and remained in custody for the duration of the conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. Glover argues that the district court abused its discretion by not conducting an evidentia-ry hearing on this issue. This argument is outside the scope of the COA and we need not address it. <em>See Murray, </em>145 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-15\">. On appeal, Glover does not argue that the government\u2019s email to Zelman constituted a plea offer and does not argue that Zelman was ineffective for failing to notify Glover of the email. Thus, Glover has abandoned this issue. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
