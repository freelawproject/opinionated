On appeal, Coffie argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), a career offender who received a departure and was sentenced below the guideline range for career offenders is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction under Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1268 (11th Cir.2002). We are bound by the opinion of a prior panel until the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc overrules that opinion\u2019s holding. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>we faced the question of whether defendants who were sentenced as career offenders under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in light of Amendment 706, which, like Amendment 750, lowered the base offense levels for certain quantities of crack cocaine under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). 541 F.3d 1323, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2008). Each of the <em>Moore </em>defendants\u2019 base offense level was calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but then each defendant\u2019s offense level was adjusted because they were classified as career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1335. We held that the defendants did not qualify for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because Amendment 706 had no effect on their applicable guideline ranges, which were calculated based on their career offender classification under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30. This determination even applied to defendant Moore who had been sentenced below the career offender guideline range due to his substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-19\">Coffie argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>has \u201cundermined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Moore </em>to the point of abrogation.\u201d However, this argument has been foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012). <em>See e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>488 Fed.Appx. 354, 354-55 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Lawson </em>foreclosed the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Freeman </em>effectively undermined <em>Moore </em>and that Amendment 750, which only altered the defendant\u2019s base offense level, did not affect the sentence he received pursuant to the career-offender guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court explained that, where a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea was based on the Guidelines, the defendant was eligible to seek a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). 131 S.Ct. at 2695 (plurality opinion). In <em>Lawson </em>we specifically addressed <em>Freeman\u2019s, </em>impact on <em>Moore </em>and held that <em>Moore </em>remained binding precedent. 686 F.3d at 1321. We explained that <em>Freeman </em>did not \u201caddress[] defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, <em>Freeman </em>[was] not \u2018clearly on point\u2019 to the issue that arose in <em>Moore.\u201d Id. </em>We have repeatedly affirmed this determination. <em>See e.g., United States v. Clayton, </em>477 Fed.Appx. 644, 646-47 (11th Cir.2012) (determining that the district court did not err by not applying <em>Freeman </em>because \u201cthere is no binding authority applying the reasoning of <em>Freeman </em>to the context of a career offender seeking \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">It is immaterial that, unlike the defendant in <em>Lawson, </em>Coffie was not sentenced within the career offender guideline range due to a departure for substantial assistance. Coffie\u2019s guideline range was still based on his career offender status even though the court later departed from the guideline range based on Coffie\u2019s substantial assistance. See <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>United States v. Clark, </em>485 Fed.Appx. 407, 410 (2012) (citing <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203 (11th Cir.2012) in support of the proposition that neither Amendment 750 nor 759 changed the fact that the defendant\u2019s guideline range was the career offender guideline range even though he later received a substantial assistance departure). Therefore, Amendment 750 \u201cdid not alter the sentencing range upon which [Coffie\u2019s] sentence was based.\u201d <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Further, there is no indication that the crack cocaine guideline calculation influenced the district court\u2019s departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Therefore, based on a prior precedent, the district court did not err in denying Coffie\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on the ground Amendment 750 did not lower his applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
