The court imposed a 327-month sentence, which Smith now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">Smith argues that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to consider his admittedly untimely objection to the presentence investigation report. We review a district court\u2019s refusal to consider the merits of untimely objections for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1351 (11th Cir.2007). A defendant must file his objections to the PSR within 14 days of receiving it. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(f)(1). The court may, for good cause, extend the deadline for filing an objection, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(2), or allow a party to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed, Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">Smith\u2019s counsel explained that he filed the objections late because he was preparing for another trial. He acknowledged that he should have filed a motion for an extension of time but did not explain why he failed to. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to consider the merits of Smith\u2019s untimely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Smith next argues, as he did in his objection to the PSR, that he should not have been classified as a career offender because one of his predicate \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d was a conviction under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.13, which does not require the defendant to have knowledge of the illicit nature of the controlled substance. <em>See State v. Adkins, </em>96 So.3d 412, 415 (Fla.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Because Smith\u2019s objection to the PSR was untimely and the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider them, we review Smith\u2019s claim that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender for plain error. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhen the defendant fails to object at the district court, we reverse only for plain error.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The district court did not commit plain error when it concluded that Smith\u2019s violation of \u00a7 893.13 was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because neither the statutory language of the sentencing guidelines nor our case law requires that a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d be one in which the defendant had knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) (defining a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as an offense under a law \u201cthat prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We look at the elements of the convicted offense, not the conduct underlying the conviction, to determine if a prior conviction is controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>United States v. Lipsey, </em>40 F.3d 1200, 1201 (11th Cir.1994). Florida statute \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Therefore, Smith\u2019s violation of that statute was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Smith argues that his sentence, which was at the high end of the applicable range, was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) and substantively unreasonable because Smith\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and expression of remorse warranted a sentence at the low-end of the range. We review <em>de novo </em>whether a court complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must ... consider the totality of the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-1190 (11th Cir.2010). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"pAlfB\">The district court must \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence\u201d and, where the applicable guideline range exceeds 24 months, its reasons for choosing that particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>point within the range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(c)(1). When stating its reasons, the district court should tailor its comments to demonstrate the appropriateness of the sentence in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181-82. The district court is not required to cite the specific language of \u00a7 3553(a) or articulate its consideration of each factor where it is obvious that it considered many of them. <em>Id. </em>at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The court in this case complied with \u00a7 3553(c)(1) because it discussed Smith\u2019s extensive criminal history in detail and explained that that history \u201cdoes not suggest a variance, or for that matter, a sentence at the low end of the guideline.\u201d The court also stated that it considered each of the \u00a7 3553 factors individually and collectively. Based on Smith\u2019s criminal history \u2014 which includes 6 convictions as a juvenile and 12 convictions as an adult for various offenses \u2014 and the nature of his offense in this case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 327-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
