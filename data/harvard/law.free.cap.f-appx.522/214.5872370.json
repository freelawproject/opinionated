He also asks this court to appoint counsel. By moving to proceed IFP, Edwards challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">According to Edwards, his constitutional rights were violated when a disciplinary hearing officer found him guilty of escape under prison regulations. He asserts that the prison failed to investigate his absence from count and that there was not the requisite \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the hearing officer\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo, employing the same standard used by the district court. <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir.2012). The prison\u2019s \u201cfailure to follow its own procedural regulations does not establish a violation of due process\u201d absent some showing of resulting prejudice. <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1251 (5th Cir.1989). Edwards fails to demonstrate prejudice because he has not shown that had prison officials found him sleeping in the dug out during count he would not have been found guilty of escape. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s summary judgment evidence shows that he received advance written notice of the charge, he was provided the opportunity to be heard, and there was some evidence to support the disciplinary decision. Edwards thus received all of the process to which he was entitled, and his due process rights were not violated. <em>See Superintendent, Massachusetts Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-65, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Edwards has not shown that his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motion for the appointment of counsel is likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
