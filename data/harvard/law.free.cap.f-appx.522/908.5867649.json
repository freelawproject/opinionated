On appeal, Lopez Hernandez argues that his guilty plea to a Florida state felony offense followed by a withholding of adjudication was not a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Under the prior precedent rule, a panel of this Court is bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). However, when the prior decision involves interpretations of state law, if the applicable state law \u201cchanges or is clarified in a way that is inconsistent with the state law premise of one of our earlier decisions, the prior panel precedent rule does not bind us to follow our earlier decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.2008), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). We have \u201ccategorically rejected an overlooked reason or argument exception to the prior precedent rule.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">We first addressed the question of whether a guilty plea to a Florida state felony offense and a withholding of adjudication constitutes a predicate conviction under \u00a7 922(g) in <em>United States v. Orellanes, </em>809 F.2d 1526 (11th Cir.1987). Relying on the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Gazda, </em>257 So.2d 242, 243-44 (Fla.1971), we held that \u201cthe term \u2018conviction\u2019 means determination of guilty by verdict of the jury or by plea of guilty, and does not require adjudication by the court.\u201d <em>Orellanes, </em>809 F.2d at 1528. Two years later, relying on <em>Orellanes, </em>we reaffirmed that \u201cunder Florida law a person is considered a convicted felon when there has been a withholding of adjudication of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Grinkiewicz, </em>873 F.2d 253, 255 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">We revisited the issue in 2001, and, operating under plain error review, held that the district court did not plainly err when it accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to the felon-in-possession charge. <em>United States v. Chubbuck, </em>252 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>Chubbuck, </em>we recognized the holdings of <em>Orellanes </em>and <em>Grinkiewicz, </em>but noted that the analysis in <em>Orellanes </em>may not have fully accounted for the context-specific nature of the term \u201cconviction\u201d under Florida law. <em>Id. </em>at 1304. While <em>Orellanes </em>and <em>Grinkiewicz </em>relied on a Florida Supreme Court decision defining the term \u201cconviction\u201d with regard to Florida\u2019s Limitation On Withheld Sentences Statute, because the term is context-specific, \u201cthe more appropriate source of applicable Florida law would be that surrounding Florida\u2019s own unlawful possession of firearms by a felon statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.23.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we determined that the case law in the area was limited but varied, and there was no definitive statement from the Florida Supreme Court on the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1304-05. Accordingly, we concluded that, although it had \u201cbecome increasingly clear that per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>haps our interpretation of Florida law was either in error or has since changed,\u201d because there was no definitive authority from the Florida Supreme Court that contradicted our precedent, the district court did not commit plain error in accepting Chubbuck\u2019s guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 1305. We noted, however, that \u201cthe prior precedent rule would not apply if intervening on-point case law from either this Court <em>en banc, </em>the United States Supreme Court, or the Florida Supreme Court existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Here, the district court did not err because the law of this Circuit, as stated in <em>Orellanes, Grinkiewicz, </em>and <em>Chubbuck, </em>is that Lopez Hernandez\u2019s guilty plea to a Florida felony offense followed by a withheld adjudication qualifies as a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Because there no intervening, on-point case law from the Florida Supreme Court, this Court <em>en banc, </em>or the Supreme Court, the district court\u2019s conclusion was compelled by the prior precedent rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
