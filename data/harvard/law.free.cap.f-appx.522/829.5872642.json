Therefore, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-19\">We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Turner. <em>See Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir.2004). From March 2008 to January 2011, Turner worked as a Financial Analyst for the FPCB. During most of this period, she was the only black employee supervised by William Thompson, a white <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>male. Thompson and Turner often did not get along, and Turner felt Thompson treated her worse than the rest of the employees he supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">On November 3, 2010, Turner sent an email to an employee of a vendor FPCB did business with that Turner does not dispute \u201ctook a defensive tone,\u201d attacked the employee, and was unprofessional. After learning of this email, Thompson counseled Turner about her behavior. Early the next morning, Turner emailed Thompson blaming him for her unprofessional email to the vendor and directing him to stop yelling at her and \u201cbe considerate at all times when approaching\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Later that day, November 4, 2010, Thompson conducted a performance evaluation for Turner, which he was required to do annually for each employee he supervised. He noted, among other things, that the quality of Turner\u2019s work had declined significantly over the preceding year, that she was unwilling to ask for help, and that she took personally any feedback about problems with her work. In the evaluation, Thompson placed Turner on a \u201c60-day performance improvement plan\u201d and wrote that, \u201c[i]f her job performance and attitude [did] not significantly improve[] within that time and consistently remain at [that] significantly improved level,\u201d he would \u201crecommend that [her] employment with the [FPCB] be terminated.\u201d That same day, he met with Turner and a representative from the FPCB\u2019s Human Resources department, Dorothy Melton, to discuss the evaluation. Both in writing and in person, he warned Turner that the FPCB \u201creserve[d] the right to terminate [her] employment prior to [her] formal reevaluation in 60 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">On December 15, 2010, prior to the planned January 3 reevaluation date, Thompson began drafting a report on Turner\u2019s progress that concluded she had made no improvement. The next morning, Turner requested FMLA leave from Melton, as directed by her physician. Later that day, Thompson delivered his performance review to Melton.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Melton informed Thompson that Turner had requested and would receive FMLA leave from December 20 through January 7. Thompson told Melton that he had decided to recommend that Turner be fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">While she was out on leave, Turner began for the first time to think the reason Thompson treated her differently was her race. So on January 8, 2011, the Saturday before she was to return to work, she sent an email to Melton and the FPCB\u2019s Executive Director, Thomas Wallace.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that email, she said that Thompson had been verbally abusive and treated her different<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>ly \u201cbecause of [her] race ... and for exercising [her] rights for FMLA time....\u201d The same day, she sought and was granted additional FMLA leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Turner returned to work on January 18 and, upon her return, spoke with an investigator from the State Board of Administration about her allegation that Thompson had discriminated against her. Later that morning, however, she was called into Melton\u2019s office, where Thompson presented her with a negative performance evaluation. And, with Wallace\u2019s approval, she was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Turner filed suit against the FPCB alleging that Thompson discriminated against her based upon her race, retaliated against her when she complained, interfered with the exercise of her FMLA rights, and retaliated against her for exercising her FMLA rights. The district court rendered summary judgment in the FPCB\u2019s favor on all four claims. This is Turner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court, and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Atheists of Fla., Inc. v. City of Lakeland, Fla., </em>713 F.3d 577, 589 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate on a claim when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIssues of fact are genuine only if a reasonable jury, considering the evidence presented, could find for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee based upon her race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Discrimination can be proven either directly or, as Turner seeks to do, indirectly using circumstantial evidence. <em>EEOC v. Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, Inc., </em>220 F.3d 1263, 1286 (11th Cir.2000). To prove differential treatment using circumstantial evidence, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Hall v. Ala. Ass\u2019n of Sch. Bds., </em>326 F.3d 1157, 1166 (11th Cir.2003). To do so, she must show (1) that she was a member of a protected class (2) who was qualified for her position but (3) was subject to an adverse employment action and (4) treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee outside of her protected class. <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006). Even if a plaintiff cannot point to a similarly situated comparator employee who was treated more favorably, however, she may in some cases create a \u201ctriable issue concerning the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent\u201d by showing a \u201cconvincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Turner has not identified a proper comparator. She points us to a Management Assistant she argues was treated more favorably, but that individual\u2019s misconduct was a mere typographical error. Turner, by contrast, concedes she sent an accusatory and unprofessional email to an employee at one of FPCB\u2019s vendors. Because \u201c[t]he quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct\u201d is not \u201cnearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>identical,\u201d Turner has not presented evidence of a similarly situated employee who was treated more favorably. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Constr., Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Labor, </em>684 F.3d 1127, 1135 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Nor has Turner presented evidence that would permit her to circumvent the usual <em>prima facie </em>showing. Just as the district court did, we accept for summary judgment purposes Turner\u2019s testimony that Thompson singled her out and treated her poorly. But \u201cTitle VII is neither a general civility code nor a statute making actionable the ordinary tribulations of the working place.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 1227, 1234 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Unless something links the actions to the employee\u2019s race, that a decisionmaker singles an employee out does not permit a jury to infer intentional discrimination based on race.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Here, the only link between Turner\u2019s race and Thompson\u2019s actions is her statement in an affidavit that Thompson did not treat white employees as harshly. But we have never suggested that a plaintiffs generalized averment that her employer treated her differently than employees of a different race can, alone, create a \u201cconvincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence\u201d from which a jury could find intentional discrimination based on race. <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328 (internal quotation marks omitted). To so hold would do away with the usual requirement that a plaintiff identify a comparator. In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff presented evidence that the paperwork in an investigation into racist emails explicitly identified employees by race. <em>Id. </em>at 1336-37, 1341, 1345-46. And in that case, the plaintiff was fired along with all other employees that paperwork identified as white, while no black employees under investigation were terminated. 1338-44. By contrast, Turner concedes she never even suspected Thompson\u2019s treatment of her was based upon race until <em>after </em>Thompson recommended on December 16 that she be fired. Thus, no reasonable jury could find the circumstantial evidence convincingly suggests that race motivated Thompson\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Turner has also failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case that she was terminated in retaliation for complaining that Thompson had discriminated against her based on her race. Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \u201cmakes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \u2018because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1268 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a)). \u201cTo establish a pri-ma facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>two.\u201d <em>Gowski v. Peake, </em>682 F.3d 1299, 1811 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">The district court concluded that Turner could not show her termination was causally related to any statutorily protected activity. We agree. Turner admits she never told anyone that she believed Thompson was treating her differently based upon her race until January 8. That was after Thompson had recommended on December 16 that she be terminated. Thus, her complaint cannot have triggered the termination. Although Turner claims on appeal that she told Melton and others she felt harassed throughout her employment, she does not even argue those complaints could have put the FPCB on notice that she believed Thompson\u2019s actions were related to her race. See <em>Coutu v. Martin Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Com\u2019rs, </em>47 F.3d 1068, 1075 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that employee\u2019s charge he was treated unfairly, without some allegation treatment was based on race, \u201cdid not constitute statutorily protected activity\u201d because \u201c[u]nfair treatment\u201d alone \u201cis <em>not </em>an unlawful employment practice under Title VII\u201d). Indeed, as noted above, she only came to suspect Thompson\u2019s treatment of her had anything to do with race after the termination decision was already made. Thus, because Turner cannot establish causality between any protected conduct and her termination, summary judgment was proper as to her Title VII retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Turner also argues summary judgment was improper on her claim that the FPCB interfered with her rights under the FMLA by terminating her when she returned from leave. After careful consideration, we agree. \u201cTo prove FMLA interference, an employee must demonstrate that [s]he was denied a benefit to which [s]he was entitled under the FMLA,\u201d such as \u201cthe right following FMLA leave \u2018to be restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced\u2019 or to an equivalent position.\u201d <em>Martin v. Brevard Cnty. Pub. Schs., </em>543 F.3d 1261, 1267 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(a)(1)(A)). \u201c[T]he employer\u2019s motives are irrelevant\u201d to an interference claim. <em>Strickland v. Water Works &amp; Sewer Bd. of Birmingham, </em>239 F.3d 1199, 1208 (11th Cir.2001). But if the employer shows it would have terminated the employee had she not been on leave, then refusal to restore her to her prior position will not support an FMLA interference claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The district court rendered summary judgment on Turner\u2019s FMLA interference claim finding that she \u201chad no pending leave requests when she was terminated.\u201d But, as Turner points out on appeal, she did not claim the FPCB prevented her from taking leave to which she was entitled, but rather that the FPCB failed to restore her to her job as the FMLA requires.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite this, we may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 960 (11th Cir.2009). The FPCB urges us to hold that the evidence shows it would have terminated Turner even had she not taken leave due to the performance deficiencies identified in the November 4 performance evaluation and December 16 progress report. But Turner disputes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>her performance was deficient in the ways outlined in those documents. And for purposes of summary judgment, we must assume Turner\u2019s version of the facts is true. <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1227. Further, as we more fully explain below, we cannot agree that the evidence unequivocally demonstrates Thompson had decided to fire Turner before learning that she intended to take FMLA leave. Therefore, genuine issues of fact about whether the FPCB failed to restore Turner to her prior position as required under the FMLA, or instead would have fired her even had she not taken leave, preclude summary judgment on her interference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Finally, we agree with Turner that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether she was fired in retaliation for taking FMLA leave. \u201cTo prove FMLA retaliation, an employee must show that [her] employer <em>intentionally </em>discriminated against [her] for exercising an FMLA right.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>543 F.3d at 1267. Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discriminatory intent, we evaluate a claim of retaliatory discharge under the FMLA using the same burden-shifting approach employed in Title VII cases. <em>Id. </em>First, an employee must make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of FMLA retaliation by showing she engaged in activity the FMLA protects and suffered an adverse employment action causally related to that activity. <em>Id. </em>The burden then shifts to the employer \u201cto articulate a legitimate reason for the adverse action.\u201d <em>Hurlbert v. St. Mary\u2019s Health Care Sys., Inc., </em>439 F.3d 1286, 1297 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIf the employer does so, the employee must then show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was pretextual by presenting evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>543 F.3d at 1268 (internal quotation marks omitted). To do so, \u201c[t]he employee may rely on evidence that [s]he already produced to establish [her] <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">The district court concluded Turner could not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case because she could not show a causal connection between her FMLA leave and termination. That conclusion was based upon the court\u2019s finding that Thompson had already recommended Turner\u2019s termination before he learned that she was taking FMLA leave. The timing, however, is ambiguous. Thompson averred that he \u201ctold Ms. Melton that [he] recommended the termination\u201d and that \u201cMs. Melton indicated that because Turner submitted a request for leave that day, the termination would not take place until Ms. Turner returned to work.... \u201d This shows Thompson learned of Turner\u2019s request and recommended her termination in the same meeting. But an inference is necessary to decide what happened first, which we must necessarily make in Turner\u2019s favor. <em>See Gowski, </em>682 F.3d at 1310-11. And while the progress report Thompson completed prior to learning of Turner\u2019s leave request indicates he was displeased with her progress, it nowhere mentions that she should be terminated. We conclude based on the record before us that a reasonable jury could infer Thompson had not decided to recommend that Turner be terminated until after he was told she was approved to take FMLA leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The FPCB responds that, even if Turner has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of FMLA retaliation, Turner was terminated for the substantial performance deficiencies and deteriorating working relationships Thompson outlined in the November 4 performance review and December 16 progress report. But Turner has raised a gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>uine question as to whether those reasons were pretextual. First and foremost, Turner testified in her deposition that none of the performance deficiencies Thompson identified, save the inappropriate email, actually existed. And, construing the facts in Turner\u2019s favor, the temporal proximity was as close as could be \u2014 within mere minutes. Nothing in the memorandum Thompson delivered to Melton on December 16 indicated that he recommended her termination then, rather than at the completion of the planned 60-day reevaluation period. So the evidence reasonably could be read to indicate he decided on the spot to seek her termination upon learning that she had invoked her right to take FMLA leave that extended through her probationary period. In so doing, he cut short the time he had given Turner to improve and short-circuited the performance improvement plan he had previously outlined and explained to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><em>Martin </em>counsels that such evidence is adequate to create a jury issue over whether the employer\u2019s proffered reason for Turner\u2019s termination was pretextual. There, just as here, an employee of several years received a poor performance evaluation and was placed on an improvement plan. <em>Martin, </em>543 F.3d at 1264. Just as Turner did, Martin took FMLA leave prior to completing his improvement plan and, just as in Turner\u2019s case, the employer decided to fire Martin after he requested and was approved for leave but before he completed the improvement plan. <em>Id. </em>at 1264-65, 1268. Moreover, in this case, Thompson terminated the improvement plan early, on the same day he learned Turner would take FMLA leave. Thus, the \u201ctemporal proximity between [her] leave and termination\u201d is at least as probative of pretext as in <em>Martin. Id. </em>at 1268. Therefore, just as in that case, although the FPCB\u2019s \u201cexplanation may ultimately prove true, a genuine dispute of material fact nonetheless remains\u201d regarding whether Thompson was terminated in retaliation for exercising her FMLA rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">No reasonable jury could find Turner was discriminated against on the basis of her race or retaliated against for engaging in any conduct protected under Title VII. But, based upon the evidence produced thus far, we conclude a jury could find the FPCB interfered with Turner\u2019s right to restoration under the FMLA and retaliated against her for seeking to exercise her right to FMLA leave. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the summary judgment rendered in the FPCB\u2019s favor on Turner\u2019s Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims, but vacate the district court\u2019s judgment on Turner\u2019s FMLA interference and retaliation claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-12\">. Although Turner also mentioned \"Chapter 760, Florida Statutes\u201d and \"42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a\u201d in the introduction to her amended complaint, the district court deemed those passing references insufficient to state independent claims. Because Turner does not challenge that conclusion on appeal, she has abandoned any claim under those provisions. <em>Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown, &amp; Root Servs., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. In her briefs, Turner claims she disputes Thompson's testimony that he orally recommended on December 16 that she be terminated, suggesting that his recommendation came later, after her complaint of racial discrimination. Neither before the district nor on appeal, however, has she pointed to any <em>evidence </em>upon which she bases this asserted dispute. A fact is not disputed for summary judgment purposes simply if the nonmovant claims the evidence put forward in support of it is \u201cdubious,\u201d as Turner does. \"Once the moving party makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to rebut that showing by producing affidavits or other relevant and admissible evidence beyond the pleadings.\u201d <em>Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1314\u201415 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-12\">. As the district court noted, Turner\u2019s two January 8 emails were sent to Melton and an address for a Thomas Williams, but both begin \"Hello Mr. Wallace and Ms. Melton.\u201d Thus, the email addresses appear to be typos, yet neither party has cleared up this confusion on appeal. Nevertheless, because Turner asserts on appeal that she sent the emails to Wallace and Melton and Thompson does not dispute that assertion, we assume it to be true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\">. The evidence indicates that the FPCB\u2019s Executive Director, Thomas Wallace, not Thompson, actually fired Turner. The FPCB suggests, albeit obliquely, that the termination cannot have been the result of intentional discrimination because Turner makes no allegation that Wallace had improper motives. Nonetheless, throughout its briefs before this court and in its motion for summary judgment, the FPCB treated Thompson as the relevant decisionmaker and never asserted Turner\u2019s claims fail because he was not. Thus, we treat any argument to that end forfeited. <em>E.g., Battle v. Bd. of Regents for Ga., </em>468 F.3d 755, 763 n. 8 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. The district court may have misconstrued Turner's theory of interference because Turner\u2019s discussion of it in her brief in opposition to summary judgment was so slight, including no citations and never referencing the restoration right. Nonetheless, because the FPCB does not argue Turner forfeited the theory in the district court and instead argues the merits of her claim, we likewise address the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
