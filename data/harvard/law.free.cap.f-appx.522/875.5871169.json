On appeal, he argues that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>We normally review all sentences for reasonableness under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The government correctly notes that Hernandez failed to object to the reasonableness of his sentence before the district court. Where a party fails to object to an error or ruling, we normally review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">I. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">First, Hernandez argues that, despite his presentation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in mitigation, the district court failed to address or consider those factors during sentencing. He contends that the court\u2019s bare assertion that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was insufficient to demonstrate that the factors had been considered in his specific case.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to accurately calculate the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the reasons for the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. However, the district court need not discuss or explicitly state on the record that it has considered each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, an acknowledgment by the district court that it considered the defendant\u2019s arguments, the circumstances of the offense, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors suffices. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. Where a case is conceptually simple, and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and the arguments, the judge is not required to further elaborate on his sentencing decision. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (holding that the sentencing judge\u2019s brief explanation was legally sufficient because the context and record made it clear that, in imposing sentence, the judge listened to each argument and considered supporting evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Here, Hernandez fails to demonstrate that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Although he argues that the district court did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as they relate to his case, the court did consider Hernandez\u2019s arguments, the circumstances of the offense, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30. The court acknowledged that it had specifically considered the arguments in Hernandez\u2019s sentencing memorandum, commented that it considered Hernandez\u2019s case to be very serious due to the large amount of cocaine involved, found that the crime was not impulsive but instead well-planned, and explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court was not required to discuss each factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Because many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors were concededly inapplicable, the case was conceptually simple, and the record made clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and the defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 358-59, 127 S.Ct. at 2469. Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Hernandez also contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court solely focused on the need to punish and impermissibly failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors brought forth in mitigation. He argues that the court exclusively focused on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>specifics of the offense \u2014 the large quantity of cocaine \u2014 which rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">After we determine that a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we examine whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The purposes of sentencing include the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide needed medical care or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, and the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The weight to be accorded to any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter left to the district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s attachment of great weight to a single factor is not necessarily reversible error, although a district court\u2019s unjustified reliance upon any single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a \u201csymptom\u201d of an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). Although we do not automatically presume the reasonableness of a sentence falling within the guideline range, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, 550 </em>F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). We vacate a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Hernandez has not met his burden of showing that his 60-month guideline sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the court unjustifiably relied upon any single \u00a7 3553(a) factor so as to impose an unreasonable sentence. <em>See Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1322. To the extent that Hernandez asks us to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we will not do so. <em>See Langston, </em>590 F.3d at 1237. Hernandez\u2019s 60-month sentence fell near the bottom of his 57 to 71-month guideline range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. Finally, the fact that his sentence fell far below the 40-year statutory maximum is another indicator of reasonableness. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(ii)(II); <em>see also Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Thus, we cannot say that the district court imposed a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">In conclusion, Hernandez\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
