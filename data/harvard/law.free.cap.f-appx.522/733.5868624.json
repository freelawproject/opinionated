For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City and Simpson.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b758-22\">According to Hawk\u2019s amended complaint, he was arrested in October 2010 by Officer Sean Klaetsch, who tasered him without reason. During Hawk\u2019s detention in the county jail, multiple inmates assaulted him, telling him that \u201cKlaetsch said to indoctrinate you into jail life.\u201d Hawk sued eight defendants, including Klaetsch, the City, and Simpson. Klaetsch<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and five other defendants were eventually dropped from the complaint, along with most of the complaint\u2019s counts, leaving only the City and Simpson as defendants, and only Counts VI and VII. Count VI asserts that Simpson violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 through a deliberate indifference to the lack of training and supervision of Klaetsch, which caused Hawk to be deprived of his due process rights. Count VII asserts that the City violated \u00a7 1983 by carrying out a policy or custom of deliberate indifference that caused the deprivation of Hawk\u2019s constitutional rights. The City and Simpson moved for summary judgment on the two counts, which the district court granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Cofield v. Goldkist, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam). We address the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Counts VI and VII in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Count VI essentially asserts a theory of supervisory liability on the part of Simpson, Klaetsch\u2019s supervisor. One way to establish supervisory liability in a \u00a7 1983 case is to show a causal connection between the injury and a history of widespread abuse that has put the \u201cresponsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation,\u201d and the supervisor\u2019s failure to do so. <em>Cottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). To show widespread abuse, the plaintiff must point to examples that are \u201cobvious, flagrant, rampant and of continued duration, rather than isolated occurrences.\u201d <em>Brown v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 667, 671 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Hawk points to five incidents that he claims establish a history of widespread abuse: (1) a 2006 complaint from Steven Cobb that, during a traffic stop, Klaetsch \u201cstomped him in his back, put his knee in his back, pulled his arms, bumped his head on the ground, pulled his hair, and then shoved his hand in the ground\u201d; (2) an August 2009 complaint from Chris Askew that Klaetsch violated two minors\u2019 Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights during a robbery investigation; (3) a 2009 complaint from Courtney Woods alleging that Klaetsch searched her vehicle and bag in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (4) another 2009 complaint from Robert Riley that Klaetsch needlessly threatened to tase him during an arrest; and (5) a 2010 complaint by Christopher Lowery that Klaetsch needlessly pulled him to the ground, put his knee in Lowery\u2019s back, and threatened to tase him.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">We agree with the district court that the allegedly unconstitutional search of Woods\u2019s car in 2009 and the August 2009 investigations into a robbery have no bearing on Hawke\u2019s excessive force claims, because neither involve the use of force. We are left, then, with three incidents prior to Hawk\u2019s arrest that demonstrate the exercise of force by Klaetsch. We fail to see how three incidents over the span of nearly five years can constitute frequent, widespread, or rampant abuse. <em>See Brown, </em>906 F.2d at 671. Moreover, our caselaw indicates that the force employed in the three incidents would constitute de minimis force rather than excessive force.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be clear, we do not condone the actions \u2014 should they be true \u2014 taken by Klaetsch during the arrest and detention of Hawk. Yet Klaetsch is not the party sought to be held liable here. The question before us is whether Simpson turned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>blind eye to rampant and widespread abuse. From the record before us, we cannot say that he did. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Simpson on Count VI is due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">We next turn to Count VII, where Hawk seeks to hold the City liable under \u00a7 1983 ratification theory. To do so, Hawk must show a \u201cpersistent failure to take disciplinary action against officers\u201d who use excessive force, which \u201ccan give rise to the inference that a municipality has ratified conduct, thereby establishing a \u2018custom\u2019 within the meaning of <em>Monell </em>[v. <em>Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) ].\u201d <em>Fundiller v. City of Cooper City, 111 </em>F.2d 1436, 1443 (11th Cir.1985). The problem with Hawk\u2019s argument, as noted above, is that he cannot point to a widespread practice of excessive force to begin with. Without that, his contention that the City deliberately ignored an unconstitutional custom or policy has been cut off at the knees. <em>See Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1308 (11th Cir.2001) (discussing \u00a7 1983 liability for a municipality based on \u201cgovernmental \u2018custom\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Count VII is also due to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-16\">. Hawk filed a motion to dismiss Klaetsch with prejudice after Klaetsch filed a petition in bankruptcy court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\">. Only two of the incidents cited by Hawk involve tasers, and none of them recount the actual tasing of an arrestee. And although all three incidents recount aggressive arrests by Klaetsch, this circuit requires something more to transform aggressive force into excessive force. See, <em>e.g., Rodriguez v. Farrell, </em>280 F.3d 1341, 1351 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that where an officer \"grabbed plaintiff's arm, twisted it around plaintiff\u2019s back, jerking it up high to the shoulder\u201d and then handcuffing the plaintiff \"as plaintiff fell to his knees screaming\u201d did not constitute excessive force); <em>Nolin v. Isbell, </em>207 F.3d 1253, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that where an officer threw an arrestee against a van, kneed him in the back, pushed his head into the side of a van, and searched his groin area in an uncomfortable manner, such force was de minimis force); <em>Jones v. City of Dothan, </em>121 F.3d 1456, 1458 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (holding that slamming plaintiff against a wall and kicking his legs apart constituted de min-imis).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
