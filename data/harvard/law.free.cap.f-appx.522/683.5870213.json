In his petition, Starling sought redetermination of deficiencies for tax years 1980 through 1997 on behalf of himself and on behalf of 1,100 of his former tax clients. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-22\">We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Peebles v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>431 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2005). And we review <em>de novo </em>the tax court\u2019s conclusions <em>of </em>law and review its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Estate of Wallace v. Comm\u2019r, </em>965 F.2d 1038, 1044 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">\u201cThe Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction and lacks general equitable powers.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r v. McCoy, </em>484 U.S. 3, 108 S.Ct. 217, 219, 98 L.Ed.2d 2 (1987). It has authority to redetermine tax deficiencies, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6214, and to review the determinations of Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) appeals officers, relating to unpaid taxes or proposed levies or liens, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6320(c), 6330(d). To invoke the tax court\u2019s authority in either case, however, the IRS must issue the taxpayer a statutory notice; and the taxpayer must timely petition to the tax court. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212, 6213(a); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6320(a), 6330(a). These statutory notices \u2014 sometimes characterized as the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cticket\u201d to the tax court \u2014 are necessary prerequisites to the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See Shockley v. Comm\u2019r, </em>686 F.3d 1228, 1238 n. 9 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe notice [of deficiency under \u00a7 6212] is ... the taxpayer\u2019s jurisdictional ticket to the Tax Court.\u201d); <em>Offiler v. Comm\u2019r, </em>114 T.C. 492, 498 (2000) (\u201cThe notice of determination provided for in section 6330 is, from a jurisdictional perspective, the equivalent of a notice of deficiency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The tax court did not clearly err when it found that no prerequisite statutory notice had been issued in this case. Although the IRS issued three notices of deficiency to Starling in the 1980s, the proceedings tied to those notices have long-since been resolved; and no new deficiency notices have been issued. And nothing evidences that the IRS issued notices of determination to Starling for the pertinent tax years. In the absence of a statutory notice and a timely petition, the tax court lacked jurisdiction over Starling\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> Starling challenges the tax court\u2019s denial of his \"Motion for Appearance and Representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tion,\u201d in which he sought to appear on behalf of his former tax clients. Because nothing evidences that Starling, a non-lawyer, satisfied the requirements for admission to practice before the tax court, or that he was admitted to practice before the tax court, the tax court committed no error in denying Starling's motion. <em>See </em>I.R.C. Rule 200 (setting forth the admission requirements for non-lawyers).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
