Chen argues the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(15)(A), because he did not individually derive $1,000,000 in gross receipts as a result of the conspiracy to which he pleaded guilty. Chen also challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, arguing the district court failed to note on the record it was aware of certain factual stipulations underlying his guilty plea. We affirm as to both issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">With respect to the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(15)(A)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentencing enhancement, any error by the district court was harmless. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1121, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992) (holding that when \u201cthe reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole, ... the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d the \u201cerror was harmless\u201d and remand is inappropriate). Chen argues that, because he turned over a portion of his illicit gross receipts to a co-conspirator after they were initially deposited in his account, he did not <em>individually </em>derive over $1,000,000 in gross receipts. We have not yet decided how individual \u201cgross receipts\u201d should be calculated under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(15)(A) when money is initially obtained by a defendant but then disbursed to a co-conspirator, and we need not do so in this case. Even discounting payments to his co-conspirator, Chen still derived at least $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the conspiracy, according to his own admissions as well as undisputed facts in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (PSI).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Ben</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>nett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832, 833-34 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201c[a] sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact may be based on undisputed statements in the PSI,\u201d and that when a defendant \u201cfail[s] to object to the facts ... contained in his PSI ... he is deemed to have admitted those facts\u201d). Therefore, because \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(15)(A)\u2019s enhancement would have applied to Chen even under his interpretation, any district court error was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Additionally, Chen\u2019s challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence is meritless. Chen contends the district court rejected his request for a minor role reduction without explaining its reasoning, without affording the parties a full opportunity to argue the point, and without giving \u201cany weight or consideration\u201d to the factual stipulation in his guilty plea that he \u201cplayed a relatively minor role.\u201d The record does not support Chen\u2019s contentions. <em>See United States v. Petrie, </em>302 F.3d 1280, 1290 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A] sentencing court\u2019s failure to make individualized findings ... is not grounds for vacating a sentence if the record support[s] the court\u2019s determination with respect to the offense conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">As to Chen\u2019s first argument, the district court did adequately explain why it was denying Chen\u2019s request for minor role reduction. The court made clear Chen was not entitled to his requested reduction based on the precise nature of his role in the conspiracy, which included titling three fraudulently-obtained properties in his name. Next, the record shows the district court did in fact give the parties a full, fair opportunity to argue the minor role reduction. The district court began the sentencing hearing by asking defense counsel to address any issues that had not been dealt with satisfactorily. Chen\u2019s counsel, however, raised none. Only after further prompting by the court did defense counsel bring up Chen\u2019s request for a minor role reduction. Finally, even when counsel argued for the minor role reduction, he never mentioned the factual stipulation in Chen\u2019s guilty plea. Despite this failure, Chen argues the district court \u201cwas required to explain at least that it was cognizant of the stipulation underlying the guilty plea.\u201d But the record shows the district court was not only \u201ccognizant\u201d of the guilty plea\u2019s stipulations, but that it had, in its own words, \u201creviewed the stipulated factual basis in support of the guilty plea\u201d prior to the hearing. The record in this case simply provides no basis for holding Chen\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008) (noting procedural errors occur when the district court fails to calculate or improperly calculates the guidelines range, treats the Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\">. As to sentencing enhancements, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2009). The procedural reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-12\">. Section 2B1.1(b)(15)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides a two-level enhancement when \"the defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from one or more financial institutions as a result of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(15)(A). Although the defendant must have individually <em>derived </em>gross receipts exceeding $1,000,000, \"gross receipts\u201d includes \"all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n. 11(A) &amp; (B)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-16\">.The specific calculation proceeds as follows. Chen derived $1,131,124 in loan proceeds as a result of his fraud and conspiracy. The PSI's undisputed facts reflect Chen paid his co-conspirator $120,343 in purported \u201cbrokerage commissions\u201d and \"fees.\u201d Even subtracting those fraudulent payments, Chen still derived $1,010,781 in gross receipts \u2014 which, by any estimation, exceeds the $1,000,000 threshold of \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(15)(A). Chen has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>provided no legitimate legal or factual argument that any other payments were made to his co-conspirator out of <em>his </em>gross receipts, which is the only consideration relevant to the question presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
