We affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">In 2009, Wilson sued Selma Water Works and Sewer Board (Selma Board) in Alabama state court for allegedly damaging his building. The trial court awarded Selma Board summary judgment and the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. On August 5, 2011, the Alabama Supreme Court denied Wilson\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, thereby ending the state-court proceedings. On August 19, 2011, Wilson filed this case in federal district court alleging violations of his federal due process rights based on (1) Selma Board\u2019s discovery and pleading tactics in state court, and (2) the state-court trial judge\u2019s failure to recuse himself. According to Wilson\u2019s Second Amended Complaint, he \u201cseeks relief from summary judgment of Alabama Courts\u201d notwithstanding the verdict of those courts. Wilson\u2019s claims were subsequently dismissed by a federal magistrate judge after the parties consented to the magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Wilson\u2019s claims are jurisdictionally barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars state-court losers from seeking what would be, in substance, appellate review of state-court judgments in federal district court based on claims that the state-court judgment violated the losing parties\u2019 federal rights. <em>See Brown v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>611 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (holding <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>also bars federal claims raised in state court as well as claims that are inextricably intertwined with the state-court judgment). Because that is precisely what Wilson seeks to do in this case, his claims are jurisdictionally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">Accordingly, the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-11\">. <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-15\">. We review the magistrate judge's dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in this case de novo. <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). Also, we deny Appellee\u2019s motion to sanction Wilson under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and Fed. R.App. P. 38. <em>See, e.g., Woods v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>3 F.3d 403, 404 (11th Cir.1993) (noting this Court\u2019s reluctance to sanction pro se litigants). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>those claims abandoned. <em>See Holland v.
