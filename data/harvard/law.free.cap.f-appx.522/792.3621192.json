She remained here without authorization, and on October 7, 2009 filed an application for asylum with the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">In her application, Petitioner asserted that she was physically attacked in Kyrgyzstan on three occasions because of her political opinion. The first attack occurred on October 15, 2008. After finishing her classes at university, Petitioner met two classmates, Kristina and Marat, to go to the university library. The library was closed, so Marat arranged to have his brother take them to the State Library. Marat\u2019s brother and two men picked them up, but took them to a house, instead of the library. At this point, Marat disappeared, and the three men forced Petitioner and Kristina into the house, where they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>beat them and Petitioner became unconscious. Both women were in a hospital for two weeks. Petitioner\u2019s parents filed a complaint against the attackers, and the court required Marat\u2019s brother to pay a fee. Petitioner\u2019s parents persuaded her to write an article about the attack for the newspaper. The article was published on February 1, 2009, and criticized local law enforcement for failing to investigate the incident and for being corrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The second attack occurred on February 3, 2009. Two men dressed like police officers came to Petitioner\u2019s home and took her to another location, where they questioned her about the article, convinced her that the police were not corrupt as she claimed, and told her not to write any more articles. They caused her \u201ca lot of harm,\u201d so she went to a hospital and did not return to university for four weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The third attack occurred on March 7, 2009. At 7:00 p.m., as she was going home, a car approached her. The men in the car, one being Marat\u2019s brother, seized her, took her to an unknown house where girls were screaming, and said they \u201cwere going to take advantage of her. A man struck her and she lost consciousness. She awakened in a hospital. Her parents filed another complaint against Marat\u2019s brother, with no result.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Following an interview on her application, the DHS asylum officer declined to grant asylum, referred her application to an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), and commenced removal proceedings. Petitioner conceded removability, renewed her application for asylum, and applied for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">On August 16, 2011, the IJ held a merits hearing. After hearing Petitioner\u2019s testimony and considering the other evidence submitted, the IJ denied her applications for asylum and withholding of removal\u2014 concluding that her testimony was not credible, that she failed to provide reasonably available corroborating evidence, and that she had not met her burden for relief \u2014 and ordered her removal to Kyrgyzstan. On October 11, 2012, the Board of Immigration (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision based on her lack of credibility and failure to sufficiently corroborate her claim of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">Petitioner now petitions this court to review the BIA\u2019s decision, affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 208, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), and withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her petition for review, she argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, because the ruling was not supported by substantial evidence. She also argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s alternative ruling that she was required to and failed to corroborate her testimony with specific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">As an initial matter, our review is limited to the decision of the BIA. Therefore, we only address the adverse credibility determination and the necessity of corroborating evidence. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1232 n. 4 (11th Cir.2006) (refusing to address the merits of a claim because the IJ\u2019s decision was based on an adverse credibility determination), n. 1 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">Petitioner argues that the adverse credibility determination was not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>substantial evidence. She testified that she was raped during the attacks giving rise to her application, and attempts to explain the inconsistency between this testimony and the medical records of her hospital visits after each attack, which do not indicate that she was diagnosed with or treated for sexual assault. She argues that it is plausible that she did not report the rapes to the doctors for the reasons given in the U.S. Department of State 2009 Country Report for Kyrgyzstan, which states that rapes were underreported in the country due to psychological pressure, cultural traditions, and apathy of law enforcement. She also asserts that the inconsistencies in her testimony were too minor to support an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We review only the opinion of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230. We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test, reversing \u201conly if the evidence compels a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-7\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">INA \u00a7 101 (a) (42) (A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">An applicant for asylum must provide specific and credible evidence demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a statutorily listed factor. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. An applicant seeking withholding of removal must show that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d if she returned to the country in question. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). An applicant must demonstrate that it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d that she would be persecuted upon returning to her country. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Under the REAL ID Act of 2005,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> credibility determinations are based on the totality of the circumstances, which may include inconsistencies that do not go to the \u201cheart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Such rulings must be supported by the record rather than \u201cpersonal perceptions\u201d or speculation and conjecture. <em>Tang, </em>578 F.3d at 1278. The BIA may base its determination on \u201cthe demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant,\u201d the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account, the consistency between the applicant\u2019s statements \u201cconsidering the circumstances under which the statements were made,\u201d the internal consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements, and \u201cthe consistency of such statements with other evidence of record.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">An adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of asylum, especially if the applicant\u2019s testimony was not supported by cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>roborating evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. However, even if the applicant is found to be incredible, the BIA must consider all of the evidence presented by the applicant. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA must offer specific, cogent reasons for its ruling. <em>Id. </em>To challenge an adverse credibility determination, a petitioner to this Court must show that it was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the petitioner provides \u201ctenable\u201d explanations for the doubtful portions of her testimony does not compel reversal, particularly in the absence of corroborating evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s specific, cogent reasons for the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Moreover, the evidence on the record would not compel a reasonable fact finder to reverse the BIA\u2019s ruling. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1230-31. Petitioner\u2019s testimony regarding the newspaper article that she allegedly wrote criticizing law enforcement was vague, inconsistent, and implausible. She could not recall whether she ever saw a copy of the article or even read it, whether her name appeared as its author, whether her name appeared in the article, or whether her family had a copy of the article. Her testimony that she was raped during the attacks was internally inconsistent, and inconsistent with her prior statements to an asylum officer and her medical records. Finally, she provided details of the attacks in a June 20, 2011 affidavit and during the August 16, 2011 merits hearing, but was unable to recall any details of the attacks when she was interviewed by a social worker during that same time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">On this record, substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s conclusion that her testimony was not credible. Petitioner argues that the inconsistencies in her testimony were too minor to support the BIA\u2019s ruling. Her argument is without merit, because an adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies that do not go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">In light of the adverse credibility determination, Petitioner did not sufficiently corroborate her claim that she was persecuted on account of her political opinion so as to meet the burden for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. Besides her own testimony, her father\u2019s written statement was the only other evidence mentioning the newspaper article that allegedly motivated a retaliatory attack against her for her political opinion about police corruption. She also relied on her father\u2019s statement that she was attacked because her father sued the Kyrgyzstani government for reinstatement of his job. However, she provided no evidence to corroborate her father\u2019s statement, and it is unclear how his suit related to her political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Because of the lack of evidence corroborating the essential elements of her claims for relief, the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was sufficient to support the denial of asylum. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. Because Petitioner did not sustain her burden as to asylum, she also did not meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Tang, 578 </em>F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Petitioner argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s alternative ruling that, assuming her testimony was credible, she was required to corroborate it by submitting a copy of the newspaper article that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>she wrote on police corruption. She asserts that she was not required to corroborate her testimony, and the burden of proof was less than a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\u201cWhere the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii). We only reverse a determination regarding corroborating evidence under INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B), if \u201ca reasonable trier of fact [would be] compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence [was] unavailable.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Petitioner\u2019s testimony was the only evidence presented as to the availability of the newspaper article. She testified that she did not have a copy of the article because police visited and searched her home in Kyrgyzstan, leaving it in a mess. However, she later testified that she did not know if she had ever had a copy of the article. She said that her parents contacted the editors of the newspaper to obtain a copy, but she did not know where the newspaper office was located or whether it was still in operation. Her brother\u2019s wife tried to contact a person who worked for the newspaper and had helped publish the article, but the person had left the country. Petitioner\u2019s testimony alone would not compel a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the article was unavailable. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">.
