In his brief, Swilam raises only general equitable arguments, asking this Court to overturn the BIA\u2019s final order of deportation, which became final in 1996. After careful review, we deny the petition in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in a motion to reopen or a motion for reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>tion for abuse of discretion. <em>Chacku v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2008). A petitioner abandons all issues on review for which he fails to offer argument in his initial brief. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Our jurisdiction to review motions to reopen or reconsider an immigration ruling is implicit in the statutory grant of jurisdiction to review a final order of removal. <em>See Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). A petitioner, seeking review of an immigration ruling, must file his petition for review within 30 days of the order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory deadline for filing a petition for review of an immigration decision is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Chao Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>677 F.3d 1043, 1045-46 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">In this ease, Swilam\u2019s September 4, 2012 petition for review only gives us authority to review the BIA\u2019s orders that had been entered within 30 days of the petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The only order, therefore, that is presently within our jurisdiction is the BIA\u2019s August 21, 2012 denial of Swilam\u2019s May 23, 2012 motion to reconsider. In his initial appellate brief, Swilam fails to address or mention the August 2012 order in his brief, and has thus has abandoned all issues related to the August 2012 order. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Instead, he presents general arguments as to why he should not be deported and references errors that the BIA made in its orders from the mid-1990s. Indeed, in his statement of jurisdiction, he asserts that he is appealing from a May 2, 1992 judgment, which was the date that his voluntary departure order expired. Because Swilam\u2019s appeal of the BIA\u2019s decisions from the 1990s is untimely \u2014 well outside the 30-day window to appeal \u2014 we lack jurisdiction over these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Accordingly, we deny Swilam\u2019s petition for review because he has abandoned all issues properly before us, and dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction as to those arguments that Swilam actually raises on petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
