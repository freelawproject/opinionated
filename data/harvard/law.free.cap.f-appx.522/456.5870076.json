Horton presents five arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for firearm possession. Second, he contends that the district court erred in admitting extrinsic evidence of similar uncharged conduct. Third, he maintains that the court also erred in not granting a mistrial based on the admission of a code-fendant\u2019s incriminating statement. Fourth, he challenges the court\u2019s application of a four-level sentencing enhancement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, for organizing or leading a criminal activity involving five or more participants. Finally, he argues that his 205-month total sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm Horton\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. <em>United States v. Verbitskaya, </em>406 F.3d 1324, 1334-35 (11th Cir.2005). In reviewing an insufficiency of the evidence claim, we examine the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the verdict and affirm if a reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1335. The evidence does not need to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, as jurors are free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence. <em>United States v. Mattos, </em>74 F.3d 1197, 1199 (11th Cir.1996). If a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction even if the evidence might also support the defendant\u2019s theory of innocence. <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1122 (11th Cir.2002). Credibility questions are for the jury, and we assume that the jury answered them all in a manner that supports its verdict. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a felon to possess a firearm, and the government must prove \u201cthree distinct elements\u201d to sustain a conviction: (1) that the defendant was a convicted felon; (2) that the defendant knew he was in possession of a firearm; and (3) that the firearm affected or traveled in interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004). The element of possession, in the context of \u00a7 922(g)(1), requires that the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm, and it may be proven either by showing that the defendant actually possessed the firearm or that he constructively possessed the firearm. <em>United States v. Pedro, </em>999 F.2d 497, 500 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cTo prove actual possession[,] the evidence must show that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>either had physical possession of or personal dominion over the thing allegedly possessed.\u201d <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>138 F.3d 906, 909 (11th Cir.1998). Possession can be shown by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273. The interstate commerce element is satisfied as long as the firearm in question had a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce. <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996). The \u201cminimal nexus\u201d standard is satisfied where the government demonstrates that the firearm \u201chad traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The evidence at trial was sufficient to support Horton\u2019s convictions for firearm possession by a convicted felon. As an initial matter, the parties stipulated before trial that Horton was a convicted felon. Next, the evidence at trial enabled a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Horton had possessed the firearms at issue. Horton\u2019s codefendants testified that they purchased the firearms at Horton\u2019s direction and that they turned the guns over to him afterwards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testimony of the store employees, along with surveillance video, confirmed that Horton was present at the time the firearm purchases were made. The evidence also showed that the gun purchases coincided temporally with Horton\u2019s trips to and from Buffalo, and the firearms at issue were ultimately recovered in Buffalo. The totality of the evidence thus permitted the jury to reasonably conclude that Horton possessed the firearms at issue. <em>See Leonard, </em>138 F.3d at 909. Finally, as the guns were manufactured in Ohio and then sold in Georgia, they had the requisite \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce. <em>See McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support Horton\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">II. Prior Crimes or Bad Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">We review the district court\u2019s admission of prior crimes or bad acts under Rule 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir.2008). However, even if we find that a district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b), the conviction may still be upheld if the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Hubert, </em>138 F.3d 912, 914 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Thus, \u201c[ejvidence of extrinsic offenses is inadmissible to prove that the accused has the propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Veltmann, </em>6 F.3d 1483, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). Extrinsic evidence \u201cmay, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Therefore, to be admissible under Rule 404(b), \u201c(1) the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; (2) there must be sufficient proof so that the factfinder could find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by undue prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>443 F.3d 772, 779 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The probative value of evidence of similar extrinsic acts \u201cdepends upon both the uniqueness of the modus operandi and the degree of similarity between the charged crime and the uncharged crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036, 1044-45 (5th Cir.1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While \u201cit is not necessary that the charged crime and the other crimes be identical in every detail[,] they must possess a common feature or features that make it very likely that the unknown perpetrator of the charged crime and the known perpetrator of the uncharged crime are the same person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In weighing the probative value of extrinsic evidence against its prejudicial value under Rule 404(b), district courts may consider, among other things, (1) the degree of similarity or difference between the charged and extrinsic offense, and (2) their temporal remoteness. <em>United States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d 1216, 1225 (11th Cir.1993). We have held that the risk of undue prejudice is reduced where the district court issues a limiting instruction to the jury. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1353 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the extrinsic evidence of the uncharged firearms purchases. The record shows that uncharged purchases were very similar to the conduct charged in the indictment, and the evidence was therefore sufficiently probative to Horton\u2019s intent so as to merit admission. <em>See Myers, </em>550 F.2d at 1044-45. The record also shows that the uncharged purchases were made during the same period of time that the charged conduct transpired. This temporal proximity further weighs in favor of the evidence\u2019s admission. <em>See Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d at 1225. Additionally, the district court issued a limiting instruction to the jury, which we have held lessens the danger of undue prejudice. <em>See Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d at 1353. The probative value of the extrinsic evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">III. <em>Bruton </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">We review preserved claims under <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides a defendant in a criminal trial the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d and to cross-examine them. U.S. Const, amend. VI. In <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in a joint trial, the Confrontation Clause was violated by the admission of \u201cpowerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements\u201d of a non-testifying codefen-dant, despite a curative instruction given to the jury. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. at 1628. In other words, \u201ca defendant\u2019s confrontation right is violated when the court admits a codefendant statement that, in light of the Government\u2019s whole case, compels a reasonable person to infer the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Schwartz, </em>541 F.3d 1331, 1351 (11th Cir.2008). However, only those statements by a non-testifying codefendant that directly inculpate the defendant give rise to a constitutional violation. <em>United States v. Arias, </em>984 F.2d 1139, 1142 (11th Cir.1993). \u201c[Ajdmission of a codefendant\u2019s statement is not error under <em>Bruton </em>where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the statement was not incriminating on its face, and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant Horton\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>Bruton </em>is only violated where a statement is offered of a <em>non-testifying </em>codefendant. <em>See Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. at 1628; <em>Arias, </em>984 F.2d at 1142. The record shows that Horton\u2019s codefendant testified at trial and that Horton had the opportunity to cross-examine her. Accordingly, there was no <em>Bruton </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">IV. Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. Garrison, </em>133 F.3d 831, 843 (11th Cir.1998). We also review the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1312 (11th Cir.2004). At sentencing, the government had the burden of proving the existence of an aggravating role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">When determining whether a role enhancement should apply, the sentencing court may consider all relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1198 (11th Cir.2006). In particular, Section 3B1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines subjects a defendant to a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). The Guidelines provide that only persons who are criminally responsible for the offense are \u201cparticipants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 1). \u201c[W]hen determining the number of participants, the defendant is considered to be one of the five [participants].\u201d <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir.1994). Further, the application notes provide that \u201ca \u2018participant\u2019 is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense, but need not have been convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">The district court did not clearly err in concluding that the criminal activity at issue involved five or more participants. Horton, as the individual responsible for the criminal activity, constitutes one such participant. <em>See Holland, </em>22 F.3d at 1045. Three witnesses testified at trial that they purchased firearms at Horton\u2019s direction and then handed the firearms over to him. Further, the evidence at trial showed that Horton\u2019s codefendant purchased firearms in a fashion similar to the way his other accomplices made the straw purchases. While one codefendant was acquitted, the application notes to the Guidelines provide that, to be counted as a participant in a criminal activity, the individual need not have been convicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 1). Finally, the evidence at trial showed that another individual, identified as \u201cBlack,\u201d participated in the straw purchases. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding that there were six participants in the criminal activity, and we therefore affirm the application of the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">V. Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">We review the application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n. 25 (11th Cir.2008). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first ensure that the sentence was procedurally reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to calculate or incorrectly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he sentencing [court] should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Once we determine that the sentence was procedurally sound, we then examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). The weight to be given any particular factor under \u00a7 3553(a) is left to the sound discretion of the district court, absent a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Horton\u2019s 205-month total sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable. With respect to procedural reasonableness, the district court imposed a sentence in the middle of the applicable guideline range. The court explained that it based Horton\u2019s sentence on the high number of firearms involved in the case, the seriousness of the offenses, Horton\u2019s attempts to obstruct the investigation, and his failure to accept responsibility. The court also stated that it had considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Horton\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Furthermore, Horton\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable, as the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) supported a within-Guidelines sentence. The record shows that Horton orchestrated several straw purchases, and that he attempted to cover up his crimes by having the purchasers file false police reports reporting the firearms as having been stolen. Additionally, Horton had an extensive criminal history, and the district court did not err by stating that the criminal history points from the Guidelines\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>range understated Horton\u2019s criminal history. The district court properly considered both the nature and circumstances of the offense and Horton\u2019s personal history and characteristics under \u00a7 3558(a) when it imposed the within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Accordingly, Horton\u2019s total sentence was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Horton\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-5\">. Horton argues that, because the primary evidence came from witnesses who were granted immunity and who admitted to engaging in prior criminal conduct, Horton\u2019s convictions were based on biased and unreliable testimony. Horton was able to attack the witnesses\u2019 credibility at trial, and the jury was entitled to judge the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d at 1285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">.
