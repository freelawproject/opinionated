The district court sentenced Pineda Ramos at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range to 70 months in prison and three years of nonreporting supervised release on each count, to ran concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">On appeal, Pineda Ramos argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because Pineda Ramos objected to the denial of his motion for a downward variance, which was based on an assertion that a guidelines sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he has preserved his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Peltier </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a defendant\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to the reasonableness of his sentence triggers plain error review). The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">A sentence within the advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). Although Pineda Ramos contends that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply, he concedes that circuit authority forecloses his assertion and he raises it for potential future review. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Pineda Ramos asserts that the illegal reentry Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based and double counts the same prior conviction to increase the offense level and to determine the criminal history category, a procedure he asserts tends to result in a guidelines range greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). We have consistently rejected these arguments. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); Mond<em>ragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Asserting that he made \u201ca try at a tres-passory offense\u201d and that 70 months in prison \u201cfor an act that could have been stopped simply by saying \u2018go home\u2019 is unreasonable,\u201d Pineda Ramos contends that the Guidelines overstated the seriousness of his attempted illegal reentry offense. Congress has decided that merely attempting to illegally reenter the United States after removal may be punishable by a term of imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). We have consistently rejected this \u201csimple trespass\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Pineda Ramos also argues that the guidelines range did not take into account his personal history and characteristics. The sentencing transcript reveals that the district court carefully made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence is appropriate is entitled to deference, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>we presume that it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 379. Pineda Ramos has not shown that the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in its weighing of the various sentencing factors, and he has not established that the district court\u2019s sentence failed to account for a significant factor or gave weight to an irrelevant factor. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range. The district court listened to Pine-da Ramos\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence but found that a sentence at the bottom of his guidelines range was appropriate. Pineda Ramos has not shown sufficient reason for this court to disturb the presumption of reasonableness applicable to his sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
