Barnett v. Bailey, </em>956 F.2d 1036, 1039 (11th Cir.1992). Dismissal of a complaint with prejudice is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gray v. Fidelity Acceptance Corp., </em>634 F.2d 226, 227 (11th Cir.1981). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo. Glover v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), a district court is authorized to dismiss a suit if subject-matter jurisdiction is not present. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). Similarly, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) permits dismissal of a suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">From a jurisdictional standpoint, it is proper to remove a state court action to federal court if it is directed at a federal agency. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442. We have held that removing an action to federal court may not waive sovereign immunity or equitably estop a sovereign from asserting lack of subject-matter jurisdiction as a defense. <em>Contour Spa at the Hard Rock, Inc. v. Seminole Tribe of Florida, </em>692 F.3d 1200, 1201, 1203, 1208 (11th Cir.2012) (involving an Indian tribe), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 843, 184 L.Ed.2d 654 (2013). In affirming the district court\u2019s judgment in <em>Hard Rock, </em>we approved the district court\u2019s remand of the remaining state law claims \u2014 which apparently involved only individuals and non-tribal defendants \u2014 back to state court. <em>See id. </em>at 1212. Here, however, Bufkin\u2019s suit named <em>only </em>the United States as a defendant, so even if the district court had remanded the state law components of his complaint to state court, sovereign immunity would have dictated dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">\u201cThe United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued.\u201d <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769-770, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941); <em>see also Gregory v. Mitchell, </em>634 F.2d 199, 203 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201c[ajbsent a waiver of immunity the United States is immune from suit in tort\u201d). A waiver of sovereign immunity \u201ccannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 1503, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Several statutes, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity, define the limited terms of the United States\u2019 narrow consent to be sued regarding federal tax issues. <em>Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. at 586, 61 S.Ct. at 769-70. Taxpayers may sue employees of the IRS or the United States in district court when challenging certain <em>procedures of tax collection. See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a) (wrongful collection activities); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7432(a) (authorizing suit against the United States in district court where an employee of the IRS fails to release a lien on property of the taxpayer); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410 (taxpayer may challenge the procedural validity of a federal tax lien, but <em>\u201ccannot ... challenge the merits of the underlying assessment </em>\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Stoecklin v. United States, </em>943 F.2d 42, 43 (11th Cir.1991). Otherwise, the Tax Court has jurisdiction over challenges to an IRS determination of income <em>tax liability. See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6213(a), 7442; <em>Redeker-Barry v. United States, </em>476 F.3d 1189, 1190 (11th Cir.2007). Section 7442 requires that a taxpayer first seek a refund or a credit from the IRS before filing a tax refund lawsuit. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Neither state law, nor other federal laws, change this result. Although Bufkin originally brought suit in Florida state court, he would not have been entitled to relief under Florida law because federal law, as discussed <em>infra, </em>cloaks the government in sovereign immunity as to this action, and the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution establishes that federal law trumps state law. <em>Arizona v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 2500, 183 L.Ed.2d 351 (2012) (quoting U.S. Const, art. VI, cl.2) (\u201cThe Supremacy Clause provides a clear rule that federal law \u2018shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The Anti-Injunction Act, in turn, provides that \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). In addition to the two express exceptions found in the Act\u2014which are not applicable here\u2014courts have recognized two other situations where federal courts may enjoin the collection of taxes notwithstanding the Act: if it can be shown that (1) under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail on its tax claim, and (2) equity jurisdiction otherwise exists due to a threat of irreparable harm without an adequate legal remedy, either ground being conclusive. <em>Mathes v. United States, </em>901 F.2d 1031, 1033 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The Declaratory Judgment Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, generally authorizes district courts to issue declaratory judgments as a remedy, but removes federal tax matters from its ambit. <em>See Raulerson v. United States, </em>786 F.2d 1090, 1093 n. 7 (11th Cir.1986). We have noted that \u201cthe federal tax exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act is at least as broad as the prohibition of the Anti-Injunction Act.... \u201d <em>Mobile Republican </em>As<em>sem. v. United States, </em>353 F.3d 1357, 1362 n. 6 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">We conclude from the record here that the district court did not err in dismissing Bufkin\u2019s amended complaint because he failed to clearly demonstrate that the United States waived its sovereign immunity so as to permit this action. First, because Bufkin\u2019s amended complaint deals with his liability for deficiencies and assertions that income tax laws do not apply to him, he cannot be said to be challenging tax collection procedures. Therefore, he cannot proceed based on the statutory waivers of sovereign immunity in \u00a7 2410, \u00a7 7432(a), or \u00a7 7433(a), all of which permit certain procedural claims but bar claims based on the merits of a tax assessment. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7432, 7433(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Second, the district court correctly found that the Anti-Injunction Act precluded Bufkin\u2019s amended complaint, because neither the statutory nor the judicial exceptions to the Act\u2019s prohibition against lawsuits \u201crestraining the assessment or collection of any tax\u201d applies here. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). As to the judicial exception, Bufkin failed to show that there was no way the government could succeed on the tax claim, as his arguments are frivolous, and he did not assert any basis for equity jurisdiction. <em>Mathes, </em>901 F.2d at 1033; <em>see Biermann v. C.I.R., </em>769 F.2d 707, 708 (11th Cir.1985) (rejecting tax protest arguments). Moreover, he was not without an adequate legal remedy because he could have filed a petition in the tax court, paid the taxes then sought a refund, or filed a refund suit. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6213(a), 7442.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Finally, the Declaratory Judgment Act also barred Bufkin\u2019s amended complaint because we have noted that the prohibition on entering declaratory judgments regarding federal taxes \u201cis at least as broad as the prohibition of the Anti-Injunction Act....\u201d <em>Mobile Republican </em>As<em>sem., </em>353 F.3d at 1362 n. 6. Thus, because the Anti-Injunction Act precluded his complaint, so, too, does the Declaratory Judgment Act. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the judgment of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-11\">. Although an appeal from a final judgment brings for review all preceding non-disposi-tive orders, Bufkin\u2019s brief cannot be construed to assert arguments concerning any of the district court's non-dispositive orders. <em>See Kirkland v. Nat'l Mortg. Network, Inc., </em>884 F.2d 1367, 1369-70 (11th Cir.1989). Therefore, he has abandoned any such challenges on appeal. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
