L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 \u2014 appeal the partial grants or denials of their 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions to reduce sentence based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. In twenty-nine of the cases, the District Court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in full, on the ground that the defendant previously had received the minimum sentence mandated by statute. In six of the cases, the District Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion in part and reduced his sentence to the mandatory minimum prison term. In all thirty-five cases, the court denied further relief on the ground that it lacked the authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentenee(s) below the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-17\">On appeal, each defendant advances these arguments: (1) because the FSA \u201cgenerated\u201d Amendment 750, the FSA must be applied \u201cin conjunction with\u201d Amendment 750 in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Therefore, because the FSA lowered the mandatory minimum prison term prescribed for defendant\u2019s conviction(s), the court was authorized to further reduce his sentence(s) and (2) the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2011 definition of \u201capplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>guideline range\u201d \u2014 in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment, (n. 1(A)) \u2014 renders defendant eligible for a sentence reduction \u201cin light of the FSA\u2019s statutory and guideline changes,\u201d which operate to lower his \u201capplicable guideline ranges.\u201d We considered and rejected these arguments in <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013), which was decided after the appeals in these cases were briefed and controls our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">As in these cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">Hippolyte\u2019s position [was] that both Amendment 750 and the FSA apply in [a] \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding. He advance^] the ... argument that one of the changes made by Amendment 759 to the Sentencing Guidelines ... was to add a brand-new definition of \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d to U.S.S.G. 1B1.10, and that the new definition significantly change[d] the way sentencing reductions work under \u00a7 3582(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\"><em>Id., </em>at 538. He noted that prior to Amendment 759,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">this court had defined the \u2018applicable guideline range\u2019 as \u2018the scope of sentences available to the district court, which could be limited by a statutorily imposed mandatory minimum \u2018guideline sentence\u2019 ... but that definition [was] obsolete because the Sentencing Commission ..., in Amendment 759, defined \u2018applicable guideline range\u2019 to include only the offense level and criminal history category, and to exclude any statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 538-39 (citation omitted),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJU\">we [we]re unpersuaded that Hippolyte\u2019s interpretation of Amendment 759\u2019s new definition of applicable guideline range is correct. Amendment 759 defines the applicable guideline range as \u2018the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.1(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u2019 <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 </em>cmt. n. 1(A) (2011). Section 1B1.1(a) prescribes an eight-step procedure for determining the applicable guideline range. Steps one through five determine the defendant\u2019s offense level. Step six determines the defendant\u2019s criminal history category. Step seven directs use of the Sentencing Table to find the guideline range by cross-referencing the previously-determined offense level and criminal history category. Step eight directs use of Chapter Five Parts B through G to determine various sentencing requirements and options. Section 5G1.1(b) provides that \u201c[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). <em>Thus, when one uses \u00a7 1B1.1 (a) to determine the applicable guideline range, one necessarily is required to take into account the mandatory minimum sentences that may be statutorily required.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 540-541 (emphasis in original). We held that the District Court committed no error in denying Hippolyte\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) for reduction of sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-13\">Section 3582(c) requires that any sentence reduction be \u2018consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 The Sentencing Guidelines explain that a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent with th[e] policy statement if ... an amendment ... is applicable to a defendant <em>but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of </em>the operation of another guideline or statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>provision <em>(e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term, of </em>imprisonment). <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (emphasis in original) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A)). Amendment 750 has no effect on Hippolyte\u2019s sentence because it did not alter the statutory mandatory minimum sentence Hippolyte received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 541-42 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">After addressing and rejecting Hippo-lyte\u2019s argument \u2014 the argument defendants advance here \u2014 we stated that \u201c[w]e agree[d] with every other circuit to address the issue that there is \u2018no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced pri- or to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the denial of \u00a7 3582(c) relief in these cases is</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
