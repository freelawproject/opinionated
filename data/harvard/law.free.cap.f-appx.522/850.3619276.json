On appeal, Matcovich argues that this conclusion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cWhether [a defendant] was \u2018in custody\u2019 and entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings is [also] a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Moya, </em>74 F.3d 1117, 1119 (11th Cir.1996). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and we review its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>\u201cestablished that custodial interrogation cannot occur before a suspect is warned of [his] rights against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>475 F.3d 1221, 1224 (11th Cir.2007). Pre-custodial questioning, in contrast, does not require <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1309 (11th Cir.2006). The \u201cinitial step\u201d in determining whether a person was in \u201ccustody\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>\u201cis to ascertain whether, in light of the objective circumstances of the interrogation\u201d and the totality of all the circumstances, \u201ca reasonable person would have felt that he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d <em>Howes v. Fields, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 1189, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012) (alterations and quotation marks omitted). An interviewee\u2019s \u201cstatus as a suspect, and the coercive environment that exists in virtually every interview by a police officer of a crime suspect,\u201d does not automatically create a custodial situation. <em>United States v. Muegge, </em>225 F.3d 1267, 1270 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">One of the factors a court should consider when determining whether the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d is the location of questioning. <em>See Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189. Although not dispositive, \u201ccourts are <em>much less likely </em>to find the circumstances custodial when the interrogation occurs in familiar or at least neutral surroundings, such as the suspect\u2019s home.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1348 (11th Cir.2006) (alterations and quotation marks omitted). Courts may also consider whether a defendant was \u201cunambiguously advis[ed] ... that he is free to leave and is not in custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347. This is a \u201cpowerful factor\u201d that \u201cgenerally will lead to the conclusion that the defendant is <em>not </em>in custody absent a finding of restraints that are so extensive that telling the suspect he was free to leave could not cure the custodial aspect of the interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Other relevant factors \u201cinclud[e] whether the officers brandished weapons, touched the suspect, or used language or a tone that indicated that compliance with the officers could be compelled,\u201d <em>Street, </em>472 F.3d at 1309 (quotation marks omitted), as well as the duration of the questioning, statements made during the interview, the presence of physical restraints during questioning, and \u201cthe release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning,\u201d <em>Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-16\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, the factors weigh in favor of find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>ing Matcovich\u2019s interrogation non-custodial. The Magistrate Judge<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> determined that Special Agent Cox told Matcovich that he was not under arrest and that immediately before questioning began, Special Agent Cramsey told Matcovich that \u201che was not under arrest, was free to leave, could begin to answer questions and then stop, and could answer only the questions he wished.\u201d In addition, the Magistrate Judge found that Matcovich was interviewed in the place where he had lived for six years. Matcovich has not shown that these findings were clear error, and they strongly suggest that Matcovich\u2019s interrogation was not custodial. <em>See Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1347-48. Further, there is no indication that there were restraints on Matcovich\u2019s freedom of movement \u201cthat [were] so extensive that telling [him] he was free to leave could not cure the custodial aspect of the interview.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1347 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">There are also a number of factors that suggest the interview was custodial, even though explained as being necessary for security reasons. First, when law enforcement officers entered the boarding house where Matcovich lived in order to execute the search warrant, there was a \u201cpolice-dominated atmosphere\u201d with a number of officers handcuffing residents and bringing them to a central location. However, when cuffed the residents were told that \u201cthey were not under arrest, it was just for officer safety\u201d and \u201cshortly thereafter, the search warrant was announced, the handcuffs were removed, and the residents were told that they were not under arrest.\u201d Second, Matcovich was not allowed to go to his bedroom to retrieve his cigarettes, rather, an agent retrieved the cigarettes for him. Special Agent Cramsey testified that this was out of precaution for the safety of the officers who were still searching Matcovich\u2019s room pursuant to a search warrant. Third, Matcovich was required to leave the door slightly open when using the bathroom. Special Agent Cramsey testified that this was for his safety and Matcovich\u2019s safety because by this point it had become clear to Special Agent Cramsey that Matcovich was \u201ca perpetrator and offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">However, these facts standing alone do not render this a custodial interrogation when: (1) Matcovich was unambiguously told that he was free to leave, was not in custody, and did not have to answer questions, <em>see Brown </em>at 1347; (2) he was \u201cin the familiar and comfortable surroundings\u201d of his home, <em>see id. </em>at 1349; (3) he was not physically restrained during questioning, <em>see Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189; (4) the agents\u2019 weapons were holstered when they spoke with Matcovich, <em>see United States v. Luna-Encinas, </em>603 F.3d 876, 881 (11th Cir.2010); (5) \u201c[a]lthough an officer accompanied [Matcovich] throughout the house for safety reasons, he was free to\u201d go outside to smoke and move about the house to get dressed and make coffee, <em>see Brown, </em>441 F.3d at 1348-49; (6) there is no evidence that Special Agent Cramsey conveyed his suspicion that Matcovich was a perpetrator to Matcovich, <em>see Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 325, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 1530, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994); and (7) after the interview was over, Matcovich left voluntarily with an FBI polygrapher and was not arrested until a later time, <em>cf. Howes, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">For these reasons, we agree with the district court that Matcovich\u2019s statements were not made during a custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-25\">. <em>Miranda v.
