On appeal, McLeod argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(13) for involvement in an organized scheme to steal or receive stolen vehicles because her conduct was not ongoing and was limited to only one stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings that support a sentence enhancement. <em>United States v. Ladson, </em>643 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cUnder clear error review, the district court\u2019s determination must be affirmed so long as it is plausible in light of the record reviewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We review \u201cpurely legal questions <em>de novo, </em>... and, in most cases, a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts with \u2018due deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Section 2B1.1(b)(13) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides: \u201cIf the offense involved an organized scheme to steal or to receive stolen (A) vehicles or vehicle parts; or (B) goods or chattels that are part of a cargo shipment, increase by 2 levels.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(13). Application note 10 to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(13) states that \u201c[sjubsection (b)(13) provides a minimum offense level in the case of an ongoing, sophisticated operation (e.g., an auto theft ring or \u201cchop shop\u201d) to steal or to receive stolen (A) vehicles or vehicle parts.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.10). An \u201coffense\u201d includes \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 comment. (n.1(H)). This includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, ... or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A). A sentencing court can rely on relevant acquitted or uncharged conduct that is proved by a preponderance of evidence. <em>See United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1347-48 (11th Cir.2006) (acquitted conduct); <em>United States v. Ignancio Munio, </em>909 F.2d 436, 438-39 (11th Cir.1990) (uncharged conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in imposing an enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(13). The record supports the finding that McLeod was involved in stealing a vehicle, in the submission of falsified title applications, and in the subsequent registration and insuring of multiple stolen vehicles. Accordingly, we affirm McLeod\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
