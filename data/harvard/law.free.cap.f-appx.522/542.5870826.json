Hernandez was involved in a conspiracy with her live-in boyfriend and her brother to skim credit card numbers and transfer them to fraudulent credit cards. She admitted to knowing about everything in the conspiracy and to benefiting from some of the fraudulent purchases. She was held accountable for the entire loss amount of more than $160,000 and for all 180 victims. On appeal, she asserts that the district court committed clear error in denying her request for a minor-role reduction, as her actual role, when measured against the relevant conduct attributed to her, was minor. She argues that she was held accountable for the conduct of her co-conspirators when her role did not encompass their conduct and that her participation was not essential to the success of the conspiracy. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">A district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). When the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and is not a misapplication of the Guidelines, we rarely conclude that the determination was clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 945. We find clear error only if \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">If the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in any criminal activity, her offense level is reduced by two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">In determining whether a mitigating-role adjustment applies, the district court should consider two principles: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which she has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, her role as compared to that of other participants in her relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. As to the first prong of this analysis, the court must assess the defendant\u2019s role in relation to all of the relevant conduct that was attributed to her under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>Id. </em>at 940-41. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that she played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which she has already been held accountable\u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">As to the second prong of the analysis, the court should compare the defendant to the other participants only to the extent that the others (1) \u201care identifiable or dis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>cernable from the evidence,\u201d and (2) \u201cwere involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant must show that she \u201cwas less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in her relevant conduct\u201d in order to receive a minor-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201ca defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because she was somewhat less culpable than the other discerna-ble participants.\u201d <em>United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939); <em>see also United States v. Zaccardi, </em>924 F.2d 201, 203 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cIt is entirely possible for conspiracies to exist in which there are no minor participants .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Hernandez\u2019s request for a minor-role adjustment. Although Hernandez asserts that she was less culpable than the other members of the conspiracy, that fact alone does not entitle her to a minor-role adjustment. <em>See Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d at 1320-21; <em>Zaccardi, </em>924 F.2d at 203. Furthermore, evidence before the district court indicated that Hernandez was not only aware of the scope of the fraudulent activity, but she also participated with the co-conspirators by checking on the status of the scheme, scheduled and attended meetings to exchange the skimming devices, and possessed a laptop computer that had the skimming device attached to it. Hernandez also accompanied a co-conspirator to make purchases and personally benefited from some of these purchases. Finally, as the district court found, Hernandez was a willing participant in the conspiracy over an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In light of the deference we owe to the district court, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred in determining that Hernandez was not eligible for the minor-role reduction. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
