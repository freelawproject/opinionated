United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). Our review of an order entered in absentia is \u201cconfined to (i) the validity of the notice provided to the alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien\u2019s not attending the proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the alien is removable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-19\">Any alien who does not attend a proceeding is subject to removal in absentia if the government establishes by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d that it gave the alien written notice of the time and place of the hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i). \u201c[A] mailing to the last known address [of the alien] is sufficient to satisfy the INS\u2019s duty to provide an alien with notice of a deportation proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Zelaya, </em>293 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). An in absentia removal order may be rescinded \u201cupon a motion to reopen ... if the alien demonstrates that [she] did not receive notice.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-21\">Omobude\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that she did not receive \u2014 and could not have received \u2014 notice of the hearing because no such notice ever existed. She bases this argument on her contention that the government failed to provide the immigration court with the notice it allegedly sent to her. That contention is incorrect. The administrative record contains a notice dated September 23, 1999 that gives the date and location of the hearing and is marked as mailed to the address provided by Omobude.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
