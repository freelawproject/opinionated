Lillo Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b) motion for relief from summary final judgment. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993) (reviewing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion). As the district court reasoned in its Order dated August 16, 2012, while Lillo\u2019s motion requests relief under Rule 60(b)(6), a catchall provision providing for relief from a final judgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief,\u201d his claim actually falls under Rule 60(b)(2), which provides for relief from a final judgment based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u201c[A] party may not avail himself of the broad \u2018any other reason\u2019 clause of 60(b) if his motion is based on grounds specified in\u201d clauses 60(b)(1) through (5). <em>Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 863 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988) (some internal quotations omitted). This prevents clause (6) from being used to circumvent the 1-year limitations period that applies to clauses (1) through (3). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Because Lillo\u2019s motion falls within Rule 60(b)(2), it cannot be brought under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s catchall provision. Lillo did not file his motion within the time allowed under Rule 60(b)(2), and instead, filed it more than two years after the court entered its orders granting summary judgment to the Defendants, making Lillo\u2019s motion untimely. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lillo\u2019s motion for relief from summary final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
