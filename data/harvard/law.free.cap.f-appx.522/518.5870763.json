Bradley, Jr., appeals his 180-month sentence, which was imposed after this Court vacated his original sentence of 225 months. <em>See United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213 (11th Cir.2011). Bradley raises three issues on appeal. We affirm as to all three issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">I. LEADERSHIP ROLE ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Bradley argues the district court clearly erred in applying a four-level \u201cleadership role\u201d adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for his racketeering [RICO] and money-laundering conspiracy offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962(c) and 1956(h). In Bradley\u2019s view, \u201cno evidence or findings of fact ... support the conclusion that [he] organized, led, managed, or supervised one or more participants who engaged in criminal activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Bradley\u2019s contention is meritless. When applying a leadership-role enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1, \u201cit is appropriate to judge a RICO defendant\u2019s role in the offense with respect to the overall RICO conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>210 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2) (providing that, when offenses are grouped under the guidelines, the defendant\u2019s role encompasses all relevant conduct, including \u201call acts or omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\u201d). In evaluating a defendant\u2019s role in the overall criminal enterprise, sentencing courts are to consider, among other things, \u201cthe exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, ... the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Here, the overall RICO enterprise could not have existed, or flourished to the extent it did, without Bradley\u2019s involvement and leadership. First, Bradley exercised \u201cdecision making authority\u201d in purchasing a Puerto Rican pharmacy that, in order to further his racketeering offenses, fraudulently obtained drugs at reduced prices for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>resale in the United States. <em>See id. </em>Second, Bradley exercised a considerable \u201cdegree of control and authority ... over others\u201d in directing his confederates to establish offshore accounts that were used to pay for fraudulently obtained medications. <em>See id. </em>Third, Bradley ordered his daughter and son-in-law, among others, to pay his confederates in the racketeering enterprises. <em>See id. </em>Fourth, Bradley had a planning and organizational role in these offenses, as he controlled the bank accounts used to transfer the wire-fraud and mail-fraud proceeds, and actively participated in those transfers. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in concluding Bradley\u2019s role in the offenses warranted a leadership enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">II. MONEY LAUNDERING ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Next, Bradley argues the district court clearly erred in calculating the total value of the funds he conspired to launder, in violation 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Bradley contends the district court should not have included $2,083,268.41 worth of checks in its $8,494,648.41 laundered-funds calculation, because those checks were not part of the relevant conduct of the money-laundering conspiracy. According to Bradley, because the checks related to separately charged racketeering offenses involving his California scheme, they were not within the scope of the money-laundering conspiracy. On this theory, the district court erred in treating the proceeds of Bradley\u2019s crimes as though they were fungible.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Bradley\u2019s argument is unavailing. In relevant part, the guidelines define \u201claundered funds\u201d to include all \u201cfunds ... involved in the transaction^]\u201d that violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.1, comment, (n. 1). The value of those funds is determined by the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d of the offense. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>651 F.3d 764, 774 (7th Cir.2011). In cases of conspiracy, racketeering, or other \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d \u201crelevant conduct\u201d includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In this case, even assuming the $2,083,268.41 was procured through Bradley\u2019s California-based racketeering offenses, the district court did not err in considering those funds part of the relevant conduct of Bradley\u2019s money-laundering conspiracy. First, in addition to the conspiracy convictions, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt Bradley committed \u201ctwenty-three acts of racketeering\u201d and \u201cacted in concert with others in relation to the fraud schemes,\u201d including those undertaken in California. <em>See Bradley, </em>644 F.3d at 1294, 1297. Consequently, Bradley is mistaken in claiming \u201c[t]here is no evidence from which the conclusion can be reached that\u201d he knew of or participated in the California fraud. Such evidence was presented to the jury that convicted Bradley, it is in the record, and it was sufficient to uphold his convictions on appeal. <em>See id. </em>Second, as part of the California scheme, Bradley not only signed checks and wired money to offshore accounts for his California confederates, but he even personally paid two such individuals $90,000 in cash. Third, Bradley had control of, and authority over, the bank account on which the $2,083,268.41 worth of checks was issued. Specifically, the checks were drawn on the bank account of Bradley\u2019s Bahamian shell company, Intermed, and mailed to his California confederates from another of Bradley\u2019s companies, Bio-Med. Finally, the checks directly furthered Bradley\u2019s racketeering scheme in California \u2014 not just in theory, but also in fact \u2014 because they were part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>of the revised concealment strategy Bradley implemented after realizing the IRS could monitor his offshore accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In light of this evidence, it borders on frivolous to claim that funds derived from the California scheme were not part of the relevant conduct of Bradley\u2019s money-laundering conspiracy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). After all, \u201c[wjithout the fraud there would have been no funds to launder.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mullens, </em>65 F.3d 1560, 1564 (11th Cir.1995). Bradley\u2019s racketeering activities and money-laundering conspiracy were symbiotic components of a network of fraud, and the proceeds of such a network need not be hermetically partitioned at sentencing. <em>See id. </em>(holding a sentencing court must \u201cconsider the total amount of funds that it believed was involved in the course of criminal conduct\u201d when ascertaining the value of laundered funds (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2) (detailing the scope of relevant conduct in jointly undertaken criminal enterprises). In arguing to the contrary, Bradley overlooks precisely what this Court stated in deciding his previous appeal: \u201cwhen a defendant is acting in concert with others, the appropriate conduct to consider for sentencing purposes is far broader than the conduct that drove the original conviction.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>644 F.3d at 1297. Because the Guidelines did not require the district court to segregate laundered funds into discrete categories when determining the scope of relevant conduct, <em>see Mullens, </em>65 F.3d at 1564, the court did not err in including the $2,083,268.41 in its laundered-funds calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">III. VULNERABLE VICTIM ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Finally, Bradley contends the district court erred in applying a two-level vulnerable-victim enhancement for the racketeering and money laundering conspiracy offenses pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b). This claim is foreclosed by the law of the case doctrine. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cAn appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case not only as to explicit rulings, but also as to issues decided necessarily by implication on the prior appeal.\u201d). Our prior decision squarely addressed \u2014 and squarely rejected \u2014 precisely the same challenge Bradley attempts to bring against his vulnerable-victim enhancement in this appeal. <em>See Bradley, </em>644 F.3d at 1299. Bradley has not shown any basis for departing from that decision, <em>see United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996), and therefore the district court did not clearly err in applying a vulnerable-victim enhancement under \u00a7 3A1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">The district court\u2019s sentencing determinations are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">. We review a defendant\u2019s role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 for clear error. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). We also review a district court's determination as to amount of money involved in a money laundering offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Mullens, </em>65 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir. 1995). We review a district court's relevant conduct determination de novo. <em>United States v. Aired, </em>144 F.3d 1405, 1418 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-11\">. Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a four-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level when the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence the defendant organized or led at least one participant in \u201ca criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a); <em>see also id. </em>comment, (n. 2); <em>Aired, </em>144 F.3d at 1421 (noting the government's burden at sentencing is only a preponderance of the evidence). A \"participant\u201d is defined as \"a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,\u201d even if that person was not convicted of the offense. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n. 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
