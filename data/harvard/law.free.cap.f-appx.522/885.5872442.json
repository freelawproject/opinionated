Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.). The district court held that it lacked authority to reduce Moore\u2019s sentence because Moore was originally sentenced as a career offender and, therefore, Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range. On appeal, Moore acknowledges that the district court\u2019s decision is correct under <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 2008), this Court\u2019s decision in his earlier appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues, however, that \u201cthere is a question as to whether the <em>Moore </em>decision has been abrogated in part by the recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">The district court\u2019s conclusion was correct under <em>Moore. </em>As explained by this Court in <em>Moore:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-23\">In Moore\u2019s case, the probation officer assigned Moore a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI following the application of the career offender guideline. These assignments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>yielded a guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government filed a downward departure motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) based on Moore\u2019s substantial assistance, and the court imposed a sentence of 132 months\u2019 imprisonment.... [T]he court indicated that the departure was predicated on the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">In that case we concluded that Moore was sentenced based on the career offender guidelines, despite receiving a below guideline sentence due to the substantial assistance downward departure. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Although Amendment 706 reduced Moore\u2019s base offense level, it did not change \u201cthe sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based\u201d because he was sentenced as a career offender and, therefore, \u201c \u00a7 3582(c)(2) [did] not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Like Amendment 706, Amendment 750 also lowered base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but did not change the career-offender guideline. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, because Moore was sentenced as a career offender and his career-offender guideline range has not changed, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction of his sentence. See <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Moore argues in this appeal that <em>Moore </em>has, at least in part, been abrogated by a recent amendment to \u00a7 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines. Moore relies on the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\"><em>Exception for Substantial </em>Assistance.\u2014 If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) [of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b) ] may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) (Nov. 2011). Moore argues that this provision \u201csuggest[s] that a defendant whose sentence was reduced \u2018pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities\u2019 would not be imprisoned \u2018based on\u2019 the career offender guidelines and would, thus, be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">However, Moore\u2019s argument is contrary to the plain language of that provision and the Sentencing Commission\u2019s reason for this change, to which he also cites. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2); U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 759, Reason for Amendment. The exception outlined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) allows defendants who originally received a sentence below the guideline range due to a substantial assistance reduction to receive a similar reduction to their \u201camended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 759, Reason for Amendment (discussing its application \u201cwhen the guideline range has been reduced and made available for retroactive application under section 3582(c)(2)\u201d). Here, Moore\u2019s guideline range has not changed. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1319; <em>Moore, 541 F.3d </em>at 1330. Therefore, the fact that Moore received a reduction for substantial assistance has no bearing on our analysis. The district court did not err in determining that it was not authorized to reduce Moore\u2019s sentence pursuant to <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
