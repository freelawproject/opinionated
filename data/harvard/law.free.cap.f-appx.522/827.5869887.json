He contends that the district court did not have enough evidence to conclude that two of his three prior convictions were from \u201cseparate and distinct criminal episodes.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 689 (11th Cir.1998) (A defendant may only be subject to an ACCA enhancement \u201cif each of the three previous convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>arose out of a separate and distinct \u2018criminal episode\u2019 \u201d). Ginebra-Vera also claims that the district court erred in using his previous conviction for conspiracy to traffic cocaine as a predicate offense, because under Florida law, we may not assume that the purchase of a large amount of drugs \u201cnecessarily give[s] rise to ... possession.\u201d <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>631 <em>F.3d </em>1187, 1189 (11th Cir.2011). The government responds that Ginebra-Vera\u2019s two prior convictions were separate and distinct because they occurred on different dates and involved different victims, and that this Court has held that Ginebra-Vera\u2019s Florida drug crime is a predicate offense under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\u201c[W]hether crimes were committed on occasions different from one another, within the meaning of the ACCA\u201d is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). The government bears the burden of showing that \u201cthe three previous convictions arose out of a separate and distinct criminal episode.\u201d <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">\u201cTwo offenses are distinct if some temporal break occurs between them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, the government presented evidence that the crimes occurred on different dates. The government gave the sentencing court the Judgment of Conviction and the Information for each of the two crimes at issue. The Information for the first conviction \u2014 one count of robbery with a pistol, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a criminal offense (Conviction One) \u2014 shows that the offense occurred on March 24, 1981. The Information for the second conviction \u2014 one count of second degree attempted murder, one count of robbery, and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a felony offense (Conviction Two) \u2014 shows that the offense occurred on March 30, 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Infor-mations also showed that the two offenses involved at least two different victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">The district judge properly relied on the Informations in determining that the crimes occurred on different dates, and thus were separate and distinct crimes. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (A sentencing judge may consider \u201cthe terms of the charging document\u201d in deciding whether a crime is a predicate offense under \u00a7 924(e).). The evidence in the Information for each offense was sufficient for the sentencing judge to determine that the predicate offenses at issue were \u201cseparate and distinct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">In his plea agreement, Ginebra-Vera pled guilty to \u00a7 924(e) and agreed that his Florida drug conviction was one of his three previous felonies. At the plea colloquy, Ginebra-Vera said he understood the terms of the plea agreement, including that \u201chis three prior felony convictions ... qualify as either violent felonies or serious drug offenses,\u201d qualifying him for ACCA status. Ginebra-Vera did not object to the treatment of the Florida drug conviction as a predicate offense either in his objections to the presentence report (PSI), or in his sentencing memorandum. At the sentene-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ing hearing, Ginebra-Vera did not object to, or even mention, the treatment of the Florida drug crime as a predicate offense. Nor did he object to the facts of this prior conviction as detailed in the PSI. Thus, after agreeing that the crime counted as an ACCA predicate offense, Ginebra-Vera did not argue before the district court that the crime should not be a predicate offense, despite having several opportunities to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Because Ginebra-Vera expressly acknowledged through his plea agreement and plea colloquy that the Florida drug offense is a predicate offense, and he did not challenge this before the district court, he invited any error that he now claims exists. <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, he is precluded from claiming that the court erred in treating his Florida drug offense as a predicate offense under \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">For these reasons, Ginebra-Vera\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">. It does not matter for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e) that Ginebra-Vera pled guilty to Convictions One and Two on the same day. <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.2006) (\"[T]he language of \u00a7 924(e)(1) requires only that the prior felonies or offenses be \u2018committed on occasions different from one another,' not that the convictions be obtained on separate occasions.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
