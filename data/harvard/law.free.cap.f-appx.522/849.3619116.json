On appeal, Eight argues that the court erroneously entered summary judgment against him, but does not raise any arguments challenging the basis for the more recent orders designated in his notice of appeal. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">An appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments, orders, or portions thereof that are specified in the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal. <em>Hill v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3(c) (requiring that a notice of appeal \u201cdesignate the judgment, order or part thereof being appealed from\u201d). A legal claim or argument not briefed before the Court is deemed abandoned, and its merits will not be addressed. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">Here, liberally construed, Eight\u2019s appellate brief contains no discernible challenge to the orders designated in his notice of appeal. Because the validity of the district court\u2019s earlier order granting summary judgment against Eight is not within the scope of this appeal, and Eight has failed to set forth any arguments related to the denial of his motion for reconsideration, motions for new trial, or order barring him from filing future pleadings, he has abandoned all issues relevant to this appeal. But in any event, even if we were to consider an appeal of these district court orders, it would have no merit since the district court did not abuse its discretion in reaching its conclusions. Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-19\">. Nevertheless, we DENY the motion for sanctions filed by J.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>(\"Donnelley\u201d). We recognize that we may, upon a motion, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee if an appeal is frivolous. Fed.R.App.P. 38. But we have been reluctant to impose sanctions against a <em>pro se </em>appellant, even where the appeal is clearly frivolous. <em>See e.g., Woods v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>3 F.3d 403, 404 (11th Cir.1993); <em>Hyslep v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir.1985). In light of Right\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, and because Donnelley has not identified extenuating circumstances similar to those that were present in past instances where we have awarded sanctions against a <em>pro se </em>appellant, we decline to award sanctions here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
