After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">A. Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s Federal Conviction and Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In January 2009, Gonzales-Corrales, a Cuban national, was convicted of a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine in the Southern District of Florida. Gonzalez-Corrales currently is serving his federal 121-month sentence at D. Ray James Correctional Institution (\u201cD. Ray James\u201d) in Folkston, Georgia, with a projected release date of June 11, 2017. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued an immigration detainer for Gonzales-Corrales, which was filed with the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) on October 7, 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">B. District Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Gonzales-Corrales filed a <em>pro se </em>pleading titled \u201cChallenge of Present and Future Incarceration.\u201d The <em>pro se </em>pleading named the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d), a division of DHS, \u201cc/o United States of America\u201d as the respondent. Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading alleged that because ICE lodged an immigration detainer, he is ineligible to participate in the BOP\u2019s Residential Drug Abuse Program (\u201cRDAP\u201d) or to be released to a halfway house and is required to serve a sentence \u201cunder circumstances more severe than those facing\u201d inmates who are U.S. citizens. Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading asked the district court \u201cto move I.C.E.\u201d to lift the detainer so Gonzales-Corrales will be eligible to participate in RDAP, but did not identify any statutory basis for the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">The district court construed Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading as a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition and issued a show cause order. The government\u2019s response argued that Gonzales-Corrales: (1) had sued only ICE and failed to name the appropriate party for a \u00a7 2241 petition (the warden); (2) could not bring his conditions-of-confinement claims under \u00a7 2241; and, in any event, (3) had not exhausted his administrative remedies with the prison before filing his action. The government submitted evidence of the grievance procedures at the prison and that Gonzales-Corrales had not filed any grievances regarding the allegations in his <em>pro se </em>pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">Gonzales-Corrales replied, stating that he was not seeking relief under \u00a7 2241, but rather declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and that ICE was properly named as the defendant. Specifically, Gonzales-Corrales contended that, as a Cuban citizen, he cannot be removed back to Cuba. Because D. Ray James prison houses inmates who will be deported when they complete their sentences, however, D. Ray James prison has no programs for inmates who need to integrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>back into U.S. society upon their release from prison. Gonzales-Corrales maintained that this \u201cI.C.E. rule,\u201d as he referred to it, treats Cuban prisoners differently than other U.S. inmates in violation of his equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Gonzales-Cor-rales did not address the government\u2019s argument that he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">C. District Court\u2019s Dismissal Without Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In a report (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), a magistrate judge recommended that Gonzales-Cor-rales\u2019s action be dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The magistrate judge concluded that Gonzales-Corrales had filed \u201ca \u2018mixed\u2019 petition,\u201d in that it asserted claims under both \u00a7 2241 and <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>408 U.S. 888, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The magistrate judge determined that, regardless of how the action was characterized, however, Gonzales-Corrales still was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his claims in federal court, and Gonzales-Corrales had not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Neither party filed objections to the R &amp; R. The district court adopted the R &amp; R in its entirety and dismissed Gonzales-Cor-rales\u2019s action without prejudice. Gonzales-Corrales filed this <em>pro se </em>appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">On appeal, Gonzales-Corrales argues for the first time that he was denied the forms necessary to exhaust his administrative remedies. Gonzales-Corrales further contends that case managers at D. Ray James prison denied all Cubans the forms to file administrative remedies and that the warden threatened to transfer inmates who ask for the forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Gonzales-Corrales never raised the issue of the availability of administrative remedies in the district court, even though he had opportunities to do so in response to the government\u2019s exhaustion argument. Generally, we do not consider for the first time on appeal arguments not presented in the district court. <em>Sterling Fin. Inv. Grp., Inc. v. Hammer, </em>393 F.3d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Furthermore, regardless of whether Gonzales-Corrales exhausted available administrative remedies, the district court properly dismissed Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>claims without prejudice. <em>See United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that we may affirm the district court \u201cfor any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading could be construed as a \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the execution of his sentence, his \u00a7 2241 petition did not name the proper respondent. The proper respondent to a \u00a7 2241 petition is \u201cthe person having custody of the person detained.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243; <em>see also Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 434, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 2717, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004). In Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s case, that person is the warden at D. Ray James, the prison where he is currently incarcerated. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Instead of naming the warden, Gonzales-Corrales named ICE as the \u00a7 2241 respondent and asked the district court to order ICE to lift its detainer so he would be eligible for these prison programs. On appeal, Gonzales-Corrales continues to insist that he has properly sued ICE and maintains that he is not challenging the prison\u2019s policies, procedures or practices. The problem for Gonzales-Corrales is that he is not in ICE custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Although \u201cchallenges to detainers may ... be brought under \u00a7 2241\u201d in certain circumstances, \u201c[t]he filing of [a] detainer, standing alone, [does] not cause [the petitioner] to come within the custody of [immigration officials].\u201d <em>Orozco v. INS, </em>911 F.2d 539, 541 (11th Cir.1990). \u201c[A]bsent custody by the authority against whom relief is sought, jurisdiction will not lie to grant the writ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Gonzales-Corrales alleged that ICE lodged a detain-er against him, he did not allege that removal proceedings had commenced or that he had been taken into ICE custody. Because Gonzales-Corrales is not in ICE custody, the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the construed \u00a7 2241 petition against ICE. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed without prejudice the construed \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">To the extent Gonzales-Cor-rales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading asserted a <em>Bivens </em>claim against ICE, the district court also properly dismissed it without prejudice. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Bivens </em>held that federal officials may be sued in their individual capacities for violations of an individual\u2019s constitutional rights, a plaintiff may not bring a <em>Bivens </em>action against a federal agency or a federal officer acting in his official capacity. <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 484-86,114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Gonzales-Corrales did not sue any federal officials in their individual capacity. Instead, his <em>pro se </em>pleading named only ICE, a federal agency that cannot be sued under <em>Bivens. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims against ICE.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Alanis-Bustamante v. Reno, </em>201 F.3d 1303, 1306 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\">. An immigration detainer \"serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the [DHS] seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien\u201d and \"is a request that such agency advise the [DHS], prior to release of the alien, in order for the [DHS] to arrange to assume custody, in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.7(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b647-6\">. Gonzales-Corrales\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleading arguably could also be construed as a petition for a writ of mandamus against ICE. A mandamus, however, will lie only when, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant owes the plaintiff a clear, non-discretionary duty. <em>See Heckler v. Ringer, </em>466 U.S. 602, 616, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 2022, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984). Gonzales-Corrales has not alleged that ICE has such a duty, and, in fact, whether or not to detain an alien after he finishes serving his criminal sentence pending a decision on whether to remove him is generally a matter within the discretion of the Attorney General. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 287(d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(d); INA \u00a7 236(a)-(e), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a)(e); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 236.1, 287.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
