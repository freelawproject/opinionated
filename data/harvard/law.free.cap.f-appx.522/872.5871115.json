Abella complained about retaliation by each of the officers. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">Liberally construing his third-amended complaint, as we must, <em>see Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990), Abella complained that Rodriguez, Rivera, Baez, and their superior officer, Bocane-gra, retaliated against Abella for engaging in conduct protected by the First Amendment. Abella alleged that his conduct included displaying a political sign in his truck, reporting police misconduct, and photographing officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">Abella complained that Rodriguez had retaliated against Abella and his family for displaying a political sign, voicing their opinion about the ordinance at town meetings, and filing grievances against Rodriguez. Abella alleged that Rodriguez ordered Abella to remove the sign from his truck; threatened to issue a citation to Abella if he failed to remove the sign; appeared outside Abella\u2019s home and his daughter\u2019s school; and \u201cma[de] signs\u201d at Abella while following him around town. Abella also alleged that, after he photographed Rodriguez outside the school, Rodriguez issued a citation to Abella for a parking violation and told Abella that \u201cthe complaints [he had] filed with the Commission on Ethics [would] not ... do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Abella\u2019s complaint alleged that Rivera had retaliated for the Abellas\u2019 complaints about police misconduct. Abella alleged that Rivera issued Abella a parking citation, followed him home, and then yelled out asking Abella\u2019s wife if she wanted his badge number or the phone number for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>the Miami-Dade Internal Affairs office. Later, during a hearing about the citation, Rivera grumbled about being assigned to the school because of the grievances filed by Abella.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Abella also complained that Baez interfered with being photographed and retaliated for the photos and having a grievance filed against him. Abella alleged that his wife photographed Baez standing outside her house and Baez approached the house to question her about the photos. Because the encounter frightened Abella\u2019s wife, she reported Baez\u2019s conduct to his supervisor. Two days later, Baez noticed that he was being photographed outside the school, walked to Abella\u2019s vehicle, and pushed the camera into Abella\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Abella\u2019s complaint also alleged that Bo-canegra deliberately ignored the grievances against his subordinate officers and failed to discipline them for their alleged misconduct. Abella alleged that his attorney complained to Bocanegra about Rodriguez, but Abella did not witness a change in Rodriguez\u2019s conduct. Abella also alleged that he and his wife filed grievances, and sent letters and emails to Bocanegra about his officers\u2019 misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">To survive a motion to dismiss based on retaliation for exercising rights under the First Amendment, Abella had to allege facts establishing, \u201cfirst, that his speech or act was constitutionally protected; second, that the [officers\u2019] retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and third, that there is a causal connection between the retaliatory actions and the adverse effect on speech.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Hendrix, </em>42B F.Bd 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). The First Amendment \u201caffords the broadest protection to ... political expression,\u201d <em>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 334, 346, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1518, 131 L.Ed.2d 426 (1995), and protects the rights of speech and to petition for redress, U.S. Const. Amend. I; <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Ill. State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 356, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967), and to photograph police activities, <em>Smith v. City of Cumming, </em>212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir.2000). To establish a causal connection, Abella had to allege that his protected conduct was a \u201cmotivating factor behind\u201d the officers\u2019 alleged misconduct, <em>Smith v. Mosley, </em>532 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2008), and that the \u201chistory of widespread abuse put[ ] the[ir] responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged deprivation, and he fail[ed] to do so,\u201d <em>Braddy v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Emp\u2019t, </em>133 F.3d 797, 802 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">The district court did not err by denying the officers\u2019 motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity. Abella alleged facts sufficient to establish that Rodriguez, Rivera, and Baez had retaliated because Abella had exhibited a political sign, reported police misconduct, and photographed the officers. <em>See Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 1254; <em>Mosley, </em>532 F.3d at 1278. Abella also alleged facts sufficient to establish that Bocanegra knew about, and failed to correct, his subordinate officers\u2019 unlawful conduct. <em>See Braddy, </em>133 F.3d at 802; <em>see also Brown v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 667, 671 (11th Cir.1990). Although Abella was not deterred by being followed, stopped, ticketed, and intimated by the officers, those actions \u201cwould likely deter a person of ordinary firmness from the exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">We AFFIRM the denial of the officers\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
