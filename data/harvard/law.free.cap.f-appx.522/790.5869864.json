He subsequently reentered the United States, and on October 6, 2011, was arrested for a state offense. This led to his indictment in this case, illegal reentry of a previously deported alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a). He pled guilty to the offense, and the District Court sentenced him to a prison term of 46 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">He now appeals his sentence, arguing that it is substantively unreasonable in light of the purposes of sentencing expressed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Two of the reasons why it is unreasonable, according to Montoya, is that the court, in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, engaged in a multiple counting scheme, whereby his criminal history was counted twice in the sentence range calculation under the Guidelines; aside from that, the court imposed a disparate sentence \u2014 different from those imposed in \u201cfast track\u201d district courts. After careful review, we affirm Montoya\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence should be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes\u201d of sentencing, including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1),(3)-(4), (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The weight to be accorded to any given \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing purpose is a matter left to the court\u2019s discretion; thus, we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) purposes. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). Although we do not automatically presume that a sentence falling within the Guidelines sentence range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). And a sentence well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (considering the defendant\u2019s sentence was well below the statutory maximum as one factor indicating reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">A defendant\u2019s prior felonies may be counted under both the criminal history score and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992). A court is not required to depart based on the availability of a \u201cfast track\u201d departure in other districts, and may not consider sentencing disparities associated with early disposition programs in imposing sentence. <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1198-99 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">We find that the District Court imposed a sentence that was supported by the record and met the purposes encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a). The court\u2019s finding that Montoya posed a risk to the public of committing further crimes was supported by evidence: (1) Montoya had previously been involved in a street gang and had assaulted victims with a baseball bat; (2) he returned to the United States within months of being deported; (3) he was arrested for the offense of \u201cserious injury by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>vehicle\u201d after his illegal return; (4) he twice pled guilty to driving without a license; and (5) he had been arrested for possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a felony, and theft by receiving stolen property. Thus, after considering Montoya\u2019s history and personal characteristics, including his family and his criminal record, the court properly determined that Montoya\u2019s sentence needed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public from further crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The prison term Montoya received fell well below the 20-year statutory maximum sentence applicable to his offense, further indicating that his sentence is reasonable. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2); <em>see also Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324; <em>Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. To the extent that he argues that his prior felony conviction was \u201cdouble counted\u201d in both his criminal history score and his offense level, his argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d at 1161 (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that counting a prior felony conviction under both his criminal history and \u00a7 21,1.2 constituted impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d). And, although he contends that the court should have focused on his background without regard to his applicable sentence range, the weight to be accorded to any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter left to the district court\u2019s discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>See Lang-ston, </em>590 F.3d at 1237. In any event, the district court was required to consider his guideline range when imposing his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3)-(4). Finally, his sentence did not create an unwarranted sentencing disparity. We have never held that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis, and the district court was not required to depart based on the existence of \u201cfast track\u201d departures in other districts. <em>See Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d at 1198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we find no basis for disturbing Montoya\u2019s sentence. His sentence is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
