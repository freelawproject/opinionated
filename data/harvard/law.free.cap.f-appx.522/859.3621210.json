Mr. Smith also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to compel discovery and his motion to alter or amend judgment. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-18\">After the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Mr. Smith was hired by Marine Contracting Group, LLC to work as a boat hand responsible for installing, inspecting, and maintaining floating booms \u2014 temporary floating barriers used to contain an oil spill\u2014in the waters of Orange Beach, Alabama. Marine Contracting, a contract labor business specializing in the shipyard industry, hired workers on behalf of Oil Recovery Company (\u201cORC\u201d) to work on the oil spill\u2019s cleanup efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-19\">After receiving forty hours of \u201chazwhop-per training,\u201d Mr. Smith reported to work at the ORC offices in Mobile, Alabama. From there, Mr. Smith and Matt Palmer, an ORC employee, drove to Orange Beach in a pickup truck towing a \u201cjet boat\u201d vessel used to deploy floating booms. Mr. Smith worked at Orange Beach for three days between May 10 and May 12, 2010. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>May 12, 2010, Mr. Smith was checking and deploying floating booms from a boat when he fell overboard. Mr. Smith returned to the boat and continued working without receiving medical attention. ORC fired Mr. Smith later that day for being an unsafe and problem employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The next day, Mr. Smith sent an email to Paul Jones, the president of ORC. In the email, Mr. Smith thanked Mr. Jones for giving him a job with ORC, and also explained that he \u201cgently slid\u201d off the side of the boat. ORC did not rehire Mr. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Mr. Smith filed a complaint against Moran Environmental Recovery, LLC and BP America, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Smith asserted three claims: (1) a negligence claim under the Jones Act, <em>see </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104 <em>et seq.; </em>(2) a claim for maintenance and cure under general maritime law; and (3) a claim for unseaworthiness under general maritime law. After a settlement with Moran, the case between Mr. Smith and BP proceeded to discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">At the beginning of discovery, Mr. Smith provided BP with a request for the production of documents. The request included (1) all contracts between BP and its contractors and subcontractors relating to the oil spill; (2) personnel files for all BP employees working on oil spill response; (3) all leases, sub-leases, and purchase agreements for both real and personal property secured by BP for work on oil spill response; (4) all photographs related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster; and (5) all interviews given by BP employees related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">BP objected to these discovery requests as being overly broad, and Mr. Smith filed a motion to compel discovery. In response, BP offered to produce a narrower set of documents, insofar as they existed, including (1) BP\u2019s contracts with Mr. Smith\u2019s employer for the work he performed in May of 2010; (2) documents relating to Mr. Smith\u2019s employment in BP\u2019s possession, custody, or control; (3) documents relating to any decision by BP to terminate Mr. Smith; and (4) any documents relating to any discussions with Mr. Smith\u2019s employer regarding his termination. The district court denied Mr. Smith\u2019s motion to compel discovery, concluding that Mr. Smith\u2019s requests were \u201ctoo broad in time and scope and not focused on the particulars of the action, namely his accident and safety concerns while on the job at the Orange Beach Site, and his subsequent dismissal and employment blacklisting.\u201d The district court ordered BP to produce the narrower set of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">Mr. Smith then attempted to narrow his original request to cover a smaller geographic area spanning over 100 miles of coastline. BP objected again, and Mr. Smith filed another motion to compel discovery. The district court denied Mr. Smith\u2019s second motion to compel after determining that his request again remained overly broad. Ultimately, BP produced a Master Service Contract (\u201cthe ORC contract\u201d) executed between BP and ORC in September of 2010, four months after Mr. Smith\u2019s accident. BP, however, did not produce a contract spanning the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s employment because BP stated that it had not executed a formal contract with ORC at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>At the close of discovery, Mr. Smith filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a determination that BP was his employer. BP moved for summary judgment on all of Mr. Smith\u2019s claims. The district court denied Mr. Smith\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and granted BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court reasoned that (1) it was an undisputed fact that BP was not Mr. Smith\u2019s employer, and so Mr. Smith could not establish an essential element of both Jones Act and maintenance and cure claims; and (2) Mr. Smith failed to establish that (a) BP owned the \u201cjet boat\u201d or that (b) the \u201cjet boat\u2019s\u201d unseaworthy condition caused his injuries \u2014 essential elements of Mr. Smith\u2019s seaworthiness claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Following the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Smith\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and its grant of BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Mr. Smith filed a motion to \u201cset aside[,] vacate[,] or reconsider the final order dismissing the action.\u201d The district court treated Mr. Smith\u2019s motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Mays v. United States Postal Service, </em>122 F.3d 43, 46 (11th Cir.1997). The district court denied the motion and affirmed its denial of Mr. Smith\u2019s partial summary judgment and its grant of BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel discovery, we apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as those governing the district court. <em>See Sierra Club, Inc. v. Leavitt, </em>488 F.3d 904, 911 (11th Cir.2007). We review the denial of a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend a judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>See Drago v. Jenne, </em>453 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">On appeal, Mr. Smith assigns as error the district court\u2019s (1) denial of his motions to compel discovery; (2) grant of BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his Jones Act and maintenance and cure claims; (3) grant of BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his unseaworthiness claim; and (4) denial of his motion to alter or amend the judgment. Additionally, Mr. Smith requests that this court impose sanctions against BP\u2019s attorneys pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We discuss each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">A. Motion to Compel Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">Pursuant to Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil procedure, \u201c[pjarties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). The district court is empowered to order discovery, for good cause, on any matter relevant to the action. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the district court is also permitted to \u201climit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed ... if it determines that ... the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 resources, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Mr. Smith\u2019s original discovery request asked for (1) <em>all </em>contracts between BP and its contractors and subcontractors, (2) personnel files for <em>all </em>BP employees working on the oil spill response, (3) leases, subleases, and purchase agreements for <em>all </em>property used for oil spill response, (4) <em>all </em>photographs related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster, and (5) <em>all </em>interviews given by BP employees regarding the oil spill. Simply put, this request extended well beyond the scope of Mr. Smith\u2019s claims, and it was reasonable for the district court to conclude that such a request needed to be limited to relevant matters. Indeed, the district court ordered BP to produce a narrower set of documents, including (1) BP\u2019s contracts with Mr. Smith\u2019s employer for the work he performed in May of 2010; (2) documents relating to Mr. Smith\u2019s employment; (3) documents relating to any decision by BP to terminate Mr. Smith; and (4) any documents relating to any discussions with Mr. Smith\u2019s employer regarding his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Because a district court is allowed \u201ca range of choice\u201d in such matters, we will not second-guess the district court\u2019s determination unless it reflects a \u201cclear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir.1989). In this case, we find that the burden of Mr. Smith\u2019s original production request outweighed its likely benefit, and the narrower set of documents was sufficient for resolving his claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(2)(C). Therefore, we conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Smith\u2019s motion to compel was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">B. Jones Act and Maintenance and Cure Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Pursuant to the Jones Act, \u201c[a] seaman injured in the course of employment ... may elect to bring a civil action at law ... against the employer.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104 (2006). Furthermore, \u201c[a] seaman\u2019s right to maintenance and cure is implicit in the contractual relationship between the seaman and his employer, and is designed to ensure the recovery of these individuals upon injury or sickness sustained in the service of the ship.\u201d <em>Pelotto v. L &amp; N Towing Co., </em>604 F.2d 396, 400 (5th Cir.1979). Thus, the claimant must establish the existence of an employee-employer relationship in order to recover on either claim. <em>See, e.g., Spinks v. Chevron Oil Co., </em>507 F.2d 216, 224 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">In this case, both parties moved for summary judgment on Mr. Smith\u2019s Jones Act and maintenance and cure claims with competing arguments regarding Mr. Smith\u2019s employment status (or lack thereof) with BP. In determining a seaman\u2019s employer, control is the critical inquiry. <em>See Ruiz v. Shell Oil Co., </em>413 F.2d 310, 312 (5th Cir.1969). Control can often be shown by \u201c(1) direct evidence that the [alleged] employer ... exercised control over the employee; (2) evidence that the [alleged employer] was responsible for paying the employee, (3) evidence that the [alleged employer] furnished equipment necessary for performance of the works; and (4) evidence that the [alleged employer] had the right to terminate its relationship with the employee.\u201d <em>Langfitt v. Federal Marine Terminals, Inc., </em>647 F.3d 1116, 1123 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Because employment status is an essential element to his Jones Act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>maintenance and cure claims, Mr. Smith ultimately bore the burden of proving that BP was his employer. In moving for summary judgment, he was required to produce credible, uncontroverted evidence in support of his position. <em>See United States v. Four Parcels of Real Prop. in Greene &amp; Tuscaloosa Counties in State of Ala., </em>941 F.2d 1428, 1438 (11th Cir.1991). Mr. Smith was unable to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">In support of his motion for partial summary judgment, Mr. Smith relied upon a contract between BP and ORC that was executed four months <em>after </em>his accident. Nevertheless, Mr. Smith argued that this contract sufficiently established the general contractual agreements between BP and ORC at the time of his accident and, therefore, established that he was an employee of BP. Additionally, Mr. Smith submitted his own affidavit in which he asserted that he was a \u201cseaman working on a vessel in the employ of BP\u201d and that he was \u201can employee of BP in that same capacity.\u201d D.E. 102 at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">These documents fail to affirmatively prove that Mr. Smith was employed by BP for at least two reasons. First, the contract he submitted was not in effect at the time of his accident, and, even if it were relevant, it indicated that ORC was \u201can independent contractor\u201d and BP had \u201cno direction or control of [ORC\u2019s employees] in the performance of [their work].\u201d <em>See </em>D.E. 98 at 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, Mr. Smith\u2019s affidavit was conelusory and did not provide any specific facts establishing that he was a BP employee. <em>See Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cMere conclusions and unsupported factual allegations are legally insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d). The district court, therefore, properly denied Mr. Smith\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">We now turn to BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which argued that Mr. Smith was unable to establish (or create and issue of fact) that an employment relationship with BP existed at the time of his accident. In support of its motion, BP produced evidence showing that Mr. Smith testified that Moran was his employer, that Mr. Smith listed Marine Contracting as his employer on his 2010 Alabama tax returns, and that Mr. Smith acknowledged that he was an ORC employee in his email to ORC president, Mr. Jones. The evidence submitted by BP established that Mr. Smith was hired by Marine Contracting to work for ORC, an independent contractor of BP. Furthermore, BP established that there was no evidence that it had the ability to hire, fire, supervise, or control ORC employees. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (stating that, when moving party does not bear the burden of proof at trial, it may prevail by \u201cpointing out to the district court [] that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d). And Mr. Smith\u2019s own evidence, for the reasons we discuss, did not create an issue of fact as to whether BP was his employer. On this record, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Mr. Smith\u2019s Jones Act and maintenance and cure claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">C. Unseaworthiness Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Under general maritime law, a <em>shipowner </em>has an absolute duty to furnish a seaworthy ship. <em>See Caldwell v. Manhattan Tankers Corp., </em>618 F.2d 361, 363 (5th Cir.1980) (emphasis added). Thus, a seaman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>who is injured by an unseaworthy condition on a ship has a right to recovery against the <em>owner </em>of the vessel beyond maintenance and cure. <em>See Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., </em>362 U.S. 539, 544, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960). Although the burden of proof is light, the injured seaman must prove that the unseaworthy condition was the proximate cause of the injury sustained. <em>Nichols v. Barwick, </em>792 F.2d 1520, 1522 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">In its motion for summary judgment, BP argued that Mr. Smith\u2019s unseaworthiness claim failed because there was no evidence establishing that (1) BP owned the \u201cjet boat\u201d or (2) an unsafe condition on the boat caused his injuries. The only evidence submitted by Mr. Smith in response was an affidavit where he claimed that he \u201cwas working on the Jet boat and due to its unseaworthiness [he] fell overboard and [he] was injured.\u201d D.E. 102 at \u00b6 3. Notably, however, this affidavit failed to provide specific facts identifying the boat\u2019s owner, indicating any unseaworthy condition, or explaining how the boat\u2019s condition caused his injuries. Such a conclusory statement is insufficient to survive summary judgment. See <em>Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 745 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that summary judgment was appropriate where the plaintiff relied on con-clusory assertions that were based entirely on her own subjective beliefs).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Upon reviewing the record, we find that there was an absence of evidence to support Mr. Smith\u2019s unseaworthiness claim. We conclude, therefore, that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of BP on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">D. Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">\u201cThe only grounds for granting [a Rule 59] motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d <em>In re Kellogg, </em>197 F.3d 1116, 1119 (11th Cir.1999). \u201c[A] Rule 59(e) motion [cannot be used] to relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, Fla., </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005). For this reason, we only address the portion of Mr. Smith\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion that raised a new issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">In his motion, Mr. Smith objected to the district court\u2019s consideration on summary judgment of an ORC rate schedule brochure that was not produced during discovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Smith also alleged that the ORC brochure did not constitute admissible evidence for purposes of summary judgment. Furthermore, he argued that BP should have produced the ORC brochure during discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Based upon our review of the district court\u2019s order, we find no indication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>that the district court relied upon the ORC brochure in granting summary judgment. Because the brochure had no impact on its ruling, the district court did not commit a manifest error of law by requesting that BP clarify whether a contract existed at the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s accident. Furthermore, to any extent that the ORC brochure was considered, it was superfluous because there was still no available evidence establishing that an employment relationship between Mr. Smith and BP existed at the time of his accident. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Smith\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its denial of Mr. Smith\u2019s motion to compel discovery, motion for partial summary judgment, and motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-11\">. In Mr. Smith's original complaint, this defendant was listed as \"British Petroleum.\u201d <em>See </em>D.E. 1. The name was changed to \u201cBP America, Inc.\u201d in the first amended complaint upon the magistrate judge\u2019s order. <em>See </em>D.E. 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. Mr. Smith's request for \u00a7 1927 sanctions was raised for the first time on appeal. We generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal, <em>see Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1994), and we see no need to deviate from that practice in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding Fifth Circuit precedent decided prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">. The contract between ORC and BP was filed under seal. <em>See </em>D.E. 77. We only quote from portions of the contract that have been disclosed in public filings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b889-6\">. Mr. Smith's Rule 59(e) motion also made an argument that BP is guilty of spoliation of evidence. <em>See </em>D.E. 116 at 2. That argument has been renewed on appeal. <em>See </em>Initial Br. at 10. But, Mr. Smith\u2019s spoliation argument could have been raised in support of his motion for partial summary judgment and/or in his response to BP\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we do not reach the issue of spoliation as Mr. Smith failed to timely raise the issue. <em>See Michael Linet, Inc., </em>408 F.3d at 763.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. On summary judgment, both BP and Mr. Smith included the ORC contract in support of their motions. Recognizing that the ORC contract was not in effect at the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s accident, the district court requested that BP clarify whether a similar contract existed at the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s accident. <em>See </em>D.E. 109. BP responded by indicating that there was no similar formal agreement in effect at the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s accident. <em>See </em>D.E. 111 at 1. BP, however, stated that ORC provided services to BP prior to execution of the ORC contract according to a standard rate schedule. <em>See id. </em>A copy of ORC\u2019s rate schedule brochure was filed separately under seal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
