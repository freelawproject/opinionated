Vaitheesvaran raises several issues on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we address in turn. After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we deny the petition in part, remand in part, and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\n<em>Adverse Credibility Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Vaitheesvaran contends the BIA and the IJ erred in their credibility determinations because they took into account trivial factors, ignored his consistent testimony, and failed to provide specific, cogent reasons for the adverse findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">We review an adverse credibility finding under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). We must affirm the determination \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). In so doing, we will view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, in order to conclude that a finding of fact should be reversed, we must determine that the record compels reversal, as the mere fact that it may support a contrary conclusion is insufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">A credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence, including country reports. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1) (B) (iii). Moreover, an adverse-credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that specific, cogent rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>sons supported the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination. Specifically, the BIA determined that there was no clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination based on the following findings: (1) Vaitheesvaran did not mention that he was forcibly recruited by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), in 2007 until the removal hearing; (2) he was not consistent as to which family members were injured in the shelling alongside him; (3) his asylum application, unlike his testimony, indicated that none of his family members were able to obtain medical treatment; and (4) he never mentioned in his asylum application that his friend died in the missile attack, or that he was beaten with a baton during interrogations at the camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Although Vaitheesvaran offered some explanation for the inconsistency between his testimony and his asylum application, that explanation does not compel a conclusion that he was otherwise credible. <em>See </em>Ruiz, 440 F.3d at 1255. The inconsistencies in Vaitheesvaran\u2019s testimony and asylum application support the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\n<em>Consideration of Vaitheesvaran\u2019s claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADs\">Vaitheesvaran contends the BIA erred by failing to consider the harm and fear to which he was subjected by the Sri Lankan armed forces on account of protected grounds in his asylum claim. Vaitheesvar-an also asserts the IJ and the BIA erred by failing to adjudicate his claim for asylum and CAT relief based on his status as a failed Tamil asylum seeker.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The IJ or the BIA must generally consider all of the evidence introduced by an applicant and all of the issues raised, and each must \u201cannounce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). However, where the IJ or the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we \u201cwill not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">\n<em>1. Past 'persecution as a Tamil</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Vaitheesvaran\u2019s claim that the IJ and the BIA failed to consider the past persecution he faced from the Sri Lankan Army because he was Tamil is unavailing. The IJ found that because Vaitheesvaran only demonstrated that the Sri Lankan government targeted him based on their belief he was a member of the LTTE, the harm he experienced did not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground. The IJ further concluded that neither targeting for forced conscription and recruitment by criminal organizations, nor an isolated criminal attack by six assailants, constituted persecution on account of a protected ground. The BIA also determined that Vaitheesvaran\u2019s asylum claim lacked the necessary nexus between any past harm and one of the protected grounds, as he failed to present any evidence to show that members of a paramilitary group imputed a pro-LTTE political opinion to him because he was Tamil, or that they were motivated to harm him on that ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">\n<em>2. Failed asylum seeker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">While it is questionable whether Vaitheesvaran brought the failed asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>seeker claim in his IJ proceedings, he brought it before the BIA and the BIA discussed it without making a clear finding on this issue. In the BIA\u2019s decision, in the context of discussing Vaitheesvaran\u2019s due process argument, the BIA stated that Vaitheesvaran sought to file \u201cadditional background country condition information to corroborate his claim that failed asylum seekers, predominantly Tamil, face future harm upon return to Sri Lanka.\u201d While it found Vaitheesvaran\u2019s due process argument lacked merit, later in its decision, the BIA stated that even if the additional background evidence was admitted, it did \u201cnot establish that there is a clear probability of torture by the government, or a pattern or practice of the government or paramilitary groups persecuting individuals similarly situated to the respondent in Sri Lanka.\u201d It is not clear from this statement whether the BIA is discussing Vaith-eesvaran\u2019s \u201csimilarly situated status\u201d as a Tamil or as a failed asylum seeker. The BIA\u2019s findings as to Vaitheesvaran\u2019s failed asylum seeker status are inadequate for this Court to review. Thus, we remand to the BIA for further proceedings on this claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Vaitheesvaran further contends the IJ violated his due process rights by refusing to reopen the record and admit a newly released country report on torture in Sri Lanka, detailing the persecution faced by failed asylum seekers.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201cWe review constitutional challenges <em>de novo.\u201d Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cWhere a constitutional claim has no merit, however, we do not have jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Vaitheesvaran failed to show that he was deprived of any rights to a fair and impartial hearing as a result of the IJ\u2019s refusal to admit the torture report. Even if the given report was unavailable prior to the close of the IJ\u2019s record, Vaitheesvaran summarized the report in his brief to the BIA. He cannot show substantial prejudice as the BIA had a summary of the evidence before it, and the BIA mentioned the report in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Because Vaitheesvaran\u2019s due process claim lacks merit, he has not raised a substantial constitutional question. Accordingly, we dismiss Vaitheesvaran\u2019s petition for a lack of jurisdiction in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; REMANDED IN PART; AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\">. Vaitheesvaran has abandoned his requests for withholding of removal and CAT protection on the basis of being a persecuted Tamil by failing to make substantive arguments on those issues in his brief. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). However, Vaitheesvaran does argue he should be eligible for CAT relief on the basis of his status as a failed asylum seeker, which we address separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-14\">. We review the BIA's decision as the final judgment. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). However, because the BIA explicitly agreed with several findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">. To the extent Vaitheesvaran argues the BIA and IJ erred in failing to grant asylum on this claim even with the adverse credibility finding, Vaitheesvaran\u2019s claim lacked the necessary nexus between any past harm and one of the protected grounds because he failed to present any evidence to show that members of a paramilitary group imputed a pro-LTTE political opinion to him because he was Tamil, and were motivated to harm him as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>result. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1). Vaitheesvaran also failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution because he could not establish that his fear was objectively reasonable, particularly because he testified that his younger brother, who was present with him at the refugee camp, continues to live in Sri Lanka without facing any persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b842-12\">. We express no opinion regarding whether this claim was properly before the BIA. We remand because if the BIA ruled on Vaithees-varan's asylum and CAT claims related to being a failed asylum seeker, there are inadequate findings for this Court to review. If the BIA was declining to address this issue, however, there are also inadequate findings for this Court to determine that was the BIA\u2019s intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
