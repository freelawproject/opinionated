Barringer, Sr., was killed January 23, 1978, when the truck he was operating for Stack Steel &amp; Supply Co., a Washington-based corporation, drove off the end of a run-away truck ramp on the Lewiston grade. The complaint in this case, filed January 18, 1980, by Barringer\u2019s wife, Linda, and son, William, Jr., alleges <em>inter alia </em>that the State of Idaho was negligent in the design, construction and maintenance of the run-away truck ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-22\">At the time of the accident Mr. Barringer was, and his wife still is, a Washington resident. There is no dispute that at the time of the accident Mr. Barringer was in the course of employment with Stack Steel. As a result of Mr. Barringer\u2019s death, Washington\u2019s Department of Labor &amp; Industries has paid, and continues to pay on behalf of the employer, worker\u2019s compensation benefits to Mr. Barringer\u2019s beneficiaries, Linda and William, Jr. These benefits are being paid pursuant to Washington\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">Following commencement of the action in 1980, the State of Idaho, on March 12, 1982, filed a third party complaint against Stack Steel. The complaint alleged that Stack Steel committed tortious acts within the State of Idaho which were the direct and proximate cause of Mr. Barringer\u2019s death, and the state asserted claims for indemnification and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">In its answer to the third party complaint, Stack Steel raised as an affirmative defense the fact that workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>tion benefits had been paid under Washington\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law and that under Washington law Stack Steel was immune from any indemnification or contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">On September 8,1982, the State of Idaho filed a motion for partial summary judgment, requesting the district court to (1) declare that Idaho, not Washington, law governs with respect to the third party complaint for indemnification and contribution; and (2) limit Mrs. Barringer\u2019s claim of damages to $100,000 as provided by I.C. \u00a7 6-926.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In February, 1983, the district court held that Idaho, not Washington, law should determine the issues of contribution and indemnification. Motions for reconsideration were filed by Stack Steel and Mrs. Barringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">On March 15, 1983, the Washington Department of Labor, having paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits to Mrs. Barringer, filed a notice of statutory lien pursuant to R.C.W. 51.24.080(2), claiming a right of reimbursement for worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid from any settlement or award recovered in the case. The State of Idaho moved to strike the department\u2019s claim of lien. On October 28, 1983, the Washington Department of Labor filed a complaint to intervene in the pending suit and immediately joined the motions for reconsideration filed by Stack Steel and Mrs. Barringer. The department argued that Washington workers\u2019 compensation law should be applied with respect to both the issues of indemnity and contribution and its right to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">On November 18, 1983, the district court denied the motions for reconsideration and granted the State of Idaho\u2019s motion to strike the department\u2019s claim of lien. The district court held that the Washington Department of Labor\u2019s right to reimbursement from any judgment or settlement rendered in favor of Mrs. Barringer also should be determined as though the department were subrogated to Mrs. Barringer\u2019s recovery pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223(3). Finally, the district court refused to grant the State of Idaho\u2019s request to limit Mrs. Barringer\u2019s claim of damages to $100,000, holding that limitation of the state\u2019s liability under I.C. \u00a7 6-926 does not apply until the state\u2019s liability has been determined at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">On December 12, 1983, the district court granted permission to appeal its November 18, 1983, order and on February 13, 1984, this Court granted leave to the department, Mrs. Barringer, and the State of Idaho to file notices of appeal. I.A.R. 12. The department\u2019s appeal is No. 15438; Mrs. Bar-ringer\u2019s appeal is No. 15439; and the State of Idaho\u2019s appeal is No. 15440.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">THE WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF LABOR &amp; INDUSTRIES\u2019 APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">Two issues need to be resolved with respect to the Department of Labor\u2019s appeal. They are: (1) whether Washington or Idaho law governs the State of Idaho\u2019s claim of contribution and indemnification, and (2) whether Washington or Idaho law governs the Department of Labor\u2019s right to reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid from any settlement or award recovered in this case. We hold that on both issues Idaho law applies and, therefore, affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">The Washington Department of Labor &amp; Industry has appealed the district court\u2019s ruling that Idaho law should apply to the State of Idaho\u2019s claim for contribution for the alleged negligence of Stack Steel, the employer, and the Washington department\u2019s claim for reimbursement of worker\u2019s compensation benefits received by plaintiff. Idaho law allows a third party tortfeasor to defend on the basis that the employer was concurrently negligent, and the third party is allowed a limited right of contribution by a setoff against damages reflecting the employer\u2019s negligence. This offset cannot exceed the amount of the worker\u2019s compensation benefits provided by the employer and surety. The employer\u2019s and surety\u2019s right of reimbursement from the third party recovery is reduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>an amount equal to the offset. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-209(2), -223; <em>Schneider v. Farmers Merchant, Inc., </em>106 Idaho 241, 678 P.2d 33 (1983); <em>Pocatello Industrial Park Co. v. Steel West, Inc., </em>101 Idaho 783, 621 P.2d 399 (1980); <em>Tucker v. Union Oil Co. of Calif., </em>100 Idaho 590, 603 P.2d 156 (1979); <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Adams, </em>91 Idaho 151, 417 P.2d 417 (1966). Washington worker\u2019s compensation statutes and case law allow no negligence to be attributed to the employer and no reduction in the surety\u2019s right to reimbursement from the third party recovery for worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid to the injured employee. <em>See Glass v. Stahl Specialty Co., </em>97 Wash.2d 880, 652 P.2d 948 (1982); <em>Kelly v. Howard S. Wright Const. Co., </em>90 Wash.2d 323, 582 P.2d 500 (1978); <em>Seattle First Natl. Bank v. Shoreline Concrete Co., </em>91 Wash.2d 230, 588 P.2d 1308 (1978). Thus, Idaho law conflicts with Washington law, and we must determine which state\u2019s law should properly be applied to this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">This exact conflict of law problem was addressed in our recent unanimous opinion of <em>Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Products, Inc., </em>107 Idaho 389, 690 P.2d 324 (1984), which had substantially identical facts to the present case. In both cases a Washington employer was doing business in Idaho through its employee. In both cases that employee was injured in Idaho due to the alleged negligence of an Idaho third party \u2014 in <em>Runcorn, </em>the third party was Shearer Lumber Products; in this case it is the State of Idaho. In both cases the third party defended claiming that the employer was concurrently negligent. In both cases the plaintiffs had received worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid by the Washington Department of Labor &amp; Industry as surety on behalf of the Washington employer. In both cases the department surety argued that Washington law should apply barring any negligence to be attributed to the employer and no reduction in the surety\u2019s right of reimbursement from the tort recovery. However, in <em>Runcorn </em>Idaho law was determined to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In the present case, the employer and surety moved to dismiss the third party complaint filed by the State of Idaho based upon the employer\u2019s claim that Washington law applied and that, accordingly, no contribution and setoff was allowable. The district court held that Idaho law applied and denied the motion to dismiss. The department surety first argues that a reciprocity agreement between Washington and Idaho state agencies binds this Court to apply Washington law. However; this issue was disposed of in <em>Run-corn:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">\u201cThe document merely agrees as to who will provide coverage and who will pay benefits for workers crossing the state line. To interpret the reciprocity agreement as urged by plaintiff would require Washington tort law, as well as all aspects of Washington\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation laws, to be applied by an Idaho court in a tort action against an Idaho resident for a tort occurring in Idaho. <em>We do not believe that the reciprocity agreement applies to third party tort actions, or that the legislature gave such authority to the Idaho Industrial Accident </em>Board____\u201d 107 Idaho at 397, 690 P.2d at 332. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The department surety next argues that a conflicts of law analysis requires the application of Washington law as the correct choice of law. <em>Runcorn </em>also disposed of this issue by considering the policies and interests which underlie the different approaches of the Washington and Idaho statutes concerning the Washington employer\u2019s right of limited immunity <em>versus </em>a third party\u2019s right in Idaho of contribution from concurrent tortfeasors. <em>Runcorn </em>discussed the basic fairness of Idaho\u2019s approach as opposed to the extreme approaches taken by other states, including Washington. Further noted in <em>Runcorn </em>was that Washington\u2019s interest in employer immunity is substantially protected under Idaho law since the employer cannot be held liable beyond the amount already paid to the injured employee in worker\u2019s compensation benefits. An injured Washington employee, such as the plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>this case, is also protected under <em>Runcorn </em>from a double deduction from tort recovery by the Idaho rule that the offset to the third party recovery also reduces the employer\u2019s surety\u2019s right to reimbursement from the recovery. Therefore, neither the Washington employer nor the employee are affected by the application of Idaho law. <em>Runcorn </em>also considered the significant contacts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which Idaho had with the parties and action. <em>Runcorn </em>ultimately concluded that \u201cIdaho has strong interests and policies which would be undermined by the application of the less equitable Washington laws. Therefore, we choose to apply the law of Idaho, the forum state.\u201d <em>Runcorn, </em>107 Idaho at 397, 690 P.2d at 332. We hold that <em>Runcorn </em>is controlling on the present issue. This is not a \u201cdifferent set of circumstances [in which] we might choose to apply Washington law....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">This Court has considered a conflicts of law issue in a case subsequent to <em>Runcorn </em>and noted the factors and significant contacts as set out by the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 6, 145. <em>See Johnson v. Pischke, </em>108 Idaho 397, 700 P.2d 19 (1985). <em>Johnson </em>quoted from Weintraub, Commentary on the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 6.8, pp. 277-78 (1980), which teaches that the contacts between each state should not be mechanically counted; rather that the conflict between the states\u2019 laws should be resolved rationally based upon the interests and policies of each state. <em>Runcorn\u2019s </em>analysis was substantially similar to the <em>Johnson v. Pischke </em>approach by considering the underlying policies and interests and the significant contacts of Washington and Idaho in concluding that Idaho law should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The application of Idaho law in this case enhances the predictability and certainty of the law. Other states such as Illinois and New York take the opposite extreme from Washington. In those states an employer is allowed to be sued for complete indemnity and contribution with no limited liability. <em>Doyle v. Rhodes, </em>101 Ill.2d 1, 77 Ill.Dec. 759, 461 N.E.2d 382 (1984); <em>Dole v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>30 N.Y.2d 143, 331 N.Y.S.2d 382, 282 N.E.2d 288 (1972). If this Court concluded that Washington law should apply to these facts, the Court would also have to apply the laws of Illinois or New York or another foreign jurisdiction\u2019s law in the next case, depending on the trucking employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s domicile. Such a choice of laws would result in one Idaho third party tortfeasor\u2019s right of contribution being unlimited while another\u2019s would be non-existent. Idaho\u2019s significant interests would be at the mercy of other jurisdictions\u2019 less equitable approaches to the problem, and the outcome of each case would vacillate between extremes, depending on the happenstance of where the truck owner and employer are domiciled. Therefore, certainty and predictability are better served with Idaho\u2019s law being applied as we held in <em>Runcorn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Of the many approaches which have been proposed and followed in attempting to resolve the conflicting states\u2019 interests and policies identified as factors under the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, the analysis and choice of law in <em>Runeom </em>and the present case are supported by the majority of authorities, which set forth a \u201ccomparative impairment,\u201d \u201cweighing of interests,\u201d or \u201cbetter law\u201d analysis. <em>See, e.g., </em>Baxter, <em>Choice of Law and the Federal System, </em>16 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 22 (1963); Horowitz, <em>The Law of Choice of Law in California </em>\u2014 A <em>Restatement, </em>21 U.C.L.A.L. Rev. 719, 748-58 (1974); R. Leflar, American Conflicts Law, \u00a7 107 (3d ed. 1977); Currie, <em>The Constitution and the Choice of Law: Governmental Interests and the Judicial Function, </em>26 U.Chi.L.Rev. 9 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">Idaho\u2019s significant contacts in the present case are that Idaho was the place where the injury occurred, the place where the negligence and contributory negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>of the third party, the employer, and the employee allegedly occurred, and the place of domicile of the third party, the State of Idaho. As stated in <em>Johnson v. Pischke, </em>108 Idaho 397, 402, 700 P.2d 19, 24 (1985), of the contacts to be considered, \u201cnone has a <em>more </em>significant relationship to the issue before us than Idaho, the place of the injury.\u201d Flowing from these contacts are Idaho\u2019s significant and important interests that third party tortfeasors be allowed a limited right of contribution through an offset reflecting the employer\u2019s concurrent negligence, if any. Idaho has further interests that out-of-state employers do not negligently operate or maintain their trucks in Idaho and that those employers through their sureties should not profit from their own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Washington\u2019s contacts are that it is the domicile of the employer and employee. Flowing from these contacts is the interest that the employer have no liability and be completely immune except to provide worker\u2019s compensation benefits to injured employees. Washington also has an interest in having injured employees adequately compensated and further having safe working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The application of Washington law would result in Washington\u2019s interests being enhanced; however, Idaho\u2019s interests would be completely undermined and unrecognized. The third party tortfeasor would get no contribution whatsoever for the employer\u2019s negligence, and the employer through its surety would be allowed to profit from its own negligence by complete reimbursement for the worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid. On the other hand, the application of Idaho law would result in Idaho\u2019s interests being served and Washington\u2019s interests being substantially although not totally protected. The Washington employer will still be accorded substantial immunity since it will not be held liable for any additional amount beyond that already paid in worker\u2019s compensation benefits. Washington employees or their heirs will receive the same compensation regardless of which state\u2019s law is applied. Only the Washington surety, who will not be permitted to benefit by the employer\u2019s wrong, will suffer. We conclude that Idaho as the forum state has the most significant interest in having its law applied under a \u201ccomparative impairment,\u201d \u201cweighing of interests\u201d or \u201cbetter law\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">At trial, if Stack Steel is determined to have been negligent, then the State of Idaho should be allowed an offset reflecting that percentage of comparative negligence, not to exceed the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits paid to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The department surety\u2019s right to reimbursement shall be reduced by an equal amount. <em>Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Products, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">MRS. BARRINGER\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Mrs. Barringer also appeals the district court\u2019s decision that Idaho law should govern the issues of contribution and indemnification, as well as reimbursement. The thrust of her appeal is that application of Idaho law may result in a reduced recovery by her against the State of Idaho. Our conclusions reached in the Department of Labor\u2019s appeal effectively answers the issue raised in the Barringer appeal. Mrs. Barringer will not be subjected to a double setoff \u2014 one by the third party defendant, and a second by the employer-surety\u2019s subrogated right. <em>Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Products, Inc., supra. </em>Therefore, we need not address further the issue raised by Mrs. Barringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">THE STATE OP IDAHO\u2019S APPEAL A.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The State of Idaho has filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s failure to grant its motion for partial summary judgment. The first issue raised by the State of Idaho is whether, if both Mrs. Barringer and her minor son have separate wrongful death claims against the State of Idaho, is each entitled to a separate $100,000 recovery against the state? The issue, as presented by the state, focuses around I.C. \u00a7 6-926\u2019s \u201cper person\u201d limitation, raising the question of whether the word \u201cperson\u201d refers to the injured person or the person or persons filing claims against the state. The version of I.C. \u00a7 6-926 in effect at the time of the accident clearly provides the answer to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Subsection (b) dealing with bodily or personal injury or death provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">\u201cThe combined, aggregate liability of a governmental entity ... for damages, costs and attorney fees under this act <em>on account of bodily or personal injury or death of any person, </em>shall not exceed and is limited to $100,000 subject to the further limitation of $300,000 in any one accident or occurrence arising out of any occurrence wherein two or more persons sustain such injury and/or death____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\"><em>\u201cLimits of liability above specified shall not be increased or altered by the fact that a decedent on account of whose death a wrongful death claim is asserted hereunder left surviving him or her more than one person entitled to make claim therefor </em>nor shall the aggregate recovery exceed the single limit provided for injury or death to any one person in those cases in which there is both an injury claim and a death claim arising out of the injury to one person, the intent of this section being to limit such liabilities and recoveries in the aggregate to one limit only.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">It is clear from the statute that the $100,-000 limitation for \u201cpersonal injury or death of any person\u201d refers to the person injured or killed, and not the person claiming compensation as an heir. <em>Cf. Packard v. Joint School Dist. No. 171, </em>104 Idaho 604, 661 P.2d 770 (Ct.App.1983). This is further emphasized by the second paragraph set out above which clearly states that the $100,000 limit of liability for the death of \u201cany person\u201d \u201cshall not be increased or altered by the fact that a decedent on account of whose death a wrongful death claim is asserted hereunder left surviving him or her more than one person entitled to make claim therefor____\u201d We hold that in this case the limit of liability of the State of Idaho as a result of any wrongful death of Mr. Barringer is $100,000, and that $100,-000 limitation is not \u201cincreased or altered by the fact [the] decedent... left surviving him ... more than one person entitled to make claim therefor____\u201d Accordingly, the trial court erred in failing to grant the state\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-17\">The state urges on appeal that I.C. \u00a7 6-926 requires that the trial court limit plaintiff\u2019s claim before the jury to $100,000, that is, that the court instruct the jury that its maximum verdict is limited to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-18\">Barringer responds that she is entitled to present her total damages to the jury for fixing a verdict and that it is for the court, following verdict, to limit its judgment entered against the State to no more than $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-19\">We note the statute is silent as to <em>when </em>the court shall take the action, and thus we must interpret the Tort Claims Act as a whole to determine the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-20\">Section 6-903(a), the core provision of the act, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-21\">\u201c6-903. Liability of governmental entities. \u2014 Defense of employees. \u2014 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this act, every governmental entity is subject to liability for money damages arising out of its negligent or otherwise wrongful acts or omissions and those of its employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>ees acting within the course and scope of their employment or duties, whether arising out of a governmental or proprietary functions, where the governmental entity if a private person or entity would be liable for money damages under the laws of the state of Idaho.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3ib\">Thus, subject to the exceptions and limitations which follow in later sections, the state waives sovereign immunity and submits itself to the same liability as would attach to a private person. The sole restriction which the state has imposed in the context of this case is that it will pay no more than $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"A-g\">Were the state\u2019s interpretation adopted, an illustration demonstrates how such would further limit the $100,000 to a lower number not stated in the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_FF\">Suppose the provable damages were $300,000 and the negligence of Stack Steel were assessed at 60% and that of the state at 40%, thus rendering the state\u2019s share $120,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMn\">Under the foregoing illustration, the state would have the verdict limited to $100,000, the court would apply 40% thereto, thus resulting in judgment being entered against the state for $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AX-v\">Under Barringer\u2019s view, the court would simply enter the judgment on the $120,000 verdict at $100,000. This is in keeping with legislative intent, as the limitation expressed by the legislature is $100,000, not $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AfCG\">Further indicative that Barringer\u2019s interpretation is in line with the legislative intent is the fact that the applicable version of the statute, where the word \u201cclaim\u201d was used, contained the following wording:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFf\">\u201c[T]he court shall reduce the amount to the minimum requirement unless the governmental entity has provided liability coverage in excess of the minimum requirement. In this event, the court shall reduce the amount of the claim or judgment to a sum____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Obviously, there would be no judgment on a verdict which would need to be reduced by the court if in fact the jury were to be instructed that it would come in at no more than $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">We note that the 1978 legislature amended I.C. \u00a7 6-926 by changing the words \u201cjudgment or claim\u201d to \u201cjudgment or judgments\u201d in the opening clause and then directing the reduction of \u201caward or awards, verdict or verdicts, judgment or judgments,\u201d rather than \u201cclaim or judgment\u201d as in the former wording.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">The language of the 1978 amendments, which was not a response to judicial interpretation and appears to reflect the then existing practice, seems to clearly reveal that legislative intent at all times was simply to place a cap on the state\u2019s liability rather than to prevent a plaintiff from demonstrating all items and amounts of damage which may have been suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">Accordingly, we decline the state\u2019s invitation to amend the statute by inserting a direction that the court instruct the jury to a $100,000 limitation prior to the commencement of its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-17\">The order of the district court, to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion, is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-18\">Costs to appellant State of Idaho.

The employer Stack Steel has not appeared or filed a brief on appeal. Since Idaho law provides that the employer\u2019s negligence, if any, can be litigated whether or not the employer is a party to the action, there is no compelling need for Stack Steel to be a party to this action. <em>Pocatello Industrial Park Co. v.

The second issue raised by the state in the second part of its appeal is whether or not the plaintiff is precluded by I.C. \u00a7 6-926 from claiming and proving more than $100,000 in damages against the State of Idaho in this case. The relevant portion of \u00a7 6-926 in effect in January of 1978, the time of the accident in the present case read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-5\">\u201cIf any <em>judgment </em>or <em>claim </em>against a governmental entity or its employee under this act exceeds the one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per person limited to three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in any one (1) accident where two (2) or more persons have <em>claims </em>or <em>judgments </em>on account of personal injury or death, <em>the court shall reduce the amount to the minimum requirement </em>unless the governmental entity has provided liability coverage in excess of the minimum requirement. In this event, <em>the court shall reduce the amount of the claim or judgment </em>to a sum equal to the applicable limits provided in the insurance policy or provided under the comprehensive liability plan.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The contention centers around the meaning to be given the word \u201cclaim.\u201d The state contends that \u201cclaim\u201d as used in \u00a7 6-926 is not synonymous with \u201cjudgment.\u201d Rather, the state argues that it refers to a person\u2019s demand for money damages as the basis of a cause of action against the state. In this sense \u201cclaim\u201d is synonymous with a plaintiff\u2019s complaint and in particular the prayer for relief, wherein the plaintiff asks or demands judgment in a specified dollar amount. Thus, the state argues, Mrs. Barringer is precluded from pleading and proving more than $100,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Mrs. Barringer, on the other hand, contends that when the statute speaks of \u201cjudgment <em>or </em>claim\u201d that the use of the word \u201cor\u201d signals equivalancy. In her view, \u201cclaim\u201d is synonymous with \u201cjudgment.\u201d However, this Court has recently stated just the contrary in <em>Sterling v. Bloom, </em>111 Idaho 211, 723 P.2d 755 (1986), wherein we held that when \u201cor\u201d is used in a statute it is in the disjunctive. \u201cThe fact that this clause is joined to the \u2018discretionary function\u2019 clause with the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 demonstrates that the two clauses describe <em>mutually exclusive </em>conduct.\u201d 723 P.2d at 771. Further, as stated in <em>Lynch v. State, </em>175 Ind.App. 111, 370 N.E.2d 401 (1977),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-10\">\u201c \u2018When \u201cor\u201d is used, it is presumed to be in the disjunctive sense\u2019 unless contrary legislative intent is clearly shown. <em>Sutherland </em>Stat.

Bloom, </em>111 Idaho at 227, 723 P.2d at 771, we look to other portions of the Idaho Tort Claims Act in effect at the time of the accident to determine what the word \u201cclaim\u201d means.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The word \u201cclaim,\u201d as used in 6-926, is defined in 6-902(7):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-13\">\u201c6-902.

A common definition of a complaint is a written statement of facts upon which a demand for relief (money damages) is based. Black's Law Dictionary, p. 258 (5th ed. 1979); <em>Hughes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>40 Del.Ch. 552, 185 A.2d 886, 889 (1962) (complaint is a claim for relief or demand for monetary damages). Clearly, then, a complaint filed against a governmental entity under the Idaho Tort Claims Act is a \u201cwritten demand to recover money damages from a governmental entity or its employees....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">To accept Mrs. Barringer\u2019s argument that \u201cclaim\u201d is synonymous with \u201cjudgment\u201d would render use of the term \u201cclaim\u201d in 6-926 superfluous. Two basic rules of statutory construction are (1) when interpreting a statute, every effort should be made to give meaning to each word so as not to render any word superfluous or without meaning, <em>University of Utah Hospital and Medical Center v. Bethke, </em>101 Idaho 245, 611 P.2d 1030 (1980); and (2) when an existing statute is amended it is presumed that a change was intended, <em>Intermountain Health Care, Inc. v. Board of County Com\u2019rs of Madison County, </em>109 Idaho 685, 710 P.2d 595 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Either of these rules of construction would be violated by the interpretation proposed by Mrs. Barringer. It would not only render the term \u201cclaim\u201d superfluous, but would nullify the intention expressed when the legislature subsequently amended \u00a7 6-926 removing the term \u201cclaim\u201d altogether from the section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That the amendment signaled a change in legislative intent is made clear by the fact that the amendment was accomplished by an outright repeal of former \u00a7 6-926 and enactment of a substantially new provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">While I agree with the state that \u201cclaim\u201d as used in \u00a7 6-926 is not synonymous with \u201cjudgment,\u201d I nevertheless do not agree with the state\u2019s argument that Mrs. Bar-ringer should be precluded from proving a damages \u201cclaim\u201d in excess of $100,000. No fair interpretation of \u00a7 6-926 places <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>such strict requirements on the trial of Mrs. Barringer\u2019s action against the state. Rather, I would hold that Mrs. Barringer may produce all her evidence of damages, even in excess of $100,000, but that the district court is required to \u201creduce the amount [of her claim] to the minimum requirement. Since her complaint cannot exceed the minimum requirement,\u201d the court should instruct the jury concerning the law in Idaho regarding the state\u2019s liability under the Idaho Tort Claims Act which should include an appropriate instruction stating that in no event can the jury return a verdict for more than $100,000 in damages on Mrs. Barringer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b844-4\">BISTLINE, Justice.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\">.

Today, as I perceive the situation, part of the earlier majority opinion authored by Justice Bakes remains intact, to wit: HISTORY, Part I, and Part II. Part III of the earlier opinion for the Court, appended hereto, has been modified by deleting entirely the content of Part III.A. As to Part III.A. as now written, I have no problems, and concur. As to Part III.B. as now rewritten, it has now been substantially changed in accordance with the views expressed in my earlier opinion of a year ago, and accordingly I concur therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Other than as modified by the foregoing, I continue to adhere to the views set forth in Part I and Part II of my earlier opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">I.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The majority declares that Idaho law should govern with respect to the issue of contribution or indemnification on the part of Stack Steel, decedent\u2019s employer, if it is proven at trial that it was contributorily negligent in decedent\u2019s accident. The majority relies upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Runcorn v. Shearer Lumber Products, Inc., </em>107 Idaho 389, 690 P.2d 324 (1984), to reach this result. The reasoning in <em>Run-corn </em>is hardly worth such an honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">In <em>Runcorn, </em>the plaintiff, a Washington resident employed by a Washington-based corporation, was injured in Idaho while on the job. The defendant was an Idaho resident. Plaintiff was injured when an employee of the defendant negligently turned on several valves inside a boiler plaintiff was cleaning. The valves, once opened, released pressurized steam that severely burned the plaintiff. Because the employer of plaintiff was a Washington-based corporation, the Washington Department of Labor and Industries paid $22,031.99 to plaintiff in worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">Plaintiff also filed suit in Idaho, and a jury returned a verdict in excess of $800,-000 to plaintiff, apportioning liability between all parties to the injury as follows: defendant 60%, plaintiff 10%, and plaintiff\u2019s employer, 30%. The jury also awarded damages to plaintiff\u2019s wife for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">Testimony revealed at trial that the plaintiff in <em>Runcorn </em>and his employer were partially responsible for plaintiff\u2019s injuries because of the manner in which plaintiff and the employer\u2019s crew were cleaning the boiler when plaintiff was injured. Thus, not only was Idaho the place of injury, but it also was the place where the negligence of <em>all </em>parties involved occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">On appeal, the issue in <em>Runcorn </em>was whether plaintiff\u2019s award should be reduced by the amount of worker\u2019s compensation benefits he had received. Plaintiff argued, as the Washington Department of Labor does here, that Washington worker\u2019s compensation law should apply, which bars indemnification or contribution where worker\u2019s compensation benefits have been paid out pursuant to Washington law.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s arguments and, while acknowledging the conflict between Washington and Idaho law on this issue, held Idaho law to be applicable. The following is the full sum of the Court\u2019s conflict of laws analysis in leading to its decision to apply Idaho law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\">It is possible that in a different set of circumstances we might choose to apply Washington law as the appropriate law when confronted by a conflict of laws. However, in this case both plaintiffs<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and defendant are Idaho residents. The tort took place in Idaho. Idaho has strong interests and policies which would be undermined by the application of the less equitable Washington laws. Therefore, we choose to apply the law of Idaho, the forum state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-6\"><em>Runcorn, supra, </em>at 397, 690 P.2d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">While brevity and conciseness <em>are </em>to be applauded, something is wrong when they are achieved at the expense of adequately explaining <em>why. </em>To perfunctorily declare that Idaho law should apply by merely restating the facts of the case smacks of provincialism on the part of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">To declare that application of Washington law would preclude application of or undermine Idaho law is merely to state the obvious, which is that we have a conflicts case. I believe all of us know that already. Such a declaration is <em>irrelevant </em>in determining which state\u2019s law should apply. Of course, application of Washington law would preclude application of Idaho law. The same can be said in reverse, too. Idaho\u2019s \u201cstrong interests and policies\u201d do not justify, in and of themselves, application of Idaho law \u2014 Washington, too, has similar \u201cstrong interests and policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\"><em>Runcorn </em>does little to improve the field of conflict of laws analysis. In fact, <em>Run-corn </em>torpedoes legitimate analysis in this area of the law. This is' especially borne out in light of what the majority does today. Relying upon <em>Runcorn,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the majority\u2019s approach can be viewed in the conflict of laws vernacular as application of the \u201cbetter law\u201d analysis, wherein the law which is that of the forum is <em>the </em>\u201cbetter law\u201d with no questions asked or answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Even if <em>Runcorn </em>had been better reasoned, the majority would be unjustified in relying on it. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, the facts in today\u2019s case are not identical to those found in <em>Runcorn. </em>First, as mentioned above, the place of injury and the place of negligence in <em>Runcorn </em>was <em>Idaho, </em>the forum state. That is not true in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">It must be remembered that the State of Idaho\u2019s third-party action, by which it seeks contribution or indemnification, alleges negligence on Stack Steel\u2019s part, which contributed to Mr. Barringer\u2019s death. Stack Steel, if negligent at all, is not liable for any tort to the State of Idaho. Its contribution liability, if any, derives only from its negligence to its employee, Mr. Barringer. Thus, the <em>only </em>place Stack Steel could have been negligent <em>vis-a-vis </em>Mr. Barringer is in Washington at its place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">The majority overlooks this crucial point. It is preposterous to argue that Mr. Bar-ringer\u2019s negligence, if any, in driving the truck improperly, can be imputed to Stack Steel under a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory, when in the same breath the State of Idaho has already alleged as an <em>affirmative defense </em>in its answer to plaintiff-Barringer\u2019s complaint the negligence of the decedent. It is absurd to say that the state can get plaintiff\u2019s judgment reduced proportionate to the amount of decedent\u2019s negligence, and then allow the state to require Stack Steel to indemnify it for the amount of negligence in which it was responsible, which is, of course, the decedent\u2019s negligence being imputed to it. Pursuing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>course allows the state to receive a double deduction in damages \u2014 a windfall if there ever was one. Such a course also ignores the fact worth repeating that the state\u2019s third-party complaint <em>alleges negligence on the part of Stack Steel vis-a-vis the decedent. </em>Thus, imputing decedent\u2019s negligence to Stack Steel in this third-party context would be palpably incorrect and unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The only reasonable view of the pleadings is that the State of Idaho has alleged the contributory negligence of Mr. Barring-er in its answer to the plaintiff\u2019s suit, and has alleged independent negligence on Stack Steel\u2019s part <em>vis-a-vis </em>the decedent in its third-party complaint. What is readily apparent, then, is that in no way could Stack Steel have been negligent outside its place of business: the only way in which Stack Steel could have been negligent to the decedent is in providing an improperly maintained truck, or in improperly training the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">It is important to distinguish between the place of injury and the place of negligence that caused the injury. As the comments to \u00a7 145 of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws state, where the <em>conduct causing the injury </em>and the <em>place of injury </em>differ, the first factor is to be given greater weight. The facts of this case adequately reveal the reason: the place of decedent\u2019s accident was <em>fortuitous; </em>it could have as easily happened in Washington on a similarly steep hill. <em>Nothing in Idaho tort law, such as contribution and indemnification, could have deterred the tragic accident from occurring in Idaho. </em>Thus, in such cases, the place of injury should have less reason for having its law applied, whereas the place where the conduct causing the injury should have more reason for having its law apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">This difference between <em>Runcorn </em>and today\u2019s case is critical and, to my mind, determinative. The majority\u2019s refusal to consider it vitiates any persuasiveness it might have had in addressing the issue of this case. The mere and only fact that the State of Idaho has <em>alleged </em>that Stack Steel\u2019s negligence occurred in Idaho is <em>insignificant. </em>Stack Steel denied this allegation. The State has not brought forth one iota of evidence in any form to substantiate its allegation. Yet, based upon this allegation, the state moved for partial summary judgment, requesting that Idaho law be held applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">It is amazing to witness the majority\u2019s willingness to believe in this <em>unsubstantiated allegation </em>in reviewing the district court\u2019s decision concerning the state\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As recently as five months ago, the same four justices in today\u2019s majority held in <em>Theriault v. A.H. Robins, </em>108 Idaho 303, 698 P.2d 365, 368-69 (1985), that in a motion for summary judgment, parties cannot rest upon their pleadings, but must offer affidavits or other evidentiary materials to substantiate their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">While <em>Theriault </em>spoke in terms of a party <em>opposing </em>summary judgment, and her duty to come forth with affidavits to oppose such a motion, it illustrates how the state\u2019s motion should have been properly treated in this case. Here we have two parties disagreeing on a vital point<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014a clearly factual dispute \u2014 but the state going ahead anyway with its motion for summary judgment, relying upon its view of the facts of this case. The district court agreed with the state, and now on appeal a majority likewise agrees. Thus, <em>the </em>critical issue in this case has been decided in a motion for summary judgment upon a disputed factual allegation \u2014 an allegation which <em>if found later to be untrue </em>should lead to a result opposite that reached by the majority today.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">The district court no doubt will recognize at trial that if the state\u2019s allegation of negligent conduct on Stack Steel\u2019s part in Idaho cannot be proved, then the state\u2019s third-party complaint should be dismissed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>As Count III of the complaint properly notes, the jurisdiction of an Idaho court over Stack Steel in this case is dependent upon Stack Steel\u2019s negligence as having been committed in Idaho. If no such negligence is found, then there is no jurisdiction over Stack Steel. Additionally, even if jurisdiction were found to exist elsewhere, Washington law should then be held to apply for the reasons I have stated and pursuant to the analysis which I will now delineate.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">1. <em>The Method of Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In <em>Johnson v. Pischke, </em>108 Idaho 19, 700 P.2d 19 (1985), this Court adopted and applied the \u201cmost significant contacts\u201d analysis found in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Law </em>for tort cases. Thus, my analysis is based on the Restatement\u2019s approach for determining which state\u2019s law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">I begin with \u00a7 184, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">Recovery for tort or wrongful death will not be permitted in any state if the defendant is declared immune from such liability by the workmen\u2019s compensation statute of a state under which the defendant is required to provide insurance against the particular risk and under which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">(a)the plaintiff has obtained an award for the injury____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">It is readily apparent that Stack Steel, having provided workers\u2019 compensation benefits under Washington law to Mrs. Barringer, is immune from liability <em>to her </em>in light of the blanket immunity in which Washington\u2019s Industrial Insurance Act clothes its employers. Comment C to \u00a7 184, however, states that the same result is not always true when contribution and indemnification are involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-11\">A person who is declared immune from liability for tort or wrongful death to an injured employee or his dependents by an applicable workmen\u2019s compensation statute may nevertheless be liable for contribution or indemnity to a third person against whom a judgment in tort or wrongful death has been obtained on account of the injury. Whether he will so be held liable is determined by the law selected by application of the rule of \u00a7 173.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Thus, I turn to the rule found in \u00a7 173, which states: \u201cThe law selected by application of the rule of \u00a7 145 determines whether one tortfeasor has a right to contribution or indemnity against another tortfeasor.\u201d Section 145 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-14\">(1) The rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-15\">(2) Contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-16\">(a) the place where the injury occurred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-17\">(b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-18\">(c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-19\">(d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-20\">These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-21\">Finally, \u00a7 6 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-22\">(1) A court, subject to constitutional restrictions, will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-23\">(2) When there is no such directive, the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law include</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-24\">(a) the needs of the interstate and international systems,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-25\">(b) the relevant policies of the forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-26\">(c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>(d) the protection of justified expectations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-4\">(e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">(f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">(g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The group of principles and factors set forth above are not to be mechanically applied; rather, they are to be analyzed and applied based upon the substantive issues they implicate. As this Court stated in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>in quoting Weintraub, <em>Commentary of the Conflict of Laws, </em>\u00a7 6.8, pp. 277-78 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">Whether or not a particular contact with a state is significant for conflicts purposes cannot be known until one first knows exactly what domestic tort rules are in conflict and what the policies underlying those rules are. Only then can one intelligently \u201cevaluate\u201d rather than mechanically count the contacts. A dozen contacts with an occurrence may fail to give a state any interest in having its rule applied to determine consequences of that occurrence. One contact may make the policies underlying a state\u2019s rule directly and rationally applicable to the case being decided. Once each of two states has a contact with an occurrence such that each state has an interest in having a different rule applied to determine controversies flowing from that occurrence, there is a real conflict that should be resolved rationally and not by counting contacts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">2. <em>The Analysis Applied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">I resort to \u00a7 145 to ascertain the relevant and important contacts to be applied when applying the test set forth in \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Beginning with \u00a7 145(2)(a), I note that the accident giving rise to plaintiff\u2019s suit occurred in Idaho. Nevertheless, it is true that with respect to the State of Idaho\u2019s claim against Stack Steel for negligence <em>vis-a-vis </em>the decedent, the fact that the accident occurred in Idaho was <em>fortuitous, </em>as I mentioned above. This diminishes the importance of this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">Subsection (2)(b) \u2014 the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred \u2014 favors application of Washington law. As I have pointed out, the State of Idaho\u2019s third-party action, by which it seeks contribution or indemnification, <em>alleges negligence on Stack Steel\u2019s part, </em>which contributed to Mr. Barringer\u2019s death. This alleged negligence \u2014 this \u201cconduct causing the injury\u201d\u2014 must have occurred, if at all, in <em>Washington </em>at Stack Steel\u2019s place of business. This fact favors application of Washington law, which would be the most interested in governing conduct occurring in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">Subsection (2)(c) \u2014 the residence of the parties \u2014 favors neither party materially. Stack Steel is a Washington-based corporation. The State of Idaho speaks for itself. Both parties, obviously, have an interest in having the law of their respective jurisdictions apply. The fact that Mr. Barringer was, and Mrs. Barringer is, a Washington resident, is of little importance on this issue, for determination of which law applies with respect to contribution and indemnification does not materially alter Mrs. Bar-ringer\u2019s suit against the State of Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">Subsection (2)(d) \u2014 the place where the relationship between the parties is centered \u2014 favors Washington law. At first glance this may not appear to be so, for there does not appear to be any relationship in which to center when only Stack Steel and the State of Idaho are considered. Nevertheless, upon closer inspection it is clear that the <em>crucial relationship on this point is the one between Stack Steel and Mr. Barringer. </em>Again, the State of Idaho\u2019s claim needs to be reviewed. The State\u2019s claim for contribution or indemnification is grounded in its allegation that Stack Steel was negligent toward the decedent, Mr. Barringer. That relationship was centered in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">I am cognizant that it is the accident in Idaho which brings the parties before us today. <em>Nevertheless, I cannot emphasize enough that the State\u2019s claim is for con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>tribution. Stack Steel, if negligent at all, is not liable for any tort to the State of Idaho. Its contribution liability, if any, only derives from its negligence to its employee, Mr. Barringer, and in this context the relationship\u2019s focal point is Washington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Therefore, with respect to the issue of employer immunity from contribution liability, the factors enumerated in \u00a7 145 favor application of Washington law. As the factors set forth in \u00a7 145 indicate, the contribution and indemnification issue <em>depends upon the relationship and conduct between Slack Steel and its employee, Mr. Barringer, which relationship was centered in Washington. </em>With the above said and done, the contacts discussed need to be considered in light of the choice-of-law principles of \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">I begin with subsection (2)(a) \u2014 the needs of the interstate system. Comments to this subsection state that the issues raised by this factor include the harmonious relations between states, the facilitation of commercial intercourse between states, and the adoption of the same choice of law rules by the states.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">With respect to the first two issues specified, I find the first one to be of little consequence \u2014 the interests of each state, which I will describe more fully below, cannot be harmoniously accommodated. The second issue \u2014 promoting interstate commercial activity \u2014 weighs in favor of applying Washington law. A Washington employer required under Washington law to pay set premiums, does so with the expectation that should worker accidents arise, they will be completely compensated for pursuant to the Industrial Insurance Act, with there being no chance of any suit or third-party action brought against it. Should this expectation be eliminated because a worker, <em>although paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits under Washington law, </em>is injured in another state, the employer may be less inclined to engage in such interstate business (where benefits will be paid under Washington law, affecting the employer\u2019s premiums, even though injury occurs out of the state). At the least, the employer may decline to pay premiums to cover its employees\u2019 activities outside Washington. While these reasons are not of paramount significance, they do militate toward having Washington law apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">With respect to the third issue mentioned, there is a dearth of case law on this topic, primarily because a great majority of the states have judicially held or statutorily declared that an employer whose concurring negligence contributed to an employee\u2019s injury cannot be sued directly or joined by a third party as a joint tort-feasor, whether under contribution statutes or at common law. 2A A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 76.20, 76.-81.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence, the possibility that this conflict of law between allowing or not allowing contribution will arise has been minimal. I have, however, found one case directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">In <em>Elston v. Industrial Lift Truck Co., </em>420 Pa. 97, 216 A.2d 318 (1966), a Pennsylvania worker brought an action in a Pennsylvania court against a Pennsylvania manufacturer of a lift truck for damages incurred while in the course of employment. The worker was injur\u00e9d in New Jersey, and workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid pursuant to New Jersey law, which, as Washington law does, prohibits any form of contribution from the employer. The lift truck manufacturer sought contribution from the worker\u2019s employer, a New Jersey employer. At the time of the accident, Pennsylvania law, in conflict with New Jersey law, allowed a limited contribution to the extent of workers\u2019 compensation bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>fits paid by the employer as does Idaho law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied an analysis similar to that of the <em>Restatement </em>and held that New Jersey law should apply. The court said in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\"><em>New Jersey has the paramount interest in the manner by which its workmen\u2019s compensation program will be administered. </em>New Jersey has undertaken to define the obligations of an employer for injuries to his employees and makes that obligation the exclusive liability of the employer. ... In return for providing compensation benefits for any and all injuries which arise in the course of employment, irrespective of fault, the employer is not only granted immunity from common law liability, but is also given a right of subrogation to the extent of compensation benefits paid in the event a third-party tortfeasor is held liable for the injury____ This right of subrogation exists irrespective of the fact that the employer may have been concurrently negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\"><em>Elston, supra, </em>216 A.2d at 323 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">In resolving the instant conflict, <em>it is significant to note that the Pennsylvania policy in favor of permitting contribution between joint tortfeasors has been subjected to modification when that policy conflicts with our workmen\u2019s compensation program. The limitation imposed on the extent to which the employer is subjected to liability to the third-party tortfeasor reflects a paramount concern with the policies underlying workmen\u2019s compensation and the priority of those policies over the equities underlying contribution. Id. </em>at 324 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The <em>Elston </em>opinion is sound law \u2014 it is based upon reason and presents unassailable logic. Thus, this Court\u2019s following its lead in this case would not only mean reaching the right result for the right reasons, but would further establish in the interstate system a principled approach to the difficult problem before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-13\">Subsection (2)(b) \u2014 the relevant policies of Idaho \u2014 are easily outlined. Idaho, as the forum state, has an interest in favoring contribution between tort-feasors. As this Court said in <em>Masters v. State, </em>105 Idaho 197, 200, 668 P.2d 73, 76 (1982), \u201cContribution is a remedy deeply rooted in the principles of equity, fair play and justice.\u201d The policy underlying contribution, however, has been <em>modified in Idaho </em>when it conflicts with our workers\u2019 compensation scheme \u2014 as previously noted, in Idaho, contribution from an employer is limited to the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for which the employer is liable. <em>Tucker, supra. </em>This limitation, as the <em>Elston </em>court pointed out, reflects a paramount concern in Idaho \u2014 the forum state \u2014 with the underlying policies of workers\u2019 compensation, and the priority of those policies over the equities underlying contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Subsection (2)(c) \u2014 the relevant policies of Washington \u2014 are likewise easily described. Washington law is unequivocal in declaring that employers are not to be held liable from any suit or claim of contribution in cases such as this one. The granting of immunity is the <em>quid pro quo </em>for a Washington employer\u2019s paying set premiums into the state\u2019s Industrial Insurance Fund. Disrupting that immunity undermines the incentive on the employer\u2019s part to pay its premium and be covered by the Fund. As noted above in the <em>Elston </em>case, this immunity interest is extremely important to smooth-working and effective workers\u2019 compensation, and when such an interest is weighed against those interests underlying a limited contribution, it has been held to be of paramount interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Section 145 of the <em>Restatement </em>states that subsections (2)(d) \u2014 the protection of justified expectations \u2014 and (2)(f) \u2014 certainty of result \u2014 are insignificant in the area of determining which state\u2019s tort law is applicable. While I agree in general, the facts of this case indicate they are important considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Stack Steel has a justified expectation that its paying into Washington\u2019s Industrial Insurance Fund will insulate it from liability <em>where workers\u2019 compensation benefits are paid under Washington law. </em>This, I conclude, is a weighty expectation. The State of Idaho, however, likewise has an expectation that the general law of contribution and indemnification in Idaho will apply to suits brought against it in a court of this state. This, too, is a weighty expectation, which I hold to be equal to that of Stack Steel. Accordingly, subsection (2)(d) is inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Subsection (2)(e) \u2014 basic policies underlying this area of law \u2014 have been set forth above in our discussion of subsections (2)(b) and (2)(c). My conclusion is that both Idaho and Washington recognize \u2014 to varying degrees \u2014 that the underlying policies of workers\u2019 compensation is paramount to those of contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Subsection (2)(f) \u2014 certainty and predictability \u2014 and (2)(g) \u2014 ease in determination and application of the law to be applied\u2014 appear to me to favor having Washington law apply. The majority declares that application of Idaho law will enhance certainty and predictability. This argument does not favor the majority at all. It is true that the majority has guaranteed certainty and predictability in this area of law by declaring, as it has done for all practical purposes, that Idaho law always will apply. I do not believe, however, that this is the type of certainty and predictability the authors of the <em>Restatement </em>envisioned when they wrote \u00a7 6. If it were, why bother with conflict of laws analyses at all, and, instead, simply say that the law of the forum state will always apply? That would guarantee certainty. It would also establish provincialism as a governing rule of law \u2014 a rather discomforting thought for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Conflict of laws decisions depend upon the particular facts and policies of the specific case at hand. By their nature, they must be decided on a case-by-case approach. Thus, differences in result <em>will </em>occur. This should not be shocking or disturbing. The certainty and predictability the <em>Restatement </em>envisions, I believe, relates to the implementation and application of a proper and fair analysis of the issue by which any given set of facts can be applied to it and a result reached that is reasonable and foreseeable. This I do not find in today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">3. <em>Conclusions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">My analysis pursuant to \u00a7 145 and \u00a7 6 leads to the conclusion that Washington law should govern the issue of contribution and indemnification. My conclusion is based on the fact that of all the policies underlying the factors mentioned in \u00a7 145, only one \u2014 place of injury favors applying Idaho law. Furthermore, the policy reasons underlying mention of that one factor are not significant in this case. As I stated above, where the <em>place of conduct causing the injury </em>and the <em>place of injury </em>differ, more weight should be given the former factor. In this case, the place of decedent\u2019s accident was <em>fortuitous; </em>it could have as easily happened in Washington on a similarly steep hill. <em>Nothing in Idaho tort law, such as contribution and indemnification, could have in any way deterred the tragic accident from occurring in Idaho. </em>Accordingly, the policy reasons underlying reference to \u00a7 145(2)(a) are minimal at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">None of the reasons and policies underlying mention of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 6 support application of Idaho law, although some are inconclusive. Accordingly, I would hold, as to the Washington Department of Labor\u2019s appeal, that Washington law governing contribution and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>demnification should apply. I, therefore, would reverse the district court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">After holding that Idaho law governs the issue of contribution and indemnification, the majority next holds that Idaho law also governs the right of reimbursement of the Department of Labor \u2014 the agency paying out worker\u2019s compensation benefits to decedent\u2019s beneficiaries. This result is only possible by <em>pretending </em>that <em>Idaho </em>worker\u2019s compensation benefits have been paid out. Only then does it make sense to apply Idaho\u2019s law governing contribution in worker\u2019s compensation related cases. As the facts reveal, however, this is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Section 185 of the <em>Restatement </em>is right on point as to this issue, and completely contradicts the majority\u2019s holding. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">The local law of the state under whose workmen\u2019s compensation statute an employee has received an award for an injury determines what interest the person who paid the award has in any recovery for tort or wrongful death that the employee may obtain against a third person on account of the same injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">This conclusion is sound. Unlike the first issue, which involved a conflict of laws involving competing legitimate state interests, only Washington has an interest in having its law apply on this point. <em>Idaho, the forum state, does not have such an interest in this case, for Idaho worker\u2019s compensation benefits have not been paid. </em>Only the state that has paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits has a legitimate interest in having its laws regarding reimbursement in worker\u2019s compensation cases apply; I can think of no sound reason why Idaho, as the forum state, would want its reimbursement scheme to apply where worker\u2019s compensation benefits have not been paid under Idaho law. I would accordingly reverse the district court on this point, and hold that Washington law governs the Department of Labor\u2019s rights of reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">THE STATE OF IDAHO\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">The State of Idaho has filed an appeal from the trial court\u2019s failure to grant its motion for partial summary judgment. The first issue raised by the State of Idaho is whether or not both Mrs. Barringer and her minor son have separate wrongful death claims for which each is entitled to a separate recovery against the State of Idaho. The issue, as presented by the State of Idaho, focuses around I.C. \u00a7 6-926\u2019s \u201cper person\u201d limitation, raising the question of whether the word \u201cperson\u201d refers to the injured person or the person or persons filing claims against the state. We need not decide that issue, however, for it is clear that there is only one person \u2014 Mrs. Barringer \u2014 who can file a claim against the State of Idaho in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">Wrongful death statutes, such as the one under which Mrs. Barringer and her son are suing, create a cause of action not recognized at common law. <em>Everett v. Trunnell, </em>105 Idaho 787, 789, 673 P.2d 387, 389 (1983). Therefore, \u201cthe right of a person to recover for the wrongful death of another is statutory, and a person seeking to recover must qualify under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the recent case of <em>Schiess v. Bates, </em>107 Idaho 794, 797, 693 P.2d 440, 443 (1984), we made it clear that for purposes of determining who can sue under Idaho\u2019s wrongful death statute, that determination is made at the <em>date of death. See also Frisbie v. Sunshine Mining Co., </em>93 Idaho 169, 457 P.2d 408 (1969). Thus, the statute in force at the <em>date of Mr. Barringer\u2019s death </em>is the statute under which Mrs. Bar-ringer and her son must qualify to have valid claims. That statute, which has since been amended,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>\u201c5-311. Action for wrongful death.\u2014 When the death of a person, not being a person provided for in section 5-310, Idaho Code, is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, his heirs or personal representatives may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death; or if such person be employed by another person who is responsible for his conduct, then also against such other person. In every action under this and the preceding section, such damages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In <em>Schiess v. Bates, supra, </em>we interpreted \u201cheirs\u201d under the \u201cold\u201d \u00a7 5-311 (which is the applicable statute for the Barringers), as being those people who are entitled to inherit the property of the decedent, according to the laws of intestate succession in effect as of the <em>date of death. Schiess v. Bates, </em>107 Idaho at 796, 693 P.2d at 442; <em>Everett v. Trunnell, </em>105 Idaho at 789, 673 P.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The laws of intestate succession in effect as of the date of Mr. Barringer\u2019s death are found at I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15-2-102 and -103. They provide that a surviving spouse receive all of the community property and the first $50,000, and one-half of the remaining balance of the decedent\u2019s separate property. Surviving children only become \u201cheirs\u201d of the decedent if the decedent leaves separate property with a value in excess of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">There is no allegation in the Barringers\u2019 complaint that Mr. Barringer left separate property in the amount of $50,000 or more; therefore, William Barringer, Jr., is not an heir for purposes of the applicable I.C. \u00a7 5-311 and does not qualify as a plaintiff under that statute. Accordingly, we hold that in this case there is but one valid wrongful death claim against the state, that of Mrs. Barringer, which I.C. \u00a7 6-926 limits to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">The second issue raised by the state\u2019s appeal is whether or not the plaintiff is precluded by I.C. \u00a7 6-926 from claiming and proving more than $100,000 damages against the State of Idaho in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">This second issue is resolved by the express language of I.C. \u00a7 6-926, in effect on January 23, 1978, the time of this accident, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-14\">\u201cIf any <em>judgment </em>or <em>claim </em>against a governmental entity or its employee under this act exceeds the one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) per person limited to three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) in any one (1) accident where two (2) or more persons have <em>claims </em>or <em>judgments </em>on account of personal injury or death, <em>the court shall reduce the amount to the minimum requirement </em>unless the governmental entity has provided liability coverage in excess of the minimum requirement. In this event, <em>the court shall reduce the amount of the claim or judgment </em>to a sum equal to the applicable limits provided in the insurance policy or provided under the comprehensive liability plan.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">The express language of the statute requires the court to reduce the amount of both any <em>\u201cclaim\u201d </em>or any \u201cjudgment\u2019 to the amount of the minimum requirement, <em>i.e., </em>$100,000. Accordingly, if the state is the only party against whom damages are asserted by the plaintiff, as in this case, then the court must reduce the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d which is submitted to the jury to the sum of $100,000. That limitation would not apply, however, to a plaintiff\u2019s claim against any other non-governmental defendant who, as an additional party defendant in such an action, would be jointly liable for the same damages asserted against the State of Idaho. Thus, in a case such as <em>Leliefeld v. Johnson, </em>104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983), where there were other defendants besides the State of Idaho, the plaintiff was entitled to allege and prove damages in excess of the $100,000 limitation applicable to the defendant State of Idaho because of the presence of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>defendants not subject to that limitation. However, under the express wording of I.C. \u00a7 6-926, in effect at the time of this accident, both the \u201cclaim\u201d and the \u201cjudgment\u201d against the State of Idaho must be reduced by the court to the minimum requirement of I.C. \u00a7 6-926.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The order of the district court, to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion, is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Costs to appellant State of Idaho.
