While that case was pending, the trustee named in the first mortgage appeared in the state court and asked that court to enter an order directing its receiver to report to the trustee and turn over to it the possession of the mortgaged property. The state court entered the order, but the foreclosure case was still pending before the master at the time of the filing of the petition herein and jurisdiction over the property and the trustee remained with that court. This showing was sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court under section 77B (11 USCA \u00a7 207), Clark on Receivers, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13, 14 and 963, and the District Court so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">The order of the District Court sustaining the petition is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
