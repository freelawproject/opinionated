Bonds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">\u201cI hereby agree not to hold the National Trust Bank, Charleston, Illinois; liable in any way for the purchase, sale or delivery of the above mentioned stocks. -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-12\">\u201cOrder filled. Bertha S. Messick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">On the same day the -bank requested the Federal Reserve Bank to purchase said bonds, charge them to its account, and forward the bonds as soon as delivered. The Federal Reserve Bank promptly executed the .order, and the bonds were received by the bank during said Bank Holiday, and they remained in its possession until a conservator, and later a receiver, was appointed for said bank. \"When the holiday was terminated the bank failed to open and was at the time of the trial in liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">, When the order was given, appellee had $37.09 on deposit, subject to a checking account with the bank. She and her husband, during said period, were holders, of a certificate of deposit, issued April 8, 1932, for $5000 payable on thirty days\u2019 notice to either of them or the survivor. On March \u00cd, 1932, her husband had $7,184.67 on deposit with the bank, subject to check, and on the day the bank closed the amount was $7,-205.97. Appellee had on previous occasions purchased bonds from the bank, and the account of herself or her husband had been charged with their purchase price. The evidence justified the conclusion which the' District Court drew, that the bank was authorized to charge the amount of the purchase against the account of appellee, of her husband, or of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">The bonds arrived in Charleston, Illinois, on March 4, and were delivered to the bank on March 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">The receiver of the bank disputed appellee\u2019s right to the bonds on the facts stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">At the close of the trial the court filed a written memorandum, from which the foregoing facts are taken, and concluded by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-19\">\u201cThere will be a decree for plaintiff against defendants directing the clerk to deliver the bonds to her as prayed, at the cost of defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-20\">This opinion was filed -March 6, 1934. Appellant immediately filed assignments of error and prayed an appeal from such ruling (calling it a decree). The appeal was duly allowed and bond was given. The appeal thus perfected is now before us for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-21\">On the 26th of March, 1934, appellee\u2019s counsel presented to the court a final decree which was signed by the court and recorded by the clerk. This proposed decree was submitted to and approved as to form by appellant\u2019s counsel. It awarded the bonds to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-22\">Upon presentation of the cause to this court, the objection was made by appellee that the appeal was from the opinion of the court and not from its final decree. Upon the oral argument, we permitted the conservator to withdraw the record and submit to the District Court his motion for the presentation and entry of a nunc pro tunc order. The District Court was left free to determine whether a proper fact situation existed for the entry of a nunc pro tunc order. The' court entered such an order, the material portion of which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-23\">\u201cIt Is Ordered that the decree signed and entered March 26, 1934 be entered nunc pro tunc as of March 6, 1934.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-24\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered that this order is based upon the findings of fact filed herein and that such findings of fact embody the entire evidence applicable to this issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-25\">The findings upon which the order was based are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The disposition of this appeal turns upon the validity of the nunc pro tunc order, for it is obvious that the memorandum or opinion from which the appeal was taken was not a final decree of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"> While this court in United States v. Chicago &amp; A. R. Co., 250 F. 101, approved the procedure here followed, namely, the return of the record to the District Court to permit of the entry of a valid nunc pro tunc order, we are unable to find any authority for the entry of such an order upon a fact situation such as is here disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The second finding is significant and, we may add, fatal to the entry of a valid order.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">No valid nunc pro tunc order may he entered unless there be a fact basis therefor, as this court pointed out in Hammond Hotel &amp; Improvement Co. v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., 55 F.(2d) 168, 169. As there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANq\">\u201c * * * a nunc pro tunc order may only be validly made where there is a proper basis for its entry. If the order actually entered fails, because of a mistake or omission of the clerk or judge to state what the court actually ordered, correction may properly be made through a nunc pro tunc order. * * * There is, however, no authority for entering a nunc pro tunc order for the purpose of correcting a previously entered order which contained no error, omission, or mistake. In other words, the court cannot, at a later term, amend a previously entered order through the use of a nunc pro tunc order. * * <em>*\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-20\"><em>A </em>few of the cases holding to the same effect are herewith collected.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-21\">The District Court\u2019s statement to the effect that its memorandum was not re-, garded by the court as a final decree and the further finding that, on March 24, 1934, counsel for appellee submitted to counsel for appellant a prooosed decree and on same date counsel for said appellant ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>proved the form of said decree, together with the court\u2019s fifth finding that the decree was signed and entered by the court on March 26, 1934 \u2014 all leave us with no doubt as to the ineffectuality of the so-called nunc pro tunc order. While we sympathize with the desire of the District Court to permit the defeated party the fullest possible opportunity to review its judgment and we commend the spirit that prompted such action, we are constrained, nevertheless, to hold, under the authorities, it was beyond the power of the court to preserve for review a question when the right to seek review had been lost by the lapse of time within which an appeal might be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">While the motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the opinion of the court is not an appealable decree is one that confronts us at the threshhold and its determination cannot be avoided by us, we have a strong urge to investigate the merits of the controversy, and by so doing satisfy ourselves that no different result would have been reached had the appeal been from the decree instead of from the opinion of the court.'</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The District Court in disposing of the case said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cIt is clear that the bank bought the bonds, acquired title thereto, from the Federal Reserve Bank.and that it paid therefor with its own funds. But in doing this it was acting under specific instructions from plaintiff so to do. She ordered the bonds, directed the bank to buy the same for her, and agreed to settle therefor as she had previously done, by payment from the deposit upon which she had a right to draw. Clearly, therefore, the bank, in doing all that it did, was acting for plaintiff\u2014 was her agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\u201cWhere, then, was the equitable title to these bonds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">\u201cIt is univers\u00e1lly the law that where an agent acquires title to property for his principal, he holds the same in equity for that principal. Good faith, essential to equity, so demands. * * * Equity does not permit a person agreeing to act for another to deal in his business of agency for his own benefit, and, if he takes in his own name a conveyance of an estate which he has agreed to purchase for another, he will, in equity, be considered as holding the estate in trust for his principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">We are satisfied from a reading of the evidence in this case, the more essential parts of which consist of written documents, that the bank was merely the agent of the appellee in purchasing the bonds. If the bank acted as agent of appellee then the bonds purchased belonged to her. The bank was transacting business in its usual course when it accepted the written order of appellee to buy as appellee\u2019s agent certain Government bonds. It was not suspended or closed when the bonds arrived. True, they were delivered at a time when there was a national bank holiday during which time securities which arrived by mail or express were not delivered. At the close of the bank holiday the bank officials decided to close the bank permanently. But the rights of the parties were fixed at that time. The bonds had arrived and had been delivered to the purchaser\u2019s agent. The agent at the time of their receipt was not under legal disability to deliver the bonds to their owner and to apply the purchaser\u2019s deposit upon their payment. Had there been a sharp decline in the value of these bonds, she would have been the loser. The failure of the bank to immediately charge her account with the cost price of the bonds was due solely to the fact that the exact amount was unknown and did not become known until the Federal Reserve Bank notified its customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">In appeal No. 5418, Messick is appellant, and the appeal is from the nunc pro tunc order. An examination of the record before us would indicate that there was also a mistake on the part of appellant in perfecting this appeal and in obtaining the order allowing the appeal. The appeal is from a decree entered on November 4, 1934. We are unable to find any decree entered on that date. Assuming as we do that the appeal is from the decree herein-before called the nunc pro tunc order, it is too apparent for argument that no such appeal will lie. It was not an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">The appeal in No. 5264 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The appeal in No. 5418 is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-26\"> \u201cThis cause coming on to be heard upon the motion of J.

Cofer' was mailed to the attorneys for the plaintiff at Danville and was on Monday, March 26 presented to Judge Lindley, signed by him and filed and entered on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-17\">\u201c9.

That all of the above transactions including the preparation and filing of the praecipe for record set forth in the proceeding findings, were within ninety days of March 6, 1934.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-26\">\u201c11.
