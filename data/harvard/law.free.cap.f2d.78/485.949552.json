On February 24, 1928, the Commissioner mailed his 60-day letter. On June 10, 1929, the 60-day deficiency letter was sent by the Commissioner to Erie Gerard as transferee of Barham Well No. 1. The tax was assessed on May 12, 1928. Deficiency notice was mailed to respondent as transferee on June 10, 1929. The period of limitations \u25a0may, under section 277 (b), 26 USCA \u00a7 1057, note, \u201cbe suspended for the period during which the commissioner is prohibited from making the assessment or beginning distraint or a proceeding in court, and for 60 days thereafter.\u201d It is obvious that under these provisions of the Revenue Act the Commissioner was prohibited from making any assessment of taxes for the period of 60 days from February 24, 1928, the date of the deficiency letter addressed to Barham Well No. 1, and was allowed an additional 60-day period after the expiration of the 60 days allowed in the deficiency letter within which to make the assessment of the taxes proposed in the deficiency letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\"> The Commissioner contends that the deficiency letter of February 24, 1928, addressed to Barham Well No. 1, the transferor, operates to effect a like extension of time for assessment against transferees, and that the notice of liability sent to the transferees on June 10, 1929, were within a year after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against Barham Well No. 1, and the respondent contends as the assessment was made against Barham Well No. 1, th'e taxpayer, on May 12, 1928, it follows that the period of limitation against the taxpayer expired on that date and the notice of liability to the transferees of June 10, 1929, were not within the year, and therefore the period of limitation for the determination of any deficiency against the transferees expired on May 12, 1929, one year after the period of limitation for assessment of Barham Well No. 1, taxpayer. The statute of limitations for making the assessment would have expired four years after the return was filed, that is, March 15, 1928. The deficiency letter of February 24, 1928, sus\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>pended the running of the period for the making of the assessment for 120 days; consequently, the deficiency notice of June 10, 1929 was within the period of limitation. The fact that the assessment of the transferor was actually made on May 12, 1928, is immaterial, for the period of limitation to the transferor does not begin to run with the assessment, but with the expiration of the statutory period in which the assessment might be made against the transferor. Petition for rehearing of respondent denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As the questions urged in the petition for rehearing of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue are disposed of in the original opinion and this opinion, and no reason appears why a different conclusion should be reached, the petition for rehearing, of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
