Knoell, Katherine Knoell and W. H. Ivy against the Frisco Lease, Incorporated, the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company (hereinafter called the Railway Company), and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">The trial court sustained defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the amended and supplemental bill. Plaintiffs elected not to further plead, and a decree of dismissal was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">The facts, as set forth in the amended and supplemental petition, are these: The S. E. % of Sec. 3, Twp. 11 N., R. 3 W. of Indian Meridian, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, was duly acquired by Valentine F. Knoell by homestead entry and patent from the United States. On February 19, 1903, he and his wife, Gasena Knoell, in consideration of $10,000 executed and delivered a statutory form of warranty deed conveying to the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railroad Company (hereinafter called the Railroad Company) all that portion of the above described land lying north of and adjoining the right of way of the Railroad Company as then located, containing about 45 acres (hereinafter referred to as the railroad tract).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-20\">The deed contained neither exception nor reservation, and no language indicating the land was conveyed for right of way purposes only.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-21\">The Railroad Company was a corporation chartered tinder the laws of Missouri and authorized to engage in the business of operating a railroad, and was engaged in that business in Oklahoma at the time such deed was executed and delivered to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-22\">Valentine F. Knoell died testate. His will was duly probated and his interest in the homestead passed to Gasena Knoell and his son Valentine G. Knoell. Thereafter Gasena Knoell conveyed all her interest in the homestead to Valentine G. Knoell. On June 1, 1931, he and his wife, Katherine Knoell, conveyed to W. H. Ivy an undivided one-half interest in all their right and interest in the railroad tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-23\">The Railroad Company used a portion of the railroad tract for railroad uses, trackage, and yards until about 1916, when the Railroad Company became insolvent and was placed in the hands of a receiver. Later all of its franchises, rights, and properties were conveyed to the Railway Company. The Railway Company is a corporation chartered under the laws of Missouri to engage in the operation of a railroad, and is authorized to transact business in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">On June 4, 1930, the Railway Company executed and delivered to Thomas B. Slick an oil and gas mining lease covering the railroad tract. Thereafter Slick died testate, and Seelingson, Urschel and Mrs. Slick were appointed as executors and trustees under his will. On January 30, 1931, they executed and delivered an assignment of such lease to the Frisco Lease, Incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-25\">At the time of the filing of the amended bill of complaint herein, the Railway Company was using a portion only of the railroad tract for railroad purposes. The amended bill sought a decree quieting title in plaintiffs to that portion of the railroad tract not being used by the Railway Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>pany, and an accounting for the oil and gas removed from the railroad tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The applicable constitutional and statutory provisions, relative to the power of railroad corporations to acquire and hold real estate, are set out in Note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The plaintiffs assert that under such constitutional and statutory provisions the Railway Company could not acquire a fee simple title to real estate, but only an easement or right to use land for railway purposes, and that it could not engage in the production of oil and gas or give a lease therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">It is a well-settled principle that, in an action to quiet title or to remove a cloud therefrom, the plaintiff must succeed on the strength of his own title and not upon the weakness of his adversary\u2019s title.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Therefore, it would seem unnecessary to determine the effect of the constitutional provisions, since, if the Railroad Company acquired a fee simple title from Valentine F. Knoell, the plaintiffs cannot succeed in this action. However, under the decisions of the supreme court of Oklahoma, as we shall presently show, the constitutional provisions impose no greater limitations than the statute on the power of a railroad company to acquire real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">The deed to the Railroad Company was in the statutory form adopted in Oklahoma. Section 9698, O. S. 1931, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">\u201cEvery estate in land which shall be granted, conveyed or demised by deed or will, shall be deemed an estate in fee simple and of inheritance, unless limited by express words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">The deed of February 19, 1903, contained no words limiting the estate granted; it purported to convey an estate in fee simple. Therefore, it must be construed to have granted an estate in fee simple, unless the Railroad Company was prohibited from acquiring such an estate. Three recent decisions by the supreme court of Oklahoma hold that the constitutional and statutory provisions of Oklahoma do not prohibit a railroad company from acquiring an estate in fee simple in lands by voluntary conveyance. They construe the provisions of section 2, art. 22, Oklahoma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Constitution, and section 11913, O. S. 1931, as limitations on the \u201cquantity of land\u201d which a railroad corporation may own, and not \u201cupon the quality of the estate\u201d it may acquire; and expressly overrule that part of the opinion indicating a contrary rule in Santa F\u00e9, L. &amp; E. R. Co. v. Laune, 67 Okl. 75, 168 P. 1022, upon which plaintiffs rely. Marland v. Gillespie, 168 Okl. 376, 33 P.(2d) 207, 230; Cobbs v. Wiedemann, (Okl. Sup.) 40 P.(2d) 1075; Oklahoma City v. Dobbins (Okl. Sup.) 44 P.(2d) 148. See, also, Oklahoma Ry. Co. v. Severas Pav. Co., 67 Okl. 206, 170 P. 216, 10 A. L. R. 157; Gilbert v. M., K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. (C. C.

W. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As no question of federal law is involved, this court is bound by the decisions of the supreme court of Oklahoma construing the constitutional and statutory provisions of thai state.
