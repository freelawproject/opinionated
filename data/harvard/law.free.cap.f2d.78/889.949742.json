The applications are identical in form and are here being considered jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-22\">On July 1, 1935, separate bills of complaint and petitions for declaratory judgments were filed in these causes in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington, Southern Division, by the appellants, for the purpose of enjoining the collection of processing taxes under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, c. 25, as amended, 7 USCA \u00a7 601 et seq., and for a declaration, under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act (28 USCA \u00a7 400), that the processing taxes arc illegal and unconstitutional in the respects set forth in the bills and petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">On July 11, 1935, the court below rendered an oral opinion, stating that it would enter an order denying the requested restraining order and injunction, temporary and permanent, and declining to\u2018render a decree declaratory of the constitutionality or unconstilutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Thereafter the appellee interposed a motion to dismiss the hills of complaint and the petitions. On July 19, 1935, the lower court entered a final order dismissing the hills and the petitions for declaratory judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Immediately following the order of dismissal, each of the appellants sought to obtain from the Bureau of Internal Revenue an extension of time for paying the processing taxes herein involved. On August 7, 1935, the Bureau formally notified the appellants in writing that such extension of time would not be granted, and demanded payment of the June installment of the taxes not later than August 16, 1935, at which time penalties would commence to attach. Appeals to this court were thereafter perfected, and the present applications for temporary injunctions were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">We are not at this time passing upon the constitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, but are confining our decision solely to the question of the propriety of issuing temporary injunctions pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Section 3224 of the Revised Statutes, 26 USCA \u00a7 154, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-9\">\u201cNo suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The principal reason for such a provision, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, \u201cis that, as courts are without authority to appoition or equalize taxes or to make assessments, such suits would enable those. liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden, and so to interfere with and thwart the collection of 'revenues for the support of the government.\u201d Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 284 U. S. 498, 509, 52 S. Ct. 260, 263, 76 L. Ed. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">However, as the Supreme Court in this opinion has indicated that certain extraordinary and exceptional circumstances may render the statute inapplicable, it therefore becomes necessary for us to inquire whether the circumstances alleged by the appellants in these cases are of that extraordinary and exceptional character which, under the decisions of the Supreme Court, would justify us in disregarding or refusing to apply section 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">In the first place, the mere allegation that a taxing statute is unconstitutional does not remove a case from the purview of section 3224. This is graphically illustrated by two Supreme Court decisions delivered by the same Justice, dealing with the same tax, and handed down the same day. In Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Company, 259 U. S. 20, 44, 42 S. Ct. 449, 66 L. Ed. 817, 21 A. L. R. 1432, Mr. Chief Justice Taft held tin: Federal Child Labor Tax Law to be unconstitutional. In Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16, 20, 42 S. Ct. 419, 66 L. Ed. 816, he reversed a decree of the District Court permanently enjoining a collector of internal revenue from collecting a tax assessed under the same Child Labor Tax Law. In the latter case, the Chief Justice, with reference to section 3224, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-14\">\u201cThe averment that1 a taxing statute is unconstitutional does not take this case out of the section. There must be some extraordinary and exceptional circumstance not here averred or shown to make the provisions of the section inapplicable. Dodge v. Brady, 240 U. S. 122, 126, 36 S. Ct. 277, 60 L. Ed. 560. In spite of their averment, the complainants did not exhaust all their legal remedies. They might have paid the amount assessed under protest and then brought suit against the collector to recover the amount paid with interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">So in the instant case, the remedy at law there suggested by Mr. Chief Justice Taft is open to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">It is hornbook law that suits in equity cannot be sustained in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law may be had. This fundamental principle is embodied in an enactment by Congress. 28 USCA \u00a7 384. Each of the appellants, however, seeks to avoid the application of this rule by setting out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>following allegations in its application for a temporary injunction pending appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-4\">\u201cThe appellant has no adequate remedy at law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">\u201c(a) In that Congress is on the point of passing a law which destroys any adequate remedy for recovering the said tax, in the event of its payment; that the pend-ency of said litigation, which will deny to appellant the right to recover any processing tax unconstitutionally exacted, constitutes a real and imminent threat of irreparable loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">\u201c(b) In that, unless the appellant pays said processing taxes, it and its officers will be subject to heavy criminal penalties provided for in the' Act in addition to the monetary penalty provided for nonpayment of said taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">\u201c(c) In that appellant\u2019s customers have stated that they will refuse to pay the amount of said tax to the appellant, and that therefore appellant, in the event said tax is invalid, will be unable to collect the same from its customers and will lose the' entire amount thereof without any chance of reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">\u201c(d) In that, in any event, the appellant .will be obliged to wage a multiplicity of suits against its said customers for the collection of said taxes, and that appellant, as a consequence, will lose many of its said customers with no possibility of redress for such loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">We will briefly consider each allegation seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">(a) It would be a strange procedure for a court of chancery to measure the adequacy of a remedy at law, not by what the law is at the time the equity suit is filed, but by certain nebulous conjectures of what the \u25a0 law may be at some future time. \u201cJurisdiction is determined as of the time the suit was commenced.\u201d Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. City of Seattle (D. C.) 14 F.(2d) 877, 879. \u201cEquity acts in the present tense.\u201d Continental Securities Co. v. Interborough R. T. Co. (D. C.) 207 F. 467, 471, affirmed 221 F. 44 (C. C. A. 2). The appellants had at the time of the commencement of these suits, and still have, a plain, adequate, and complete remedy.at law. They can pay the tax and sue to recover at law. Equity is not to be frightened into assuming jurisdiction by the bugaboo of dire prophecies of what the law may be in the future. \u201cTo grant an\u201e injunction in anticipation of a possible injury to .arise under a law that may never be passed, is, to say the least, unusual. What complainant\u2019s rights may 'be, and what relief should be afforded him in the event of the passage of such a law as he contemplates, cannot now be anticipated.\u201d Ryan v. Williams (C. C.) 100 F. 172, 175. It would be an unwarranted encroachment by the judiciary upon the legislative branch of the government \u201cshould the court attempt a race of diligence with Congress to defeat the applicability of an Act to a pending case.\u201d La Croix v. United States (D. C. W. D. Tenn.) decided July 27, 1935, reported in 11 F. Supp. 817. We are unanimously of the opinion that this court should not be governed or influenced in its action by speculations or predictions regarding future congressional enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">(b) The provision for \u201cheavy criminal penalties\u201d for nonpayment of the taxes in question is not an unusual one in tax legislation. Punishment can be avoided by paying the tax and then suing for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">(c) Appellants\u2019 petitions show that heretofore they have passed on the tax to their customers who they claim have now notified them that, if the tax is held invalid the customers will not pay such part of the purchase price of the processed product as 'reflects the tax, and by reason thereof appellants will be unable to collect these accounts. It is not claimed .that appellants have promised their customers any rebate or refund in case the tax is held invalid or that the obligation of such customers to pay for flour purchased from appellants is in any way contingent upon the validity of the tax. Regardless of the ultimate fate of the processing tax, appellants have and will have the right to collect the full purchase price of all flour sold by them. Moreover, these contentions may all be answered by .pointing out that, if the tax in question is eventually declared invalid, there will be no occasion for the appellants to demand that their customers reimburse them for the tax, as to any sales made thereafter. As to sales theretofore made, even if the customers refuse to pay the amount of the tax, as averred, the appellants will stand no loss, for they will be entitled to sue for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">(d) The ' mere fact that the appellants\u2019 customers may 'refuse to pay that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>portion of the purchase price of flour ascribablc to such tax, if the tax is upheld, is not sufficient ground for a court of equity to enjoin the collection of the tax from appellants. The tax is against appellants directly, and, if they choose to pass it on to customers who refuse to pay and litigation results, such will not constitute a \u201cmultiplicity of suits\u201d in the equity sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In their brief before this court, the appellants also rely upon the following paragraph in the bills of complaint filed by them in the court below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-6\">\u201cPlaintiff has been notified by several of its customers during the week immediately preceding this action, who have purchased large quantities of flour which has been processed during the month of May, 1935, and either delivered to said customers or is in transit, and for which purchases plaintiff has not received payment from said customers, that said customers will not pay plaintiff that part of the purchase price of said processed flour which reflects the processing tax thereon, if the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and/or those provisions relating to processing taxes, are declared invalid and unconstitutional by the courts, and said customers have notified plaintiff and demanded that plaintiff do not pay the processing taxes on said purchased flour; that if plaintiff pays said processing taxes for the month of May, 1935, and subsequent months as said processing taxes accrue, and other milling companies engaged in processing wheat do not pay such processing taxes, and in so doing are upheld by the courts, plaintiff will lose said and other customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">It is clear from the bills of complaint filed in the court below and from the applications for temporary injunctions filed in this court that the appellants are now adding the amount of the processing taxes to their selling price, and that they intend to continue to do so. In their brief, the appellants assert that \u201cmilling companies which have not paid the tax by reason of an injunctive order will be in a position to pay to their customers the withheld tax, even though they are presently collecting in the purchase price of flour the amount of the tax.\u201d There is nothing in the pleadings or the briefs before us to indicate that the appellants would not likewise \u201cpresently collect\u201d the amount of the tax from their customers, even if we were to grant a temporary injunction. Quite the contrary is inferable from the appellants\u2019 statements. This would result in the unjust enrichment of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">It has been suggested that there accrues to the appellants each month a right of demand and suit in the event that the tax be improperly assessed, or in the event that the taxing statute is declared to be unconstitutional. From this it is argued that a multiplicity of suits against the government would result. There is no reference to this point in the pleadings or in the briefs, nor do we believe that it is well taken. There is no need for the appellants to sue each month to recover the taxes in question, in the event the statute is declared unconstitutional. Under the provisions of Rev. St. \u00a7 3226, as amended by Revenue Act 1932, \u00a7 1103 (a), 26 USCA \u00a7 156, the taxpayer is allowed two years from the date of the mailing of the disallowance notice by the Commissioner within which to institute a suit for such refund or credit. According to 26 USCA \u00a7 157, all claims for refunds must be presented to the Commissioner within four years next after the payment of the tax in question. In other words, the taxpayer is given a maximum of more than six years from the date of payment within which to file his suit. lie need not sue for the taxes monthly, but may seek to recover a lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The appellants also rely upon the following paragraph in their applications before this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-11\">\u201cThat throughout the United States many suits in equity have been instituted by millers and milling companies situated identically with the applicant herein; that in a very great majority of such cases, more than eighty in number, United States District Courts have granted temporary injunctive relief during the pendency of the causes in said District Courts,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">From the foregoing, the appellants argue that, unless they are granted the relief sought, they will be placed at a \u201ctremendous disadvantage\u201d in the sale of flour. In other words, the appellants\u2019 argument amounts to this: The fact that other milling companies have been awarded injunctive relief in the same situation should compel this court to award to the appellants similar relief, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>te equalize competitive conditions, regardless of whether or not we believe such injunctive relief warranted under federal statutes or under the principles of equity. We do npt believe that such equalization of competitive conditions, under such circumstances, is one of the duties of a court of chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The majority of the court are of the opinion that, under the showing made in these applications, we are not justified in disregarding the provisions of section 3224 of the Revised Statutes, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Accordingly, the applications for temporary injunctions pending appeal are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b918-6\">DENMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2D\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The sole ground on which the judge below rested his dismissal of the bill is that R. S. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154) prevents enjoining the collection of a tax assessed under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The merit of this decision is one of the paramount questions to be argued on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">I am unable to concur with my brethren in the denial of the temporary relief prayed for. In effect the denial of the restraint of the collection of the processing tax for the months of April and May, which it is alleged will be collected immediately through process of distraint or otherwise, may well frustrate entirely the ultimate injunctive remedy of this litigation and prevent a consideration of the merits of the appeal when the case is called for hearing. The collector of internal revenue may then be able to show that the action sought to be enjoined has been performed and that the appeal, regardless of the merits, must be dismissed so far as injunction is the remedy sought. The right to certiorari to the Supreme Court may also be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">The argument of the collector disclosed, and we are otherwise properly informed, that a large number of similar bills are pending in the circuit. In some of them the District Judges have decided that the injunctive remedy should be granted and in others that it should be denied. We are advised that the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has recognized the propriety of the injunctive relief we are here denying. It is my opinion that a sufficient showing has been made of the debatable character of the question whether R. S. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154), as follows: \u201cRestraining assessments or collection of taxes. No suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court\u201d \u2014 prevents the use of the injunction in the instant cases, and that therefore the merits of the contention should be given full exploration at the hearing of the appeal. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that opportunity should be afforded to the litigants in the pending cases in the District Courts of the circuit, whose litigation may be frustrated by the denial of this temporary injunction, to present their views on the merits of the error assigned to the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">I agree with my confreres that there is no validity in the contention that the court should govern its action with reference to a possible future enactment of Congress which would prevent litigation for the recovery of these processing taxes. Even if there were a method of determining such future action, I would regard it as improper for a judicial branch of the government to hasten the processes of litigation to frustrate such definitely ascertained future action of the legislative branch. However, I regard is as entirely illogical and inconsistent to assume that, having refused to consider possible future congressional enactments, the taxing statute in question .will not continue in the future in its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">The applicability of R. S. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154), prohibiting injunctive relief, is challenged on the claim that this case falls within two of the exceptions recognized by the Supreme Court in Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 284 U. S. 498, 509, 52 S. Ct. 260, 263, 76 L. Ed. 422. That case states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-13\">\u25a0 \u201cIndependently of, and in cases arising prior to, the enactment of the provision (Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 475) which became Rev. St. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154), this court, in harmony with the rule generally followed in courts of equity, held that a suit will not lie to restrain the collection of a tax upon the sole ground of its illegality. The principal reason is that, as courts are without authority to apportion or equalize taxes or to make assessments, such suits would enable those liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden, and so to interfere with and thwart the collection of revenues for the support of the government. And this court likewise recognizes the rule that, in cases where complainant shows that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>addition to the illegality of an exaction in the guise of a tax there exist special and extraordinary circumstances sufficient to bring the case within some acknowledged head of equity jurisprudence, a suit may be maintained to enjoin the collector. Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 20 L. Ed. 65; Hannewinkle v. Georgetown, 15 Wall. 547, 21 L. Ed. 231; State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 614, 23 L. Ed. 663. Section 3224 is declaratory of the principle first mentioned and is to be construed as near as may be in harmony with it and the reasons upon which it rests. Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Kelly (C. C. A.) 160 F. 316, 321, 15 Ann. Cas. 1210; Baker v. Baker, 13 Cal. 87, 95; Bradley v. People, 8 Colo. 599, 604, 9 P. 783; 2 Sutherland (2d Lewis Ed.) \u00a7 454. The section does not refer specifically to the rule applicable to cases involving exceptional circumstances. The general words employed are not sufficient, and it would require specific language undoubtedly disclosing that purpose, to warrant the inference that Congress intended to abrogate that salutary and well-established rule. This court has given effect to section 3224 in a number of cases. Snyder v. Marks, 109 U. S. 189, 191, 3 S. Ct. 157, 27 L. Ed. 901; Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U. S. 118, 121, 36 S. Ct. 275, 60 L. Ed. 557; Dodge v. Brady, 240 U. S. 122, 36 S. Ct. 277, 60 L. Ed. 560. It has never held the rule to be absolute, but has repeatedly indicated that extraordinary and exceptional circumstances render its provisions inapplicable. Hill v. Wallace, 259 U. S. 44, 62, 42 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 822; Dodge v. Osborn, supra, page 121 of 240 U. S., 36 S. Ct. 275; Dodge v. Brady, supra. Cf. Graham v. Du Pont, 262 U. S. 234, 257, 43 S. Ct. 567, 67 L. Ed. 965; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 36 S. Ct. 236, 60 L. Ed. 493, L. R. A. 1917D, 414, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The case of Hill v. Wallace, cited in the Miller Case, arguably recognizes that a tax which creates a profound business disturbance is excepted from R. S. 3224. The cases of Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108, 20 L. Ed. 65; Hannewinkle v. Georgetown, 15 Wall. 547, 21 L. Ed. 231; State R. R. Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 614, 23 L. Ed. 663, support the proposition that the creation of a multiplicity of suits constitutes an exception from the prohibition of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">As it now stands, the processing tax statute, as administered, imposes a tax of 30 cents a bushel on wheat milled in the far flung businesses of the companies moving for the temporary relief. With the diversity of opinion as to the constitutionality of the act, shown by the varying decisions of the courts, these great businesses are necessarily in apprehension of the price they shall charge for their product in every sale that they make and correspondingly in doubt as to the volume of purchases of raw material for their current and future business. We cannot assume that the price of flour is uniform throughout the United States, for this would be an assumption either that there was an illegal combination fixing a uniform price or that the capitalistic competitive system had ceased to function in the United States. It is arguable that the creation of such doubt and uncertainty as to price in each sale is not an usual incident of tax legislation under Hill v. Wallace, 259 U. S. 44, 62, 42 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 822. So much for the effect on this one of the great and fundamental industries of the country in the process of its manufacture and sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">When we come to the administrative features of the statute, we find it unusual in that there is required a monthly return and payment to the collector. Thus there accrues each month a right of demand and suit in the event that the tax be improperly assessed or in the event that the claimed unconstitutionally should ultimately be sustained. The possible accrual in one year of twelve causes of action against the government, is an uncommon feature of tax measures. Such a situation cannot be dismissed cavalierly as presenting no question of multiplicity of causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">What this court is doing is to decide finally on a preliminary motion and without hearing on the merits of the appeal that the exceptional circumstances of this case as affecting these industries above described are not within the rule of Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 284 U. S. 498, 509, 52 S. Ct. 260, 263, 76 L. Ed. 422, regarding \u201cextraordinary and exceptional circumstances\u201d which \u201crender * * * inapplicable\u201d the provisions of R. S. \u00a7 3224.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">For the purposes of the application for a temporary restraint to keep alive and make possible the exercise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>injunctive relief sought, it is my opinion that sufficient doubt is raised as to the correctness of the decision below to warrant an order for the temporary injunction pending appeal until that appeal can be heard on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">This is not to indicate what, my opinion would be on the question whether or not R. S. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154) prevents injunctive relief in the instant cases. That question should be determined on the hearing of the merits of the appeal when, as suggested, all the litigants in the many cases pending in the District Courts of the circuit should be given an opportunity to present their views.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Supplement to Dissenting Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The decision rendered by a majority of this court was accompanied by a brief statement to the effect that the showing made by the applicants for temporary injunction was insufficient. My dissenting opinion was next filed, followed by an opinion of the' majority. In that opinion the argument presented in my dissent regarding the unusual incident of the processing tax legislation, in that it gave rise to twelve causes of action against the government in a year in a continuous processing business, is treated as if it were of significance that the point was not made in the pleadings or in the briefs. The fact that there are so many other cases, similar to those just decided, pending throughout the circuit, all of which would be affected by ignoring the plain provisions of the processing statute itself for a monthly return, assessment, and payment of tax, reinforces the suggestions I have made regarding the danger in hastily frustrating, in a preliminary proceeding, the rights of appellants to their day in court on the merits of the appeal. In a case of this importance no doubt the combined assistance of many of the members of the bar interested in the merits of the lower court\u2019s decision would be available to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">What my dissent stated was that the monthly payment of the processing tax gave rise under the statute to twelve causes of action a year, an unusual incident in the federal taxation of business, and hence arguably one of the exceptions to R. S. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154) recognized in Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., 284 U. S. 498, 509, 52 S. Ct. 260, 76 L. Ed. 422. Each one of the companies affected is forced to conserve the evidence of the steps taken in the administrative requirements of the statute to make effective its right to sue. It must be prepared to prove, along with other facts of the month, the volume of the monthly processing to meet any adverse contention of the Treasury Department. In other words, each must take all the preliminary steps necessary to maintain its position in twelve lawsuits a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">I do not believe it is any answer to this to say another statute avoids a multiplicity of suits if the taxpayer will give up his right to sue at once and combine at the. end of six years, as suggested in the majority opinion, his seventy-two causes of action. Assuming that this remedy is \u201cplain,\u201d I am unable to see how, under any theory, a six-year or a two-year delay is the \u201cadequate\u201d remedy at law referred to in 28 USCA \u00a7 384. It is certainly not a \u201cspeedy\u201d relief, and promptitude of the legal redress is a part of its \u201cadequacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">In one of the cases before us a month\u2019s tax is $125,857.30. At the end of six years, at this rate, the seventy-two causes of action would amount to $9,061,451.00. The holding of the majority opinion is that the delay in'suing for these, gradually increasing huge amounts to avoid a multiplicity of suits is plainly not such an unusual feature in the taxation of business that we need wait for its further discussion at a hearing on the merits of the appeal. I am convinced the litigants in these and the other pending cases, if we had not denied them the opportunity, could have presented strong arguments that the claim of multiplicity of suits is not answered by the fact they may be consolidated after such delay, and such deprivation of the legal right to sue when each cause of action arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">In many stat\u00e9s all contract causes of action or all causes arising out of the same transaction may be joined in a single suit. The majority opinion seems to hold that, as to causes of action so joinable, equity could never consider them as constituting a multiplicity of causes where, in the absence of the consolidating statute, their number would warrant equitable relief. I believe this principle is not so clearly established that it should have been so declared, without argument, on a preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">From the suggestion that the law regarding the right to injunctive relief, which we are now deciding for all the cases in the circuit, should be affected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the consideration that the litigants here claim they have passed on the burden of the tax to the consumer, and that therefore repayment might lead to \u201cunjust enrichment,\u201d two questions arise. One is: What becomes of the cases where, under competition, all of the tax has not been passed on? The other is: Is it of concern here, if the litigants have a legal right to the return of the tax, that the contracts made with the purchasers of the flour may or may not permit the retention of the money by the processors? If the cause had been heard on the merits, quite likely some counsel would have appeared who would have offered the suggestion that, while Congress may properly withdraw the right to reclaim taxes for any reason it pleases, courts, sitting in equity, are not permitted to change an existing legal right to recover a tax, and an interesting and possibly pertinent discussion might have ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">I concur in the statement of the majority opinion that a mere claim of unconstitutionally does not warrant equitable relief. This does not answer the point raised in my first opinion that, where the taxing act affected every purchase and every sale of the businesses taxed, it is arguable that this is an unusual incident of taxation. Like the multiplicity of suits per annum in its effect upon the businesses taxed, it seemed a proper matter for deliberate consideration upon a hearing of the appeal on the merits of the right to injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">All of this, of course, does not purport to state what my opinion would be on the merits of the decision below denying injunctive relief if the matter had been fully presented, and has nothing to do with the constitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act or the right of these litigants to have their taxes refunded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
