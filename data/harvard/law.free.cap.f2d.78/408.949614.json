Widener, 33 F.(2d) 833, and Whitney v. Commissioner, 73 F.(2d) 589, cases which the government has not sought to question by reviews. There is no dispute about the facts in the present case, and we find nothing, except the size of the business, which differentiates the present taxpayer\u2019s activities from those of Messrs. Whitney and Widener in the two cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Regarding those cases as evidencing the settled holdings of this court, we are of opinion the Tax Board erred in holding that the losses incurred in taxpayer\u2019s training and racing business were not deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
