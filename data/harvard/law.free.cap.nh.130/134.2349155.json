We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">In February, 1982, a lay technician known as a phlebotomist, employed by the defendant, Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover, drew a sample of blood from the right arm of the plaintiff, Patricia A. Martin. In the course of the venipuncture procedure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>plaintiff suffered an injury to her arm\u2019s lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, for which she seeks compensation from the hospital on the basis of three acts of omission said to constitute negligence: the hospital\u2019s failure to train the phlebotomist adequately; the hospital\u2019s failure to provide an appropriate chair for the plaintiff to use as the blood was drawn; and, on the theory of vicarious liability, the failure of the phlebotomist to exercise due care in performing the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">At trial, the plaintiff produced no independent medical expert witness to provide evidence of negligence and of a causal relationship between the negligence claimed and the plaintiff\u2019s injury. She relied, rather, on the testimony of defense experts and on a statement allegedly made to her by the defendant\u2019s laboratory director, Dr. Paul Young, that \u201cI guess we really hit a nerve in your arm, and we\u2019ll accept responsibility for what was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The trial judge responded to the motion for nonsuit with a careful analysis of the record, in which he found no evidence that the chair was defective and no expert testimony indicating that the phlebotomist had been negligent in extracting the blood. Nor did he find that the hospital had been negligent in training the phlebotomist or that any assumed inadequacy in training had caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In this appeal from the ensuing nonsuit, the plaintiff argues that there was adequate evidence that defendant\u2019s use of a defective chair for the plaintiff during the procedure was causally negligent, and that Dr. Young\u2019s statement was an admission of causal negligence sufficient to take the case to the jury on the theories of negligent training and negligent performance of the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We see no basis for seriously arguing that the trial court erred in declaring a nonsuit on the negligent equipment claim. Although the plaintiff presented testimony on the need for proper equipment, the trial judge found that there was no evidence of any inadequacy of the chair actually used, and the plaintiff has cited nothing in the record to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We will, however, assume that there was prima facie evidence of negligence in training, inferable from a defense expert\u2019s testimony that a phlebotomist should be taught about the location of nerves and from the phlebotomist\u2019s admission that she had received no such instruction. That leaves the question whether the trial court could have found that there was no evidence to establish a causal link between any such negligence and the injury. In light of the realistic concession made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel at oral argument, that without Dr. Young\u2019s statement there was no expert opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>evidence to establish the causal link, the appeal turns on whether Dr. Young\u2019s remark was sufficient evidence to go to the jury on the issue of negligent, as distinguished from merely physical, causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"> The standards for assessing the adequacy of evidence on this point are commonplace. Since any inference of the requisite causal link must depend on observation and anaylsis outside the common experience of jurors, <em>see April v. Peront, </em>88 N.H. 309, 311-12, 188 A.2d 457, 459 (1936), this case falls within the general rule, that proximate causation between negligence and injury in a medical malpractice case must be established by expert testimony. <em>Carson v. Maurer, </em>120 N.H. 925, 934, 424 A.2d 825, 832 (1980). On the issue of negligent causation, therefore, some expert opinion was necessary to establish that inadequate training or a want of due care in performing the venipuncture caused or contributed to the cause of the injury. <em>Murray v. Boston &amp; Maine R.R., </em>107 N.H. 367, 374, 224 A.2d 66, 72 (1966). The quantum of such evidence necessary to survive a motion for nonsuit had to be enough to warrant the conclusion of a reasonable juror that the causal link probably existed. <em>See DiPietro v. Lavigne, </em>97 N.H. 474, 476, 92 A.2d 914, 916 (1952); <em>Allison v. Railroad, </em>88 N.H. 420, 422, 190 A. 127, 128 (1937) (mere scintilla of evidence inadequate to survive motion for nonsuit); <em>see also Faust v. General Motors Corp., </em>117 N.H. 679, 685, 377 A.2d 885, 888 (1977) (scintilla of evidence insufficient to satisfy burden of evidentiary production).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The application of these standards is likewise straightforward. Assuming that Dr. Young\u2019s statement was within the scope of his authority to speak and act for the hospital, it was reasonable, certainly, for the trial judge to find that the plaintiff\u2019s burden was unsatisfied because the remark fell short of admitting a causal link between negligence and injury. We will concede to the plaintiff that the doctor\u2019s acceptance of \u201cresponsibility\u201d was at least an undertaking to provide or pay for medical treatment, and we read that undertaking as predicated on the admission of a causal link between the physical act of venipuncture and the injury in question. Any attempt to discover further significance in the doctor\u2019s words, however, would take us outside the realm of legitimate inference. An admission of physical causation is not an admission of negligence, or of a causal connection between negligence and injury, and to read Dr. Young\u2019s statement as an admission of causal negligence would be an exercise in speculation. Because a reasonable juror could not infer from Dr. Young\u2019s statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>negligence had probably caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury, the nonsuit was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
