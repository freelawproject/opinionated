We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-19\">Ruth Cairo, the defendant insured in this action, owned real estate abutting the easterly limit of Lafayette Road in Seabrook on August 10, 1982, the date of the accident giving rise to this litigation. The real estate comprising the defendant\u2019s holdings consisted of two parcels conveyed to Ruth and John Cairo by separate conveyances from George F. Eld, Jr. The first parcel was conveyed in September 1967, and consisted of a little over a half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>acre. The second parcel, which abuts the first parcel on two sides, was substantially greater in area, consisting of several acres, and was conveyed in August 1973. The Cairos built their residence on the small parcel they had originally purchased. Mrs. Cairo was an executive officer in a small closely held corporation, Rockingham Fireworks Corporation (Rockingham Fireworks), which had leased the second tract from Mrs. Cairo. On August 10, 1982, there was an explosion of substantial magnitude resulting from an occurrence on the property under lease to Rockingham Fireworks. The force of the explosion caused the deaths of the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents as well as death and injuries to other persons. The leased property was enclosed by a fence, .and Mrs. Cairo on the date of the accident resided in her home on the adjoining lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The plaintiffs, representing the estates of the decedents, filed a lawsuit against Mrs. Cairo alleging negligence, first, as a landowner and, second, as an executive officer of Rockingham Fireworks. Mrs. Cairo\u2019s insurer, defendant Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), denied coverage under her homeowner\u2019s policy on either count. Mrs. Cairo did not challenge Aetna\u2019s decision, but the plaintiffs did by filing a petition for declaratory judgment to determine Aetna\u2019s obligations under the homeowner\u2019s policy. Following motions for summary judgment filed by both parties, the Superior Court <em>(Gray, </em>J.) approved a recommendation of the Master <em>(Charles T. Gallagher, </em>Esq.) that Aetna was not obligated to defend Mrs. Cairo as an executive officer of Rockingham Fireworks, but was obligated to defend Mrs. Cairo as a landowner. Upon granting Aetna\u2019s motion for clarification, the master upheld the original decision, and the Superior Court <em>(Nadeau, </em>J.) affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The focus of this appeal is determining whether the coverage under Mrs. Cairo\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy, which was issued by Aetna after the purchase of the residence lot, extends to an adjoining lot purchased at a later date and subsequently leased to a small closely held corporation in which Mrs. Cairo is an executive officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u201cSummary judgment procedure allows a final judgment to be entered when there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring a formal trial.\u201d <em>Arsenault v. Willis, </em>117 N.H. 980, 983, 380 A.2d 264, 266 (1977). In this case, the superior court, approving the master\u2019s recommendation, determined that there was no genuine issue as to whether Aetna was obligated to defend Mrs. Cairo as a landowner because \u201cthe description of the premises in the policy is unambiguous and sufficiently general to include the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>adjoining the residence which were leased to [Rockingham Fireworks].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">\u201cThe final interpretation of an insurance policy is for this court.\u201d <em>Laconia Rod &amp; Gun Club v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co., </em>123 N.H. 179, 182, 459 A.2d 249, 250 (1983). The interpretation of Mrs. Cairo\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy turns on the definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d because one of the exclusions under Section II provides that the policy does not apply \u201cto bodily injury or property damages arising out of any premises, other than an insured premises, owned, rented or controlled by any Insured ....\u201d The definition of \u201cinsured premises\u201d is found under a separate section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">\u201cADDITIONAL POLICY CONDITIONS MANDATORY ENDORSEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">It is agreed that the following provisions apply with respect to the insurance afforded under this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">A. Under GENERAL CONDITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7S\">8. Definitions: Paragraph b, \u2018insured premises\u2019 is amended to read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhN\">b. \u2018insured premises\u2019 means</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">(1) the residence premises described in the Declarations of this policy, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">(2) under Section II [Coverages and Exclusions] only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">(a) any other residence premises specifically named in this policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">(b) all other premises and private approaches thereto for use of the Named Insured or his spouse in connection with the residence premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">(c) any residence premises acquired by the Named Insured or his spouse during the term of this policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">(d) any premises which are not owned by any Insured but where an insured may be temporarily residing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">(e) vacant land, other than farm land, owned by or rented to any insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-14\">(f) individual or family cemetery plots or burial vaults.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The residence described under the Declaration of Mrs. Cairo\u2019s policy is \u201cLafayette Rd. Seabrook NH.\u201d This address applies to both Mrs. Cairo\u2019s home and the location of Rockingham Fireworks; nonetheless, it is obvious that both lots are not used as Mrs. Cairo\u2019s residence. Moreover, the lot which Rockingham Fireworks leased cannot be considered as additional to, or in connection with, the residence premises; therefore, subparagraphs (2)(a), (b), (c) and (d) do not apply. Finally, because the lot is neither vacant nor used as a cemetery, subparagraphs (2)(e) and (f) do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The master stated that, if Rockingham Fireworks had not existed on the adjoining lot, \u201cit would be difficult to say that the lot was not a part of the residence premises [and further stated that it was not] logical to exclude those parts of the adjoining lot which might be used in connection with the residence but not involved in the fireworks enterprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> If we follow the master\u2019s interpretation, we would be extending the homeowner\u2019s policy coverage to premises leased for any purpose, so long as there were parts \u201cnot involved\u201d with the lessee\u2019s activiti\u00e9s. Had Mrs. Cairo leased the adjoining lot to another person to use for residential purposes, we do not think the plaintiffs would be here today asking for coverage under Mrs. Cairo\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy, but would rather seek coverage under the lessee\u2019s insurance policy. We will not construe a policy \u201cto create coverage where it is clear that none is intended.\u201d <em>Robbins Auto Parts, Inc. v. Granite State Ins. Co., </em>121 N.H. 760, 764, 435 A.2d 507, 509 (1981); <em>see also Town of Epping v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>122 N.H. 248, 444 A.2d 496 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The summary judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-9\">Thayer, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
