Alad, </em>560 P.2d 3 (Cal. 1977) and as adopted by California, New Jersey, <em>(Ramirez v. Amsted, </em>431 A.2d 811 (N.J. 1981)), Washington <em>(Martin v. Abbott Labs, </em>689 P.2d 368 (Wash. 1984)), and Pennsylvania <em>(Dawejko v. Jorgensen Steel, </em>434 A.2d 106 (Pa. Super. 1981)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The facts are set forth clearly in the order of certification from the federal court, and we reiterate them here. In January, 1985, the plaintiff, Elizabeth Simoneau, was injured while operating a punch press at her place of employment. The press had been manufactured in 1948 by Johnson Machine and Press Corporation (Johnson).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Prior to 1956, Johnson manufactured presses in Elkhart, Indiana. In 1956, Bontrager Construction Company (Bontrager) purchased Johnson\u2019s assets for cash and received the only share of Johnson stock. Bontrager continued to manufacture presses under the Johnson name.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">On August 29, 1962, Amsted Industries, Inc. (Amsted) purchased all the assets of Bontrager, including the sole share of Johnson stock. Amsted assumed the obligations and liabilities of Bontrager necessary for continuation of the business. However, Amsted specifically refused to assume any liability for injuries incurred from the use of presses previously manufactured and sold by Bontrager. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Bontrager agreed to dissolve its corporate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The sole share of Johnson stock was transferred on the Johnson stock records from Bontrager to Amsted. A new certificate was issued in Amsted\u2019s name, and Amsted immediately assigned all its rights and obligations under the purchase agreement with Bontrager to South Bend Lathe, Inc. (SBL-I), a wholly-owned Amsted subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">SBL-I took possession of Bontrager\u2019s assets on September 1, 1962. It continued to manufacture Johnson presses using substantially the same facility, employees, assets, and middle-level management personnel that Bontrager had used. However, none of the shareholders, directors, or officers of Bontrager became shareholders, directors, or officers of Amsted or SBL-I. Amsted notified Bontrager\u2019s and Amsted\u2019s customers that Amsted would continue to manufacture and sell Johnson presses.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Bontrager voluntarily dissolved in 1964. In 1965, Amsted dissolved both SBL-I and Johnson, which only existed as a paper company. The assets of both dissolved companies were distributed to Amsted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">South Bend Lathe, which now operated as an unincorporated division of Amsted, continued to manufacture Johnson presses in the original Elkhart, Indiana plant. In 1966, Amsted transferred the manufacturing operations from Elkhart to South Bend, Indiana. In 1975, Amsted sold the assets comprising the Johnson press line of its operation to L.W.E., Inc., a paper corporation representing the employees of the South Bend Lathe division of Amsted.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Following culmination of the sale, L.W.E., Inc. changed its name to South Bend Lathe, Inc. (SBL-II) and continued to manufacture Johnson presses.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Simoneau and her husband brought suit against Amsted and SBL-II alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that SBL-II is liable under the \u201cproduct line\u201d theory for having manufactured and maintained an allegedly defective product. The \u201cproduct line\u201d theory, as expressed in <em>Ray v. Alad, </em>stated that the purposes underlying strict liability in tort require:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cthat a party which acquires a manufacturing business and continues the output of its line of products under the circumstances here presented assumes strict tort liability for defects in units of the same product line previously manufactured and distributed by the entity from which the business was acquired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\"><em>Ray v. Alad, </em>136 Cal. Rptr. 574, 582, 560 P.2d 3, 11 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Three factors provide the primary justification for imposing strict liability under the product line theory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">\u201c(1) the nonavailability to [a] plaintiff of any adequate remedy against [the predecessor corporation] as a result of [the predecessor\u2019s] liquidation prior to [the] plaintiff\u2019s injury; (2) the availability to [the successor] of the knowledge necessary for gauging the risks of injury . . . together with the opportunity for meeting the cost arising from those risks by spreading it among current purchasers of the product line; and (3) the fact that the good will transferred to and enjoyed by [the successor] could not have been enjoyed by [the predecessor] without the burden of liability for defects in [products] sold under its aegis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>1 L. Frumer &amp; M. Friedman, Products Liability \u00a7 2.06[4] (1987) (citing <em>Ray v. Alad, supra </em>at 580, 560 P.2d at 9); <em>see also Ramirez v. Amsted Industries, Inc., </em>86 N.J. 332, 349, 431 A.2d 811, 819-20 (1981); <em>Dawejko v. Jorgensen Steel Co., </em>434 A.2d 106, 109-10 (Pa. Super. 1981); <em>Martin v. Abbott Labs, </em>102 Wash. 2d 581, 614, 689 P.2d 368, 387-88 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">The defendants argue that the factors that justify imposing liability under the product line theory are inconsistent with the policy reasons underlying this State\u2019s recognition of strict liability in tort. <em>Compare Ray v. Alad, supra </em>at 581, 560 P.2d at 10, <em>with Thibault v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>118 N.H. 802, 806, 395 A.2d 843, 845-46 (1978). Specifically, they argue that, since we have rejected \u201crisk spreading\u201d as a justification for the imposition of strict liability, logic requires that we reject the product line theory. <em>Thibault supra. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">A year after the California Supreme Court first adopted the product line theory and its rationale in <em>Ray v. Alad, </em>this court explicitly stated that the \u201c\u2018spreading\u2019 of [the] risk\u201d theory provides no justification for imposing strict liability on a corporate defendant. <em>Thibault supra. </em>In disagreeing with the risk-spreading approach, we observed that \u201cstrict liability is not a no-fault system of compensation. The common-law principle that <em>fault and responsibility </em>are elements of our legal system applicable to corporations and individuals alike will not be undermined or abolished by \u2018spreading\u2019 of risk and cost in this State.\u201d <em>Thibault supra. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Indeed, as pointed out by the defendants\u2019 counsel at oral argument, proof of a manufacturer\u2019s responsibility remains an essential element of a plaintiff\u2019s strict liability claim under New Hampshire law. <em>Thibault, supra </em>at 806, 395 A.2d at 846; <em>Buttrick v. Lessard, </em>110 N.H. 36, 39, 260 A.2d 111, 113 (1969) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment f (1966) for the proposition that manufacturer\u2019s responsibility to public is basis for strict liability). The doctrine of strict liability to which we adhere emphasizes that it is \u201cthe manufacturer who placed the item into the stream of commerce [who is] held to be \u2018responsible for the finished product.\u2019\u201d <em>Heath v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>123 N.H. 512, 521, 464 A.2d 288, 292 (1983) (quoting <em>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., </em>217 N.Y. 382, 394, 111 N.E. 1050, 1055 (1916)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">We limit the application of strict tort liability in this jurisdiction by continuing to emphasize that liability without negligence is not liability without fault. <em>See Bagley v. Controlled </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>Environment Corp., </em>127 N.H. 556, 558-59, 503 A.2d 823, 825 (1986); <em>Moulton v. Groveton Papers Co., </em>112 N.H. 50, 52, 289 A.2d 68, 71 (1972). We do not impose what amounts to absolute liability on a manufacturer. <em>Heath supra; Wood v. Public Serv. Co., </em>114 N.H. 182, 188, 317 A.2d 576, 579 (1974); <em>Elliott v. LaChance, </em>109 N.H. 481, 484, 256 A.2d 153, 156 (1969). This court continues to be extremely reluctant to extend the doctrine of strict liability unnecessarily, <em>Siciliano v. Capitol City Shows, Inc., </em>124 N.H. 719, 730, 475 A.2d 19, 25 (1984); <em>Wood v. Public Serv. Co., supra </em>at 188-89, 317 A.2d at 579, and we have specifically declined to do so when there has been no commercial relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff. <em>Bagley v. Controlled Environment Corp., supra </em>at 559, 503 A.2d at 825; <em>Wood v. Public Serv. Co. supra. </em>Accordingly, we join a majority of jurisdictions in holding that the product line theory of recovery, as propounded in <em>Ray v. Alad </em>and its progeny, is incompatible with this State\u2019s approach to the doctrine of strict liability in tort, and we decline to adopt it. <em>See </em>American Law of Products Liability 3d \u00a7 7.15 n.3 (1987) (and cases cited). Accordingly, the answer to the certified question is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\">We do note that a number of courts cite <em>Cyr v. B. Offen &amp; Co., </em>501 F.2d 1145 (1st Cir. 1974), for the proposition that New Hampshire has adopted \u201crisk spreading\u201d under the doctrine of strict liability. <em>See Ramirez, </em>86 N.J. at 344, 434 A.2d at 817; <em>Dawejko, </em>434 A.2d at 108. The <em>Cyr </em>decision, however, predates our express rejection of a risk-spreading approach in <em>Thibault, </em>and to the extent <em>Cyr </em>does suggest that we embrace risk spreading, it is no longer a valid interpretation of New Hampshire law. <em>Cyr, supra </em>at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
