We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">The plaintiffs brought this medical malpractice action as next friends of their injured child, and on their own behalf for medical expenses of $42,525.56 and other out-of-pocket charges of $5,339.37. Without the intervenor\u2019s participation, the parties settled the actions for $200,000, an amount within the limits of the defendants\u2019 insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Although the intervenor insured the plaintiff parents against the medical expenses and paid them $41,743.94, as to which the intervenor is their undisputed subrogee, the intervenor\u2019s post-settlement claim to reimbursement met with resistance. The plaintiffs argued that the settlement was a \u201creduced recovery\u201d within the meaning of <em>Dimick v. Lewis, </em>127 N.H. 141, 497 A.2d 1221 (1985), but the parties and the intervenor could not agree on the effect to be given to the allegedly reduced recovery in evaluating the amount of the intervenor\u2019s allowable subrogation claim. The trial court awarded $29,766 in attempting to apply <em>Dimick, </em>but it failed to make separate findings of the losses incurred by the parents and the minor plaintiff. This court accordingly vacated the award and remanded for recalculation on the basis of such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On remand, the trial judge once again failed to make any findings of the plaintiffs\u2019 respective losses, but concluded without explanation that the intervenor\u2019s allowable claim as subrogee was $6,533.97. The trial court apparently took that figure from a letter sent by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Mr. Garod, to counsel for the intervenor, which was received by the trial court together with evidence that the real value of the combined claims of parents and child was at least $300,000. Although the letter reveals counsel\u2019s reasoning in reaching the figure, we need not analyze the thought process, for reasons given below.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The intervenor has appealed the most recent order, and has asked us, <em>inter alia, </em>to reconsider the holding of <em>Dimick </em>and to limit its applicability. We respond by noting that, while we are willing to reexamine <em>Dimick </em>in a proper case, the case before us falls outside the <em>Dimick </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>Dimick </em>addressed issues that may arise in consolidated actions brought by parent and minor child for damages occasioned by injury to the child. We had previously held that a \u201cparent, rather than the child, is entitled to recover the medical expenses of a minor child injured by another,\u201d <em>Blue Cross/Blue Shield v. St. Cyr, </em>123 N.H. 137, 141, 459 A.2d 226, 228 (1983), and that the subrogated insurer who pays the medical expenses is a subrogee of the parent, <em>id. </em>In <em>Dimick </em>we held that when the combined claims of parent and child are settled for a single figure, the plaintiff and defendant may not allocate to the child a portion of the recovery attributable to the parent, in order to limit enforcement of the subrogee\u2019s claim against the parent\u2019s share. <em>Dimick, supra </em>at 145, 497 A.2d at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>We further held in <em>Dimick </em>that when such a settlement \u201cinvolves a reduced recovery,\u201d 127 N.H. at 144, 497 A.2d at 1223, the respective shares allocated to parent and minor should bear the same proportions to the total settlement that the full loss of each would have borne to a complete recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 497 A.2d at 1224. The subrogee\u2019s rights will then be limited to the amount of the parent\u2019s reduced recovery that is attributable to the medical expenses that the subrogee has paid. (The subrogee-intervenor here agrees that the amounts of the subrogation claim and of the parents\u2019 share from which it may be satisfied may be reduced, respectively, by the amounts of legal expenses attributable pro rata to the recovery\u2019s component for medical expenses paid by the intervenor and to the parents\u2019 share. Such reductions were not contested either in <em>Dimick </em>or in the instant case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The difficult step in applying <em>Dimick, </em>however, is the calculation of the true or full extent of the combined losses. The medical expense portion is easily valued, but the intangible elements of the minor\u2019s claim are not. The process by which counsel and the court addressed the issue of the full value of the plaintiffs\u2019 losses in this case raises the serious question whether we should continue to adhere to <em>Dimick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Because we are satisfied that this case does not fall within the <em>Dimick </em>rule, however, we do not today decide the future of that holding. The significant distinction between the two cases appears when we note that the parties in <em>Dimick </em>settled the plaintiffs\u2019 combined claim at the policy limits of the defendant\u2019s insurance coverage. <em>Dimick, </em>127 N.H. at 143, 497 A.2d at 1222. The court recognized that the true value of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, had the parties gone to trial and verdict, could have been greater than the amount available under the policy, and we allowed the settlement to be treated as a reduced recovery, provided the plaintiffs could establish a combined value of the claims in excess of the settlement amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">There is, however, no justification for treating a settlement within the policy limits as a reduced recovery. When the enforceability of the settlement itself is not in question, there is no reason to assume that a plaintiff who settles for less than the defendant\u2019s policy limits has acted irrationally in choosing not to test the value of his claim by litigating his case to verdict. <em>See Illinois Automobile Ins. Exch. v. Braun, </em>280 Pa. 550, 557-58, 124 A. 691, 693 (1924). The plaintiff in such a case is in a demonstrably different position from that of the plaintiff who settles at the policy limits of the defendant\u2019s insurance coverage, <em>see Dimick, </em>127 N.H. 141, 497 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>1221, or who obtains a verdict that is not paid, <em>see Germer v. Public Service Mutual Insurance Co., </em>99 N.J. Super. 137, 238 A.2d 713 (1967), or whose undisputed loss exceeds the amount available from insurance, <em>see Wimberly v. American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pa., </em>584 S.W.2d 200 (Tenn. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In a case such as this, therefore, the undisputed amounts of the parents\u2019 medical and other out-of-pocket costs must be assumed to be covered by the amount of the settlement. If the parents choose to forego reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses not affecting the subrogation claim, they are, of course, free under State law to do so. But the amounts subject to the subrogee\u2019s claims must be allocated to the parents in order to recognize the intervenor\u2019s undisputed subrogation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Therefore, the plaintiff parents\u2019 share of the settlement in this case must be set at not less than $41,743.94, less the pro rata share of legal expenses, against which the intervenor is entitled to impose its entire subrogation claim, subject to a like reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
