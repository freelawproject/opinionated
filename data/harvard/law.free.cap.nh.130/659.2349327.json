Crowley under RSA 282-A:32. We affirm the decision of the appeal tribunal for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The claimant, Mary E. Crowley, was employed by the New Hampshire Sweepstakes Commission as a bingo inspector, with law enforcement responsibilities, for approximately four years. On November 12, 1985, she was discharged for willful insubordination for failure to follow a written office procedure issued in April 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">On April 18, 1985, the Sweepstakes Commission\u2019s executive director issued an inter-office memo which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKf\">\u201cIt was recently brought to my attention that there were some copies of bingo and lucky seven files and information being kept outside of the Sweepstakes office. Effective the date of this memo, it will become a Sweepstakes policy that no copies will be allowed to leave the premises unless they are approved by myself and all copies that now exist outside this commission be brought back to the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Crowley received the memorandum and returned a majority of her files to the office. However, three handwritten documents were not returned until six months later. Because of her failure to return these three documents, her employment was terminated. She appealed to the State Personnel Appeals Board (board), formerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the Personnel Commission, which found that she had been properly dismissed. The finding was affirmed by order of this court; <em>see Petition of Mary E. Crowley, </em>No. 86-277 (October 1, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">She applied for unemployment benefits and was denied. After the claimant was denied unemployment benefits she appealed to an appeal tribunal (tribunal). The tribunal, after a full evidentiary hearing including conflicting testimony, also denied the claimant unemployment benefits, on the ground that the employee was discharged for \u201cmisconduct connected with [her] work\u201d pursuant to RSA 282-A:32, 1(b). In particular, the tribunal found the employee\u2019s contention that she had forgotten about the three documents not \u201creasonably believable\u201d and that she \u201cknew, or should have known, that she was obliged to turn in all records when directed to do so by the Director.\u201d The tribunal further found that the \u201cclaimant, by knowingly keeping [the] records at home . . . showed a willful disregard of the employer\u2019s best interests.\u201d No other instances of misconduct were found by the tribunal, although it noted that the claimant had previously challenged the director\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The claimant then appealed to the appellate division, which reversed the appeal tribunal\u2019s decision. The division, in reviewing the tribunal\u2019s decision, stated that it would \u201cnot substitute [its] judgment for that of the Appeals Tribunal on questions of fact which are supported by evidence . . . [but would] weigh the facts against the appropriate standard for determining when a termination is for misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The appellate division found the standard to be that stated in <em>Appeal of Miller, </em>122 N.H. 993, 994, 453 A.2d 1269, 1270 (1982), in which the court stated that \u201c[isolated or inadvertent instances of unsatisfactory conduct are not sufficient for a finding of misconduct.\u201d Finding no other instances of misconduct in the record, the appellate division went on to the second prong of what they determined to be the standard: that an employee can be terminated for a single breach of an employer\u2019s reasonable business policy, when the breach is deliberate. The division then determined that Crowley\u2019s retention of the documents was not \u201cin deliberate defiance of her employer\u2019s instructions.\u201d It further noted that \u201cher employer suffered [no] harm as a result of [her] delay in returning the documents,\u201d nor had she inappropriately used the documents in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The sole and dispositive issue before us is whether the appeal tribunal\u2019s decision to deny unemployment benefits to the claimant was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>In appealing to this court, the Sweepstakes Commission asks us to overturn the division\u2019s decision to award unemployment benefits to the claimant on the grounds that: (1) the division improperly reversed the appeal tribunal, pursuant to RSA 282-A:65, because that statute prohibits the division from substituting its judgment for that of the tribunal on questions of fact; and (2) the division applied the incorrect legal standard in interpreting disqualification under RSA 282-A:32, 1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">Conversely, the claimant argues that the division properly reversed the appeal tribunal because the tribunal applied an erroneous legal standard to the facts at hand. <em>See </em>RSA 282-A:65, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In response to Crowley\u2019s claim, the Sweepstakes Commission, in its reply brief, argues that even if the wrong legal standard was applied by the appeal tribunal, the same result would have been reached under the correct standard, and the decision may stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">RSA 282-A:65 clearly prohibits the division from reversing the tribunal except in certain circumstances. <em>See Appeal of Kelly, </em>129 N.H. 462, 466, 529 A.2d 935, 937 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">RSA 282-A:65 and RSA 282-A:65, III state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cThe appellate division shall not substitute its judgment for that of the . . . appeal tribunal as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, or as to the prudence or desirability of the determination . . . [and] shall reverse . . . the decision . . . only if the substantial rights of the appellant had been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions, or the decision is: . . . [a]ffected by reversible error of law[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> Similarly, this court\u2019s \u201creview is confined to the record, and we cannot substitute our judgment as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact for that of the appeal tribunal.\u201d <em>Appeal of the City of Franklin, </em>125 N.H. 761, 762, 485 A.2d 295, 297 (1984); RSA 282-A:67, III, IV. However, we will reverse the appeal tribunal where its decision is affected by an error of law. <em>City of Franklin, supra </em>at 762, 485 A.2d at 297; <em>Kelly, supra </em>at 466, 529 A.2d at 937 (The court does not \u201chave the statutory authority to review the rulings or conclusions of the appellate division as such. The findings and conclusions of the appellate division .. . are significant only insofar as they set forth and clarify the issues on appeal.\u201d); <em>Appeal of Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., </em>124 N.H. 506, 509, 474 A.2d 983, 984 (1984); RSA 282-A:67, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Thus, the crux of the issue is whether the tribunal applied the correct legal standard under RSA 282-A:32, 1(b), for if it did so, RSA 282-A:65 categorically prohibits the division from reversing the tribunal on issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">Both the claimant and the Sweepstakes Commission generally agree on the legal standard required under RSA 282-A:32, 1(b). However, the claimant contends that the appeal tribunal\u2019s use of \u201cwillful disregard of the employer\u2019s best interest\u201d is in actuality the <em>Boynton </em>test, which has been rejected in this State in <em>Appeal of United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>125 N.H. 753, 757, 484 A.2d 1217, 1219 (1984) and <em>Sturm, Ruger supra; see Boynton Cab Co. v. Neubeck, </em>237 Wis. 249, 259-60, 296 N.W. 636, 640 (1941). Conversely, the Sweepstakes Commission contends that the division, though generally correct in applying the legal standard, erred when it required two additional elements: \u201c(1) that the employee intend to <em>defy </em>her employer; and (2) that the employee\u2019s action caused specific, particular, identifiable harm to the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">It is true that New Hampshire has rejected the rule of <em>Boynton supra, </em>which requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201csuch wilful- or wanton disregard of an employer\u2019s interest as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect ... or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interests or of the employee\u2019s duties . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Work-Connected Inefficiency or Negligence as \u201cMisconduct\u201d Barring Unemployment Compensation, </em>26 A.L.R.3d 1356 (1969) (there is little disagreement that work-connected negligence constitutes \u201cmisconduct\u201d when it is of such a degree or recurrence to manifest culpability, wrongful intent, evil design or an intentional and substantial disregard of an employer\u2019s interest). <em>See Sturm, Ruger, supra </em>at 508, 474 A.2d at 984 (\u201cWe are not prepared to adopt the <em>Boynton Cab </em>definition as controlling in this State, nor is it necessary we do so.\u201d); <em>United Parcel, supra </em>at 757, 484 A.2d at 1219 (court not prepared to accept the <em>Boynton </em>test \u201crequiring \u2018wilful or wanton disregard\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Instead, New Hampshire has used a less stringent two-pronged modified definition of \u201cmisconduct\u201d applicable to RSA 282-A:32, 1(b). \u201cIsolated or inadvertent instances of unsatisfactory conduct are not sufficient for a finding of \u2018misconduct,\u2019 but recurring careless or negligent acts are enough to constitute \u2018misconduct.\u2019\u201d <em>Sturm, Ruger, </em>124 N.H. at 508, 474 A.2d at 984 (quoting <em>Appeal of Miller, </em>122 N.H. 993, 994, 453 A.2d 1269, 1270 (1982)). \u201cAs well, the negligence need not be of such a degree or recurrence as to manifest wrongful intent or evil design or to show intentional and substantial disregard.\u201d <em>United Parcel, </em>125 N.H. at 757, 484 A.2d at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\">If, however, there are no recurring acts of carelessness or negligence, New Hampshire law implies that a single instance of misconduct may be sufficient for a finding of misconduct if it is a <em>\u201cdeliberate </em>violation of a company rule reasonably designed to protect the legitimate business interests of [the] employer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Appeal of Beebe Rubber Co., </em>124 N.H. 533, 536, 474 A.2d 984, 986 (1984) (quoting <em>Branch v. Employment Comm., </em>219 Va. 609, 611, 249 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1978)) (Our court found that one incident of misconduct where the employee deliberately took a paycheck early was a violation of company policy.). The <em>Branch </em>test, in its entirety, defines misconduct as a deliberate violation of a company rule reasonably designed to protect the legitimate business interests of the employer or when an act or commission is of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest a willful disregard of those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">At first blush, the language in <em>United Parcel supra </em>rejecting the <em>Boynton </em>\u201cwilful or wanton\u201d test would indicate that \u201cwillful\u201d is not required when there is a single instance of misbehavior. However, \u201cdeliberate\u201d is a synonym for \u201cwillful,\u201d which means \u201cdeliberate, voluntary or intentional,\u201d RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (unabridged) 1634 (1966). Willful is further defined as: \u201cvoluntary, as distinguished from accidental ...[,] [i]ntentional or deliberate, yet not necessarily with an evil purpose in mind.\u201d BALLENTINE\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1369 (3d ed. 1969). In the employment context, willful means \u201cnot only the mere exercise of the will . . . , but ... an intention to do an act [the person] knows, or ought to know, is wrongful. . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The difference between the <em>Boynton </em>test and the New Hampshire test is that New Hampshire does not require the same high level of culpability in recurrent acts of negligence or carelessness as does <em>Boynton. </em>Both tests, however, require <em>\u201cdeliberate\u201d </em>or, if one prefers the word, \u201cwillful\u201d action when there is only one instance of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\"> Thus the tribunal\u2019s application of the \u201cwillful disregard of the employer\u2019s best interests\u201d legal standard to Crowley\u2019s one instance of misconduct was correct. There was sufficient evidence for the tribunal to find that Crowley knew she should have returned the documents and deliberately did not do so. These are findings of fact, <em>see generally United Parcel, </em>125 N.H. at 757, 484 A.2d 1217, 1219; <em>Beebe, </em>124 N.H. at 536, 474 A.2d at 986, which are accorded great weight, <em>see generally Desmarais v. State Personnel Comm\u2019n, </em>117 N.H. 582, 378 A.2d 1361 (1977); <em>Hutton v. State Personnel Comm\u2019n, </em>113 N.H. 34, 300 A.2d 333 (1973). We also note that the standard applied by the division was correct with the exception of the additional two requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Since we find that the division went beyond its powers, as defined in RSA 282-A:65, in reversing the tribunal on issues of fact and hold that the tribunal made no error of law, we affirm the decision of the tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\n<em>Decision of the appeal tribunal affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b679-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
