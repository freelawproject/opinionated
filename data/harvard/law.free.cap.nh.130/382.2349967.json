Merrill, </em>attorney general <em>(.Robert B. Muh, </em>assistant attorney general, on the brief), by brief for the State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-14\"><em>Joanne Green, </em>assistant appellate defender, of Concord, by brief for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b396-15\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A44\">A jury convicted the defendant, Edward Bundy, Jr., of theft by unauthorized taking (of an automobile), RSA 637:3, and the trial court sentenced him to twelve months in the Cheshire County House of Correction, suspending all but thirty days. The defendant challenges his conviction on the ground that the Trial Court <em>(O\u2019Neil, </em>J.) erred in its response to a question posed by the jury during deliberations. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">The facts of this case that are pertinent to the issue raised on appeal can be stated briefly. Tom Ward and the defendant, Edward Bundy, Jr., took a Datsun automobile owned by Robert Budd from the parking lot of the Park Place Restaurant in North Swanzey. Tom Ward drove the car, while the defendant occupied the passenger seat. Shortly after taking the car, Ward and the defendant abandoned it in a snowbank.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">During deliberations, the jury sent a question to the trial judge asking: \u201cDoes the law read that a person has to be driving a car to be charged with the theft?\u201d The trial court replied: \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d The jury found the defendant guilty of theft, and he appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>on the ground that the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s query was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant acknowledges that the trial court\u2019s answer was legally correct, but charges that it was, nevertheless, incomplete, misleading and intrusive of the jury\u2019s exclusive authority to resolve factual disputes and, therefore, that it violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We have long recognized the rule that a claim of an erroneous jury charge must be evaluated by reading the alleged offending portion in the context of the trial court\u2019s whole charge. <em>State v. Brown, </em>128 N.H. 606, 615, 517 A.2d 831, 837 (1986); <em>Poulin v. Provost, </em>114 N.H. 263, 265, 319 A.2d 296, 298 (1974). An examination of the supplemental charge at issue, when read and evaluated in the context of the facts of this case, reveals no prejudice to the defendant and hence no reversible error. <em>See State v. Jordan, </em>130 N.H. 48, 49, 534 A.2d 378, 379 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Under the facts of this case, the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge could not possibly have invaded the jury\u2019s exclusive fact-finding province. <em>See Ewing v. Burnet, </em>36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 41, 50-51 (1837). The evidence that Tom Ward was the driver of the stolen vehicle was uncontroverted. The defendant himself testified to this fact. Thus, the jury could only have been concerned with the purely legal question of whether a person could be guilty of theft of an automobile when he was not the operator of the stolen car. The defendant concedes that the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s inquiry was legally correct, and we do not find the trial court\u2019s supplemental charge to be misleading or incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We find <em>State v. Frederick, </em>32 Wash. App. 624, 648 P.2d 925 (Ct. App. 1982), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>674 P.2d 136 (Wash. 1983), to be persuasive. The jury submitted to the court a request for supplementary instructions which asked: \u201cDoes the law preclude a knife of less than three inches long of being a deadly weapon?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625, 648 P.2d at 926. The court answered in writing \u201cNo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the trial court\u2019s supplementary instruction was upheld, since, as here, both counsel were present and apprised of the jury\u2019s question, the question was unambiguous, and the court\u2019s response was legally correct. The court\u2019s response, as in the present case, was confined to a wholly legal issue and, therefore, did not usurp the jury\u2019s exclusive fact-finding authority. <em>Id. </em>at 626, 648 P.2d at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">In contrast, in <em>State v. Jones, </em>125 N.H. 490, 484 A.2d 1070 (1984), upon which the defendant relies, the jurors asked the court for a supplementary instruction concerning whether \u201cthe lack of a signature on Mr. Jones\u2019 statement [meant] a complete denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 484 A.2d at 1071. (In <em>Jones, </em>the defendant claimed that he did not sign the statement because it was not true.) The court responded: \u201c[t]he answer is no.\u201d <em>Id. Jones </em>is distinguishable from this case because, in <em>Jones, </em>the court\u2019s response created a realistic danger that the jury would be misled by mistaking an answer to an open-ended legal question for a definitive answer to a factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">As <em>Jones </em>pointed out, a lawyer would likely have interpreted the court\u2019s response to the supplementary query as meaning that the absence of the defendant\u2019s signature on his statement did not compel the conclusion that the defendant denied the truth of his entire statement and, therefore, that more than one factual interpretation of the signature\u2019s absence was possible. <em>Id. </em>at 494, 484 A.2d at 1073. A juror, on the other hand, might well have interpreted the court\u2019s response to mean that the defendant\u2019s refusal to sign the statement did not constitute a complete retraction of it; that is, a juror could easily have regarded the court\u2019s response as the resolution of a factual issue rather than as a statement of the law which left the factual issue open, to be decided by the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In the present case there was no danger that jurors would mistake the court\u2019s response to a legal question for a definitive answer to a disputed f\u00e1ctual question. The query which the jurors posed plainly asked what the law requires, and the court plainly answered that the law <em>does not </em>require one to be driving an automobile in order to be charged with the theft of that automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We conclude that the defendant has failed to show that the trial court\u2019s supplementary instruction to the jury was incomplete, misleading or violative of his constitutional right to have a jury decide the facts necessary for a finding of guilt based on a correct legal charge. On the contrary, the instruction was unambiguous, legally correct and, in light of the clarity and specificity of the jury\u2019s question, entirely appropriate. We therefore affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
