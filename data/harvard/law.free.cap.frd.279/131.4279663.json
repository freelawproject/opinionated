SCHEINDLIN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b178-19\">1. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">In this consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d), plaintiffs seek relief from contamination, or threatened contamination, of groundwater from various defendants\u2019 use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and/or tertiary butyl alcohol, a product formed by the natural degradation of MTBE in water. In February 2011, Orange County Water District (\u201cOCWD\u201d or \u201cthe District\u201d) moved for partial summary judgement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) on three claims against certain defendants associated with fourteen gasoline service station sites.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a June 20, 2011 Opinion and Order, this Court denied OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment under the Orange County Water District Act (\u201cOCWD Act\u201d) as to the recovery costs incurred by OCWD for testing production wells for MTBE and commissioning reports to investigate and characterize the groundwater impacts from MTBE. The Court also denied OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment for its trespass claim. This Court then ordered OCWD to show cause as to why summary judgment should not be granted in favor of defendants for these two claims. This Opinion assumes familiarity with the background and procedural posture of this case, as described in the June 20 Opinion and Order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">A. Summary Judgement</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018An issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u201cThe moving party bears the burden of establishing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the burden of proof at trial would fall on the nonmoving party, it ordinarily is sufficient for the movant to point to a lack of evidence to go to the trier of fact on an essential element of the nonmovant\u2019s claim.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In turn, to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must raise a genuine issue of material fact. To do so, the non-moving party \u201c \u2018must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201c \u2018may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court must \u201c\u2018construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, \u201c \u2018[credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The role of the court is not to resolve disputed issues of fact but to assess whether there are any factual issues to be tried.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-17\">B. Expert Testimony and Rule 26</p>\n<p id=\"b179-18\">Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that all expert witnesses submit a written report if \u201cthe witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony on the case or one whose duties as the party\u2019s employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Parties must make such disclosures and reports \u201cat the times and in the sequence that the court orders.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-19\">Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs expert opinion testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Expert testimony is that which is based on \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Lay opinion testimony is governed by Rule 701 and \u201cmust be \u2018rationally based on the perception of the witness.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cThis requirement \u2018is the familiar requirement of first-hand knowledge or observation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cAn essential difference [between Rule 701 and 702] is that Rule 701 requires direct personal knowledge of a factual matter at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">C. Rule 37(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c) states that \u201c[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion ... unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The purpose \u201cis to prevent the practice of \u2018sandbagging\u2019 an opposing party with new evidence. Courts in this Circuit recognize that preclusion of evidence pursuant to Rule 37(c)(1) is a drastic remedy and should be exercised with discretion and caution.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In its earlier motion, OCWD sought to recover costs associated with (1) testing for MTBE at drinking water production wells associated with stations where MTBE was released and (2) retaining consultants to investigate and characterize groundwater impacts from MTBE.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> After finding that the plain language of the OCWD Act prohibits the recovery of OCWD\u2019s testing and report-commissioning costs, I denied summary judgment as to those costs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> I then ordered OCWD to show cause as to why summary judgment should not be granted in favor of defendants.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">A. <em>Orange County Water District v. Arnold Engineering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">OCWD asks this Court to reconsider its denial of partial summary judgment with respect to investigative costs in light of the California Court of Appeals decision in <em>Orange County Water District v. Arnold Eng</em>ineering,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which was published three days after the issuance of the June 20 Opinion and Order.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> OCWD contends that the <em>Arnold Engineering </em>decision \u201cagrees with OCWD\u2019s position that the costs of investigation may be recovered under the [OCWD] Act.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">State appellate decisions are ordinarily binding on federal courts applying state law.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> However, the portion of <em>Arnold Engineering </em>on which OCWD relies is dicta that I am not bound to follow. In <em>Arnold Engineering, </em>the defendants sought to disqualify OCWD\u2019s counsel, the law firm of Miller, Ax-line &amp; Sawyer (\u201cMiller Firm\u201d), on the grounds of their contingency fee arrangement.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201cThe issue before the <em>[Arnold Engineering </em>court] [was] whether the Water District and the Miller Firm [were] prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action on the public\u2019s behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If so, the contingency fee arrangement between the Miller Firm and OCWD would be subject to a heightened neutrality standard as explained in <em>County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court </em>and <em>People ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>rel. Clancy v. Superior Court.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court found that OCWD did not bring suit on the public\u2019s behalf but rather in its own name; therefore, the contingency fee arrangement between OCWD and the Miller firm need not meet the limitations established in <em>Clancy </em>and <em>Santa Clara.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In the course of finding that OCWD was bringing suit in its own name, the <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">Indeed, regardless whether the Water District\u2019s interest in the groundwater is classified as regulatory, proprietary, or usufructuary, the Water District is entitled to recover monetary damages for the <em>investigation </em>and remediation costs it incurred and will incur in the future. As explained both the Water Code and the Health and Safety Code authorize the Water District to bring an action in its own name to recover <em>investigation </em>and remediation costs it incurred without regard to the particular interest the Water District holds in the contaminated groundwater.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG\">OCWD now points to this statement and argues that the <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court \u201cinterpreted the remedies provisions of [the OCWD Act] as authorizing recovery of investigative costs.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> I disagree. The statement on which OCWD relies is dicta. The <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court did not consider the issue of whether the OCWD Act allows for recovery of investigative costs nor do I know if this issue was briefed and argued by the parties.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The court did not examine the definitions of investigative and remedial costs, the potential differences between the two categories of costs or their treatment under the OCWD Act.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Instead, in reaching its holding that OCWD was bringing the litigation on its own behalf, the <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court focused on the nature of OCWD\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As dicta, the statement on which OCWD relies does not alter this Court\u2019s previous finding that the plain language of the OCWD Act prohibits recovery of OCWD\u2019s investigatory costs.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">B. Non-Investigative Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">1. Herndon\u2019s Declaration</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">In response to the June 20 Opinion and Order, OCWD now offers a declaration by its Chief Hydrogeologist, Roy Herndon, to ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>gue that \u201csignificant amounts of MTBE have migrated off-site at each of the fourteen stations\u201d and that \u201cOCWD has moved beyond investigating off-site MTBE and has begun designing remedial systems for MTBE that has migrated off-site.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Defendants are moving to strike Herndon\u2019s declaration on the grounds that OCWD failed to produce an expert report for Herndon in violation of Rule 26.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> OCWD contends that an expert report was not needed because Herndon\u2019s testimony does not fall under Rule 26\u2019s definition of expert testimony.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> OCWD argues that Herndon\u2019s testimony \u201cis based on facts personally known to him through his work at [OCWD] and merely relates conclusions reached by him in the course of his employment\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and is therefore \u201cpercipient rather than expert in nature.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A89\">Much of Herndon\u2019s declaration, however, is not based on his perceptions, but on his experience and specialized knowledge. For example, Herndon\u2019s declaration covers, among other things, the typical costs of remediating groundwater contamination, typical groundwater flow rates, the extent of the MTBE off-site migration\u2014which was based on his review of consultant and expert reports rather than his own investigation\u2014as well as the significance of OCWD\u2019s commitment of funds for \u201cdrilling borings and collecting depth-specific ground water samples\u201d to OCWD\u2019s remediation efforts.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Herndon could not have drawn these conclusions from his first-hand perceptions or investigatory findings.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> To reach these conclusions, Herndon \u201cnecessarily relied upon a reasoning process utilizing technical knowledge beyond that normal to the activities of everyday life, triggering the application of the expert disclosure rules.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Although the Herndon declaration may contain expert testimony, under Rule 26(a)(2)(A), defendants are not entitled to an expert report unless Herndon is \u201ca witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or whose duties as an employee of the party regularly involve giving expert testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Defendants have not submitted evidence showing that Herndon\u2019s \u201cduties ... regularly involve giving expert testimony.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Instead, defendants contend that this Court had already ruled that OCWD\u2019s six employee experts\u2014 which included Herndon\u2014are required to submit a report.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> I disagree. Although I had assumed during that particular hearing that the six employees would testify as experts\u2014and would therefore be required to submit an expert report\u2014the subject was not fully discussed or briefed and I made no such ruling.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Defendants have not proffered any evidence indicating that Herndon\u2019s duties include regularly giving expert testimony. Defendants are therefore not entitled to an expert report.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s motion to strike Herndon\u2019s declaration is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Defendants Exxon Mobil Corporation and ExxonMobil Oil Corporation (\u201cExxonMobil\u201d) separately move to strike portions of Herndon\u2019s declaration that reference former Mobil station # 18-HDR, located at 3195 Harbor Boulevard, Costa Mesa, CA.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> ExxonMobil asserts that OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment only addressed fourteen sites, and former Mobil station # 18-HDR is not one of them. OCWD contends that it reads the Court\u2019s order to show cause as implicating OCWD\u2019s entire claim under the OCWD Act, including stations for which OCWD did not seek partial summary judgment.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Therefore, OCWD asserts that it is entitled to submit evidence with respect to any station that may be affected by the Court\u2019s order to show cause.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> This Court, however, specifically stated that OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment concerned only <em>\u201ccertain </em>defendants associated with the fourteen gasoline service stations sites.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Therefore, the portions of Herndon\u2019s declaration relating to former Mobil station # 18-HDR are irrelevant and are stricken.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">2. Costs Associated with Testing Production Wells and Commissioning Consultant Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Although OCWD may use much of Herndon\u2019s declaration, defendants are still entitled to partial summary judgment. OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>recover costs associated with testing production wells and commissioning consultant reports.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In the June 20 Opinion and Order, I held that those costs did not fall under the OCWD Act\u2019s definition of remediation.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> OCWD, to this date, has not presented any evidence to the contrary. Instead, OCWD asks the Court to \u201c \u2018liberally construe\u2019 the term \u2018other remedial action\u2019 to include all costs incurred in the process of remediation <em>other than </em>investigatory costs.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> OCWD offers evidence\u2014through Herndon\u2019s declaration\u2014that it has spent three million dollars to \u201cconduct bore hole drilling and depth-specific sampling.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> OCWD offers further evidence that these activities are \u201can integral component of the design process for remediation systems.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> OCWD\u2019s line of argument, however, misses the point. This new evidence does not relate to the costs of production well testing or the commissioning of the consultant reports. Rather, OCWD is asking this Court to grant summary judgement for costs that were not the subject of its previous motion for partial summary judgment and that OCWD has not previously presented to the Court.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> I decline to do so. Because OCWD has failed to present any evidence as to why its testing and report commissioning constitute remedial action, I now grant summary judgment to the defendants and find that those costs are not recoverable under the OCWD Act.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">OCWD asks that if the Court enters partial summary judgment against OCWD, the Court clarify that it is doing so because OCWD\u2019s claims under the OCWD Act are not ripe and that OCWD may seek relief in the future under the Act with respect to \u201creasonable costs incurred.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> I find that OCWD\u2019s claims are ripe with respect to the costs of production well testing and the commissioning of the consultant reports. OCWD moved for summary judgment with respect to those costs. As stated above, I am granting partial summary judgment on those claims in defendants\u2019 favor. This finding, however, will not prejudice OCWD\u2019s ability to seek future relief for other remedial costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">C. OCWD\u2019s Trespass Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The June 20 Opinion and Order also denied OCWD\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to its claim for tres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>pass.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> I found that OCWD does not have \u201cexclusive\u2014or even primary\u2014possession of the property interest allegedly invaded by the MTBE contamination, and therefore cannot assert the claim for continuing trespass.\u201d <footnotemark>65</footnotemark> I then ordered OCWD to show cause as to why summary judgment should not be entered in favor of the defendants with respect to the trespass claim.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In their response, OCWD contends that defendants have not cited any authority that a possessory interest in groundwater must be exclusive of all others before the holder of that interest may bring a trespass claim based upon contamination.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> However, defendants have successfully argued\u2014and I have held\u2014that exclusive possession is a necessary prerequisite to bringing a trespass claim.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> OCWD then again quotes the passage in <em>Arnold Engineering </em>where the court stated that OCWD is \u201c \u2018entitled to recover monetary damages for ... investigation and remediation costs\u2019 \u201d regardless of \u201c \u201cwhether the Water District\u2019s interest in the ground water is classified as regulatory, proprietary or usufructuary.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> OCWD never explains how this statement supports its argument that it has the prerequisite property interest to bring its trespass claim. Instead, OCWD goes on to assert that the <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court \u201calso made clear that OCWD\u2019s interests in groundwater are not to be diminished simply because those interests include regulatory and management authority.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> This statement is also unhelpful. The statement is merely a reference to <em>Arnold, Engineering's </em>rejection of defendants\u2019 argument that OCWD cannot bring the suit in its own name because it only \u201cexercises sovereign powers to regulate and protect groundwater for its users\u2019 benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> OCWD\u2019s arguments are unavailing. Although the court mentioned that OCWD alleged a claim for trespass,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> <em>Arnold Engineering </em>never addressed the merits of the claim. Once again, the <em>Arnold Engineering </em>court focused on the nature of OCWD\u2019s claims and the fact that they were being brought on OCWD\u2019s own behalf.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Because OCWD has failed to show cause as to why judgment should not be granted against it, summary judgment is entered in favor of defendants on the trespass claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">For the reasons previously stated, defendants\u2019 motion to strike the declaration of Roy Herndon is denied; however ExxonMobil\u2019s motion to strike portions of the declaration relating to Mobil # 18-HDR is granted. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close these motions (Docket Nos. 276 and 277). Furthermore, partial summary judgment is entered in favor of the defendants for OCWD\u2019s claims for costs associated with testing production wells and commissioning consultant reports as well as for OCWD\u2019s claim for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-13\">.
