We agree that the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion to suppress, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction as to both charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on October 4, 2014, the complainant provided a written statement to the North Haven Police Department alleging that her husband, the defendant, had assaulted her at approximately 4:30 p.m. that day. The statement reads: \"[The defendant] followed me outside to my car yelling at me and he picked up a grey PVC pipe and swung it at me and hit me in the right hip on the side of my rear. Prior to swinging the pipe he threw a piece of wood at me and\n   I had an open umbrella in my hand and used it as a shield and the umbrella broke. After he struck me with the PVC pipe he then blocked me from entering my house so I got my keys out of my car which was in the driveway and went up the stairs to enter from the deck thr[ough] my kitchen. He followed me up yelling at me but did not strike me again. I grabbed my makeup case and left the house and got in my car and headed to work. On my way to work I called the [North] Haven police main [phone] number to see if I could file a complaint over the phone just to have it on record and was told I needed to come down here and file it in person and I said [okay] I couldn't I had to go to work. I did get to work around 5 p.m. and headed to the [North] Haven Police [Department] after work [at approximately] 11:30 [p.m.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the complainant provided her written statement, the officers photographed a bruise on her right hip, which she claimed resulted from the defendant striking her with the PVC pipe. The complainant also indicated to police that there was a history of domestic violence between her and the defendant, and that he became angry and violent when drinking alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Acting on the basis of the information that the complainant provided, Officers John Gaspar and Michael DiCocco of the North Haven Police Department went to the defendant's residence to question him. The defendant answered the door to his home, but remained inside the doorway and refused to speak with the officers. The defendant then attempted to close the door to his home, but Gaspar prevented him from doing so by stepping \"inside with [his] foot at the base of the door ....\" In his testimony, Gaspar acknowledged that he needed to step over the threshold to arrest the defendant, and described the place of arrest as in \"the foyer.\" The defendant was placed under arrest and transported to the police station by DiCocco, while\n   Gaspar remained at the residence to wait for the complainant to arrive home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While in custody, and after having received\n   a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   warning at 1:34 a.m., the defendant made an oral statement to DiCocco. The officer testified at trial as to the contents of the statement, stating that the defendant said that during \"an argument [the complainant] was very upset. And that she had taken a metal pipe and that she was hitting him with it. [The defendant] said that he then removed it from her hands, and he told me that he struck her with it once.\" When DiCocco tried to question him about the incident, the defendant stated that he did not strike the complainant. The defendant was released from police custody, and was charged subsequently with assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) and disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the custodial statements that he made to police indicating that he had hit the complainant with a \" 'metal tube,' \" on the ground that the statements were the tainted fruit of an unconstitutional, warrantless arrest under the state and federal constitutions. The court heard the testimony of Gaspar and DiCocco, and Chris Zyck, a friend of the defendant who claimed to have been present during the arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the presentation of testimony, the court denied the defendant's\n   motion to suppress, finding (1) \"the officers had probable cause to effectuate a warrantless arrest of the defendant\" from \"the information the officers had from the [complainant],\" and (2) \"exigent circumstances existed at the time of the arrest.\" Thereafter, in their respective testimonies at trial, both the complainant and the defendant denied that the incident occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complainant's statement to the police was admitted as a full exhibit pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502338,6503652,6502425,6503432,6503216,6503540,6502525,6502614,6502713,6503325,6503134\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/994/\">\n    479 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%20597\">\n    107 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20598\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). On April 7, 2016, the jury found the defendant guilty of assault in the second degree and disorderly conduct. On June 17, 2016, the court sentenced the defendant to five years incarceration, execution suspended after three years, and two years of probation on the count of assault in the second degree, and ninety days incarceration\n   on the count of disorderly conduct, to be served concurrently. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We address first the defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of\n   assault in the second degree. Specifically, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that the PVC pipe was a dangerous instrument within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-3 (7) because \"the state did not prove, and did not attempt to prove, that the ... PVC pipe ... in this case was capable under the circumstances in which it was used of causing 'serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health or serious loss or impairment of\n   the function of any bodily organ.' \" We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We begin by setting forth our standard of review. \"In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test.

Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964282\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/742/#p754\">\n    289 Conn. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754-55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20A.2d%20322\">\n    961 A.2d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ... with intent to cause physical injury to another person, the actor causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument other than by means of the discharge of a firearm ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2).

Fur-thermore, apart from a photograph of the bruise on the complainant's hip that resulted from that single swing, there was no evidence as to the amount of force with which the plastic PVC pipe was used to strike her. Of course, it is possible to imagine other scenarios in which the use of a PVC pipe might be shown capable of causing serious physical injury, such as a single blow to the\n   eyes, nose or ears that might be shown capable of causing serious disfigurement, or multiple blows to other, more vulnerable or sensitive body parts, such as the head, the genitals or the abdomen, that might be shown capable of causing serious loss or impairment of the function of a bodily organ. However, the theoretical existence of other possible uses of a PVC pipe that could have caused the complainant serious physical injury, thus supporting a finding that the PVC pipe is a dangerous instrument, provides no basis for making such a finding in this case, where the evidence does not show that the defendant actually engaged in any such conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The complainant, of course, did not actually sustain a serious physical injury. Although the actual infliction of serious physical injury is not required to prove that an object used to inflict injury was a dangerous instrument, the lack of such an injury in this case obviously deprived the jury of any basis for inferring the pipe's injury producing potential from the injury alone. The state did not present any medical testimony as to the potential injurious consequences of striking the average person with a plastic PVC pipe of the type here used, much less the particular susceptibility of this complainant to suffering serious physical injury when struck once in the buttocks with such a pipe, as she was. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McColl\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309278\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/74/545/#p554\">\n    74 Conn.App. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20A.2d%20107\">\n    813 A.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (in determining whether \" 'feet and footwear' \" were dangerous instrument, this court considered vulnerability of victim, who was seventy-one years old and had heart condition, and medical testimony presented that part of body that defendant repeatedly kicked contains several vital organs, including lungs and kidneys, as to which older person, when kicked repeatedly, could suffer serious internal injuries or death). Other than having the opportunity to observe both the complainant and the defendant when they testified, and to see the complainant's bruise in the photograph that was admitted into evidence, the jury had no basis for inferring\n   the ultimate potential of the pipe to cause her serious physical injury when used as the defendant used it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In conclusion, our law concerning dangerous instru-ments is clear that an \"object's potential for injury ... must be examined only in conjunction with the\n   circumstances in which it is actually used or threatened to be used, and not merely viewed in terms of its dangerous capabilities in the abstract.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Leandry\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=161%20Conn.%20App.%20379\">\n    161 Conn.App. at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%201115\">\n    127 A.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, at most, the jury could have found that the defendant swung a plastic PVC pipe at the complainant once, striking her in the buttocks and causing a bruise to her hip. I do not believe that such evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding, as required for a conviction of assault in the second degree, that the PVC pipe the defendant used to strike the complainant was, as used, a dangerous instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, I would reverse the defendant's conviction for assault in the second degree, and remand this case to the trial court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal on that charge and to afford the defendant a new trial on the charges of disorderly conduct, as the majority hereby orders, and on the lesser included offense of assault in the third degree, on which a judgment of conviction would otherwise enter, in the absence of other trial error, upon the defendant's acquittal of assault in the second degree.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Although the defendant described the PVC pipe at one point as a \" 'metal tube,' \" the state consistently at trial represented that the PVC pipe was plastic. In addition to the testimony of Officer Gaspar of the North Haven Police Department that the PVC pipe was plastic, the state's attorney told the jury during closing argument that \"PVC piping is a hard plastic used often times in plumbing.\" Although the defendant's single description of the pipe as a \" 'metal tube' \" may reveal the defendant's perception of the heft or rigidity of the pipe, the record is bereft of any actual description of the weight of the pipe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
