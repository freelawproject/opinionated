Although Chief Justice Rogers was not present when the case was argued before the court, she has read the briefs and appendices, and listened to a recording of the oral argument prior to participating in this decision.

Urbanowski, guilty of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1), breach of the peace in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (2), strangulation in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64bb (a), and threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1), in connection with a 2012 incident in which he was alleged to have, inter alia, choked the victim. The state also charged the defendant with being a persistent serious felony offender, to which he pleaded nolo contendere after the jury had found him guilty of the other charges. See General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 53a-40 (c) and (j). The trial court sentenced him to a total effective sentence of fourteen years incarceration, followed by six years of special parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant appealed from the trial court's judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming, among other things, that the trial court had improperly admitted evidence of his prior uncharged alleged misconduct. Specifically, the trial court permitted testimony of a woman whom the defendant had allegedly choked approximately ten years earlier as probative of the defendant's intent in the 2012 incident. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that, although the trial court had abused its discretion in admitting the uncharged misconduct testimony, the defendant had not demonstrated that the error was harmful.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Urbanowski,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20Conn.%20App.%20377\">\n    163 Conn.

We do not consider whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in admitting\n   the uncharged misconduct evidence because we agree that any such error would be harmless for the reasons given by the Appellate Court. Because the Appellate Court's well reasoned opinion fully addresses the certified question, it would serve no purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. We therefore adopt the Appellate Court's opinion as the proper statement of the issue of harmlessness and the applicable law concerning that issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Recall Total Information Management, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%2046\">\n    317 Conn. 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%20458\">\n    115 A.3d 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    In response to the defendant's claims on appeal, the state argues, in part, that the trial court properly admitted the uncharged misconduct evidence as prior misconduct that was probative of the defendant's specific intent. The state asserts that the Appellate Court, in reaching a contrary conclusion, improperly applied a heightened standard for the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence, a standard not supported by the Connecticut Code of Evidence or the decisions of this court, which should alone control the admission of evidence. Because we affirm the Appellate Court's judgment on the ground that any error by the trial court was harmless, we do not consider whether the trial court properly admitted the evidence at issue. See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Brunetti\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668656\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/39/#p77\">\n     279 Conn. 39\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 77,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=901%20A.2d%201\">\n     901 A.2d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006), cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20U.S.%201212\">\n     549 U.S. 1212\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20S.%20Ct.%201328\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1328\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2085\">\n     167 L.Ed.2d 85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007). Nevertheless, we note that we do not necessarily share the state's view that the Appellate Court applied a heightened or improper standard. We do, however, agree with the state that the Connecticut Code of Evidence and this court's decisions alone govern the admission of evidence in our state courts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
