He claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal; (2) improperly concluded that his guilty plea to kidnapping in the first degree was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary in light of our Supreme Court's subsequent reinterpretation of our kidnapping statutes in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734708\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/509/\">\n    287 Conn. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ; and (3) improperly concluded that he was not actually innocent of kidnapping in the first degree.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following factual and procedural history is relevant to this appeal.

The subsequent investigation revealed that the phone number that Brown's abductors had called with his phone while driving to his house was the petitioner's phone number and that the petitioner was known to drive a white Mazda minivan. Id., at *3. Detectives then interviewed the petitioner concerning his involvement in the Brown abduction and robbery. In a signed incident report, Detective Richard S. Yeomans reported that the petitioner \"admitted to being involved in the [k]idnapping and [r]obbery .... He stated [Kyle] Glenn, [James] Freelove, and [Kevin] Harrison went into the house with Brown while he waited outside in his vehicle.\" Yeomans further reported that Freelove had \"admitted to being involved with the kidnapping and robbery of Jerry Brown in Shelton. He further stated Jermaine Little, Kevin Harrison and Isaac Peoples were the other participants in the kidnapping and robbery. Freelove stated he and Harrison were in Beardsley Terrace when Little pulled up to them and asked if they wanted to do a 'job' with him. Freelove stated Little then went [to] pick up Peoples.... Peoples and Little were armed with semi automatic handguns.\" Freelove explained that, after they abducted Brown, he, Harrison and Peoples drove with Brown in Brown's car while the petitioner followed them in his van. Freelove \"stated when they arrived at Brown's house they all went into the house including Little.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The petitioner subsequently was charged in state court with kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101, and robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (state case).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner was further charged in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (1) (federal\n   case).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 3:05-CV-1674 (MRK),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202361723\">\n    2006 WL 2361723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (D. Conn. August 15, 2006). During this time, the petitioner also had an ongoing state narcotics case, for which he received a sentence of eight years of imprisonment while the state and federal cases remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although \"[t]he petitioner initially pleaded not guilty and consistently exhibited an intent to take the case to\n   trial\";\n   <em>\n    Little I\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204415754\">\n    2008 WL 4415754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ; he ultimately decided to plead guilty pursuant to separate written plea agreements with the state and the federal government. Under the terms of those agreements, the petitioner agreed to plead guilty to kidnapping in the first degree in the state case and to being a felon in possession of a firearm in the federal case. In exchange, the state and the federal government agreed to recommend to their respective sentencing courts a sentence of fifteen years and eight months of imprisonment, and to request that the state and federal sentences run concurrently. The parties further agreed that it would be left to the discretion of the sentencing courts whether to run those sentences concurrently with or consecutively to the eight year sentence that the petitioner had begun serving in the narcotics case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 29, 2004, the petitioner pleaded guilty in federal court to being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202361723\">\n    supra,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202361723\">\n    2006 WL 2361723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1. On December 22, 2004, the petitioner pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the first degree. At the beginning of the plea hearing, the prosecutor informed the court,\n   <em>\n    Carroll, J.\n   </em>\n   , that the petitioner was pleading guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement, and she briefly explained the terms of that agreement. The prosecutor then informed the court that \"counsel is telling me [that the petitioner] again is making clear he wishes to reject the state's offer. And if that's so, I'm just going to ask that the court make full inquiry so that we don't later have a collateral proceeding claiming that his lawyer didn't inform him or that he wasn't aware of these things.\" The prosecutor expressed her surprise that the petitioner would repudiate the plea agreement. She observed that the petitioner was currently exposed to a maximum term of imprisonment of sixty-five years\n   in the state case, that his sentencing exposure would increase if the state charged him with conspiracy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that, if\n   the petitioner rejected the plea agreement, the state could seek a sentence of more than fifteen years and eight months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court briefly canvassed the petitioner to ensure that he understood the terms of his plea agreement, that he did not have to plead guilty, and that it was his decision alone whether to plead guilty. After discussing the matter with trial counsel, the petitioner represented, through trial counsel, that he was ready to plead guilty. The petitioner pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the first degree,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the prosecutor recited the factual basis\n   for the guilty plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reiterated the terms of the plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court next canvassed the petitioner to ensure that his plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. During this canvass, the petitioner confirmed, inter alia, that he understood the terms of his plea agreement; he had had enough time to speak with his attorney about the case; his attorney had explained to him the nature and elements of kidnapping in the first degree; his attorney had reviewed with him all of the state's evidence against him; the prosecutor's recitation of the facts supporting his guilty plea was \"essentially correct\"; nobody was threatening or forcing him to plead guilty; and he was voluntarily pleading guilty because he was in fact guilty. The court found that the petitioner's plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary and accepted it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petitioner was subsequently sentenced, in accordance with the terms of his plea agreement, to fifteen years and eight months of imprisonment in the state case and the federal case, and those sentences were run concurrently with each other and with the petitioner's sentence in the narcotics case. The prosecutor in the state case further indicated at the sentencing hearing that she had entered a nolle prosequi with respect to the petitioner's remaining charges of burglary in the first degree and robbery in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 3, 2006, the petitioner filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus (first habeas petition), in which he alleged various claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 1, 2008, while the first habeas petition remained pending, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734708\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/509/\">\n    287 Conn. at 517-18, 531, 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which it abrogated thirty years of kidnapping jurisprudence. Specifically, the\n   court held for the first time that to convict a defendant of a kidnapping in conjunction with another crime, the state must prove that the defendant \"intend[ed] to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which is necessary to commit the other crime.\" Id., at 542,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=949%20A.2d%201092\">\n    949 A.2d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 15, 2008, the first habeas court,\n   <em>\n    A.

The first habeas court, in part, rejected the petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because it concluded that, even if it presumed that trial counsel rendered deficient performance during the pleading process, the petitioner failed to prove prejudice. Id., at *3. The first habeas court observed: \"The evidence clearly reveals that the petitioner was present, with a firearm, in Brown's home when the robbery took place. It also reveals that the petitioner drove the rest of the kidnappers to Brown's workplace to set up the kidnapping and robbery.... In the absence of any compelling contrary evidence, this court cannot say that the petitioner would have been likely to be successful had he chosen to go to trial. Furthermore, the petitioner faced additional charges and, if he had chosen to go to trial, would have been exposed to a total possible sentence of sixty-five years. It is highly unlikely that he would have obtained a more favorable result than the fifteen years and eight months he received under the plea agreement. There would also be no guarantee that the sentence would\n   be set up to run concurrently with the federal sentence he faced, as the plea agreement provided.... While it is clear that the petitioner had previously expressed a desire to go to trial, the record also reveals that he made the decision to accept the state's plea offer knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.\" (Citations omitted.) Id., at *3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 22, 2013, the petitioner initiated this second habeas action. On June 9, 2015, the petitioner filed the operative habeas petition. In relevant part, the petitioner alleged in count one that his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because \"he did not know or understand that in order to be convicted of kidnapping in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B), a criminal defendant needed to intend to restrain the victim for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which was necessary to commit or advance the commission of a separate felony\" (due process claim). In count four, the petitioner alleged that he was actually innocent of kidnapping in the first degree because he \"did not intend to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which was necessary to commit a separate crime\" (actual innocence claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 2, 2016, a one day trial was held. After hearing the evidence and argument from the parties, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Fuger, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued an oral ruling denying the second habeas petition as it pertained to the petitioner's due process and actual innocence claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. CV-13-4005250-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202935514\">\n    2016 WL 2935514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (May 2, 2016) (\n   <em>\n    Little II\n   </em>\n   ).

See\n   <em>\n    Hinds\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%2056\">\n    321 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   106-107 and n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%20596\">\n    136 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella, J., dissenting\n   </em>\n   ). Those answers are the narrowest grounds on which a majority of the panel clearly agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to the first reserved question, although a majority of the court in\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   agreed that\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   could be applied retroactively in collateral proceedings, there was no clear majority concerning how and to what extent\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   should be applied\n   retroactively. The three justice plurality adopted a general presumption of full retroactivity, subject to certain limited exceptions, while Justice Katz supported a per se rule in favor of full retroactivity. Neither Justice Palmer nor Justice McLachlan expressly endorsed a particular approach to retroactivity; they concurred only in the result reached by the plurality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   With respect to the second reserved question, the facts of the present case are sufficiently distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   such that the court's affirmative answer to the second reserved question also does not control the outcome of the present case. The petitioner was convicted after pleading guilty pursuant to a plea agreement with the state and federal government, and admitting his role in the Brown abduction and robbery. Luurtsema was convicted after a jury trial in which the jury was not instructed that, to find him guilty of kidnapping, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to prevent the victim's liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which was necessary to commit the other crime. A majority of the court in\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   further appears to have agreed that this instructional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the facts and circumstances of Luurtsema's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a result, there is no binding precedent controlling the unique issue presently before us: whether\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   should be\n   applied retroactively to collateral attacks on a kidnapping conviction when the defendant pleaded guilty to that charge, and only that charge, pursuant to a plea agreement. Having given thorough consideration to the various approaches endorsed by the justices in\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   , we find the reasoning of the plurality of the court in\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   to be the most persuasive in the context of\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   . As the United States Supreme Court has observed, one of the reasons that decisions\n   narrowing the scope of a criminal statute should generally apply retroactively is \"because [those decisions] necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Schriro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Summerlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2528610\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/348/#p352\">\n    542 U.S. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2528610\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/348/#p352\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2528610\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/348/#p352\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344353\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/740/#p743\">\n    299 Conn. at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20817\">\n    12 A.3d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning general presumption of retroactivity appropriate because \"considerations of finality simply cannot justify the continued incarceration of someone who did not commit the crime of which he stands convicted\" and it would be unjust and amount to judicial usurpation of the legislature to permit defendant to be convicted of \"two crimes where the legislature intended only one\").

The criminal conduct the petitioner admitted to engaging in at his plea hearing was extremely serious. See footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion. The petitioner along with three other individuals abducted Brown at gunpoint from his place of employment in Bridgeport, drove with him to his house in Shelton, forced their way into his house, and stole a substantial amount of money, jewelry, and property from his safe. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The entire nighttime incident lasted from approximately 8:45 p.m. until approximately 10:34 p.m. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The law clearly criminalizes this type of conduct under several statutes, including \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B).

Specifically, the petitioner agreed to plead guilty to kidnapping in the first degree and to being a felon in possession of a firearm in exchange for the certainty of concurrent sentences of fifteen years and eight months of imprisonment in the state and federal cases,\n   and the entry of a nolle prosequi on the remaining state charges. The petitioner has received precisely what he bargained for under the terms of that agreement. If\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   is applied retroactively in the present case and the petitioner's conviction is vacated, however, the state will have lost the benefit of its bargain. We recognize that in many cases the state and society's interest in \"finality must give way to the demands of liberty and a proper respect for the intent of the legislative branch.\"\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344353\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/740/#p743\">\n    299 Conn. at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20817\">\n    12 A.3d 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Luurtsema II\n   </em>\n   , the state in the present case can plausibly be said to have relied to its detriment on our Supreme Court's prior interpretation of our kidnapping statutes when constructing the terms of the plea agreement. To authorize a term of fifteen years and eight months imprisonment, the petitioner could have pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, or another appropriate felony offense, e.g., conspiracy to commit one of the aforementioned felonies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had the state been prescient enough to foresee\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   and thus selected a nonkidnapping offense as the basis for the guilty plea,\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   would be irrelevant and the state would not be faced with the prospect of reconstructing and reprosecuting a fourteen year old case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In light of these facts and circumstances, we fail to see how not applying\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   retroactively in the\n   present case would be fundamentally unfair or manifestly unjust. \"Plea bargains always entail risks for the parties-risks relating to what evidence would or would not have been admitted at trial, risks relating to how the jury would have assessed the evidence and risks relating to future developments\n   in the law. The salient point is that a plea agreement allocates risk between the two parties as they see fit. If courts disturb the parties' allocation of risk in an agreement, they threaten to damage the parties' ability to ascertain their legal rights when they sit down at the bargaining table and, more problematically for criminal defendants, they threaten to reduce the likelihood that prosecutors will bargain away counts (as the prosecutors did here) with the knowledge that the agreement will be immune from challenge on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9172792\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/400/459/#p464\">\n    400 F.3d 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (6th Cir.), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5935584,5986529,6000802,5879780,5963302,5918823,5988792,5970488,5951256,5920851,6002904,5978522,6010746,6013695\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/862/\">\n    546 U.S. 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20S.%20Ct.%20145\">\n    126 S.Ct. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20144\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) ; accord\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095711\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/207/#p213\">\n    406 F.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (3d Cir. 2005) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906591\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/794/#p798\">\n    124 F.3d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"If the law allowed the defendant to get off scot free in the event the argument later is shown to be a winner, then the defendant could not get the reduction in the first place.
