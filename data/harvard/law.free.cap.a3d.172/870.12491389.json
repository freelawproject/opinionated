The respondent father, Pablo R., appeals from the judgments of the trial\n   court finding that his two daughters, C.R.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and A.R., were neglected and abused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the respondent claims that the court abused its discretion in (1) permitting his appointed counsel to withdraw and (2) finding that he had waived his right to appointed counsel by conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record discloses the following procedural history. In March, 2016, the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families (commissioner), filed two motions for temporary custody and two neglect petitions, one for each of the respondent's children, C.R. and A.R. The petitions alleged that C.R. and A.R. were neglected and abused.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Attorney Roger Chiasson was appointed to represent the respondent as his counsel and filed an appearance on March 10, 2016. Six weeks later, Attorney Chiasson filed a motion to withdraw his appearance, representing that the attorney-client relationship had broken down in that the respondent had sought advice from another attorney and had expressed that he was not happy with the advice and counsel being given by Attorney Chiasson. The court,\n   <em>\n    Frazzini, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard argument on the motion on May 11. Attorney Chiasson represented that\n   the respondent had engaged in conversations with other lawyers, and, based on those conversations, had expressed to others that Attorney Chiasson may have been misleading him. The respondent objected to the withdrawal and\n   claimed that this was the first time he was hearing of Attorney Chiasson's dissatisfaction with the relationship. The respondent claimed that he had spoken to other people for advice but denied that he had discussed legal matters. The court granted the motion and ordered that new counsel be appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Attorney Elizabeth Potts Berman was appointed as the respondent's second counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Attorney Berman filed a motion to withdraw her appearance, representing that the attorney-client relationship had broken down irretrievably. During argument on July 20, the respondent objected to the withdrawal and again represented to the court that this was the first time he was hearing that \"this relationship had any problem.\" The court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the motion to withdraw and ordered that new counsel be appointed. However, Attorney Christine Rapillo from the Office of Public Defender informed the court that \"because a number of the lawyers from New Britain have covered the case ... we may have to look outside the New Britain panel to get someone ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Attorney Joshua Michtom, an employee of the public defender's office, was appointed as the respondent's third counsel and filed his appearance on July 27, 2016. Less than two weeks later, on August 5, Attorney Michtom filed a motion to withdraw his appearance, in which he represented that the respondent had yelled at him\n   after he refused to file certain motions that he deemed frivolous, unethical, and counterproductive. Attorney Michtom further represented that the respondent had registered a formal complaint against him with the Office of the Chief Public Defender and had indicated that he would like Attorney Michtom to withdraw on the basis that communication had broken down. Lastly, Attorney Michtom expressed a willingness to continue to represent the respondent, but noted that communication in the future might be impossible based on the respondent's \"having indicated unequivocally\" that he desired Attorney Michtom to withdraw. During a hearing on the motion on August 18, the respondent asserted a number of reasons in support of the request to withdraw, including that Attorney Michtom had been dishonest to the court and to the respondent, and that Attorney Michtom had represented him \"without any understanding of the case.\" Attorney Rapillo again appeared, stating that there were no panel attorneys left in New Britain, and that the public defender's office could not, under its contracts with individual attorneys, require an attorney to accept an appointment in another jurisdiction. The court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone, J.\n   </em>\n   , requested that the public defender's office appoint another attorney for the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court then issued the following warning to the respondent: \"You understand ... this is your last chance. If you have a fight with the next attorney, you're not going to be able to get one.\" The court further cautioned: \"Understand this is it. We don't have anybody else. You'll get one more lawyer.... If you have a disagreement with this next lawyer or this next lawyer feels abused or maligned by you, then you're going to have to represent yourself.\" The court instructed the parties\n   to return on September 1, 2016, and stated that \"I would like Mr. [R.] and new counsel here, because if he doesn't get new counsel, he's going to be instructed\n   that he either has to file a pro se appearance or he has to hire counsel on his own.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to September 1, 2016, Attorney Trudy Condio, a panel attorney from the Hartford Juvenile Court, was contacted by the public defender's office regarding appointment as the respondent's fourth counsel. At the hearing on September 1, which Attorney Condio had previously stated that she could not attend, the respondent indicated that he had not yet made a decision as to whether he wished to be represented by Attorney Condio, that he had been trying to set up a meeting with her, and that she did not have a copy of the file yet. The court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone, J.\n   </em>\n   , approved the appointment of Attorney Condio, stating that unless the court received a motion to withdraw from Attorney Condio, she would represent the respondent. The court warned that Attorney Rapillo \"indicated that she was going to have a hard time replacing Attorney Michtom and she has provided counsel for Mr. [R.]. If you are dissatisfied with Ms. Condio ... you are going to have to either file a pro se appearance indicating you're going to represent yourself or you're going to have to hire private counsel, because Ms. Rapillo represented to the court that she had no one else and this was the last person, if even she could get Ms. Condio.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 16, 2016, Attorney Condio filed a motion for continuance and a motion to withdraw her appearance stating that it was impossible to establish an attorney-client relationship based on the respondent's unreasonable demands. Attorney Condio represented\n   that although she had communicated with the respondent on four occasions, the respondent refused to meet with her before 5 p.m. and refused to meet with her without a third party present. Moreover, she claimed that the respondent insisted on meeting at his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 21, 2016, the court,\n   <em>\n    Abery-Wetstone, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard argument on Attorney Condio's motions. With respect to the respondent's insistence on a third party being present during attorney-client meetings, the respondent explained that he always had a third party present for his protection during his meetings with previous counsel and that he wanted to waive the attorney-client privilege. He also informed the court that he had a third party monitoring phone conversations \"so there wouldn't be any issue of the he said/she said ....\" Regarding the respondent's unwillingness to meet before 5 p.m., the respondent stated that although he was unemployed, he was busy with other personal, medical responsibilities that prevented him from meeting with Attorney Condio during business hours. The court ordered the respondent to meet with Attorney Condio with no one else present, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays, and denied the motions for continuance and to withdraw.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   After further\n   argument, the court asked the respondent: \"Mr. [R.], do you\n   wish to keep this attorney or do you wish to represent yourself?\" The court further inquired of the respondent whether he understood the potential danger of representing himself while his application for accelerated rehabilitation was pending in criminal court, to which the respondent replied, \"Yes, I-that's why I told the court back in September 1, 2016, that I was not qualified to represent myself ....\" The court then reminded the respondent that he previously had been warned: \"If you couldn't get along with [Attorney Condio], you were going to have represent yourself because I'm not going to give you a fifth attorney.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both parents were before the court for a hearing on October 14, 2016. On that date, the court,\n   <em>\n    Frazzini, J.\n   </em>\n   , permitted the mother's counsel to withdraw from representation based on the mother's filing of a grievance against that lawyer. The court rescheduled the trial, and addressed the respondent and the mother: \"I'm telling you both right now, don't expect or believe that if you obtain a new lawyer by hiring them, or if you-if your lawyer seeks to withdraw, that a new lawyer would be appointed for you. Do not anticipate that; do not expect that. It would not happen.\" The respondent asked: \"So Your Honor, so if we have an issue with misconduct or some issue that the lawyer violates Connecticut statute that we won't be allowed to obtain a new lawyer-a counsel? Is that my understanding?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, stating that the respondent had a legal right to file a grievance, asked the respondent to present the\n   grievance to the court first so the court could review the situation and determine whether the facts showed that the attorney had committed an act or failure to act that would necessitate withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the first day of trial, November 28, 2016, the respondent advised the court,\n   <em>\n    Frazzini, J.\n   </em>\n   , that he had filed a grievance against Attorney Condio because of failed communication and a lack of representation and stated: \"I don't think it's appropriate that Ms. Condio now go forward in representing me or my-or my best interests ....\" After hearing argument from the respondent and Attorney Condio, both advocating for withdrawal, the court stated that it had not found exceptional circumstances to justify discharging counsel at the last minute, which would cause a delay in trial, and ordered that evidence proceed. Attorney Condio noted further objection, and trial commenced. After the testimony\n   of the first witness, Attorney Condio orally moved the court to reconsider, stating that the public defender's office had expressed concern that her continued representation could create further liability. Counsel for the Department of Children and Families (department) and counsel for the children both agreed that Attorney Condio should be permitted to withdraw, but both expressed concern that the trial should not be continued. The court then stated that it would \"take the filing of the grievance as a-as an act terminating Attorney Condio's representation and allow you to withdraw.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After permitting Attorney Condio to withdraw, the court turned to the question of whether the respondent had waived his right to an appointed attorney by conduct. The respondent told the court that he was not stating that he was capable of representing himself, and he stated that he was \"not an attorney\" and was not \"familiar with this process.\" The court continued the matter until the next morning and ordered the parties to file briefs addressing whether the respondent had\n   waived his right to appointed counsel by virtue of his conduct and, if so, whether the trial should proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The next morning, the court,\n   <em>\n    Frazzini, J.\n   </em>\n   , heard argument from the department's counsel and the respondent as to whether the respondent had waived his right to appointed counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The respondent stated: \"[A]t no point did I ever indicate to this court or I'm telling you that now do I have the education or ability, or because I am indigent, to basically represent myself or seek outside counsel.\" The court concluded that the respondent had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appointed counsel by his conduct, and it declined to continue the trial to another date. The department then proceeded to call its witnesses. On the first day of trial, in the presence of the respondent, the court had set a number of court dates, including January 3, 2017. The respondent did not appear on January 3, and the trial continued. The court,\n   <em>\n    Frazzini, J.\n   </em>\n   , entered a default against the respondent and adjudicated C.R. and A.R. neglected and abused as alleged in the petitions. The court heard evidence as to disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 11, 2017, the court issued its written memorandum of decision committing the children to the custody of the commissioner until such time as a subsidy to the foster parent could be approved, at which time guardianship of the children would be transferred. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The respondent first claims that the court abused its discretion in permitting the respondent's fourth attorney to withdraw from representing him. Specifically, the respondent contends that his filing of a grievance against Attorney Condio did not require withdrawal\n   from representation, especially given that the respondent's complaints were \"vague and nothing more than disagreements with strategy and tactics.\" We disagree that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Attorney Condio to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth principles surrounding the attorney-client relationship. \"An attorney-client relationship is established when the advice and assistance of the attorney is sought and received in matters pertinent to his profession.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    DiStefano\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Milardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3990886\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/416/#p422\">\n    276 Conn. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20A.2d%20415\">\n    886 A.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). With respect to termination of the relationship, our Supreme Court has stated: \"The formal termination of the relationship occurs when the attorney is discharged by the client, the matter for which the attorney was hired comes to a conclusion, or a court grants the attorney's motion to withdraw from the representation. A\n   <em>\n    de facto termination\n   </em>\n   occurs if the client takes a step that unequivocally indicates that he has ceased relying on his attorney's professional judgment in protecting his legal interests, such as hiring a second attorney to consider a possible malpractice claim or filing a grievance against the attorney.\" (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nusbaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"655919\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/263/588/#p597\">\n    263 Conn. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597-98,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%20744\">\n    821 A.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Straw Pond Associates, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick, Mariano &amp; Santos, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487042\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/292/#p719\">\n    167 Conn.App. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487042\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/292/#p719\">\n    145 A.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488089,12488087\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/323/930/\">\n    323 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488089,12488090\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/231/\">\n    150 A.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the present case, the court concluded that the respondent's filing of a grievance constituted a de facto termination of the attorney-client relationship pursuant to\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court adopted the continuous representation doctrine, pursuant to which the statute of limitations applicable to legal malpractice claims may be tolled when the plaintiff can show: \"(1) that the defendant continued to represent him with regard to the same underlying matter; and (2) either\n   that the plaintiff did not know of the alleged malpractice or that the attorney could still mitigate the harm allegedly caused by that malpractice during the continued representation period.\" (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nusbaum\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"655919\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/263/588/#p597\">\n    263 Conn. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%20744\">\n    821 A.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first prong of the test prompted our Supreme Court to define termination of the attorney-client relationship, which it described as including de facto termination through the filing of a grievance against the attorney. Id., at 597-98,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%20744\">\n    821 A.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The respondent argues that the\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   court's definition of termination of the attorney-client relationship is limited to circumstances where the continuous representation doctrine is at issue. In so arguing, he points to the\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   court's statement that \"[o]nce such a step has been taken, representation may not be said to continue for purposes of the continuous representation doctrine.\" Id., at 598,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%20744\">\n    821 A.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court continued: \"A client who has taken such a concrete step may not invoke this doctrine, because such actions clearly indicate that the client no longer is relying on his attorney's professional judgment but instead intentionally has adopted a clearly adversarial relationship toward the attorney. Thus, once such a step has been taken, representation does not continue for purposes of the continuous representation doctrine.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=821%20A.2d%20744\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We agree that\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   elucidated the termination of an attorney-client relationship in the context of continuous representation. However, this court finds that it was within the trial court's discretion to use\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   as guidance in its determination that a de facto termination occurred based on the respondent's filing of a grievance against his appointed counsel in a juvenile proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although our appellate courts have not had occasion to consider whether de facto termination based on the filing of a grievance extends beyond the continuous representation doctrine, recently, this court in\n   <em>\n    Straw Pond Associates, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick, Mariano &amp; Santos, P.C.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487042\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/292/#p719\">\n    167 Conn.App. at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487042\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/145/292/#p719\">\n    145 A.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , described the\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   framework as \"instructive in that it defines what is meant by legal representation.\" Moreover, although\n   not binding on our analysis, we note that the Superior Court has cited to\n   <em>\n    DeLeo\n   </em>\n   's formal and de facto methods of termination in the context of determining the date representation terminated for purposes of a conflict of interest analysis under rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.

The relationship between the respondent and Attorney Condio, the respondent's fourth appointed attorney in approximately six months' time, had been the subject of a previous motion to withdraw filed by Attorney Condio approximately two months before trial commenced. In the interim, the respondent witnessed the withdrawal of the mother's counsel based on the mother's filing of a grievance, and at that hearing had inquired of the court whether he would be permitted to \"release\" his attorney if some misconduct had occurred. At trial, after learning from the respondent himself that he had indeed filed a grievance, the court asked whether the respondent had a copy of the grievance, inquired at length of the respondent as to why he believed Attorney Condio had violated her professional responsibilities, and inquired of Attorney Condio whether she believed she could continue to represent the respondent, which she stated she did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At oral argument before this court, counsel for the respondent clarified that his claim is that the trial court\n   should have once again told the respondent that if Attorney Condio was permitted to withdraw, he would not be appointed a fifth attorney. Given that the respondent had been given this exact warning numerous times on multiple occasions prior to the filing of his grievance against Attorney Condio, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in not issuing the warning yet again or in permitting Attorney Condio to withdraw from representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The respondent's second claim is that the court abused its discretion in finding that he had waived his right to appointed counsel by virtue of his conduct. Specifically, the respondent claims that the record is clear that he wanted representation and that his conduct did not rise to the level that has been found to justify a waiver of counsel in other cases. We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We begin our analysis by setting forth the governing legal principles regarding the right to counsel, self-representation, and waiver in the context of a neglect proceeding. As noted in part I of this opinion, a parent has a statutory right to appointed counsel in a neglect proceeding. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135. A parent may waive his statutory right to counsel in favor of representing himself.

I've indicated the basic, the general background facts, but in summary they include the fact that Mr. [R.] has had four appointed attorneys. All were removed at some level because of a client-attorney conflict. He was told the last time an attorney had been appointed that a new lawyer would not be automatically appointed. He was assured that the court would continue to monitor attorney conduct, and that if there was a legitimate claim of attorney misconduct with an action that warranted discharge of counsel, that the court would act in that\n   way, but after [the mother] had filed a grievance, that has necessitated the discharge of [her attorney]. He was specifically reminded to present any claim to the court first. And the reason for presenting it to the court first was so that the almost automatic de facto termination of a discharge of attorney that occurs by the filing of the grievance could be ... avoided and the court would have an opportunity to ascertain whether the complaints and the dissatisfaction of a person being represented by a lawyer were sufficient, that they met the standards for discharge of that lawyer. It's the court's duty to ensure that people who have counsel have competent, qualified and effective counsel. And I assured him that I would review any claim of misconduct, and that the assured filing of the grievance would not be that. So I find that the conduct has waived his right to an attorney ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The respondent concedes that waiver may be implied by conduct, but argues, based on out-of-state cases addressing forfeiture of the constitutional right to counsel, that the respondent's conduct has not risen to the level that has been found by sister courts to constitute a waiver of counsel. The cases relied upon by the respondent all involve criminal or habeas proceedings and violence, or threats thereof, by the defendant against appointed counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   None of these decisions\n   supports a conclusion that the court here abused its discretion in concluding that the respondent had waived his statutory right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This court's decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Daniel A.\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There, the court permitted the respondent's second attorney to withdraw from representation after the court informed the respondent that it would not appoint a third counsel if it granted the motion to withdraw.\n   <em>\n    In re Daniel A.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%2078\">\n    150 Conn.App. at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%201040\">\n    89 A.3d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Id., at 94-95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%201040\">\n    89 A.3d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the present case, the record is clear that the trial court was familiar with the respondent as a result of presiding over previous proceedings in the neglect and abuse case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the first day of trial, the respondent requested that his fourth appointed attorney be removed despite repeated warnings from the court that it would not provide him with a fifth attorney. The\n   respondent was aware that the withdrawal of Attorney Condio would mean that he would represent himself, having been expressly informed of this consequence by two different judges on at least four previous occasions. Moreover, the record shows a general understanding of legal proceedings, in that the respondent's frustration with Attorney Condio stemmed, in part, from certain motions he wished to file, evidence he wished to obtain, and exhibits he wished to introduce. The record also shows that the respondent indicated that he understood the hazards associated with representing himself. Lastly, the record indicates that the respondent understood the gravity of the proceedings; he stated he was seeking a \"fair shot of trying to debunk these allegations about neglect and abuse.\"\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    In re Daniel A.\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]lthough the record indicates that the respondent did not state, in so many words, that he no longer desired counsel, he engaged in a course of conduct that demonstrated that he knew what he [was] doing and [that] his choice [was] made with eyes open ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The respondent's attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Daniel A.\n   </em>\n   are entirely unavailing. As we concluded in part I of this opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not issuing the same repeated warning one final time. The record reveals that the respondent knew that his last minute request for Attorney Condio's withdrawal would mean that he would be representing himself.
