The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of the hearing officer that the plaintiff refused to submit to a chemical analysis of his breath. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of the appeal. On February 19, 2015, the plaintiff was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the incident, Officer Brian Hamm of the Stratford police department prepared a report that\n   included the following information. When Hamm arrived on the scene, the plaintiff's vehicle was disabled in a snowbank. Upon asking the plaintiff to place the vehicle in park and step out of the vehicle, Hamm observed that the plaintiff appeared confused. He asked Hamm and Sergeant Rosenbaum several times where he was. Hamm had to lean the plaintiff against his vehicle because of the plaintiff's inability to stand safely on his own. The plaintiff said that he had been playing tennis and, when asked where he was going, he responded, \"tennis.\" Hamm noted that the plaintiff appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Neither he nor Rosenbaum were able to detect an odor of alcohol at that time because of the cold weather.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hamm and Rosenbaum then asked the plaintiff if he had any medical issues, and the plaintiff responded that he might be a diabetic. The plaintiff was \"very disoriented,\" and said that he did not know where he was. Because of the plaintiff's inability to answer questions, Hamm requested that Stratford fire and emergency medical services respond to the scene. Another officer went to the plaintiff's residence to determine if his family was aware of any medical conditions affecting the plaintiff; the response was that the plaintiff had no known medical condition. The\n   plaintiff was placed in the rear of the patrol vehicle to stay warm. After Hamm and Rosenbaum sat in the patrol vehicle for a few minutes, they were able to detect the odor of alcoholic beverages. Stratford fire and emergency medical services arrived at the scene and, after evaluating the plaintiff, \"cleared [him] of any medical emergency.\" The plaintiff refused medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hamm did not conduct any field sobriety tests because of the inability of the plaintiff to stand and the plaintiff's failure to cooperate in answering questions. The plaintiff was arrested and transported to the Stratford police station, where he was processed. According\n   to Hamm's report, the plaintiff \"refused to waive his rights and also refused to answer any questions in the postarrest interview. ... [The plaintiff] was afforded the opportunity to call an attorney at [2:24 a.m.]. [The plaintiff] refused to submit to the breath test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b(c), Hamm completed an A-44 form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He checked a box indicating that the plaintiff had refused to perform field sobriety tests and had refused to answer whether he had any physical illness or injury preventing him from performing the field sobriety tests. Hamm noted on the form that probable cause to arrest was based on the motor vehicle crash and the odor of alcoholic beverages on the plaintiff's breath. The second page of the form, as filled out by Hamm, indicated that the plaintiff had refused to answer questions or to take a breath test. Sergeant Anthony Rhew swore to a printed statement on the form that the plaintiff \"refused to submit to such test or analysis when requested to do so. The refusal occurred in my presence and my endorsement appears below.\" A Breathalyzer test strip included in its printout the words \"test aborted refusal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 24, 2015, the commissioner sent a notice to the plaintiff to inform him of the suspension of his license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b. On March 17, 2015, an administrative hearing was held before a hearing officer pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b(g). On the same day, the hearing officer issued a decision finding, in its entirety, that (1) the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff, (2) the plaintiff was arrested, (3) the plaintiff refused to submit to chemical alcohol testing, (4) the plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle and (5) the plaintiff was not younger than twenty-one years of age. The\n   hearing officer ordered that the plaintiff's driver's license be suspended for six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the commissioner's decision suspending his operator's license. In a written memorandum of decision, the court found that there was substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's finding of refusal. The court reasoned that although the \"evidence does not provide detail as to the conversation between the officer and the plaintiff, there is no such requirement. ... The fact that the record contains four separate references to the plaintiff's refusal [to submit to chemical alcohol testing], albeit without great detail, provides a substantial and corroborated basis to conclude that the plaintiff did, in fact, refuse, and that the references to his refusal are not fabricated or erroneous.\" The court also stated that the plaintiff's claim that a physical condition rendered a test inadvisable was inadequately briefed and, in any event, had no effect on the question of whether\n   the hearing officer's conclusion was based on substantial evidence. The court dismissed the appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The determination of whether the plaintiff's actions constituted a refusal to submit to a Breathalyzer test is question of fact for the hearing officer to resolve.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1274515\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/70/76/#p81\">\n    70 Conn.App. 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20A.2d%20567\">\n    797 A.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"In an administrative appeal, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the commissioner's decision to suspend a motor vehicle operating privilege was clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. ...

Substantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. ... The evidence must be substantial enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury. ...
