He appeals following the habeas court's denial of his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the habeas court granting the motion to dismiss filed by the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction. He claims that the habeas court abused its discretion by denying his petition for certification to appeal and improperly dismissed four counts of his third amended petition. We dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and lengthy procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's appeal. In 1999, following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2), sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (1) (A), and three counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   to 1995) \u00a7 53-21 (2), as amended by No. 95-142, \u00a7 1, of the 1995 Public Acts. Subsequently, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J\n   </em>\n   ., found the petitioner guilty of being a persistent felony offender in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-40 (a). The petitioner was sentenced to a total effective term of forty years imprisonment, execution suspended after twenty-five years, followed by ten years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2001, he appealed from his conviction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and our Supreme Court set forth in detail the facts underlying his conviction. It explained that the petitioner, a thirty-five year old man, had engaged in three acts of sexual contact with MC, the twelve year old victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After MC told her mother about the sexual contact, the petitioner gave an incriminating statement to the police, which was read to the jury at trial. In the statement, the petitioner claimed that MC never objected to the contact and that the contact did not constitute sexual intercourse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Toccaline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"357762\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/542/#p546\">\n    258 Conn. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546-47,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=783%20A.2d%20450\">\n    783 A.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (\n   <em>\n    Toccaline I\n   </em>\n   ).

He was represented by Attorney Conrad Ost Seifert in both his first habeas trial and his subsequent habeas appeal. His amended first petition alleged: (1) eleven counts of ineffective assistance by\n   his trial counsel, Attorney Mark C. Hauslaib; (2) ineffective assistance by his direct appellate counsel, Attorney Richard S. Cramer; and (3) factual innocence. Following a habeas trial, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Richard M.
