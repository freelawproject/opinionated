We reverse the judgment and special finding of the court, and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to this appeal, which arises out of the 2008 sale of 59 Paper Chase Trail in Avon\n   (property) from Stephen Pellet to Kimberly Kilduff. The underlying action was commenced on September 9, 2011, against the defendants, who are Stephen Pellet's former real estate agents with respect to the sale of the property (Olson and Jenkins), the agents' employer/realty agency (Keller Williams),\n   Keller Williams' broker of record (Ladden), and the spouse of Kimberly Kilduff, Jason Kilduff. In his eight count substitute complaint dated February 20, 2015, the plaintiff alleges the following claims: breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty of an agent, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation, negligent supervision, conspiracy to defraud, and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A jury trial commenced on July 8, 2015. On July 10, 2015, the defendants filed a written motion for a directed verdict, accompanied by a memorandum of law, and that same day, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 15, 2015, after the close of evidence in the trial but before the parties' closing arguments, the court,\n   <em>\n    Swienton, J\n   </em>\n   ., granted the defendants' motion for a directed verdict, ruling, in relevant part: \"[T]he court has carefully considered the counts against the defendants, and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the court grants the motion [for a] directed verdict as to all defendants on all counts. ... I am going to state my reasons on the record at this time. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"[Stephen Pellet] was the owner of property located at 59 Paper Chase Trail in Avon. The property was built in 1971 and other than minor renovations had never been updated or renovated. Furthermore, the house was full of clutter. The defendants David Olson and Pina Jenkins, real estate salespersons affiliated with Keller Williams agency, were contacted by [Stephen Pellet] and [his brother] Daniel Pellet. The evidence showed that [Stephen Pellet] was anxious to sell the\n   property and, further, that he wished to net $90,000 from the sale of the property. The listing price was established accordingly, after discussions with the realtors and [Stephen Pellet], and after the realtors performed a comparative market analysis, which was reviewed with and furnished to [Stephen Pellet]. A listing agreement was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Kimberly Kilduff learned from a neighbor that the property was being sold, and the real estate agents, Olson and Jenkins, were contacts. Olson and Jenkins, after obtaining permission from [Stephen Pellet] to show the house, showed the property to the defendants Kimberly Kilduff and Jason Kilduff. An offer was placed by Kimberly Kilduff, which was accepted, and the house was sold for $100 more than the listing price. [Stephen Pellet] netted almost $89,000. The buyers of the property,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendants Jason Kilduff and Kimberly Kilduff, performed extensive renovations to the property, exceeding some $100,000 in expenses. They subsequently sold the property for $462,000 and netted, in profits, approximately $16,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The operative complaint is in eight counts .... The underlying basis for each of these counts is based upon breaches of professional standards of care on the part of the real estate agent, broker, and salespersons regarding selection and recommendation of the listing price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"In an action based upon professional negligence, expert testimony will be [required] if the determination of that standard of care requires knowledge that is beyond the experience of a normal fact finder .... [T]he plaintiff in this case has failed to produce any\n   expert testimony and therefore fails on [his] burden of proof of negligence. ... Although the plaintiff presented an expert in the field of appraisals, this does not satisfy the requirement of an expert to testify as to the standard of care of a realtor in the determination and recommendation of a listing price.\" (Footnotes added.) Judgment in favor of the defendants was rendered on that same day. On July 22, 2015, the defendants filed a motion for a special finding pursuant to \u00a7 52-226a, which the court granted on February 25, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a preliminary matter, in reviewing the court's reasoning for granting the defendants' motion for a directed verdict, we highlight our concern with whether it applied the correct standard of review to the evidence presented at trial. \"Directed verdicts are not favored.... A trial court should direct a verdict only when a jury could not reasonably and legally have reached any other conclusion. ... A directed verdict is justified if ... the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside a verdict rendered for the other party. ... This court has emphasized two additional points with respect to motions to set aside a verdict that are equally applicable to motions for a directed verdict: First, the plaintiff in a civil matter is not required to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt; a mere preponderance of the evidence is sufficient. Second, the well established standards compelling great deference to the historical function of the jury find their roots in the constitutional right to a trial by jury.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Curran\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174703\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/845/#p856\">\n    303 Conn. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20A.3d%20700\">\n    37 A.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). This standard also requires the trial court\n   to consider the evidence, including reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Beckenstein Enterprises-Prestige Park, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063908\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/115/680/#p693\">\n    115 Conn.App. 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=974%20A.2d%20764\">\n    974 A.2d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146604,4147829,4146551\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/916/\">\n    293 Conn. 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20488\">\n    979 A.2d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the present case, it is not entirely clear from the record whether the court made findings of fact in ruling on the defendants' motion. As previously indicated, such findings would be improper in the context of a motion for a directed verdict, given that \"litigants have a constitutional right to have factual issues resolved by the jury\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20488\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=979%20A.2d%20488\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Although the court expressly stated that it \"viewed [the evidence] in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\" certain\n   aspects of its decision suggest it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For instance, the court stated at one point that it \"cannot\n   <em>\n    find\n   </em>\n   that the defendants' actions were proven to be the proximate cause of the plaintiffs' harm.\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, in its recitation of the evidence supporting its ruling, certain statements were clearly viewed in the light most favorable to the\n   <em>\n    defendants\n   </em>\n   , rather than to the plaintiff. For example, the court stated that \"[t]he evidence showed that [Stephen Pellet] ... wished to net $90,000 from the sale of the property,\" even though the plaintiff testified at trial that he and Stephen Pellet never told Olson and Jenkins that they wanted to make a specific profit from the sale of the property, instead desiring to \"maximize\" the\n   profit to its fullest potential. The court also stated that Olson and Jenkins \"obtain[ed] permission from [Stephen Pellet] to show the house ... to ... Kimberly Kilduff and Jason Kilduff,\" even though the plaintiff testified at trial to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the court, in fact, did not view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, pursuant to the applicable standard of review. Because the issue of \"[w]hether the evidence presented by the plaintiff was sufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict is a question of law, over which our review is plenary\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Curran\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kroll\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174703\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/845/#p856\">\n    303 Conn. at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20A.3d%20700\">\n    37 A.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we need not afford deference to the court's recitation of evidence and exercise plenary review over the record in the present appeal.

In response, the defendants argue that each of the eight theories of recovery advanced in the plaintiff's complaint \"centers upon the foundational allegation that the defendant realtors negligently or intentionally recommended a list price for the ... property that was substantially below fair market value,\" and, thus, those eight theories of recovery presented, at their core, claims\n   for professional negligence. As a result, the defendants argue, the plaintiff was required to present expert testimony to establish the applicable standard of care and any breach thereof, which he failed to do. We reject the defendants' arguments and agree with the plaintiff in both respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Professional Negligence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff first argues that the court improperly concluded that \"[t]he underlying basis for each of [the plaintiff's eight] counts is based upon breaches of professional standards of care on the part of the real estate agent, broker and salespersons regarding selection and recommendation of the listing price.\" Although all eight counts of the substitute complaint incorporate the allegation that Olson and Jenkins set the list price for the property at $318,000 when they knew, or should have known, that the fair market value of the property was, in fact, substantially greater, we agree with the plaintiff that it does not necessarily follow that all of the counts summarily can be characterized as one general claim of professional negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"The interpretation of pleadings presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\" (Internal\n   quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Oxford House at Yale\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gilligan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235523\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/125/464/#p469\">\n    125 Conn.App. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%2052\">\n    10 A.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

With regard to the first count, the plaintiff argues that because the breach of contract claim is directly tied to the terms of the written \"exclusive right to sell listing contract\" (listing contract) into which the parties entered, it, in fact, sounds in contract law rather than tort law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Whether [a] plaintiff's cause of action is one for malpractice [or contract] depends upon the definition of [those terms] and the allegations of the complaint. ... Malpractice is commonly defined as the failure of one rendering professional services to exercise that\n   degree of skill and learning commonly applied under all the circumstances in the community by the average prudent reputable member of the profession with the result of injury, loss, or damage to the recipient of those services .... The elements of a breach of contract claim are the formation of an agreement, performance by one party, breach of the agreement by the other party, and damages. ...

[may require a] defendant to provide [a] plaintiff with legal representation and that the plaintiff was dissatisfied with the defendant's performance does not necessarily mean that her claim of improper representation sounds in breach of contract. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[W]e previously have concluded that a claim alleging that the defendant attorney violated the specific instructions of his client sounded in breach of contract. ... Other Connecticut courts similarly have determined that an attorney's failure to comply with the specific provisions of a contract sounded in breach of contract. ... Correspondingly, Connecticut courts have concluded that claims alleging that the defendant attorney had performed the required tasks but in a deficient manner sounded in tort rather than in contract. ...

It also expressly provides under \"other terms\" that the property is \"on temp status till [the] seller gives written [e-mail] permission to put on active\" (written permission provision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, in analyzing whether count one sounds in breach of contract, as the plaintiff asserts, or professional negligence, as the court concluded, it is clear that at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the particular allegations therein reference Olson's, Jenkins', Ladden's, and Keller Williams' failure to comply with the\n   <em>\n    specific provisions\n   </em>\n   of the listing contract, namely, the dual agency provision and the written permission provision. Under our case law, such allegations sound in breach of contract, not professional negligence. See\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Livingston, Adler, Pulda, Meiklejohn &amp; Kelly, P.C\n   </em>\n   ., supra, 311 Conn. at 292,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%20534\">\n    87 A.3d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, other allegations in count one that\n   reference these defendants' valuation of the property, their \"reasonable efforts,\" and their \"degree of care, skill and expertise,\" i.e., those that allege that the required tasks were performed but in a deficient manner, appear\n   to sound in professional negligence rather than breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Livingston, Adler, Pulda, Meiklejohn &amp; Kelly, P.C\n   </em>\n   ., supra, at 294,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20A.3d%20534\">\n    87 A.3d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, because the court summarily deemed the\n   <em>\n    entirety\n   </em>\n   of count one to be solely a claim of professional negligence, this was improper as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Similarly, count two, which alleges breach of a fiduciary duty of an agent, and count three, which alleges breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, are both claims that stem from the contractual\n   relationship between the parties. With regard to count two, our Supreme Court has expressly held that \"[p]rofessional negligence alone ... does not give rise automatically to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. ... [Thus] not every instance of professional negligence results in a breach of [a] fiduciary duty. ... Professional negligence implicates a duty of care, while breach of fiduciary duty implicates a duty of loyalty and honesty.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Sherwood\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Danbury Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667135\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/278/163/#p196\">\n    278 Conn. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=896%20A.2d%20777\">\n    896 A.2d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Although professional negligence and breach of a fiduciary duty may arise from the same operative facts, they are not, legally speaking, one and the same claim. Thus, the court's determination that count two could be reduced merely to a claim of professional negligence was improper as a matter of law. Moreover, in reviewing the allegations contained in count two, the plaintiff clearly takes issue with Olson's, Jenkins', Ladden's, and Keller Williams' duty of loyalty and honesty by asserting, among other things, that these defendants had not disclosed conflicts of interest arising from their dual representation of both the plaintiff and Kimberly Kilduff or disclosed their preexisting outside relationships with Kimberly Kilduff and Jason Kilduff that predated the sale of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With regard to count three, our Supreme Court has held that a claim brought pursuant to a contract, alleging a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, sounds in contract\n   because \"[e]very contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement. ...

Thus, it is not easily determined what are the demands of proper treatment. It is for this reason that expert testimony is required to define the standard of care or the duty owing from the real estate broker to his or her client and whether that duty has been breached so\n   that one may reasonably and logically conclude what the standard of care is and whether or not it has been violated .... [T]he plaintiff in this case has failed to produce any expert testimony and therefore fails on [his] burden of proof of negligence.

This knowledge is not one that can be simply discerned from a course of conduct or from some document that sets forth the care that is required under these circumstances. Expert testimony is required ... and no testimony was offered to establish said standard. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"Although the plaintiff presented an expert in the field of appraisals, this does not satisfy the requirement of an expert to testify as to the standard of care of a\n   realtor in the determination and recommendation of a listing price. The appraiser was not a real estate agent. His appraisal was a retrospective appraisal of the value of the property and did not perform a comparative market analysis.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In the present case, although the plaintiff did not present expert testimony from a real estate agent and/or broker\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding the standard of care for these professionals' selection and recommendation of a list price, such testimony was provided by the defendants through Olson and Barbara Fairfield. First, Olson, a licensed real estate agent in Connecticut for more than twenty-three years, testified as to how a professional in the field arrives at a recommended list price. For example, Olson explained how data is obtained through the multiple listing service database and how a comparative market analysis (CMA) is generated for a client's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Next, Fairfield, a real estate agent licensed in Connecticut and/or Florida for thirty-five years who also was previously licensed as a broker for nearly thirty years, was tendered by the defendants as an expert witness on their behalf, and the court designated her as such. Fairfield testified that she understood that she was, as counsel stated, \"disclosed as an expert witness in this matter to opine as to whether or not the defendants met the applicable standard of care of reasonable real estate professionals with respect to this particular transaction\" and that she had reviewed all of the documents and deposition testimony in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fairfield testified as to how real estate agents generate a CMA for a particular property in order to choose an appropriate list price, stating that the agents \"look at the property itself, the condition of the property inside and outside, any cosmetic things that need to be changed or updated and then we look at properties that have sold around the same square footage. We try to do the same number of bedrooms, bathrooms, same structure, colonial to colonial, for instance. We couldn't compare a colonial to a ranch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"And so we look at solds and what we try to do with the solds is, we try to stay within a very close area to the subject property and we look at solds. We don't want to go back further than a year before the property date and we definitely don't-we don't have any way to forecast\n   what something would sell after the date. Good comparables will be like kind property, best to about six months in arrears, so we look at those solds because that's what buyers were willing to pay for that property based on its condition. Then we also ... look at the market. So, we look and see what the competition is at the same time. So, we look at the properties that are out there for sale right now and how they stack up to the subject property, and so we look at those two areas specifically.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Fairfield also testified as to other variables that competent real estate professionals should take into account when determining the list price, such as the age and condition of the property and its features, as well as the time of year at which the property is put on the market. She ultimately opined that, having reviewed Olson's CMA for the property, the $317,900 list price recommended to the plaintiff in September, 2008, was within the range of price \"where the property should have its greatest market appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing testimony of Olson and Fairfield, we conclude, contrary to the court's determination, that the jury was provided with expert testimony as to the applicable standard of care required of real estate professionals. Significantly, Olson and Fairfield were \"not required specifically to have expressed as an opinion that [the defendants] breached the standard of care in order for the [plaintiff] to prevail,\" as all that was required was sufficient testimony for the jury \"reasonably to infer, on the basis of its findings of fact, that [the defendants] breached the standard of care.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    LePage\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Horne\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653159\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/116/#p132\">\n    262 Conn. at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=809%20A.2d%20505\">\n    809 A.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, it of no importance that Olson and Fairfield did not expressly opine that the defendants breached that standard here or that this expert testimony did not specifically come from the plaintiff.

From the other facts presented in this case, the jury reasonably could infer that the standard of care was breached by the defendants. Because the court improperly concluded that the plaintiff's failure to tender an expert witness resulted in a lack of evidence on the professional standard of care, it improperly directed a verdict in favor the defendants.

Following the court's granting of the defendants' motion for a directed verdict on their behalf, the plaintiff filed with this court an appeal from that judgment. Subsequently, there\n   were two motions for a special finding pursuant to \u00a7 52-226a that were filed with the trial court-one on behalf of Kimberly Kilduff, and one on behalf of the remaining five defendants. Following the court's granting of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   motions for a special finding via a single memorandum of decision filed February 25, 2016, the plaintiff properly filed an amended appeal with this court, assigning as error that February 25, 2016 decision of the trial court.

We cannot conclude that this standard was met here. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the plaintiff's evidence that he suffered damages, which included a second offer on the property, two days after Kimberly Kilduff's offer, that was for $42,000 more than the first, and testimony from certified real estate appraiser Daniel LaPorte that the market value of the property in October, 2008, was $92,000 higher than the sale price, was sufficient to meet his burden of proof.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    On this point, the plaintiff contended elsewhere in the complaint, and incorporated into count four, the following allegations: \"[Stephen Pellet] was unaware, and was not informed, that Olson and Jenkins had already discussed selling the subject property, prior to the September 10, 2008 showing, with ... buyer Kimberly Kilduff\"; \"[Stephen Pellet] was also unaware, and was not informed, that Kimberly Kilduff was married to Jason Kilduff, who was an associate of Olson and Jenkins and an agent in the same Keller Williams Agency office\"; and \"[t]he fact that ...

Second, there was never any allegation of a violation of this statute, and even if the court stretched this even further and accepted the plaintiff's argument that this is negligence per se, the violation of a statute has to be proven to be a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's damages before the plaintiff can recover. There is not a scintilla of evidence to indicate that the failure to have such a document signed was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's damages.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    \"Ordinarily, it is a question of fact whether the negligence of a defendant was the proximate cause of a plaintiff's injuries. ... The test is whether the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injuries.\" (Citation omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Ferndale Dairy, Inc\n    </em>\n    . v.\n    <em>\n     Geiger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"551604\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/167/533/#p538\">\n     167 Conn. 533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 538,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=356%20A.2d%2091\">\n     356 A.2d 91\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1975). In the present case, there was evidence presented, through the parties' joint stipulation and through the plaintiff's testimony, that the dual agency was never disclosed to Stephen Pellet. Accordingly, the jury reasonably could have inferred from this evidence that, had the dual agency been disclosed, the plaintiff would have chosen another agent/broker who did not have divided loyalties, and that that new agent/broker, in turn, would have obtained a higher sales price for the property. Thus, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there was enough evidence at trial that the question of causation should have gone to the jury, and the issue was, therefore, improper for the court to resolve in the context of a motion for a directed verdict.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    We note that the court also directed the verdict in favor of the defendants on count seven specifically on the ground that \"the plaintiff has not met [his] burden of proof to sustain such a claim or to support the claim that he suffered substantial harm.\" \"The party claiming fraud ... has the burden of proof. ...

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we conclude that the jury could have reasonably determined that the elements of conspiracy to defraud were proven here. More specifically, evidence was presented at trial that the defendants all were professionally affiliated with Keller Williams at some point in time and had personal relationships with each other; that Olson and Jenkins showed the property to Kimberly Kilduff and Jason Kilduff while the property was still listed as \"temp\" status, thus prohibiting other real estate agents from seeing the property or presenting offers on it on behalf of their clients; that Olson and Jenkins never discussed their role as dual agents with the plaintiff; and that Jason Kilduff served as the listing agent and Keller Williams as the broker in the resale of the property in 2009. On the basis of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have inferred that because the defendants were concerned with helping their other client, the purchaser, obtain the property at the lowest price possible, as well as with lining their own pockets via a second, future sale once the property had been flipped by the Kilduffs, this affected their representation of the plaintiff in the 2008 sale of the property and caused the alleged damages at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    In the first forty paragraphs of the substitute complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants acted improperly in some of the following ways that do not directly encompass the list price of the property: Jenkins and Olson showed the house to Kimberly Kilduff without written permission that the property could be moved from \"temp status\" to \"active,\" and in derogation of Stephen Pellet's express instructions not to show the house until it was cleaned; none of the defendants informed Stephen Pellet of Olson's and Jenkins' dual representation of both Stephen Pellet and Kimberly Kilduff prior to the sale of the property, nor was a written dual agency disclosure notice and consent agreement executed; the defendants failed to disclose that there were other offers on the property; and the deceptive practices of some or all of the defendants working in concert with one another \"deprived and excluded all other prospective buyers from even bidding on the subject property before the September 10, 2008 purchase contract was signed.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The court also directed the verdict in favor of the defendants on count eight specifically on the ground that \"the plaintiff premises his allegation of a violation of CUTPA on the purported breaches of unspecified professional standards of care and the allegedly artificially low listing price recommendation and subsequent sale of the home. CUTPA requires that the defendant must have engaged in unfair or deceptive acts in the conduct of any trade or commerce. In the absence of such unfair or deceptive acts, in this case, breach of professional standards of care with the intent to defraud, the claim cannot be found in favor of the plaintiff.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    In our review of count eight, the plaintiff's CUTPA claim clearly incorporates a myriad of allegations of unfair or deceptive acts, as set forth in paragraphs 1 through 40 of the substitute complaint, that do not all necessarily implicate a professional standard of care.
