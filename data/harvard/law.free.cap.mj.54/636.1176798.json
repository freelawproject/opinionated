The approved sentence was a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for ninety days, forfeiture of $250.00 pay per month for three months, and reduction to Private El. Appellant received fifty-five days confinement credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Appellant avers that the military judge erred by failing to shift the burden of persuasion to the government to prove that no unlawful command influence (UCI) existed once appellant had met his burden of producing sufficient facts to constitute UCI. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">The burdens of production and persuasion concerning UCI at trial and on appeal, although they are clearly analogous, are somewhat different. As the court held in <em>United States v. Biagase, </em>50 M.J. 143 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-13\">At trial, the accused must show facts which, if true, constitute unlawful command influence, and that the alleged unlawful command influence has a logical connection to the court-martial, in terms of its potential to cause unfairness in the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 150 (citations omitted). The defense has the initial burden <em>of </em>production <em>of </em>raising the issue of UCI at trial by bringing forth \u201csome evidence\u201d that UCI will potentially cause the proceedings to be unfair. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 M.J. 296, 300 (1995) (citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>54 M.J. 32, 34 (2000). While this threshold is low, it is more than mere allegation or speculation. <em>United States v. Johnston, </em>39 M.J. 242, 244 (C.M.A.1994) (citing <em>Green v. Widdecke, </em>19 U.S.C.M.A. 576, 579, 42 C.M.R. 178, 181, 1970 WL 7035 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">On appeal, the appellant has the initial burden of raising UCI and must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-18\">(1) allege facts which, if true, constitute unlawful command influence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-19\">(2) show that the proceedings were unfair; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-20\">(3) show that the unlawful command influence was the cause of the unfairness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-21\"><em>United States v. Stombaugh, </em>40 M.J. 208, 213 (C.M.A.1994); <em>see also United States v. Richter, </em>51 M.J. 213, 223-24 (1999); <em>United States v. Levite, 25 </em>M.J. 334, 341 (C.M.A. 1987)(Cox, J., concurring). The first \u201cprong\u201d of <em>Stombaugh </em>is identical to the first part of the <em>Biagase </em>test. While the second and third prongs of the <em>Stombaugh </em>test and the second part of <em>Biagase </em>both focus on the unfairness of the proceedings and the causal connection to the UCI, they do so from different perspectives. Under <em>Biagase, </em>the trial judge looks prospectively at the potential impact of the UCI; under <em>Stombaugh, </em>the appellate court looks retrospectively at the actual effect, if any, upon the completed trial. <em>Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 150 (citations omitted). Once the defense meets its initial burden of production, at trial or on appeal, the burden shifts to the government to convince the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the findings and sentence are not affected by the UCI. We review the military judge\u2019s findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard and the question of UCI flowing from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>those facts as a question of law de novo. <em>United States v. Ayers, </em>54 M.J. 85, 95 (2000); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>39 M.J. 284, 286 (C.M.A.1994) (citing S. Childress and M. Davis, 2 Federal Standards of Review \u00a7\u00a7 2.01 and 2.14 (2d ed.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Defense called three witnesses (two Privates First Class and a Specialist), members of appellant\u2019s platoon, who testified that appellant\u2019s squad leader, Staff Sergeant (SSG) Eaton, held a meeting with approximately twenty to thirty members of appellant\u2019s platoon shortly after appellant returned from his unauthorized absence. At the meeting, SSG Eaton told them not to associate with appellant. Defense also called appellant\u2019s team leader, who testified that he was at a noncommissioned officer (NCO) meeting when Lieutenant Koester, appellant\u2019s platoon leader, told the NCO\u2019s that appellant should be separated from the rest of the soldiers. All four witnesses testified that they were never told not to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf and never threatened with adverse repercussions if they did elect to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf. All four witnesses also stated that if appellant asked them to testify on his behalf, they would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The government called SSG Eaton, who testified that his message to the members of his platoon at the subject meeting was, essentially, when a soldier hangs out with the wrong crowd, it\u2019s easier to get \u201cin a little bit of trouble.\u201d Staff Sergeant Eaton punctuated his admonition by relating his own personal history of falling in with the wrong crowd when he was a teenager and ending up in drug rehabilitation. The government also called another supervisor of appellant, who testified that he was never told not to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf, that he was never threatened with adverse repercussions if he did elect to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf, and, that if appellant asked him to testify on his behalf, he would do so. Lieutenant Koester testified that he did tell the NCO\u2019s in his platoon to be watchful of appellant, who had come up positive on a drug urinalysis, to ensure that he wasn\u2019t placed in a position of responsibility, that he didn\u2019t hui*t himself, and that he didn\u2019t get into any more trouble than he was already in. Lieutenant Koester did not recall ever telling the NCO\u2019s not to associate with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The defense counsel argued that, if NCO\u2019s took the stand, they would not say that they felt like they were influenced not to come in and testify. The military judge then inquired, \u201cDo you have any reason to believe that they would testify favorably for Private Francis?\u201d and defense counsel answered, \u201cNo, Your Honor, I don\u2019t.\u201d The following-colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">MJ: Can you tell me what evidence, physical evidence, documentary evidence, what witnesses you\u2019ve been unable to procure because of actions of Lieutenant Koester and Sergeant Eaton, assuming of course that their actions constitute command influence? Why do you [ ] think the proceedings are unfair I guess is what I\u2019m asking you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">DC: Your Honor, I don\u2019t have any evidence of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\">MJ: [Hjave you found anybody that was pressured not to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">DC: No, Your Honor, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-12\">MJ: You\u2019ve done interviews of people within the platoon ... the company, and you are satisfied that if the evidence was there, that you would have uncovered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-13\">DC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">MJ: Favorable evidence for your client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-15\">DC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">On the basis of this record, the military judge made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-17\">(1) Sometime between 15 and 22 May 1999, Staff Sergeant Eaton, the accused\u2019s Squad Leader, called a meeting of approximately 20 of his soldiers. The accused was not present. One of the issues discussed was the troubles facing Private Francis. Staff Sergeant Eaton told the soldiers that \u201cThe accused had come up hot on a urinalysis, was going to get court-martialed and go to jail, and that they needed to stay away from him as any association would be bad for them,\u201d or words to that effect. While I find Staff Sergeant\u2019s Eaton\u2019s motivations to be altruistic and well-intended, as he was simply trying to keep them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>going down the wrong path themselves and commit similar misconduct, the clear message received by the squad was \u201cStay away from Francis. He is bad news.\u201d Within a week of this meeting, a message filtered down to the platoon through several NCO\u2019s that Lieutenant Koester did not want anyone to have anything to do with the accused;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">(2) Other than these two instances, there have been no other communications or orders to members of the accused\u2019s unit about this case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">(3) No specific individuals were targeted by either Staff Sergeant Eaton or Lieutenant Koester with regard to this case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">(4) Charges were preferred on 11 June 1999; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">(5) There is no evidence that anyone has been pressured not to testify; and there is no evidence any soldier has been discouraged from testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-9\">I find the accused has been able to procure all physical and documentary evidence and witnesses available to him despite actions of Lieutenant Koester and Staff Sergeant Eaton. Though Lieutenant Koester and Staff Sergeant Eaton are not Commanders, they were acting under the mantle of authority when their messages were relayed and recited and acted on behalf of the command.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">These findings of the military judge are fully supported by the record and we adopt them. However, the military judge also found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">Though charges had not yet been preferred, I find the comments and actions by Lieutenant Koester and Staff Sergeant Eaton in essence to stay away from the accused <em>to be reasonably understood by the listener as an attempt to influence or interfere with potential witnesses, and, thus constitute an unlawful </em>\u2014 and <em>thus constitute unlawful command influence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVz\">(emphasis added). To the extent that this latter finding is a finding of fact, we find it to be clearly erroneous, and to the extent that it is a conclusion of law, we disagree and reach a different conclusion. <em>Cf. Ayers, </em>54 M.J. at 95; <em>United States v. Morris, </em>49 M.J. 227 (1998). Not only was there no evidence that any member of appellant\u2019s unit reasonably understood the subject admonitions as an attempt to influence, or interfere with, potential witnesses, there was compelling evidence to the contrary, to wit, every defense and government witness did not so understand. The cleai* import of SSG Eaton\u2019s admonition, and the one that every witness took away from the meeting, was that the witness should avoid falling in with the wrong crowd where he was more likely to get into trouble himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We thus find that the defense failed to meet its burden of production on the first part of the <em>Biagase </em>test at trial. <em>Cf. </em>50 M.J. at 150. Based upon our review, we find beyond a reasonable doubt that the findings and sentence have not been affected by UCI. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 151; <em>Stombaugh, </em>40 M.J. 208; <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>22 M.J. 388 (C.M.A.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">Even if we agreed with the military judge that appellant had met his burden of production on the first part of <em>Biagase </em>at trial, the military judge farther found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-15\">However, while I am satisfied the defense has met its burden and production of proof with respect to the first prong of the <em>Stombaugh </em>analysis, I find that they have not met then.' burden with respect to prongs two and three. The defense has been unable to show how or why these proceedings are unfair, or that the unlawful command influence was the approximate [sic] cause of the unfairness. Specifically, I find the defense has been unable to demonstrate what legally and logically relevant evidence has not or could not be produced as a result of these allegations of interference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avp\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is premised upon the erroneous conclusion that, because appellant satisfied the first part of <em>Biagase </em>(referred to as the first prong of <em>Stombaugh </em>by the military judge), the burden of persuasion shifted at that point to the government without appellant having to sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>isfy any further burden of production. While we agree with the military judge that appellant failed to meet his burden of production on the second and third prongs of <em>Stombaugh, </em>the military judge had no responsibility to make that determination at trial, <em>cf. Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 150. Appellant\u2019s burden of production required, however, that, in addition to satisfying the first part of <em>Biagase, </em>to show facts, which, if true, constituted UCI, appellant must also show \u201cthat the alleged unlawful command influence has a logical connection to the courts-martial, in terms of its potential to cause unfairness in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Although the military judge\u2019s reference to the second and third prongs of <em>Stombaugh </em>may have blurred the basis of his ruling, the aggregate effect of his findings, quoted above, was that appellant failed to meet his burden of production to show a logical connection between the alleged UCI and any potential unfairness in the court-martial. Thus, the burden of persuasion legally never shifted to the government. <em>Cf. Ayers, </em>54 M.J. at 95. The determination of whether appellant has satisfied the second and third prongs of <em>Stombaugh </em>is the responsibility of the appellate court, not the trial court. <em>Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 150. We find that as appellant has failed to produce \u201csome evidence\u201d of proximate cause between the acts constituting the alleged UCI and the outcome of his court-martial, appellant has failed to carry his initial burden of production. <em>Cf. Ayers, </em>54 M.J. at 95; <em>Ayala, </em>43 M.J. at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Even if we agreed that appellant had met his burden of production on all three prongs of <em>Stombaugh, </em>we would find that the government met its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt that these facts do not constitute UCI and, alternatively, that, assuming UCI, it had no prejudicial impact on appellant\u2019s court-martial. <em>Cf. Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 151. At trial, the military judge\u2019s findings, quoted above, further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aar\">However, at this point, though I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Lieutenant Koester\u2019s and Staff Sergeant Eaton\u2019s actions have not prejudiced these proceedings, I order the following remedial measures to address any perceived taint and prevent future interference with potential witnesses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">(1) Captain Hayes, the Alpha Company Commander, will issue a retraction to all members of 1st Platoon. The retraction will include reference to Lieutenant Koester\u2019s and Staff Sergeant Eaton\u2019s communications regarding disassociation with Private Francis. Captain Hayes will tell all soldiers that it is their duty to testify on behalf of Private Francis, if called; that no retribution or other unfavorable actions will be taken against them if they do testify for Private Francis; and that all 1st Platoon members will make themselves available for interview by [defense counsel]. Lieutenant Koester and Staff Sergeant Eaton will be present during Captain Hayes\u2019 retraction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">(2) The government is prohibited from calling any witnesses or introducing evidence on sentencing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-8\">(3) The government will produce all relevant witnesses requested by the defense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">(4) I will allow Private Francis to testify about what he thinks people would say about him, if called;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-10\">(5) Private Francis will not be cross-examined by trial counsel during sentencing, if he chooses to testify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-11\">(6) Lieutenant Koester and Staff Sergeant Eaton are barred from this building for the remainder of the trial unless called as witnesses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-12\">Finally, I will consider any other remedial measures suggested by the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">The military judge denied a defense request for sentence reduction as an additional remedial measure. The colloquy concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-14\">MJ: Any other remedial measures addressing the trial itself and access to witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-15\">DC: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-16\">MJ: Do you believe that that will address any perceived taint that may have arisen as a consequence of their actions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8J\">DC: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-17\">It is manifestly clear that the military judge, in finding \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that no prejudicial effect resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>from the alleged UCI, correctly placed the burden of persuasion on the government and required the requisite quantum of proof. We review this legal determination de novo and arrive at the same conclusion. In spite of his appropriate denial of the defense motion, the military judge gratuitously afforded appellant extensive remedies to remove any perceived taint of UCI. While we are reluctant to criticize judges who, out of an overabundance of caution, grant unwarranted relief to an accused, the approach employed in the instant case deprived the government of any fair opportunity to present admissible aggravation evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the net result, and the one undoubtedly intended by the military judge, was that even a hint of prejudice, which was infinitesimal at most, was completely ameliorated. <em>See United States v. Rivers, </em>49 M.J. 434, 434 (1998). Thus, assuming arguendo, that UCI existed in this case, we are convinced that the extensive remedial measures directed by the military judge fully ensured beyond a reasonable doubt that the findings and sentence were not affected. <em>Cf. Biagase, </em>50 M.J. at 152; <em>Rivers, </em>49 M.J. 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Senior Judge MERCK and Judge CURRIE concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-12\">. In numerous records of trial reviewed by this court, we come across appellants who, normally during their allocution statements, tearfully confess how their troubles with the law started when they fell in with the wrong crowd.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-15\">. Additionally, the military judge found the actions of SSG Eaton and LT Koester amounted to illegal pretrial punishment in violation of Article 13, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 813, citing <em>United States v. Stamper, </em>39 M.J. 1097 (A.C.M.R.1994), and awarded appellant thirty days confinement credit. While we cannot and would not disturb the military judge\u2019s decision, we do consider it to be an unwarranted windfall for appellant. The actions of SSG Eaton and LT Koester do not, in our opinion, even remotely resemble the gratuitously disparaging remarks found to be offensive in <em>Stamper.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
