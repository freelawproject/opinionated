Consistent with her pleas and a pretrial agreement (PTA), she was found guilty of four specifications, consisting of the wrongful use of ecstasy, LSD, and marijuana, all on divers occasions, and wrongful use of psilocybin, in violation of Article 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a. The military judge sentenced the appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 7 months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to E-l. This sentence was within the limitation of the PTA and was approved by the convening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-24\">The appellant raises one issue on appeal. She claims the military judge erred when, over defense objection, he allowed the appellant\u2019s commander to testify about the appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-25\">This ease presents a classic example of trial counsel interjecting an appellate issue into a case for no good reason. The prosecution\u2019s documentary evidence on sentencing consisted of a stipulation of fact that described the offenses in detail, a personal data sheet, three enlisted performance reports that evidenced limited potential, four letters of counseling, two letters of admonition, three letters of reprimand, and a record of nonjudicial punishment, all of which pertained to disciplinary infractions by the appellant over a 16 month period leading up to her court-martial. Instead of resting on this wealth of derogatory documentary evidence, the trial counsel, with apparently little un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>derstanding of the rules regarding opinion evidence, chose to call Major Reinert, the appellant\u2019s commander, to testify about the appellant\u2019s performance and rehabilitative potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">After the commander responded to questions by the assistant trial counsel (ATC) about his knowledge of the appellant, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-5\">ATC: Are you aware of any disciplinary actions that have been taken since the accused was charged with the offenses in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-6\">Witness (WIT): We have a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-7\">Defense counsel (DC): \u2014Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">Military judge (MJ): You can\u2019t ask questions \u2014 go into specific acts if you\u2019re trying to lay a basis for a rehabilitation opinion. Do you have any more questions [DC]? Did you have any in view of your objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-9\">DC: Yes, sir. I don\u2019t believe based upon his interaction with the accused, that he has adequate knowledge to give his opinion, I mean an occasional \u201chi, how are you doing\u201d is not sufficient under [Rule for Courts-Martial] R.C.M. 1001 to lay basis for this opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-10\">MJ: Okay. I\u2019ll overrule your objection. I\u2019ll note that he was the commander. That he had reviewed the personnel records, he\u2019s aware \u2014 he did visit her in the office. I think that goes to the weight to be given to his testimony as to whether or not the admissibility and I\u2019ll allow you to cross examine as to the weight to be given to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-11\">DC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-12\">MJ: So, your objection is overruled, you may continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-13\">ATC: Major Reinert, based on your review of the accused (sic) personnel information file, and your contacts with her at the job and at unit social events, do you have an opinion on the accused\u2019s performance as an Air Force member?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-14\">WIT: I think her performance \u2014 -go ahead \u2014 I thought you had a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-16\">ATC: Please, yes or no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-17\">WIT: Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-18\">ATC: What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-19\">WIT: I think her performance up to a certain point and time was good to okay or okay to good. EPRs showed that and after the EPR closed out in the end of June 98 was when we started to see a decline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-20\">ATC: What type of decline did you start to see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-21\">DC: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-22\">MJ: She hasn\u2019t raised the issue you can\u2019t get into specific instances of misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asq\">ATC: Yes, sir. Strike the question, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXv3\">MJ: So, your objection\u2019s sustained. You may continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-23\">ATC: Do you have an opinion on the accused\u2019s potential for rehabilitation in the Air Force?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-24\">WIT: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-25\">A.TC: What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-26\">WIT: I think rehabilitation in the Air Force is slim to none because we have tried drastic measures and stair step discipline that didn\u2019t seem to get her attention, didn\u2019t seem to take the corrected measures that we intended for it to take. So, based upon my experience, based upon the stair step discipline that we applied I don\u2019t think rehabilitation is \u2014 in the Air Force is in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-27\">ATC: Do you have an opinion of the accused\u2019s potential for rehabilitation in general to become a law abiding citizen in society?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-28\">WIT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-29\">ATC: And, what is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-30\">WIT: In civilian life, based upon the trends and based upon what we saw in military life, I\u2019m not real sure that rehabilitation is gonna be achieved on the outside either because our military standards seem to be more strict than on the outside. So, I\u2019m not really sure that\u2019s my opinion, I\u2019m not real certain what the rehabilitative nature will be on the outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-31\">ATC: No further questions, Your Honor. MJ: Just note for the record, his comments regarding civilian life or that I understand that it\u2019s my decision as to wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>er or not the accused remains a member of the military or a punitive discharge. I did not interpret his comments as being directed towards whether or not a punitive discharge is appropriate or not appropriate. Even if it was directed towards that, I\u2019ll disregard that testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">A military judge\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>46 M.J. 8 (1997). Although the military judge\u2019s statements are not models of clarity, we are convinced from the record that he did not abuse his discretion in overruling the defense objection that Major Reinert did not have a sufficient foundational knowledge of the appellant to state an opinion regarding her rehabilitative potential. We agree with the trial judge that the witness did have sufficient information and knowledge (and therefore, a rational basis) to state such an opinion. R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(B); <em>United States v. Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. 301, 304 (C.M.A.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Judge Cox, of the United States Court of Military Appeals (now United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), made a remark in <em>Ohrt </em>that bears repeating: \u201cThe only appropriate witness is one who can be helpful to the court-martial when it acts in making \u2018the determination of a fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. at 303 (quoting Mil.R.Evid. 701; citing <em>United States v. Susee, </em>25 M.J. 538, 540 (A.C.M.R.1987)). This principle is incorporated as a requirement of R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(B), which provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he witness or deponent providing opinion evidence regarding the accused\u2019s rehabilitative potential must possess sufficient information and knowledge about the accused to offer a rationally-based opinion that is helpful to the sentencing authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Our decision upholding the military judge\u2019s ruling carries with it a determination that Major Reinert\u2019s opinion regarding the rehabilitative potential of the appellant was helpful to the sentencing authority. However, the trial counsel\u2019s questions, which drew a distinction between rehabilitative potential in the Air Force and in civilian life, rendered Major Reinert\u2019s testimony improper. R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>50 M.J. 397, 400 (1999). <em>See also United States v. Armon, </em>51 M.J. 83, 87 (1999) and eases cited therein; <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>31 M.J. 91, 94 (C.M.A.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">R.C.M. 1001(b)(5)(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-10\">(D) <em>Scope of opinion. </em>An opinion offered under this rule is limited to whether the accused has rehabilitative potential and to the magnitude or quality of any such potential. A witness may not offer an opinion regarding the appropriateness of a punitive discharge or whether the accused should be returned to the accused\u2019s unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">This rule expressly prohibits the prosecution from presenting both direct and indirect opinions on whether the accused should be punitively discharged. <em>See Williams, </em>50 M.J. at 400 (stating rule expressly prohibits direct and indirect opinions on punishment). As Judge Cox said in <em>Ohrt: </em>\u201cThe use of euphemisms, such as \u2018No potential for continued service\u2019; \u2018He should be separated\u2019; or the like are just other ways of saying, \u2018Give the accused a punitive discharge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. at 305, <em>quoted in Williams, </em>50 M.J. at 399. As the rule falls under R.C.M. 1001(b)\u2014matter to be presented by the prosecution\u2014it does not appear to prohibit the defense from offering evidence that a member of the accused\u2019s unit wants him back. <em>See United States v. Aurich, </em>31 M.J. 95, 96-97 (C.M.A.1990) (dictum). <em>But cf. United States v. Ramos, </em>42 M.J. 392, 396 (1995) (suggesting the rule against direct or indirect opinions on whether accused should be punitively discharged may apply to defense as well as prosecution) (citing <em>Ohrt).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">Over a decade ago, this Court warned practitioners to heed the words of Judge Cox about the use of euphemisms to improperly place opinions on punishment before the sentencing authority. <em>See United States v. Freeman, </em>29 M.J. 865, 867 (A.F.C.M.R.1989). <em>See also United States v. Diamond, </em>30 M.J. 902 (A.F.C.M.R.1990); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>31 M.J. 669 (A.C.M.R.1990). Two days after the release of <em>Thomas, </em>our superi- or court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-13\">R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) limits a witness\u2019 testimony to an opinion concerning \u201crehabilitative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>potential.\u201d It does not permit a full, logical explanation of the witness\u2019 opinion except on cross-examination. R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) contemplates one question: \u201cWhat is the accused\u2019s potential for rehabilitation?\u201d \u2014 and one answer: \u201cIn my opinion, the accused has__(good, no, some, little, great, zero, much, etc.) potential for rehabilitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\"><em>Aurich, </em>31 M.J. at 96.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Not long after these cases, our Court took the opportunity to express the frustration that R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) was creating unwarranted litigation. <em>See United States v. Pompey, </em>32 M.J. 547, 550 (A.F.C.M.R.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>33 M.J. 266 (C.M.A.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) was substantially amended in 1994. Several of the decisions of our superior court concerning the use of evidence on rehabilitative potential are recognized for spawning the amendment. <em>See </em>Drafter\u2019s Analysis, <em>Manual for Courts Martial, United States </em>(MCM), A21-70 (2000 ed.) and cases cited therein. The rule now defines rehabilitative potential:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-7\">(5) <em>Evidence of rehabilitative potential. </em>Rehabilitative potential refers to the accused\u2019s potential to be restored, through vocational, correctional, or therapeutic training or other corrective measures to a useful and constructive place in society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL3t\">R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">In light of the 1994 changes to R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) and the decisions of our superior court since, culminating in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Armon, </em>we hold that rehabilitative potential testimony that narrows the context of the opinion from the permitted general context of \u201cin society\u201d is improper. To say that an accused has no rehabilitative potential in the Air Force is equivalent to saying, \u201cNo potential for continued service.\u201d <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">We note that the only objection raised by the defense at trial to Major Reinert\u2019s testimony was foundational. While the appellant seeks to blur the distinction in her Assignment of Errors, trial defense counsel made no objection to the scope of Major Reinert\u2019s testimony. By failing to object to the scope of the commander\u2019s opinion, the appellant forfeited this error. In the absence of plain error, we will not reverse. Under a plain error analysis, the standard of review is whether the admission of such testimony materially prejudiced a substantial right of the appellant. <em>Armon, </em>51 M.J. at 87; <em>Williams, </em>50 M.J. at 400 (citing <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 M.J. 460 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">We find no prejudice in this case. Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a). The trial was before a military judge alone. A military judge is presumed to know the law and apply it correctly. <em>United States v. Robbins, </em>52 M.J. 455, 457 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 177, 148 L.Ed.2d 122 (2000). Moreover, in this case, the military judge stated he would not consider the testimony to the extent that it could be interpreted as expressing an opinion on the appropriateness of a punitive discharge. Additionally, other evidence properly before the court demonstrated the appellant\u2019s poor disciplinary record. This evidence both supports the approved sentence and \u201cdiminishe[s] the importance of [the] appellant\u2019s right to preclude <em>Ohrt </em>euphemism evidence in [her] case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>50 M.J. at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">The approved findings of guilty and the sentence are correct in law and fact and, on the basis of the entire record, are</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">. Army practitioners got the message that, \"[a]s <em>Aurich </em>demonstrates, our military appellate courts are not very enamored with R.C.M. 1001(b)(5).
