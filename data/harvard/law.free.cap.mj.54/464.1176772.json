At a general court-martial, the military judge granted appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his written confession to investigators, holding that the statement was not sufficiently corroborated under Military Rule of Evidence 304(g), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.). The Government filed timely written notice of appeal of the military judge\u2019s ruling pursuant to Article 62(a)(2), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 862(a)(2). The Court of Criminal Appeals initially agreed with the ruling by the military judge. 53 MJ 676 (2000). Upon reconsideration, the court concluded that the military judge erred in suppressing appellant\u2019s confession and ordered the case returned to the court-martial for further proceedings. 54 MJ 551 (2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-22\">On appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>i.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">WHETHER THE AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS EXCEEDED ITS AUTHORITY UNDER ARTICLE 62, UCMJ, BY FINDING ADDITIONAL FACTS TO SUPPORT ITS CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">II.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">WHETHER THE AIR FORCE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED BY USING OTHER UNCORROBORATED ADMISSIONS OF THE ACCUSED AND EVENTS NOT CONNECTED IN TIME OR PLACE TO THE ALLEGED CRIME IN DETERMINING THAT APPELLANT\u2019S CONFESSION WAS ADEQUATELY CORROBORATED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">For the reasons stated below, we affirm the holding of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">After turning himself in to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), appellant provided a detailed confession concerning the acts with which he was charged. Appellant\u2019s handwritten statement to AFOSI included the following admissions: (1) on April 24, appellant\u2019s wife \u201cwalked in on\u201d him during one of the occasions on which he touched his daughter\u2019s genitals while she was asleep in her bedroom; (2) appellant \u201cimmediately\u201d sought help from the chaplain; and (3) the chaplain referred appellant to a family therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">At trial, appellant moved to suppress this confession on the ground that his statement was not corroborated adequately under Mil. R.Evid. 304(g), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-12\">An admission or a confession of the accused may be considered as evidence against the accused on the question of guilt or innocence only if independent evidence, either direct or circumstantial, has been introduced that corroborates the essential facts admitted to justify sufficiently an inference of their truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">In <em>United States v. Cottrill, </em>45 MJ 485, 489 (1997), we summarized the applicable case law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-15\">The corroboration requirement for admission of a confession at court-martial does not necessitate independent evidence of all the elements of an offense or even the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the confessed offense. <em>See United States v. Maio, </em>34 MJ 215, 218 (CMA 1992). Rather, the corroborating evidence must raise only an inference of truth as to the essential facts admitted. <em>Id; United States v. Rounds, </em>30 MJ 76, 80 (CMA 1990). Moreover, while reliability of the essential facts must be established, it need not be done beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Maio, supra </em>at 218 n. 1; <em>see United States v. Melvin, </em>26 MJ 145, 146 (CMA 1988) (quantum of corroboration needed \u201cvery slight\u201d); <em>United States v. Yeoman, </em>25 MJ 1, 4 (1987) (corroboration needed \u201cslight\u201d). We have closely analyzed the evidence in every case before us to determine whether a confession has been sufficiently corroborated. <em>See Maio, supra </em>at 218-19; <em>see generally </em>C.A. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 414 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">The military judge in the present case made detailed findings of fact, which included the following: (1) on April 24, appellant\u2019s \u25a0wife saw appellant in the child-victim\u2019s bedroom beside her bed; (2) appellant gave his wife \u201ca strange look that she had never seen before\u201d; (3) appellant left the bedroom and went into the living room, where his wife found him crying on the floor and talking about his own history of being molested as a child; and (4) two days after this incident, appellant sought professional counseling with the base chaplain, who referred him to a therapist. After enumerating these and other findings, the military judge granted appellant\u2019s motion, concluding that the Government had failed to introduce sufficient evidence to corroborate the truth of the essential facts of appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-17\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b643-18\">We agree with the court below that the facts specifically enumerated by the military judge adequately corroborate those contained in appellant\u2019s written confession. The military judge described a specific interaction between appellant and his wife on the night <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>of April 24, which began when she found him in the child-victim\u2019s bedroom, and which culminated with appellant revealing to his wife his own history of being molested as a child. This finding sufficiently corroborates the truth of appellant\u2019s own statement that his wife \u201cwalked in on\u201d him while he was molesting the child in the child\u2019s bedroom on April 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The military judge\u2019s finding that two days after this incident appellant sought professional counseling with a chaplain, who then referred him to a therapist, adequately corroborated the truth of appellant\u2019s assertion that he immediately sought help from a chaplain, who then referred him to a therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In light of the direct corroborative value of the facts found by the military judge with respect to the essential facts contained in appellant\u2019s written confession, we agree with the court below that the military judge erred in suppressing the confession under Mil. R.Evid. 304(g). The findings made by the military judge, which raised an inference of truth as to the essential facts admitted, were legally sufficient Lo corroborate appellant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In view of our conclusion that the military judge\u2019s determination was incorrect as a matter of law, we need not reach the second granted issue regarding the ability of the lower court to consider facts in addition to those found by the military judge in evaluating corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals remanding this case for further proceedings is affirmed. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
