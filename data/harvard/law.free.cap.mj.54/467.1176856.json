Jamison, </em>USMC (argued); <em>Colonel Marc </em>W. <em>Fisher, Jr., </em>USMC, and <em>Lieutenant Commander Philip L. Sundel, </em>JAGC, USNR (on brief); <em>Colonel Kevin M.

The court-martial did not impose a forfeiture of pay and allowances as part of the adjudged sentence. Subsequently, appellant forfeited all of his pay and allowances by operation of law. <em>See </em>Art. 58b, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 858b. He claims on appeal that the subsequent forfeiture of his pay and allowances violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States <em>(see also </em>Art. 44, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 844).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that neither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor Article 44 prohibits the forfeiture of pay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>allowances imposed by operation of Article 58b.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In <em>United States v. Gorski </em>47 MJ 370 (1997), we observed that the forfeiture of pay and allowances has long been recognized as punishment for military offenders. Thus, we found that the application of automatic forfeiture of pay and allowances to crimes and offenses committed prior to the enactment of Article 58b violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of Article I, \u00a7 9 of the Constitution. In dicta, we also recognized that prospective application of the statute would be permissible. 47 MJ at 374. This is because the fact that a statute provides for unlawful <em>ex post facto </em>punishment does not mean that the punishment would be unlawful prospectively. There is no prohibition against requiring the mandatory forfeiture of pay and allowances as a consequence of a court-martial sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">\u201cDouble Jeopardy\u201d means that an offender is \u201csubject, for the same offense, to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d U.S. Const, amend V. In this case, appellant has not been twice put in jeopardy. All of the punishment that he has suffered, including the automatic forfeiture of pay and allowances, arose out of and was caused by his single court-martial. There has been only one proceeding, as a result of which appellant has received multiple punishments as authorized and intended by Congress. \u201cWith respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d <em>Missouri, v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Because we find no violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we need not consider the Government\u2019s contention that the imposition of forfeitures required by Article 58b is merely an \u201cadministrative consequence\u201d of the court-martial sentence. Nor do we address the Government\u2019s contention that we have no jurisdiction over the case before us because the forfeiture is a \u201ccollateral result\u201d of the sentence. We rejected this approach to forfeiture of pay and allowances in <em>Gorski </em>and we need not plow that ground again.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-17\">. The granted issue is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-18\">WHERE THE COURT-MARTIAL\u2019S SENTENCE DID NOT INCLUDE FINES OR FORFEITURES, DOES THE ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT OF FORFEITURES BY OPERATION OF ARTICLE 58b, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 858b, VIOLATE THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
