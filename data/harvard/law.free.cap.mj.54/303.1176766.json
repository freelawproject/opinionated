The military judge sentenced appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 75 days, forfeiture of $600.00 pay per month for 3 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. In accordance with a pretrial agreement, the convening authority disapproved all confinement in excess of time served but approved the remainder of the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and approved sentence. 52 MJ 597 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">This Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE MILITARY JUDGE DID NOT VIOLATE MIL.R.EVID. 410 BY ADMITTING (AS AGGRAVATION UNDER RCM 1001) APPELLANT\u2019S ADMISSION OF GUILT IN AN UNRELATED REQUEST FOR AN OTHER THAN HONORABLE DISCHARGE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">For the reasons set out below, we reverse the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">During the plea inquiry, appellant told the military judge that he was asked by another sailor to be the lookout while the other sailor stole merchandise from the Navy Exchange. The plan was to return the stolen property to the Navy Exchange for a refund and split the money. When they were unable to obtain a refund without a receipt, they decided to \u201cgo shopping\u201d again. Appellant agreed to act as lookout again while his co-actor took more items, intending to exit the store without paying for them. As appellant and his co-actor exited the store, they were apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">After appellant\u2019s pleas of guilty were accepted by the military judge, the prosecution offered evidence that appellant had requested an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial for an unauthorized absence of 212 days. Appellant was awaiting execution of the administrative discharge when he committed the larceny. Appellant\u2019s request included an admission that he was in fact guilty of the unauthorized absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">Trial counsel argued that the request for administrative discharge was admissible as a personnel record relating to the character of appellant\u2019s prior service under RCM 1001, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.), and was not excluded by Mil. R.Evid. 410, Manual, <em>supra. </em>The military judge overruled a defense objection and admitted the evidence under RCM 1001(b)(2).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">The defense case focused on avoiding a bad-conduct discharge. In an unsworn statement, appellant described his life growing up in a poor family and a bad neighborhood. He remembered his grandfather\u2019s war stories about World War II and decided to enlist in the Navy. He did not mention his unauthorized absence or approved administrative discharge. He concluded his unsworn statement with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-16\">I enlisted in October of \u201994, not for the college money or to see the world, I joined for three reasons, sir: To serve my country, to make something out of myself, and to make my grandfather proud of me. Sir, the bottom line, I wanted to make a man out of myself and not be one of the street punks that I used to see everyday on the street. Sir, while in the Navy I have been many places and done many things and met many people, and I loved everyday of it. From that I have taken life lessons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that I couldn\u2019t learn anywhere else. This right here, sir, will be no different. Sir, at this time I would like to apologize to the United States Navy, to you, sir, my family, and especially my grandfather who I have let down. I am sorry, and thank you very much, sii*.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In sentencing argument, trial counsel made specific reference to appellant\u2019s unauthorized 212-day absence and asked the military judge to impose a sentence that included a bad-conduct discharge. Defense counsel emphasized appellant\u2019s remorse, commented on the influence of other troublemakers in the unit on appellant, and argued that a bad-conduct discharge would be too severe a punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the military judge\u2019s ruling. It held that the approved request for administrative discharge documented appellant\u2019s unauthorized absence \u201cin much the same way as a record of a prior conviction is documented by a promulgating order or a record of nonjudicial punishment by the completed mast report form.\u201d 52 MJ at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The court below further held that Mil. R.Evid. 410 was not applicable to appellant\u2019s case. The court reasoned that Mil.R.Evid. 410 applies only to pending charges and that the unauthorized absence was no longer pending after appellant\u2019s request for an administrative discharge was approved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">RCM 1001(b)(2) permits the prosecution to introduce a broad range of documents from an accused\u2019s personnel records. However, it does not provide blanket authority to introduce all information that happens to be maintained in the accused\u2019s personnel records. <em>United States v. Ariail, </em>48 MJ 285, 287 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Mil.R.Evid. 410 prohibits the admission of a guilty plea that was later withdrawn, a plea of nolo contendere, a statement made during a judicial inquiry into a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or \u201cany statement made in the course of plea discussions.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 410 is generally taken from Fed.R.Evid. 410, but is broader because it encompasses statements made in connection with a request for administrative disposition in lieu of court-martial. Drafters\u2019 Analysis of Mil.R.Evid. 410, Manual, <em>supra </em>at A22-34. Mil.R.Evid. 410(b) defines a \u201cstatement made in the course of plea discussions\u201d as including \u201ca statement made by the accused solely for the purpose of requesting disposition under an authorized procedure for administrative action in lieu of trial by court-martial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">In <em>United States v. Barunas, </em>23 MJ 71, 75-76 (CMA 1986), this Court held that an accused\u2019s pretrial letter to his commander, admitting his guilt and requesting disposition by \u201cany other avenues of punishment short of court-martial,\u201d was a plea discussion within the meaning of Mil.R.Evid. 410. This Court explained that \u201c[a]n excessively formalistic or technical approach to this rule may undermine\u201d the policy of the rule, which is \u201cto encourage the flow of information during the plea-bargaining process.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Ankeny, </em>30 MJ 10, 15 (CMA 1990) (defense counsel\u2019s \u201cpreliminary overtures\u201d to an assistant staff judge advocate during a social event encompassed by Mil. R.Evid. 410); <em>United States v. Brabant, </em>29 MJ 259, 264 (CMA 1989) (accused\u2019s question to commander, \u201cWhat can I do to make this right?\u201d was a plea discussion encompassed by Mil.R.Evid. 410).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">In light of this Court\u2019s long-standing precedent for avoiding an \u201cexcessively formalistic or technical\u201d application of Mil. R.Evid. 410 in favor of a broad application of the rule, we must respectfully reject the rationale of the court below for finding the rule inapplicable. Mil.R.Evid. 410 does not require that protected plea bargaining statements be related to offenses \u201cpending\u201d before the court-martial at which they are offered. Such a construction of the rule would remove its protection from any accused who bargained for withdrawal or dismissal of certain charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s charges arising from the unauthorized absence are still \u201cpending\u201d because appellant has not yet received the <em>quid pro quo </em>for his admission of guilt: an executed discharge. Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ment appellate counsel acknowledged in oral argument that the convening authority was not empowered to execute the requested discharge and that the request for discharge was still pending approval at the Navy Bureau of Personnel at the time it was offered in evidence. Subject to limitations of the Due Process Clause and Articles 10, 33, and 43, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 810, 833, and 843, respectively, the Government remains free to prosecute appellant for the unauthorized absence at any time until its jurisdiction is terminated by appellant\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The final question is whether appellant was prejudiced by the violation of Mil.R.Evid. 410. <em>See Barunas, </em>23 MJ at 76. Appellant had no previous convictions or nonjudicial punishment. On its face, the unexplained 212-day absence was a serious offense. Appellant expressed remorse for the larceny, and his counsel argued that a bad-conduct discharge was too severe. We cannot say \u201cwith fair assurance\u201d that evidence of a 212-day unauthorized absence did not have a \u201csubstantial influence\u201d on the sentence imposed by the military judge. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). Furthermore, under the criteria for sentence reassessment prescribed in <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 MJ 305, 307-09 (CMA 1986), we are convinced that it cannot be reliably determined that the military judge would have imposed a bad-conduct discharge in the absence of evidence of the 212-day unauthorized absence. Accordingly, we cannot give the court below its usual broad discretion to reassess and affirm the bad-conduct discharge, because we would be unable to affirm that decision in light of <em>Sales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed as to findings but reversed as to sentence. The sentence is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy for remand to the Court of Criminal Appeals. That court may either reassess and affirm a sentence that does not include a bad-conduct discharge, or it may order a sentence rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\"> All Manual provisions are cited to the version in effect at the time of trial. The current version is unchanged, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b484-8\">CRAWFORD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AlL\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">I fully join the majority\u2019s rationale in holding that Mil.R.Evid. 410, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.), was applicable to appellant\u2019s case and that the military judge\u2019s error in admitting the challenged evidence had a \u201csubstantial influence\u201d on appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">I respectfully part company with the majority over their restrictive remand of this case to the Court of Criminal Appeals for sentence reassessment. In taking this action, the majority has abridged the lower court\u2019s sentence reassessment discretion and expertise unnecessarily, substituted its own judgement of sentence appropriateness, and virtually dictated a sentence rehearing, all in derogation of Congressional and Presidential mandates, as well as 15 years of precedent from this Court. <em>See </em>Art. 66(c), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 866(c); RCM 1203, Manual, <em>supra; United States v. Suzuki, </em>20 MJ 248, 249 (CMA 1985); <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 MJ 305 (CMA 1986); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>33 MJ 98, 99 (CMA 1991); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>48 MJ 434, 438 (1998); <em>United States v. Eversole, </em>53 MJ 132, 138 (2000)(Crawford, C.J., dissenting); <em>Id. </em>at 140 (Gierke, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">This Court\u2019s responsibility is to determine, as a matter of law, whether a Court of Criminal Appeals abuses its discretion when reassessing and determining that a sentence imposed at trial, minus the prejudicial error, would have been of a certain magnitude. Art. 67(c), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 867(c); <em>see United States v. Taylor, </em>51 MJ 390, 391 (1999); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>39 MJ 315, 317 (1994); <em>Sales, </em>22 MJ at 308. Today we put the proverbial cart before the horse by circumscribing the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 statutory function.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Finally, the restrictive mandate virtually guarantees a sentence rehearing. Instead of erroneously introducing appellant\u2019s discharge request at trial, the Government could have introduced, during sentencing, properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>maintained, complete, reliable personnel forms reflecting appellant\u2019s absence from and return to duty after 212 days. See RCM 1001(b)(2); <em>United States v. Ariail, </em>48 MJ 285 (1998); <em>see generally United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 56, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984). Such documents, even though incorporated in the allied papers of the record of trial, cannot be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeals when performing its sentence reassessment. <em>See United States v. Peoples, </em>29 MJ 426, 428 (CMA 1990). Conversely, they can be introduced <em>during </em>a sentence rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">By its action today, the majority says that the Court of Criminal Appeals is incapable of determining the ultimate affect (albeit \u201csubstantial\u201d) a 212 day unauthorized absence had on the sentence. Accordingly, the Court of Criminal Appeals, with its discretion removed, will have no option but to restart the sentencing process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
