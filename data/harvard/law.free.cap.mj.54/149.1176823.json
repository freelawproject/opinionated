Contrary to his pleas, he was found guilty of using marijuana, conspiracy to commit larceny, and larceny, in violation of Articles 112a, 81, and 121, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 912a, 881, and 921, respectively. He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 6 years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved this sentence, except for forfeitures in excess of $583 pay per month from the completion of appellant\u2019s confinement until the execution of his discharge. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. <em>United States v. Diffoot, </em>No. 97-0515, 1999 WL 179613 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. March 11, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-25\">On July 13, 1999, this Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>WHETHER THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED BY HOLDING THAT A \u201cSERIES OF ERRORS\u201d DURING THE TRIAL COUNSEL\u2019S CLOSING ARGUMENT ON THE MERITS, INCLUDING REFERENCES TO APPELLANT\u2019S RACE AND \u201cGUILT BY ASSOCIATION,\u201d DID NOT AMOUNT TO PLAIN ERROR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We hold that trial counsel\u2019s closing argument referring to appellant\u2019s alleged co-conspirators\u2019 Hispanic ethnicity and admitted criminality, and urging conviction based on the theory of guilt by association, prejudicially violated appellant\u2019s due process right to a fundamentally fair trial. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>903 F.2d 16 (D.C.Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Polasek, </em>162 F.3d 878 (5th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Appellant was arraigned on June 17, 1996, at which time trial was set for August 21, 1996. R. at 7. He absented himself without authority and, thus, was not present for the remainder of his court-martial. R. at 11, 37. The charges for which appellant was tried center around an alleged conspiracy between him, Private Juarez, and Private Sorianocarcamo to steal an automobile, their larceny of that vehicle, and appellant\u2019s use of marijuana. R. at 562; Charge Sheet. The Government granted immunity to Private Juarez, Private Sorianocarcamo, and a civilian female, Ms. Maria Cervantes, in exchange for their testimony implicating appellant in the conspiracy and larceny offenses. R. at 170, 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Appellant\u2019s defense counsel put forth evidence raising the defense of alibi on the larceny charge and an innocent ingestion defense for the marijuana charge. R. at 276-88, 338-50, 364-75, 429-38, 456-62, 467, 495; Defense Exhibit I. Both defenses were based on the testimony of Ms. Cynthia Smith and her brother, Fred, both of whom were friends of appellant. Several Marines from appellant\u2019s unit also corroborated appellant\u2019s alibi defense. (R. 425, 456, 464) Several other Marines testified to the poor credibility of the Government\u2019s witnesses. R. at 474-75, 478-79, 482-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The issue on appeal concerns remarks made by trial counsel during his summation on findings. R. at 505-17. Trial counsel made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">Gentlemen, how many times can lightning strike one person; not only in the course of a lifetime, but over the course of ten days, gentlemen. Fantastic coincidence, fantastic tragedy befell Lance Corporal Diffoot. <em>On the ISth, lfth, or maybe the 15th of January, he ivas framed for using marijuana by some evil surf punks. Ten days later, on the 2fth of January, he was framed by the evil Juarez, who is an evil guy; framed by the evil Juarez, Soriano, and Maria Cervantes for stealing a car. Now, these are separate, wholly unrelated criminals. </em>[Evil surf punks and evil fellow Marines and friend.] They have nothing to do with each other. Yet they pick the hapless, innocent Lance Corporal Diffoot as their victim. Credibility, gentlemen, that is what this is all about. That is an incredible coincidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">Now, let\u2019s turn to the government witnesses. Gentlemen, I told you it would be ugly. These are lousy Marines. <em>These are criminal Marines. They\u2019re </em>\u2014 Juarez <em>and Soriano, </em>you heard, they\u2019re a Platoon Commander\u2019s worst nightmare incarnated. They come to life right there. <em>But who is their amigo, gentlemen? Who is their compadre? You heard it from everybody. Lance Corporal Diffoot, the three of them. All three of them, running mates.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">Now, earlier in my opening I told you or I proffered to you, <em>who do criminals associate with? Other criminals. Gentlemen, Lance Corporal Diffoot was intimately tied up with the other tivo; yet he distanced himself for this misconduct. He wasn\u2019t there. Also, by the way, he didn\u2019t use drugs. It was innocent ingestion. Gentlemen, there is something called \u201cguilt by association.\u201d We clearly have that here.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">R. at 506-07 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Defense counsel did not object to any of these comments, and the military judge did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>not, <em>sua sponte, </em>give any instructions to the members regarding the above remarks. The appellate court below determined that the above comments made by trial counsel were clearly erroneous but did not materially prejudice appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The question before this Court, 1999 WL 179613, is whether the Court of Criminal Appeals was correct in holding that certain errors made by trial counsel in his closing argument did not \u201cmaterially prejudice the substantial rights of [appellant].\u201d Article 59(a), UCMJ. The lower appellate court noted that defense counsel did not object to trial counsel\u2019s references to the common Hispanic ethnicity of appellant, R. at 492, and his alleged co-conspirators. It also noted that defense counsel did not object when trial counsel invited the members to convict appellant on the basis of his preoffense association with these Marines, who admitted their own criminal involvement in the charged offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it found these references and argument, although obvious and substantial error, were not plain error, because there was \u201cno reasonable possibility that any of the errors in trial counsel\u2019s argument materially prejudiced the appellant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial by affecting the members\u2019 deliberations over the evidence. Article 59(a), UCMJ.\u201d Unpub. op. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">More particularly, the Court of Criminal Appeals initially concluded that trial counsel\u2019s remarks that appellant was the \u201camigo\u201d or \u201ccompadre\u201d of Private Juarez and Private Sorianocarcamo \u201cwas clearly an indirect reference to the race of the appellant and the witnesses, which had no logical relationship to any of the issues in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. It held, however, that these \u201cracial remarks ... were neither overtly pejorative in their own right, nor a subtle appeal to the prejudice of the members, when viewed in the context in which they were made. They were two isolated racial remarks buried within a lengthy argument by the trial counsel. It is unlikely that these particular remarks had any effect, much less an unfair impact, upon the members\u2019 deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">The Court of Criminal Appeals also concluded that trial counsel\u2019s erroneous reference to \u201cguilt by association\u201d with admitted criminals did not materially prejudice appellant. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">While the trial counsel did use the term \u201cguilt by association,\u201d his argument actually focused on the evidence of the appellant\u2019s own criminal misconduct in the conspiracy and larceny of the stolen vehicle. We, again, find it unlikely that the use of this term alone had any effect upon the members\u2019 assessment of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-17\"><em>Id. </em>We disagree with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 prejudice analysis and conclude that these comments by trial counsel, viewed together and in the context of the entire record of tidal, did materially prejudice appellant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Grandy, </em>11 MJ 270, 275 (CMA 1981) (holding that prejudice from improper trial counsel argument must be assessed in light of entire trial context); <em>see generally United States v. Clark, </em>53 MJ 280 (2000) (concluding upon review of the entire record that the error did not materially prejudice the substantial rights of appellant); <em>see also United States v. Kho, </em>54 MJ 63 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">Turning to the record in this case, we note that the prosecution\u2019s case for conspiracy and larceny of Lance Corporal Bruno\u2019s automobile rested largely on the testimony of appellant\u2019s two alleged co-conspirators, Private Juarez and Private Sorianocarcamo. Recognizing that these two prosecution witnesses were themselves admitted criminals who were testifying with immunity, trial counsel in his opening argument attempted to justify the Government\u2019s reliance on these witnesses as unfortunate but necessary. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Now, the Government would love to present a parade of witnesses, a parade of stellar, poster Marines to substantiate these charges. Unfortunately, that is not the nature of criminal activity. As <em>a general proposition, there are two axioms that apply to criminals and criminal activities. </em>First, criminal Marines that are planning a theft, obviously they are not going to seek or solicit assistance from the Marine of the Quarter. <em>Second, when they do commit criminal activities, they are </em>either going to do it in private, away from prying eyes, away from detection; <em>or if they do solicit assistance, it is going to be from their peers, their friends.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><em>Who are these </em>people? <em>Fellow criminals. That is who is going to help them. </em>So you have a choice. <em>Either they are going to go and look for members of their own ilk, fellow criminals, or they are going to do it in private so they don\u2019t get caught. </em>That is what this is all about. Not getting caught. That is the way this whole thing unfolded and that is the way it unraveled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">R. at 100 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In other words, he properly asked the members not to disregard these witnesses\u2019 testimony simply because they admitted their own participation in these crimes. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>12 F.3d 1414, 1424-26 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Trial counsel, however, was not content to rest his case on the conspiracy and larceny charges simply on the testimony of two admitted criminals and a female companion, or his case on drug use simply on the basis of urinalysis evidence. After presentation of the defense case, he blatantly argued that appellant should be convicted of all these offenses because he was the Hispanic associate of the two Hispanic Marines who admitted committing the larceny crimes. This was a marked shift from his earlier argument, and one which improperly attempted to enhance the prosecution\u2019s case based on the defendant\u2019s race and his criminal associations. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>903 F.2d at 24-27; <em>United States v. Dickens, </em>775 F.2d 1056, 1058 (9th Cir.1983). This was done during closing argument, a critical point in the trial <em>(see United States v. Marshall, </em>173 F.3d 1312, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1999)), and in a situation where the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was not overwhelming. <em>See United States v. Polasek, </em>162 F.3d at 886-87. Finally, this was done without any effort being made by trial counsel or the military judge to disavow this improper argument or limit consideration of appellant\u2019s ethnicity and associations to proper purposes. <em>Cf. United States v. Spriggs, </em>102 F.3d 1245, 1257-58 (D.C.Cir. 1996); <em>United States v. Rose, supra </em>at 1426.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The Court of Criminal Appeals discounted these racial remarks and the guilt-by-association argument because it concluded that tidal counsel actually focused his closing argument on the evidence in the case showing specific conduct by appellant. Indeed, trial counsel did heavily rely on the testimony of appellant\u2019s alleged co-conspirators, who were the principal government witnesses against appellant, and who identified him as a member of their conspiracy and as the person who actually stole the car. We note, however, that the defense called two civilian witnesses without criminal involvement in this case to establish the defense of alibi for appellant at the time of the alleged theft, and the defense of innocent ingestion. Accordingly, we disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecution\u2019s evidence in this case was overwhelming and that trial counsel\u2019s comments had no effect on the members\u2019 assessment of guilt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Doe, supra </em>at 27-28; <em>United States v. Polasek, supra </em>at 884-85; <em>United States v. Irvin, </em>87 F.3d 860, 866 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">In conclusion, we note that our military justice system established by Congress in accordance with the Constitution does not permit a conviction based on an accused\u2019s race (see <em>United States v. Green, </em>37 MJ 380, 385 (CMA 1993)), or an accused\u2019s associations. <em>See United States v. Sitton, </em>39 MJ 307, 310 (CMA 1994). In the words stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>long ago by Judge Brosman, permitting convictions on the basis of a theory of guilt by association would establish \u201ca principle alien to American standards of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Jacobs, </em>1 USCMA 209, 211, 2 CMR 115, 117 (1952); <em>see United States v. Adkins, </em>5 USCMA 492, 499, 18 CMR 116, 123 (1955). In more recent times, a majority of this Court adopted Judge Wiss\u2019s eloquent statement on racial discrimination in the military justice system (see <em>United States v. Witham, </em>47 MJ 297, 303 (1997)), \u201cRacial discrimination is anathema to the military justice system. It ought not \u2014 and it will not \u2014 be tolerated in any form.\u201d <em>United States v. Greene, </em>36 MJ 274, 282 (CMA 1993) (Wiss, J., concurring). Even in the absence of objection by defense counsel, this Court can and will act to remedy such a serious injustice and preserve the integrity of the military justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"A0c\">The decision of the United States Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and the findings of guilty and sentence are set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. A new trial may be ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. Despite the language of \u201cwaiver\u201d in RCM 919(c), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.), we have repeatedly held that where there is no defense objection to the prosecution\u2019s argument, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Carpenter, </em>51 MJ 393, 396 (1999); <em>United States v. Sweeney, </em>48 MJ 117, 121 (1998); <em>cf. United States v. Causey, </em>37 MJ 308, 312 (CMA 1993) (Sullivan, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. We agree with the dissent that not every racial reference in a criminal trial requires a new trial. <em>See Smith v. Farley, </em>59 F.3d 659, 663-64 (7th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Abello-Silva, </em>948 F.2d 1168, 1182 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b331-8\">COX, Senior Judge, with whom CRAWFORD, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A96B\">joins (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">I disagree that the purpose of trial counsel\u2019s closing argument was to urge conviction on the basis of Hispanic ethnicity or guilt by association. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">The question of the effect of improper prosecution argument was addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974), and in <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). Applying these cases, the question is whether trial counsel\u2019s argument \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Donnelly, supra </em>at 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868; <em>Darden, supra </em>at 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464. In order to make this determination, we must look at the entire record in this case. <em>Donnelly, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">A. Hispanic Ethnicity</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Trial counsel\u2019s argument related to charges against appellant for conspiring with Private Juarez and Private Sorianocarcamo (aka Private Soriano) to steal, and then actually stealing another soldier\u2019s automobile. Since appellant absented himself without authority after his arraignment, and thus was not present for the remainder of his trial, appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel raised on his behalf the affirmative defense of alibi to the larceny charge, i.e., appellant was somewhere else when the actual theft of the automobile took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">The Government granted immunity to Privates Juarez and Soriano and a civilian female in exchange for their testimony impheating appellant in both the conspiracy and the larceny. During cross-examination of these individuals, trial defense counsel attempted to establish that they were lying about appellant\u2019s participation in the theft, thereby raising by implication the inference that appellant was not part of the conspiracy. Trial defense counsel\u2019s argument\u2019s on opening and closing supported this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Presenting this alibi defense clearly put the question of the extent of appellant\u2019s relationship with Juarez and Soriano squarely at issue. Proof that appellant had little or no prior affiliation with Juarez and Soriano could only serve to decrease, in the minds of the jurors, the likelihood that appellant was involved in the theft or conspiracy and thereby increase the plausibility of appellant\u2019s alibi defense. Trial counsel took great pains to establish at trial that appellant, Juarez, and Soriano were well acquainted, and were in fact \u201crunning mates.\u201d Hence, appellant\u2019s closing argument reiterated the evidence presented at trial of this relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">Because of the alibi defense, as well as the conspiracy charge, there is no question that evidence of the relationship between appellant, Juarez, and Soriano was logically relevant. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 401 and 402, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). Hence, the argument itself was legally permissible, so the only question remaining is whether the use of \u201camigo\u201d and \u201ccompadre\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>with respect to Hispanic co-conspirators was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Prejudice would attach if trial counsel\u2019s argument was made for the purpose of kindling racial or ethnic stereotyping, so that a conviction would be obtained because of appellant\u2019s affiliation rather than because the evidence against him was overwhelming. In this case, we need only look at trial counsel\u2019s argument in its entirety in order to determine its intended purpose. The entire argument trial counsel made concerning appellant\u2019s co-conspirators was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">Now, let\u2019s turn to the government witnesses. Gentlemen, I told you it would be ugly. These are lousy Marines. These are criminal Marines. They\u2019re \u2014 Juarez and Soriano, you heard, they\u2019re a platoon Commander\u2019s worst nightmare incarnated. They come to life right there. But who is their <em>amigo, </em>gentlemen? Who is them <em>compadre? </em>You heard it from everybody. Lance Corporal Diffoot, the three of them. All three of them, <em>running mates.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In context, trial counsel was describing the relationship between appellant, Juarez, and Soriano using several terms including the term \u201crunning mate.\u201d The words \u201camigo\u201d and \u201ccompadre\u201d are Spanish words which also can mean running mate, particularly when used in this context. This is not a situation where \u201camigo\u201d and \u201ccompadre\u201d were used in a perjorative manner to describe people of Hispanic ancestry, but rather were used to describe the relationship between co-conspirators. Such use is entirely legal. It would be an absurd result to permit trial counsel to use English terms like \u201crunning mate\u201d but disallow use of Spanish words with the same meaning merely because witnesses are of Hispanic descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">This case is easily distinguishable from <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 MJ 572 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.1997). In <em>Lawrence, </em>the term \u201cthree Jamaican brothers\u201d was used in a pejorative manner with no other logical purpose than to cast the testimony of the defense witnesses in an adverse light based upon an implied racial stereotype. It is also distinguishable from to <em>United States v. Doe, </em>903 F.2d 16 (D.C.Cir.1990), cited by the majority. <em>Doe </em>directly supports the proposition that the entire proceedings must be examined and the argument viewed in context. <em>See DeChristoforo, supra </em>at 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868. In <em>Doe, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s argument included evidence that Jamaicans had taken over the local drug market. The Court of Appeals determined this evidence to be irrelevant and inadmissible because there was no evidence that the Jamaican defendants were connected with any Jamaican drug dealers or that Jamaican drug dealers were involved in the charged drug offenses. 903 F.2d at 27. Further, any other evidence against the accused in <em>Doe </em>for drug offenses was weak. <em>Id. </em>Under those facts, the <em>Doe </em>court found the prosecutor\u2019s argument to be both improper and prejudicial because it invited the jury to convict the defendants based purely upon a stereotype. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">There is no question that race, ethnicity, or national origin may not be used to obtain a conviction. However, the mere use of Spanish words in a case where a witness is of Hispanic descent is not a <em>per se </em>denial of due process. Defense counsel did not object to the argument and did not request a curative instruction. Further, trial defense counsel did not raise the matter of the Hispanic background of the witnesses during <em>voir dire. </em>In this context, the use of the words \u201camigo\u201d and \u201ccompadre\u201d did not deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">B. Guilt by Association</p>\n<p id=\"A80\">Trial counsel used the words \u201cguilt by association\u201d in his closing argument. However, viewed in context, I would find no error. Trial counsel argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">Now, earlier in my opening I told you or I proffered to you, who do criminals associate with? Other criminals. Gentlemen, Lance Corporal Diffoot was intimately tied up with the other two; yet, he distanced himself for this misconduct. He wasn\u2019t there. Also, by the way, he didn\u2019t use drugs. It was an innocent ingestion. Gentlemen, there is something called \u201cguilt by association.\u201d We clearly have that here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">Since neither Juarez nor Soriano was involved in the charge related to drug use, the argument appears to be focusing on appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>lant\u2019s surprisingly close association with an assortment of criminal activity for which he claims innocence. This argument, it seems to me, is fair commentary on the evidence. Trial defense counsel must have thought so too, as he interposed no objection and requested neither a mistrial nor even a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">C. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">This is not a case where there has been a miscarriage of justice. Appellant absented himself from trial after arraignment. Then, in a veritable paroxysm of guilt and remorse, returned to military control, began serving his sentence and, most importantly, admitted guilt to the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In my view, under the facts and circumstances of this ease, it would be a true miscarriage of justice to set aside these findings of guilt and the sentence and authorize a retrial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
