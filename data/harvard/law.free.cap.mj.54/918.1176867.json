The petitioner also applied for an order staying the convening authority\u2019s commitment order. On 1 March 2001, after conducting a hearing with counsel for the parties, we denied the petition to stay the commitment order because the petitioner failed to demonstrate any likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">On 12 December 2000, three specifications alleging misconduct in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934, were preferred against the petitioner. On 5 January 2001, the petitioner\u2019s defense counsel asked the special court-martial convening authority to order an inquiry into the competence of the petitioner to stand trial and cooperate in his own defense. R.C.M. 706. The convening authority apparently granted that request on 11 January 2001, and a sanity board was conducted. By letter dated 3 February 2001, the sanity board reported its findings: The petitioner is suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in his defense. The board found the cause of this ineompetency to be neuropsychological deficits remaining from his moderately severe closed head injury on 8 October 2000. Based on the \u201csubstantial progress of his recovery to date,\u201d the board estimated that the petitioner might recover enough within the next 3 months to meet competency requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-13\">On 21 February 2001, the general court-martial convening authority concurred with the sanity board\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner was not competent to stand trial. Despite the protestations of the petitioner\u2019s counsel, the general court-martial convening authority ordered the petitioner committed to the custody of the Attorney General, pursuant to R.C.M. 909(e), for transfer to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for commitment and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-14\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">The petitioner alleges that this Court has jurisdiction under the Ml Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), to issue the stay and grant the petition for extraordinary relief. He argues that we have jurisdiction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_h6\">over issues concerning protections of legal rights that arise from \u2018military problems,\u2019 that arise from the Uniform Code of Military Justice. <em>Ponder v. Stone, </em>54 M.J. 613, 615 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App.2000) (finding jurisdiction to entertain petition for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>traordinary relief in the nature of a writ of mandamus and a stay of proceedings arising from military judge\u2019s pretrial orders in case involving refusal to submit to anthrax inoculation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">On the other hand, the respondent contends this Court lacks jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to enter the relief requested. The respondent relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Clinton v. Goldsmith, </em>526 U.S. 529, 119 S.Ct. 1538, 143 L.Ed.2d 720 (1999). The respondent asserts that <em>Goldsmith </em>rejected such a broad reading. The respondent claims our jurisdiction under the All Writs Act is limited to matters in aid of our statutory jurisdiction under Article 66(c), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c) \u2014 to findings and sentences of courts-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">We find it unnecessary to enter the fray and draw a line between the two extremes posited by counsel. Even if we have jurisdiction, the petitioner is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">III. The Application for Stay and the Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">R.C.M. 909(c), the provision upon which the convening authority relied to order the petitioner\u2019s commitment is based on Article 76b, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 876b. That statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-8\">In the case of a person determined under this chapter to be presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering the person mentally incompetent to the extent that the person is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against that person or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case, the general court-martial convening-authority for that person <em>shall </em>commit the person to the custody of the Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Article 76b(a)(1), UCMJ (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">The President provided procedural guidance for implementing Article 76b, UCMJ, in R.C.M. 909.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-11\">(c) <em>Determination before referral. </em>If an inquiry pursuant to R.C.M. 706 conducted before referral concludes that an accused is suffering from a mental disease or defect that renders him or her mentally incompetent to stand trial, the convening authority before whom the charges are pending for disposition may disagree with the conclusion and take any action authorized under R.C.M. 401, including referral of the charges to trial. If that convening authority concurs with the conclusion, he or she shall forward the charges to the general court-martial convening authority. If, upon receipt of the charges, the general court-martial convening authority similarly concurs, then he or she shall commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General. If the general court-martial convening authority does not concur, that authority may take any action that he or she deems appropriate in accordance with R.C.M. 407, including referral of the charges to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">Article 76b, and the federal statute upon which it is based, both provide that if an accused is found to be mentally incompetent to stand trial, he \u201cshall\u201d be committed to the custody of the Attorney General. The petitioner does not contest the fact that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial. In fact, it was the petitioner who sought such a finding. Instead, he argues that before the government may involuntarily commit him, it must show, by more than a preponderance of the evidence, not only that he is mentally incompetent, but that he \u201crequires hospitalization for his own welfare and protection of others.\u201d We, and every federal appellate court that has examined this issue, disagree. The purpose of any hearing, under Article 76b or the federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d), is to determine the competency of an accused to stand trial, not to determine the propriety of commitment to the Attorney General. <em>United States v. Filippi, </em>211 F.3d 649 (1st Cir.2000) (assuming commitment mandatory, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 is constitutional); <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>155 F.3d 674 (3d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Donofrio, </em>896 F.2d 1301, 1302 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that upon finding of incompetency, \u201cthe district court did not have the authority to circumvent the hospitalization\u201d); <em>United States v. Shawar, </em>865 F.2d 856, 860 (7th Cir.1989) (finding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 and the legislative history unambiguous \u2014 once an accused \u201cis found incompetent to stand trial, a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>judge has no discretion in whether or not to commit him\u201d); <em>Farrell v. United States, </em>646 A.2d 963 (D.C.App.1994) (interpreting DC statute based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241).</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Accordingly, the petition for writ of mandamus is</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
