The adjudged sentence was a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for six years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El. The pretrial agreement required the convening authority to disapprove any confinement in excess of eight years. After reviewing appellant\u2019s Rule for Courts-Martial 1105 [hereinafter R.C.M.] matters, the convening authority adopted his staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation and reduced appellant\u2019s confinement to five years, but otherwise approved the adjudged sentence. This case is before the court for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">We heard oral argument on appellant\u2019s second assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-6\">APPELLANT WAS NOT PROVIDENT TO CHARGE IV AND ITS SPECIFICATION BECAUSE THE FACTS DO NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THE VISUAL DEPICTIONS \u201cINVOLVE [D] THE USE OF A MINOR\u201d AS REQUIRED BY 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">For the reasons to be discussed, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">Appellant was actively involved in \u201cchatting\u201d with minor girls on the Internet, engaging in sexual activity with minor girls, and exchanging and collecting sexually explicit photographs of minor girls. The carnal knowledge, sodomy, and indecent acts charges concerned appellant\u2019s sexual activities with three different girls, L.B., D.B., and D.P., all under the age of sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">In the fall or winter of 1995, appellant met L.B. at an on-post bowling alley. Appellant was twenty-two years old. He knew that L.B. was fifteen years old. Within two weeks of meeting, they engaged in sexual intercourse at the home of one of L.B.\u2019s friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">In December 1997, appellant began conversing with D.B. in an Internet chat room. Appellant knew that D.B. was fourteen years old. After communicating over the Internet for two to three weeks, appellant met D.B. at an off-post movie theater. During the movie, appellant placed his hand under D.B.\u2019s clothes, inserted his finger in her vagina, and rubbed her breasts over her shirt. The next evening, appellant accepted D.B.\u2019s invitation to come to her parent\u2019s residence while she was alone. After taking their clothes off, appellant penetrated D.B.\u2019s vagina with his finger and rubbed her breasts. Appellant then performed cunnilingus on D.B., after which they engaged in sexual intercourse on three occasions. D.B. also performed fellatio on appellant at his request. During a conversation on a subsequent date, appellant asked D.B. to let him take nude pictures of her or the two of them nude together. She agreed, but appellant never took any pictures of her. Appellant sent her, over the Internet, pictures of himself with his penis exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-14\">In January 1998, appellant communicated with D.P. in an Internet chat room. D.P. told appellant that she was fourteen years old. Within a week of their initial conversation, appellant met D.P. at a pool on Fort Huaehuca, Arizona. From there they drove to a remote site on post, where both appellant and D.P. took off their clothes in the uncovered bed of his pickup truck. Appellant penetrated D.P.\u2019s vagina with his finger and she fondled his penis. Appellant then performed cunnilingus on D.P., after which they engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>On 6 March 1998, appellant lied in a sworn statement concerning the number of times he had sexual intercourse with these girls. Two sworn statements by appellant, admitted during the providence inquiry, described other uncharged misconduct concerning underage girls and nude pictures. In one of these statements, appellant specifically admitted to sending nude frontal pictures of himself to girls under eighteen; to knowingly providing pornographic pictures to juveniles; to soliciting juveniles to let him take pictures of them in the nude or in sexually explicit positions; and to knowingly sending child pornography to persons in other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Between 1 November 1997 and 31 March 1998, appellant downloaded onto the hard drive of his computer approximately fifty-five images of what appeared to be minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Based upon these images, the Specification of Charge IV alleged that appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-6\">did at Fort Huachuca, Arizona 85613, on or between 01 November 1997 and 31 March 1998, unlawfully and knowingly receive visual depictions that had been transported by computer, via the Internet, in interstate and foreign commerce, which said visual depictions, when produced, involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, and which said visual depictions are of such sexually explicit conduct, which is a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2252(a) (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">The parties stipulated to the following facts regarding the above offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-11\">On or between 01 November 1997 and 31 March 1998, PFC Coleman did possess, distribute and receive, via the Internet, computer reproductions containing images of child pornography, teen and pre-teen children nude and performing sexual acts. Over 50 images of child pornography were copied from PFC Coleman\u2019s computer depicting children as young as five engaging in various sexual acts with adults and other children. PFC Coleman did distribute these images to other juveniles and adults in Arizona as well as other states in the United States. PFC Coleman\u2019s conduct was of such nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">In a two-pronged argument, appellant requests that we set aside and dismiss his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 and order a rehearing on his sentence. First, appellant argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252, unlike the subsequently enacted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A, requires the actual exploitation of real children under the age of eighteen, as opposed to computer-generated images of children. Second, appellant claims his guilty plea is improvident because the military judge failed to specifically ask him how he knew that the images he downloaded were of real children rather than computer-generated images of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">We agree with the first prong of appellant\u2019s argument. Both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252 and 2252A proscribe pornographic materials involving children, although only \u00a7 2252A uses the term \u201cchild pornography\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>punitive provisions. The principal difference between 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252 and 2252A is that the former prohibits \u201cvisual depictions\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> involving the use of an actual minor, while the latter includes computer-generated images.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant was prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), which provides, in pertinent part, that it is a crime if a person \u201cknowingly receives ... any visual depiction that has been ... transported in interstate or foreign commerce ... by any means including by computer ... if \u2014 (A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and (B) such visual depiction is of such conduct\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that his guilty plea was improvident because he failed to explicitly admit that the children in the images were \u201creal,\u201d as opposed to computer-generated, images. During the providence inquiry, the military judge correctly explained the elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) to appellant and read him the applicable statutory definitions of \u201cminor,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201csexually explicit conduct,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cvisual depiction,\u201d and \u201ccomputer.\u201d Appellant admitted that the elements and definitions correctly described what he had done. He told the military judge that he downloaded onto his computer\u2019s hard drive material that he \u201cshould not have had.\u201d When asked what kind of material he had, the appellant stated that he had \u201c[pictures of girls under the age of 18, either by themselves or with somebody, partially nude, nude, performing [sexual] acts----\u201d Appellant explained to the military judge, in detail, how he knew that the girls depicted in these images were minors. Appellant stated that the girls in the pictures were physically underdeveloped, had no public hair, had either small breasts or no breasts, were small in stature when compared to adults in the pictures, and that the girls\u2019 faces were young looking. Appellant told the military judge that he acquired these images from, and traded similar images with, people he talked to in chat rooms where the topic of discussion was children engaged in sexual intercourse or other sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">The military judge then examined with appellant the fifty-five images retrieved from appellant\u2019s computer. Appellant told the military judge that these images contained \u201c[v]isual depictions of people under the age of 18 doing, either by themselves, or committing acts involving sex.\u201d The military judge individually discussed with appellant about a dozen of the pictures depicting the youngest girls. Again, appellant repeatedly and specifically explained to the military judge how he knew that the girls in each of these pictures were under eighteen based upon their physical underdevelopment, lack of pubic hair, small breasts or no breasts, and their young looking faces.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In several places appellant admitted that there was \u201cno doubt\u201d in his mind that some of these girls were under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>eighteen. Appellant\u2019s responses consistently and persuasively demonstrated his unequivocal belief that he intended to and did receive images created through the sexual exploitation of real children. Not a single response from appellant hinted or suggested that any of these images were computer-generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">A plea of guilty should not be set aside on appeal unless there is a \u201csubstantial basis in law and fact for questioning the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)). Our standard of review of a military judge\u2019s decision to accept an accused\u2019s guilty plea is abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>41 M.J. 446 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Had appellant pled not guilty and presented evidence that the images were computer-generated, the government may have had difficulty proving that real children were depicted in these images.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, we do not review the adequacy of the providence of a guilty plea on the basis of post-trial speculation as to the existence of facts that might invalidate an accused\u2019s plea, particularly when such speculation contradicts the express admissions by the accused. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>42 M.J. 443, 445 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">In our judgment, the record as a whole sufficiently established that appellant knowingly received, through interstate commerce,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> visual depictions of real children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. This was a guilty plea. An unconditional guilty plea waives any objection \u201cto the factual issue of guilt of the offense(s) to which the plea was made.\u201d R.C.M. 910(j). The theoretical possibility that a defense existed to this charge does not render appellant\u2019s plea improvident. <em>See United States v. Faircloth, </em>45 M.J. 172, 174 (1996); <em>United States v. Clark, </em>28 M.J. 401, 407 (C.M.A.1989). Appellant thoroughly explained why he believed that he had knowingly violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. Although he offered no evidence that real children were depicted in these pictures, independent of his analysis of the images themselves, his unequivocal belief that he had collected pictures of minors was sufficient to support his guilty plea. <em>See Smith, </em>47 M.J. at 591 (holding that appellant\u2019s \u201crepeated admissions to his belief and knowledge that the images displayed were of minors\u201d satisfied the requisite knowledge for a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) violation); <em>see also United States v. Maxwell, </em>45 M.J. 406, 424-25 (1996) (rejecting argument that actual knowledge of the minority of the individuals depicted is an essential element under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252); <em>United States v. Brantner, </em>54 M.J. 595, 602 (C.G.Ct.Crim.App.2000) (holding that all that is required <em>for </em>an accused to plead guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) is an admission by the accused to each element of the offense, or an indication that he believes each element is trae). Accordingly, we find that nothing appellant said or failed to say during his providence inquiry \u201cset[] up matter inconsistent with\u201d his plea of guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2). UCMJ art. 45(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other assignment of error and find it also to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">The court affirms only so much of the finding of guilty of the Specification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Charge IV as finds that appellant did at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, on or between 1 November 1997 and 31 March 1998, unlawfully and knowingly receive visual depictions that had been transported by computer, via the Internet, in interstate or foreign commerce, which said visual depictions, when produced, involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, and which said visual depictions are of such sexually explicit conduct, which is a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2252(a)(2), in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The remaining findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the error noted, the entire record, and the principles in <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A.1986), the court affirms the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Senior Judge TOOMEY and Judge HARVEY concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">. Appellant was convicted under Article 134, UCMJ (clause 3\u2014crimes and offenses not capital) of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">. As noted by appellate defense counsel, the effective date of the 1998 amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 was 30 October 1998, at least seven months after the date of appellant\u2019s receipt of these visual depictions. However, any error in specifying the date of the statute was harmless, insofar as no changes were made to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a) in the 1998 amendments to the statute that would affect this case. We will remedy this error in our decretal paragraphs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">. \"Child pornography\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-10\">[A]ny visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-15\">(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aec\">(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apd\">(C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXc\">(D) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMXa\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">. \"Visual depiction\u201d is defined to include any \"undeveloped film and videotape, and data stored on computer disk or by electronic means which is capable of conversion into a visual image.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">.
