It is not our function to reweigh evidence and determine guilt or innocence anew. In the case of legal sufficiency of the evidence, our standard of review is \u201cwhether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v.

[we are] bound to draw every reasonable inference from the evidence of record in favor of the prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 MJ 281, 284 (CMA 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\n<em>The Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The 90th Fighter Squadron deployed to Italy on October 4, 1995, with eight F-15E\u2019s and twelve 2-man crews. The mission was \u201cto maintain around the clock presence over [the] top of Bosnia.\u201d There had been \u201cmultiple air strikes\u201d on Bosnia the week prior to the 90th\u2019s arrival. The 90th was flying combat missions over Bosnia. Generally, they worked 6 days on and 2 days off. As the off-days rarely coincided with calendar weekends, the off-days were known as \u201cvirtual weekends,\u201d comprised of \u201cvirtual Saturdays\u201d and \u201cvirtual Sundays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Appellant first met lLt Clemm at an Officers\u2019 Club in Korea, in April or May 1995, while the 90th was in Korea on temporary duty. She was interested in a position in his squadron, and he approved her application. lLt Clemm arrived at Elmendorf AFB about the time the squadron was deploying to Italy. She joined the squadron in Italy on November 18, 1995, about a month and a half into the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Captain (Cpt) Laurie Lovrak also met lLt Clemm in Korea in about May 1995. Cpt Lovrak became lLt Clemm\u2019s sponsor, in effect, as she processed into the squadron, and Cpt Lovrak preceded lLt Clemm to Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">In Italy, Cpt Lovrak briefed lLt Clemm, among other things, on who was who in the squadron and who to watch out for. As Cpt Lovrak explained in her testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">Basically, I was pointing out for her individuals. For example, happily married aircrews on whom she could rely for professional, platonic support. Also pointing out to her members that might have ulteri- or motives in seeking a close friendship with her. I was concerned for her welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Cpt Lovrak warned lLt Clemm against hanging around and drinking with the aircrews. As she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-14\">I talked about my experiences in the fighter squadrons and tried to point out to her that the aircrews who drink together are perceived as, you know, the good old boys, but we\u2019re females in Ops [Operations], and when we join them, we look like promiscuous lushes and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re viewed, especially if we\u2019re returning the flirtations. There is a double standard that is unfortunate, but I said don\u2019t allow yourself to get in that position, you\u2019re walking a dangerous line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">Cpt Lovrak knew in Korea that lLt Clemm was married. Apparently lLt Clemm\u2019s marriage was failing, although no action had been taken to institute divorce proceedings. In Italy, lLt Clemm held herself out as single.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">November 21, 1995 \u2014 three days after lLt Clemm arrived in country \u2014 was a virtual Saturday, and a Thanksgiving party was organized for the entire squadron. The party was held at a hotel near Caorle, Italy, well to the south of Aviano AB on the Adriatic coast. This was the hotel in which the enlisted members of the squadron were quartered, and in which the officers had been quartered until just previously. At the time of the party, the officers were newly quartered in a hotel in the town of Pordenone, about - an hour to an hour and a half by car from Caorle, and much nearer to the air base.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">After dinner, a large number of the enlisted personnel went down to the beach for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>bonfire, but some of the officers and enlisted people remained behind in the hotel bar. It was at this point that numerous members of the squadron began to notice behavior that caused concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Cpt Lovrak noticed that, at dinner, lLt Clemm had been drinking \u201cexcessively, and at the bar she continued to drink excessively.\u201d This surprised Cpt Lovrak, \u201cbased on our previous \u2014 my previous observations and our conversations.\u201d lLt Clemm \u201cbecame very physically flirtatious with aircrews at the bar, particularly Major (Maj) Cloutier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both of them were behind the bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Cpt Lovrak painted the scene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">She [lLt Clemm] had, at this point, removed her outer sweater and Major\u2014 there was probably room just barely for two people to stand behind the bar, between the bar and the back mirrors. She \u2014 Major Cloutier was in back of her. She stood with sometimes a drink in each hand or a drink in one hand, a cigarette in the other, or a cigarette in each hand, and pushed back against him, pressed against him, turned around and had her hands all over his chest. Major Cloutier was making it apparent, I mean, very blatant attempts to sidestep her and get around her, but she would find her way to that very same position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Cpt Lovrak declined to join the party at the bonfire. As she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">The situation was beginning to deteriorate. It was obvious that people were growing very disgusted with what was going on at the bar, including enlisted personnel that were still standing around. Major Moore and I attempted to get Lieutenant Clemm to come back to the hotel with us and she didn\u2019t want to, so I left with Major Mo\u00f3re.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">At some point, Maj Cloutier noticed that lLt Clemm was behind the bar with appellant mixing drinks. Maj Cloutier testified that \u201c[t]hey were standing in very close proximity to one another.\u201d Maj Cloutier \u201cstayed there to monitor the situation. It was an uncomfortable situation for me, because there were still several maintenance [enlisted] individuals present, as well as some of my officers.\u201d Maj Cloutier was not alone in this concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Eventually, the remaining contingent at the bar began to trickle down to the beach. Maj Hume<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had previously noticed that appellant and lLt Clemm \u201chad struck up a rapport during dinner, is the best way to describe it.\u201d At the beach, he noticed that \u201cthey came down to the bonfire together, significantly later than most everyone else____ They were engaging people in conversation like they were a couple together at a social function, side-by-side, you know, talking to different people in groups and that sort of thing.\u201d Hume testified that \u201c[t]he discussion at the bonfire was that the boss was drunk and we didn\u2019t really want him to, you know, pickup on the Lieutenant and make a mistake there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">When Cpt Lange<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> noticed appellant and lLt Clemm at the bonfire, he noticed that appellant \u201chad his arm around Lieutenant Clemm\u2019s waist.\u201d \u201c[H]e had his arm down around her lower waist and their bodies were, you know, they were hip-to-hip.\u201d Cpt Lange \u201cfelt like there was a relationship being developed there that was inappropriate,\u201d in that appellant was the commander and she a subordinate. A number of the officers were discussing the situation, and Cpt Lange hastened to offer lLt Clemm his coat, saying, \u201cLieutenant, you must be cold. Here, take my coat.\u201d Appellant declined it, and they moved closer to the fire. Cpt Lange was especially concerned because there were about 20-25 enlisted personnel at the bonfire. \u25a0 -</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Maj Durtschi<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Cpt Morgan<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> both saw appellant with his arm around lLt Clemm\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>waist at the bonfire. Cpt Morgan saw them \u201ccoming out of the darkness.\u201d It struck him \u201cthat they were walking very close to each other, together, bodies touching pretty much all the way down, and [appellant] had his hand tightly around her waist.\u201d Cpt Morgan was talking to Cpt Hughes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at the time and exclaimed, \u201cHey, look at that.\u201d Cpt Morgan and Cpt Hughes discussed which \u201cone of us was going to have to tell [appellant] to stop doing this in front of the enlisted troops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Cpt Hughes, being a flight commander, was elected. He approached appellant and pulled him away from lLt Clemm on the pretext of needing to talk to him about an operational matter. Appellant was reluctant to separate and asked Cpt Hughes if it \u201ccould wait.\u201d Cpt Hughes replied, \u201cNo, sir, I need to talk to you about it now.\u201d Cpt Hughes kept appellant away from lLt Clemm for about 20 or 30 minutes. As they were finishing the discussion, Cpt Hughes told appellant, \u201cSir, I think you should kind of keep your distance from Lieutenant Clemm around here, several of the guys have noticed.\u201d Appellant acknowledged, in his testimony, that Cpt Hughes had warned him on that occasion that \u201c[t]hat girl is bad news.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Eventually, the bonfire broke up and the officers prepared to return to their quarters at Pordenone. There were nine officers remaining, and two small vehicles. Appellant climbed into the rear seat of his car with lLt Clemm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To Maj Cloutier\u2019s knowledge, appellant had never sat in the back of his own vehicle before. Cpt Lange was sufficiently concerned about what he had seen that he tried to get into the back seat and get between the two of them. But Maj Cloutier, who undertook to drive, dissuaded him, saying that he would \u201chandle the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Back at the Park Hotel in Pordenone, a group of officers gathered in Maj Cloutier\u2019s room on the second floor. The first to arrive was lLt Clemm, whose room was directly across the hall. She wanted to smoke a cigarette with Maj Cloutier. Minutes later, they were joined by Majs Durtschi and Hume and Cpts Morgan and Lange.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">When Cpt Hughes got back to the hotel, he rode up on the elevator with appellant. Cpt Hughes and appellant were the only members of the squadron billeted on the fourth floor of the hotel. After the third floor, Cpt Hughes and appellant were the only people on the elevator. Once they were alone, Cpt Hughes reiterated his earlier warning to appellant. He told him, \u201cSir, you know I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019d just kind of go into your bed and not hang around Lieutenant Clemm anymore.\u201d Appellant responded, \u2018Yeah, but she would look really good with my dick in her mouth.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cpt Hughes advised him once more against seeing her. Then he made sure that appellant went into his room and closed the door. Finally, Cpt Hughes went into his room and went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">About that time, Maj Durtschi was in the hall outside Maj Cloutier\u2019s room on the second floor. He heard lLt Clemm\u2019s phone ring and saw her go into her room to answer it. Maj Durtschi heard lLt Clemm say into the phone, \u2018Yes, you can come down, there are other guys here and we\u2019re in [Maj Cloutier\u2019s] room.\u201d Moments after that conversation, appellant appeared with a bottle of wine and two glasses. He nodded to everyone, sat down with lLt Clemm, and poured a glass of wine for the lieutenant and one for himself. Appellant and lLt Clemm stayed in the room for 30-45 minutes and then left, one after the other. The remaining officers commenced discussing, for about an hour, the problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>that was becoming apparent to them that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The virtual weekend of November 21-22 marked a change in the life of the 90th Fighter Squadron. Thereafter, many officers began noticing that appellant and lLt Clemm were spending a great deal of off-duty time together. Maj Hume testified that, after that weekend, \u201c[tjhey spent time together, riding to and from work, and going to the gym, that sort of thing.\u201d Maj Hume saw them drive to work together \u201cmaybe five or six times,\u201d and he saw them leave to go to the gym \u201ctwo or three times.\u201d Maj Hume noted that the previous Intel Officer, a male, did not ride to work with the commander.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Cpt Morgan saw them together on \u201cnumerous occasions, on a pretty much daily basis.\u201d This included \u201c[rjiding in the same car to work quite a bit, apparently going to the gym to workout, going to lunch, dinner, et cetera. Just on a fairly regular basis.\u201d To Cpt Morgan, the quantum of their togetherness seemed \u201cimproper ... or unusual.\u201d Other officers noted similar sightings.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Maj Moore<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> described himself as a born-again Christian, a fact purportedly well known in the squadron. He once observed a degree of physical contact between appellant and lLt Clemm in the gym, in which appellant was apparently helping the lieutenant with chin-ups, that Maj Moore thought was compromising and made him feel uncomfortable. So much so, that he \u201ctried to walk back into the room and make a joke of it to kind of break the tension, because it was uncomfortable for me, and I was in another room.\u201d Maj Moore also noticed that appellant \u201cwasn\u2019t as available as he normally was,\u201d that occasionally he was \u201chard to find.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Maj Cloutier, the second in command, noticed the difference acutely. He had been \u201cjoined at the hip\u201d with his boss up until the Thanksgiving party. After that, he was \u201cfiltered out of the picture.\u201d Whereas before the party, Maj Cloutier rode back and forth to work with appellant, after the party, Maj Cloutier \u201cgot to drive home with other people.\u201d In the week after the Thanksgiving party, Maj Cloutier was approached by several of his officers \u201cindicating ... that they thought there was a problem occurring between Lieutenant Clemm and [appellant].\u201d Maj Cloutier was trying \u201cto quell the situation,\u201d and saw that his \u201cresponsibility is to first take care of my boss.\u201d He hoped that the Thanksgiving situation was simply a result of too much alcohol, and that it was \u201cjust a minor occurrence at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">The next virtual weekend was November 29-30. As it happened, on the afternoon of the 28th, an EA6 \u201ctook the barrier\u201d at Aviano and closed down the base. Two of the 90th\u2019s planes returning from sorties with \u201clive ordnance\u201d were diverted to a nearby, non-U.S.-operated base. Appellant assigned Majs Cloutier and Moore to work the weekend and to manage the return of the aircraft. Appellant wanted a maintenance crew to fly to the other base to check the planes before they took off, but weather prevented the helicopters from flying and kept the maintenance crew at Aviano on the 29th. It was not until the 30th that the planes were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">On the morning of the 29th, a virtual Saturday, Maj Durtschi was off duty, walking in the city of Pordenone. Appellant and lLt Clemm, in civilian clothes, were driving alone in a vehicle and they \u201cstopped [Maj Durtschi] on the sidewalk.\u201d According to Maj Durtschi, the three of them \u201chad a little chat, and they said they were going to the base to do errands.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">At some point that day, Maj Cloutier called appellant on his cell phone to update him on the progress of recovering the two planes. Appellant indicated on the phone that \u201cwe are in Maniago knife shopping.\u201d Maj Clouti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>er did not ask who \u201cwe\u201d was.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Maj Moore also talked to appellant on the phone and confirmed that appellant had said he was in Maniago.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Later that day, in the early evening, Maj Cloutier called appellant back as it was beginning to be clear that they would not be able to get their planes back that day. This time, appellant said that \u201cwe are now up in the mountains in a bar.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Again, Maj Cloutier did not inquire who \u201cwe\u201d was.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">When Maj Cloutier returned to the hotel that night, he knocked loudly on lLt Clemm\u2019s door. She did not respond. He repeated this the next morning when he was heading back to base to try to recover the planes. Again, she did not answer. Maj Cloutier did not see lLt Clemm or appellant around the squadron or the hotel that entire virtual weekend.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On the virtual Sunday of that weekend, Majs Cloutier and Moore were again back at base working on recovering the aircraft. Maj Cloutier again called appellant to apprise him of the situation. First, he called appellant\u2019s hotel room and got no answer. Then he tried appellant\u2019s cell phone and reached him, at about 9 a.m. Appellant said that \u201cit was such a beautiful day, that we decided to drive back up into the mountains again.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On another occasion, identified only as occurring in \u201cearly December,\u201d Maj Hume had evening duty and called appellant on his cell phone regarding a maintenance matter. After the necessary discussion was concluded, appellant said, \u201cHummer, I\u2019m up here in the mountains. I\u2019m over an hour away from base, and I\u2019m looking at the stars with a beautiful woman and it\u2019s great.\u201d Maj Hume noted that appellant \u201csounded pretty happy-\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">By early December, rumors were rampant among the aircrews, and the morale of many was plummeting. Maj Hume testified that \u201cthe rumor mill was just out of control as far as, you know, \u2018Have you seen them together?\u2019 \u2018What have they been doing together,\u2019 that sort of thing. I mean it was the talk of the town.\u201d Maj Hume added: \u201cMy observations were that people were going to [appellant] trying to tell him to knock off the alleged affair, and that they weren\u2019t well received.\u201d Cpt Lange testified: \u201cIt surprised me that he would do something like this that could have such an effect on his career. It really generated a lack of trust in him, which I felt lowered morale in the squadron.\u201d Cpt Morgan testified: \u201cI\u2019ll say how I personally felt that the morale went downhill. There\u2019s a large trust factor that\u2019s associated with a commander and those that follow on. And I felt that trust had been violated____\u201d Cpt Hughes testified that morale \u201cwas at an all time low. I\u2019d never\u2014 actually, I haven\u2019t been in that many squadrons, but I\u2019d never seen a squadron, you know, that disbursed [sic], especially when you have a mission like we had over there to do.\u201d Maj<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Grahn characterized the morale as \u201cdefinitely going downhill fast.\u201d It bothered him because, \u201cwe were in a combat situation and if guys were not paying attention to what they were doing, somebody is going to get hurt pretty quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">In addition to being concerned about what appellant was doing to his career, the officers knew that the aircrews were talking to their wives back at Elmendorf, and that the matter could not long be contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>December 4 did not fall on a virtual weekend, but that was the day word was received in the squadron that appellant had been selected for Colonel (O-6). Appellant was flying that night, so Maj Cloutier organized the usual fighter pilot sort of reception. As he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">I arranged for a fire truck to meet him. We were going to douse him down when he got out of the airplane. On his arrival, I had everybody stand at \u2014 the entire maintenance organization, plus the officers, standing at attention. I had the \u2014 it was dark out, so we had the big lights set up with the fire truck right there. As the aircraft pulled in, his aircraft pulled in, everybody went to attention and gave him a salute as he came in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Champagne followed the dousing.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Walking back to the squadron area, Maj Hume asked appellant, \u201cSir, are you doing Lieutenant Clemm?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cNo, Hummer, I\u2019m not doing her.\u201d But Maj Hume testified that \u201che looked away from me and looked down with \u2014 the best way that I can describe it is a shit-eating grin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The promotion celebration picked up again later at an establishment near the officers\u2019 hotel. On the way back to the hotel after the party, the first of the car-walking incidents occurred. <em>See </em>n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Back at the hotel, the officers continued to try to protect their commander. As Cpt Hughes explained it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">[I]t was Captain Grahn that was \u2014 we just didn\u2019t really assign anybody, he just said \u201cI\u2019m going to take [appellant] back to his room.\u201d And Major Cloutier said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure Lieutenant Clemm gets back to her room,\u201d because the impression was throughout the squadron that there was something going on between the two of them. We were going to make sure that they got back to their rooms that night.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Up in appellant\u2019s room at about 2:30-3:00 a.m., Cpt Grahn brought up the subject of appellant\u2019s relationship with lLt Clemm. Appellant asked Cpt Grahn if he thought he was sleeping with her. Cpt Grahn replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8P\">I said it really didn\u2019t matter what I thought. I replied that my impression was that he was sleeping with her, and the impression was \u2014 really what I was trying to get across to him, was the important thing, that these days we\u2019ve had a few commanders that \u2014 I said we had a few commanders that had been court-martialed or whatever, for inappropriate behavior, inappropriate contacts, and I wanted to make sure he knew that I thought this situation was inappropriate. I just wanted to let him know, so he\u2019d know that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">Asked what appellant\u2019s response was to his concerns about the relationship, Cpt Grahn testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-16\">He never really told me that it was appropriate or inappropriate, or that he was sleeping with her or he wasn\u2019t sleeping with her. It was more of a, you know, kind of treating me like a mother hen, kind of attitude.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">At about that point, appellant\u2019s phone rang; it was lLt Clemm. Appellant told her, \u201cNo, Cubes [Cpt Grahn] is here giving me massive shit,\u201d and he ended the conversation quickly. After they hung up, Cpt Grahn pointed out to appellant that that was an example of what he was talking about, \u201ca Lieutenant calling an 0-6 in his room at three o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d Appellant brushed him off.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">Meanwhile, that night, a group of officers had gathered in Cpt Walgren\u2019s room. Maj Cloutier was summoned, and the conversation ranged from training issues and topics of the day to appellant\u2019s relationship with lLt Clemm. The decision was made to bring appellant into the conversation. The officers felt that they needed to take care of their boss, that things had gone far enough and they needed to confront him directly. When appellant arrived, they confronted him with their perceptions. Appellant reacted angrily and defensively. The officers were shocked at his response, and he ultimately walked out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>on the conversation. Relations between appellant and those officers became exceedingly chilly from that point on.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The next day, December 5, brought two events of consequence. First, Maj Durtschi rotated back to Elmendorf. There he was confronted by Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) Donisi, who asked him \u201cwho had hooked up with Lieutenant Clemm.\u201d Maj Durtschi \u201cdidn\u2019t answer right away,\u201d but ultimately he revealed that it was appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Second, concluding that confronting appellant had been fruitless, Maj Cloutier decided to try to confront the other party, lLt Clemm. He testified that, in a 5-minute conversation, he warned her about the perceptions that had arisen. lLt Clemm promptly told appellant that Maj Cloutier had accused her of having an affair with appellant. Appellant was not happy that Maj Cloutier had confronted lLt Clemm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">By December 6, relations between appellant and Maj Cloutier were exceedingly icy. That evening after dinner, the two of them had it out. Appellant announced that he was not pleased with \u201cany of the individuals that confronted me about this situation,\u201d and that he was going \u201cto make a few changes in this squadron.\u201d Maj Cloutier reviewed the bidding; he explained \u201cwhy the perceptions are developing, what his actions were that generated such things, and that we were trying nothing more than to protect him.\u201d Apparently, the conversation was lengthy and vehement, on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Ultimately, Maj Cloutier felt he had begun to get through to appellant, and the two of them \u201csettled back down from what was a very tense situation, to more of a comfortable situation.\u201d The conversation became \u201cjust a frank discussion.\u201d Eventually, appellant handed Maj Cloutier a poker chip with the squadron\u2019s emblem (the \u201cPair-O-Dice\u201d) on it. Appellant said to Maj Cloutier, \u201cHere, cash this in in five years, and I\u2019ll tell you all about the relationship between the two of us [1Lt Clemm and himself].\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Relations between Maj Cloutier and appellant did not improve, however. Maj Cloutier and others had additional confrontations -with appellant about the continuing relationship, and there was an additional car-walking incident. Generally, appellant would not even talk to Maj Cloutier, his second in command.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Maj Cloutier was \u201cvery dejected\u201d that he \u201ccould not get through\u201d to appellant. The situation was \u201ceating [Maj Cloutier] up,\u201d because he felt that \u201c[he was] the one that [was] responsible for taking care of the situation, and [he was] not able to resolve the situation.\u201d Early in the morning of December 15, after the second car-walking incident had occurred, Maj Cloutier called LtCol Donisi at Elmendorf. He told LtCol Donisi that he could no longer work for appellant, and he asked LtCol Donisi to help him find a new job.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">After concluding the phone call, at about 5:30-6:00 a.m., Maj Cloutier, in uniform, stepped out of his room into the hall of the hotel to go to work. He noticed that 1Lt Clemm\u2019s door across the hall was ajar and that her room key was lying on the floor. Knocking and looking into the room, he saw that the bed appeared not to have been slept in. Backing out of the room, he saw lLt Clemm coming down the hall toward him. As he testified: \u201cShe is in civilian attire, in her socks, with jeans and a T-shirt, and her hair is still a mess, like she has just gotten up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Caught red-handed sneaking back to her room, lLt Clemm confessed to Maj Cloutier that she was having an affair with appellant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> She expressed remorse about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>relationship, mentioning that she had recently seen the officers\u2019 wives\u2019 newsletter and read the portion written by appellant\u2019s wife; and \u201cshe had felt badly about that.\u201d She pledged to Maj Cloutier that she would talk to appellant about ending the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It was not until the next evening, December 16, that Maj Cloutier had a chance to talk to lLt Clemm. As Maj Cloutier testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">I inquired, I said, \u201cWell, how did it go?\u201d I said, \u201cDid you have an opportunity to speak with [appellant] today?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, how did it go?\u201d She said, \u2018Well, not too well.\u201d She said, \u201cI went up there last night to talk to him about it, and I ended up sleeping with him again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Maj Cloutier said, \u201cJulie, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d 1Lt Clemm responded, \u201cWell, when I was leaving this morning, I told him that this should ... we probably need to knock this off.\u201d However, she related that appellant replied to her that he was \u201cnot willing to make the commitment not to have the relationship anymore.\u201d lLt Clemm also indicated that she was changing hotel rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The next morning, December 17, Maj Cloutier discovered that 1Lt Clemm had moved up to the fourth floor, next door to appellant\u2019s room. 1Lt Clemm had not coordinated the move with the squadron-billeting officer; rather, she made her own arrangements through the hotel staff. lLt Clemm would have been well aware that Cpt Reesman, one of the pilots, was also the billeting officer and that he made the room assignment for the squadron, because she assisted Cpt Reesman in that capacity when the officers moved into the hotel.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Also on December 17, Cpt Hughes made another effort with his friend, appellant. As Cpt Hughes explained the situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao4\">Things were obviously not going well in the squadron. Here we were. The United Nations troops were just coming into Bosnia. The feeling at the time was that things could flare up over the air responsibility at any time. And there was a definite lack of focus on the part of most \u2014 I\u2019d say all the aircrew, in dealing with the threat that was perceived out there. That was directly related to what was going on or perceived to be going on, between the Commander and the Intelligence Officer [lLt Clemm].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">Cpt Hughes continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">Eventually we [Cpt Hughes and appellant] went to the gym and we ended up back in his room. It was eight thirty or nine. Went up to have a couple of beers and talk about it. I approached the subject with him, by saying that I was worried about his career, which I definitely was. I was worried about him as, you know, his subordinate, and also as a friend, and I was worried about the squadron and what was going to happen to us, if this continued. So, that\u2019s how I approached the subject with him. We talked \u2014 talked about various things for two to three hours. Two thirds of it was about what was going on in the squadron. He never said that he had been sleeping with Lieutenant Clemm. He never said that he hadn\u2019t been sleeping with her. He asked me what he thought I should do [sic] \u2014 he asked me what I would do if I were him, to try to correct the situation. And I told him that I think \u2014 I told him I think Major Cloutier\u2019s heart is in the right place, that he has the best interest of the squadron in mind, that those two should get together, talk about this as Commander and DO, figure out how to deal with the situation, and then deal with it. Probably it would involve either [appellant] or Lieutenant Clemm going back to Alaska. And once that\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>they\u2019re apart, then everything would probably defuse and we\u2019d go about our business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Asked how appellant responded to the suggestion that one of them go back to Alaska, Cpt Hughes testified: \u201cNot very well. He didn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t like that option at all.\u201d Instead, appellant blamed the entire situation on Maj Cloutier\u2019s manipulations and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">For Maj Cloutier, lLt Clemm\u2019s move to the fourth floor was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. With appellant and lLt Clemm \u201cnow rooming side-by-side with one another,\u201d Maj Cloutier felt \u201cthat it\u2019s going to break loose,\u201d that he himself \u201cwill receive retribution for not doing [his] job of reporting it.\u201d Maj Cloutier called a meeting of the officers \u201cclosest associated with what was going on, because during this entire time, we had tried to keep it very, very quiet.\u201d Maj Cloutier told the officers that he was \u201ccompletely out of ideas on how to handle this situation, and that [he] was considering going forward with the allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">At the conclusion of the meeting, Maj Cloutier decided to go forward with the allegations. He contacted the appropriate higher authorities, and on December 18, presented the information in his possession. Appellant was relieved of his command on December 19, 1995, pending an investigation into allegations of engaging in \u201can unprofessional relationship.\u201d But the saga does not end here.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Maj Moore was detailed to assist appellant in moving out of the hotel immediately, and to escort him on the plane to Elmendorf. Maj Moore described the conversation on the airplane:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">He offered bits and pieces of information. Some of it was that she [lLt Clemm] had some affairs or something in the past. The conversations were broken because he was, you know, under a lot of thought. He said that she\u2019d had an affair with Klute[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] at one point, it was \u2014 Major Cloutier, excuse me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">Asked whether appellant had said anything regarding the squadron, Maj Moore continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-13\">Well, he did make a comment that kind of \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say it alarmed me, but he said he didn\u2019t know how deep he and Donna would have to go to right this or to\u2014 how deep he would have [to] dig into the squadron affairs. Something about this may be \u201cme and Julie against the whole Air Force by the time it\u2019s all over.\u201d He told me the results would be earth-shattering.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">Cpt Lovrak had departed Italy on December 2 and returned to Elmendorf. She was called back to Italy to escort 1Lt Clemm back to Elmendorf. After they arrived back in Alaska, lLt Clemm called Cpt Lovrak \u201cabout ten to 12 times. She initiated the phone calls.\u201d According to Cpt Lovrak, lLt Clemm</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">often called late at night, but the one occasion she called me very late, and very distraught____ She was crying____ She talked about the, you know, the sort of\u2014 some of the legal issues that were pending, without being very specific. Talked about her arguments with her parents, and was very quiet for a moment. Then she blurted \u2014 she blurted out, \u201cYou warned me about Major Cloutier, but you didn\u2019t warn me about [appellant].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-18\">Regarding the reference to appellant, Cpt Lovrak testified, \u201cIt was \u2014 boy, it was one of those statements that is so pregnant with meaning.\u201d Cpt Lovrak did not follow up and pursue the statement, however, because she had been advised by the Legal Office \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>make a wide berth around any specifies regarding this case.\u201d She had been instructed not to ask questions, but to \u201cchange the subject\u201d and \u201cmove on,\u201d and she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Regarding the reference to Maj Cloutier, Cpt Lovrak clarified that she had not, in fact, warned lLt Clemm about him. She told lLt Clemm that \u201cMajor Cloutier loves to party and loves women, but I never cautioned her, you know, that he would come on to her. I would never have expected him to come on to Lieutenant Clemm, and she never gave me any indication that he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Issue I</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\n<em>Was the Specification Vague?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Appellant contends that the specification of Charge II, alleging conduct unbecoming an officer, was vague in that it \u201cfailed to identify a relevant custom or regulation which prohibits relationships between officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In its entirety, Article 133, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 933, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGn\">Thus, by its terms, Article 133 contains no requirement of proof of violation of a service regulation or custom. Reference to para. 59, Part IV, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.)(conduct unbecoming an officer), in effect at the time of the underlying conduct at bar, produces a similar conclusion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Indeed, in the instant case, the specification of Charge II did not allege that appellant had violated a service regulation or custom. It alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">In that LIEUTENANT COLONEL SHELLEY S. ROGERS, United States Ah\u2019 Force, 90th Fighter Squadron, at or near Pordenone, Italy, did, between on or about 20 November 1995 and on or about 18 December 1995, wrongfully and willfully develop an unprofessional relationship of inappropriate familiarity with First Lieutenant Julie Clemm, a subordinate under his command, which conduct under the circumstances was unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">Tailoring his instructions on the elements to the allegations, the military judge instructed the members as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-17\">In the Specification of Charge II, the accused is charged with the offense of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. In order to find the accused guilty of this offense, you must be convinced by legal and competent evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-18\">One, between on or about 20 November 1995 and 18 December 1995, at or near Pordenone, Italy, the accused wrongfully and willfully developed an unprofessional relationship of inappropriate familiarity with First Lieutenant Julie Clemm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-19\">Second, First Lieutenant Julie Clemm was a subordinate under the command of the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-20\">And third, under the circumstances, the accused[\u2019s] conduct [was] unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">Further, the military judge defined certain key terms and phrases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-22\">\u201cConduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman\u201d means behavior in an official capacity, which in dishonoring or disgracing the individual as a commissioned officer, seriously distracts or detracts from his character as a gentleman, or behavior in an unofficial or private capacity, which in dishonoring or disgracing the individual personally, seriously detracts from his standing as a commissioned officer. \u201cUnbecoming conduct\u201d means behavior more serious than slight, and of a material and pronounced character. It means con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>duct morally unfitting and unworthy, rather than merely inappropriate or unsuitable, misbehavior which is more than opposed to good taste or propriety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201cUnprofessional relationships\u201d are those personal relationships between officers, which result in inappropriate familiarity or create the appearance of favoritism, preferential treatment, or impropriety. Unprofessional relationships create the appearance that personal friendships and preferences are more important than individual performance and contribution to the mission. The term \u201cunprofessional relationships\u201d refers not to any one specific occurrence, but to the totality of the circumstances. Not all contact or association between and [sic] a superior officer and a subordinate officer is an offense. Whether the contact or association in question is an offense, depends upon the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 752, 757-58, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), Article 133 survived a claim that it was \u201c Void for vagueness\u2019 under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and over-broad in violation of the First Amendment.\u201d The Supreme Court noted that our Court and other military courts had \u201cnarrowed the very broad reach of the literal language of the articles [Arts. 133 and 134], and at the same time ha[d] supplied considerable specificity by way of examples of the conduct which they cover.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547. The Court cited approvingly our invocation of Colonel Winthrop\u2019s venerable observation on conduct unbecoming an officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">To constitute therefore the conduct here denounced, the act which forms the basis of the charge must have a double significance and effect. Though it need not amount to a crime, it must offend so seriously against law, justice, morality or decorum as to expose to disgrace, socially or as a man, the offender, and at the same time must be of such a nature or committed under such circumstances as to bring dishonor or disrepute upon the military profession which he represents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">William Winthrop, <em>Military Law and Precedents </em>711-12 (2d ed.1920 Reprint); <em>see </em>417 U.S. at 753-54, 94 S.Ct. 2547.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The Supreme Court acknowledged, however, that \u201c[i]t would be idle to pretend that there are not areas within the general confines of the articles\u2019 language which have been left vague despite these narrowing constructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547. Where \u201careas of uncertainty as to the coverage of the articles ... remained],\u201d the Court added that <em>\u201cfurther content may be supplied ... by less fomalized custom and usage.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Nothing in the opinion intimated that proof of a custom or usage was a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">On the other hand, the Supreme Court noted \u201cthere is a substantial range of conduct to which both articles clearly apply without vagueness or imprecision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the Court made it clear that an officer charged with an Article 133 offense must have fan-notice that his or her conduct was punishable. 417 U.S. at 755-57, 94 S.Ct. 2547. Although there have been occasional hints by some judges of our Court that proof of a service custom or regulation may be a requirement of Article 133 prosecutions generally, <em>e.g., United States v. Kroop, </em>38 MJ 470, 473 (CMA 1993), that view, as then-Chief Judge Sullivan noted, \u201chas not commanded a majority of this Court,\u201d with the possible exception of officer-enlisted \u201cfraternization\u201d cases charged under Article 133, instead of Article 134. <em>United States v. Boyett, </em>42 MJ 150, 159 (1995)(Sullivan, C.J., concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">In the instant case, there is no question that appellant was on notice of what sorts of relationships were impermissible. Albeit it was an apparently nonpunitive regulation, an Air Force Instruction in effect at the time of the charged conduct proscribed, and gave examples of, unprofessional relationships. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">Relationships in the Same Chain of Command, the Same Unit, or a Closely Related Unit. Personal relationships between members of different grades or positions within an organization or chain of command can easily become unprofessional. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Dating </em>and indebtedness commonly get out of hand because they appear to create favoritism or partiality. Consequently, <em>senior members should not date </em>or become personally obligated or indebted to <em>junior members. </em>This is also because seniors have, or are perceived to have, authority to influence the junior member\u2019s career.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Paragraph A1.3.1., AFI 36-2909 (20 Feb. 1995)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Further, as commander, appellant had occasion to both discuss and apply the standards relating to personal relationships. Cpt Lovrak testified that she and appellant had had \u201cseveral\u201d professional discussions on the subject, even before the deployment to Italy, particularly concerning a relationship that involved a senior noncommissioned officer. Appellant acknowledged in his testimony having \u201cmany discussions of professionalism\u201d with Cpt Lovrak, \u201ceach one may have been related to another act or incident.\u201d Appellant also had to deal with at least one relationship matter in Italy, involving enlisted members within 1Lt Clemm\u2019s intelligence section.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In sum, the granted issue asks whether the specification was unconstitutionally vague in failing to allege violation of a regulation or custom of the service which forbade a relationship such as his and 1Lt Clemm\u2019s. The Constitution, however, does not require that a regulation or custom of the service be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Obviously, there will be many gradations of relationships and associations between servicemembers that will not put the parties fairly on notice that the conduct might be inappropriate. However, as the Supreme Court suggested in <em>Parker v. Levy, supra, </em>there is certain conduct to which Article 133 \u201cclearly applies] without vagueness or imprecision.\u201d 417 U.S. at 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547. Under the circumstances of this case, we are satisfied that appellant\u2019s conduct falls into this latter category. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>34 MJ 194 (CMA 1992). Any officer would be on notice that this type of behavior was punishable. We hold that the granted issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Issue II</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">\n<em>Failure of Specification to Identify Acts Which Constituted the Unprofessional Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">Appellant\u2019s misperception of this issue represents more than a matter of mere semantics. The conduct appellant was charged with was \u201cwrongfully and willfully develop[ing] an unprofessional relationship of inappropriate familiarity.\u201d The \u201cacts\u201d appellant refers to did not \u201cconstitute\u201d the relationship, they evidenced it.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">In regard to the evidence of the \u201cacts\u201d that was to be proffered at trial, appellant was well on notice. A Bill of Particulars, produced <em>in limine </em>by the prosecution, outlined the core events and evidentiary matters the Government intended to introduce. Although necessarily abbreviated, the fullness of their significance could hardly have failed to resonate in that the defense had previously been provided a copy of the 4-volume Article 32, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 832, Investigating Officer\u2019s Report. This document contained both the sworn pretrial statements and the summarized or verbatim testimony of all of the Government\u2019s significant witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">Taken in conjunction with the Bill of Particulars, the Government had disclosed, in essence, all of the evidence it possessed in order to prove the nature of the relationship. This granted issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">Issue III</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">\n<em>Legal Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">As previously indicated, it is not our function to reweigh evidence and determine guilt or innocence anew. Rather, our responsibility is to ascertain whether the finder of fact had a legally sufficient basis to reach the conclusion it did. Indeed, as pertained to virtually every evidentiary matter presented by the prosecution, the defense either denied the act or statement, or presented it with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>different content and meaning. The court members,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> however, apparently found the credibility of appellant and 1Lt Clemm to be insufficient even to raise a reasonable doubt as to guilt. We, in turn, are satisfied that the evidence presented by the prosecution was enough that \u201ca reasonable factfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, supra; Jackson v. Virginia, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-13\">.

Similarly, a charge of violating a lawful regulation under Article 92, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 892, requires proof of a violation of a \"punitive\u201d regulation. <em>See United States v.

Long ago, in. my separate opinion in <em>United States v. Boyett, </em>42 MJ 150, 160-61 (1995) (Sullivan, J., concurring in the result), I concluded that a custom or regulation was not constitutionally required for a valid prosecution under Article 133, UCMJ. I said:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">FAIR NOTICE THAT CONDUCT VIOLATED ARTICLE 133</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">47. The second issue in this case is whether appellant was provided fair notice that his conduct was a crime under Article 133. Clearly, <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>[417 U.S.] at 755-57, 94 S.Ct. at 2561-62, provides that at least constructive notice of the criminality of a servicemember\u2019s conduct is required by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Such notice can be shown by proof of an authoritative court decision including such conduct as punishable under Article 133; a provision of the Manual for Courts-Martial explaining conduct as a violation of Article 133; or a custom of the service prohibiting such conduct <em>or any other circumstance which would establish that a servicemember would have no reasonable doubt that his conduct was unbecoming an officer. Id. </em>In <em>United States v. Johanns, </em>20 MJ at 161, this Court simply held that Captain Johanns in 1982 did not have adequate notice from any of the above sources or anywhere else that his conduct was proscribed under Article 133.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Those circumstances exist in this case, where appellant\u2019s conduct with a female subordinate officer clearly undermined his status as head of his squadron. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>34 MJ 194 (CMA 1992) (officer undermined his ability to lead by open and overly familiar relationship with enlisted man\u2019s wife). An obvious leadership failure existed in this case, which was not only observed by subordinates but was expressly called to appellant\u2019s attention by them. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s prosecution for this Article 133, UCMJ, offense was constitutionally proper.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b436-13\">EFFRON, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ADC\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">For the reasons set forth below, I agree that the Charge, in light of the bill of particulars, was sufficient to state an offense and provide fair warning of the criminality of the conduct at issue. I do not agree that the evidence was sufficient to prove the offense alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">I. Legal Sufficiency of the Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">Article 133, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 933, proscribes \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\u201d The Supreme Court, in <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 756, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974), indicated that such a statute might be void for vagueness under the standards applicable to criminal offenses in the civilian sector. The statute could be sustained in the military context, however, so long as the person had received \u201cfair warning of the criminality\u201d of his or her conduct. The Court relied in significant part on the decisions of this Court and the language in the Manual for Courts-Martial that had \u201cnarrowed the very broad reach of the literal language of the articles, and at the same time ha[d] supplied considerable specificity by way of examples of the conduct which they cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>er.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 753-54, 94 S.Ct. 2547. The Court also noted that \u201cfurther content may be supplied ... by less formalized custom and usage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 94 S.Ct. 2547. The guidance in the Manual for Courts-Martial plays a vital role in the assessment of the legality of the Charge. With respect to the offense of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman under Article 133, the Manual notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">There are certain moral attributes common to the ideal officer and the perfect gentleman____ Not everyone is or can be expected to meet unrealistically high moral standards, but there is a limit of tolerance based on customs of the service and military necessity below which the personal standards of an officer, cadet, or midshipman cannot fall without seriously compromising the person\u2019s standing as an officer, cadet, or midshipman or the person\u2019s character as a gentleman. This article prohibits conduct by a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman which, taking all the circumstances into consideration, is thus compromising.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Para. 59c(2), Part IV, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.). The Manual reflects traditional military law. Winthrop, in his authoritative treatise, noted with respect to an earlier version of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5y\">Though it need not amount to a crime, it must offend so seriously against law, justice, morality or decorum as to expose to disgrace, socially or as a man, the offender, and at the same time must be of such a nature or committed under such circumstances as to bring dishonor or disrepute upon the military profession which he represents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">William Winthrop, <em>Military Law and Precedents </em>711-12 (2d ed.1920 Reprint) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The comments by the President in the Manual and Winthrop in his treatise reflect two tiers of disciplinary infractions under military law. The first tier includes matters that amount to flaws or deficiencies in performance or conduct that are not crimes, either in the traditional or uniquely military sense. <em>See generally United States v. Wheatley, </em>10 USCMA 537, 28 CMR 103, 1959 WL 3414 (1959)(careless or thoughtless act of officer not necessarily criminal). Infractions not amounting to UCMJ offenses may be addressed through administrative measures, such as those listed in ROM 306(c)(2), Manual, <em>supra, </em>and the Discussion thereunder. The second tier includes matters that not Only involve deficiencies in performance or conduct, but which also constitute offenses under the UCMJ. These matters can be dealt with either under the UCMJ or through administrative actions. <em>See </em>RCM 306(c)(1)\u2014(5), 401-04, and 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">The Manual expressly addresses the subject <em>of </em>officer-enlisted relationships in paragraph 83, Part IV (Fraternization), providing a basis for differentiating between those relationships that are punishable under the UCMJ and those that are either permissible or that may be addressed solely through administrative measures. The Manual, however, does not provide similar guidance with respect to the relationships between officers of different grades.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\"><em>United States v. Kroop, </em>38 MJ 470 (CMA 1993), is our most recent precedent governing relationships between officers of different ranks. <em>Kroop </em>involved a charge of \u201cundue familiarity\u201d and \u201cexcessive social contacts\u201d between a married male lieutenant colonel (LtCol) and a married female second lieutenant detailed to his squadron. LtCol Kroop pled guilty to the Charge but challenged the findings on appeal. The Court of Military Review affirmed the findings only insofar as the Charge pertained to adultery and set aside that portion of the findings concerning \u201cundue familiarity\u201d and \u201cexcessive social contacts.\u201d 34 MJ at 634-36. The Judge Advocate General certified the case to our Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">The opinion of Senior Judge Everett, joined by Judge Wiss, addressed two aspects of the Charge. First, it stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of further allegations as to the details of the conduct involved or the service custom violated, we are concerned about the imprecision of this language.\u201d 38 MJ at 472. Second, it noted that in 1989, at the time of the charged conduct, \u201cno custom of that service\u201d and \u201cno Air Force Regulation prohibited such conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473. Judges Ever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ett and Wiss concluded that neither Article 133 nor Article 134 was violated by \u201cprivate sexual intercourse between an officer and his or her superior, unaccompanied by any element of harassment or coercion on the part of the superior and any allegation of violation of an applicable custom or regulation____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Chief Judge Sullivan concurred in part and in the result, limiting his views to agreement with a comment by Senior Judge Everett that the language excised by the Court of. Military Review could be viewed as \u201csurplus-age\u201d in the context of an adultery charge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Judge Gierke, in dissent, stated that the allegation of \u201cundue familiarity\u201d and \u201cexcessive social contacts\u201d with a married female servicemember was sufficient to state an offense under Article 133. He noted: (1) the case involved a guilty plea in which the accused had not challenged the sufficiency of the specification at trial; (2) under those circumstances, the standard of review as to legal sufficiency was lower on appeal than in a case where the specification had been challenged at trial; and (3) the accused had not asked for a bill of particulars or in any way asserted at trial that the specification was too vague. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Judge Cox expressed agreement \u201cwith almost everything\u201d in Judge Gierke\u2019s dissent, but he concurred in the result because he viewed the decision of the Court of Military Review as doubting that <em>\u201cthis particular </em>conduct was of such a character as to rise to conduct unbecoming an officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">In view of the split opinions in <em>Kroop </em>and the fact that it was viewed as involving private behavior, it does not provide a precedent that would clearly govern the present case. At a minimum, <em>Kroop </em>suggests that pleading and proof of a custom or regulation, or production of a bill of particulars, may be sufficient to rebuff a challenge to such a specification in a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Kroop, </em>the Air Force revised Instruction (AFI) 36-2909, entitled \u201cFraternization and Professional Relationships,\u201d effective February 20, 1995. The parties to the present case agree that the 1995 version of the Instruction was non-punitive, in the sense that violations were not punishable under Article 92, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 892 (failure to obey a lawful order or regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">With respect to officers, the 1995 Instruction defined \u201c[Unprofessional Relationships\u201d as \u201c[pjersonal relationships between officers ... which result in inappropriate familiarity or create the appearance of favoritism, preferential treatment, or impropriety.\u201d Para. Al.1.2. With respect to officers within the same chain of command, unit, or closely related unit, the Instruction noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-15\">Personal relationships between members of different grades or positions within an organization or chain of command can easily become unprofessional. Dating and indebtedness commonly get out of hand because they appear to create favoritism or partiality. Consequently, senior members should not date or become personally obligated or indebted to junior members. This is also because seniors have, or are perceived to have, authority to influence the junior member\u2019s career.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Para. A1.3.1. The Instruction also defined fraternization (officer-enlisted relationships) and noted that fraternization was subject to criminal prosecution under the UCMJ as service discrediting and prejudicial to good order and discipline. Para. Al.1.3. No such language was included with respect to unprofessional relationships between officers; rather, the Instruction simply noted that such relationships \u201cbecome a matter of official concern.\u201d Para. A1.3.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">The current version of AFI 2909 (1 May 1999), issued subsequent to the events at issue in this appeal, contains a more detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>description of the nature of unprofessional relationships. In addition, the new Instruction indicates that commanders will use \u201ca stepped approach to enforcement of the policy\u201d regarding unprofessional relationships. <em>Id. </em>(Summary of Revisions). Under the stepped approach, a commander first will issue an order \u201cto cease an unprofessional relationship\u201d; then, if the officer does not adhere to the order, the commander will consider \u201cprosecution under the UCMJ for violation of the order.\u201d Para. 4. The two-step approach is reinforced in paragraph 8 of the Instruction, \u201cActions in Response to Unprofessional Relationships,\u201d which provides that corrective action</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">should normally be the least severe necessary to terminate the unprofessional aspects of the relationship. The full spectrum of administrative actions is available and should be considered.... Experience has shown that counseling is often an effective first step in curtailing unprofessional relationships____ An order to terminate a relationship, or the offensive portion of a relationship, can and should be given whenever it is apparent that lesser administrative action may not be effective. Officers or enlisted members who violate such orders are subject to action under the UCMJ for violation of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">This current Instruction reflects a recognition by the Air Force that it is difficult to provide a definitive set of rules governing the wide variety of personal interactions between officers of different ranks, and that an order can serve to focus the attention of an officer on the limits of his or her relationships with particular subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">In a case such as this, where there has been a bill of particulars, it is not necessary to address the question of whether the specification, standing alone, provides sufficient notice that the conduct in question was proscribed by Article 133. Instead, it is appropriate to look at the bill of particulars in conjunction with the guidance in the Instruction, the Manual, case law, or custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">During the initial stages of the trial, the defense moved to dismiss the specification at issue on the grounds that it failed to state an offense. The Government responded by furnishing a bill of particulars.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-18\">The centerpiece of the bill of particulars was item 4, the allegation that 1Lt Clemm admitted to Major Cloutier that she was having an affair with appellant. The balance of the bill of particulars involved circumstantial evidence from which inferences could be drawn corroborating the existence of an affair and its negative impact on the command.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">The bill of particulars was more than sufficient to provide adequate notice of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Whatever limits there may be on the reach of Article 133 into discreet, private conduct, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>circumstances referenced in the bill of particulars were well within the range of conduct proscribed by military law. I am confident that no field grade officer holding a position of command in any of the armed forces could have reasonably believed in 1995 that he or she would not risk a court-martial for having an affair with a subordinate junior officer under the circumstances described in the bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">II. Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">A bill of particulars may provide the basis for sustaining the legal sufficiency of a charge, but it does not address the leg\u00e1l sufficiency of the evidence actually introduced on the merits. At trial, 1Lt Clemm denied that she had been involved in an affair with appellant, and she denied making a statement to Major Cloutier admitting to such an affair. As a result, the only evidence of her statement was Major\u2019s Cloutier\u2019s assertion that 1Lt Clemm had, in fact, made such an admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The military judge ruled that Major Cloutier\u2019s recollection of her statement constituted hearsay that was inadmissible on the merits of the Charge, although he permitted it to be used, under proper limiting instructions, as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach 1Lt Clemm\u2019s trial testimony denying the affair. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 613, Manual, <em>supra. </em>Because it was excluded as substantive evidence on the merits, her statement may not be considered during appellate review of the question whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Absent her admission, the remainder of the prosecution\u2019s case consisted of a variety of incidental touchings, social encounters, warnings to appellant about the impact of his interactions with 1Lt Clemm on the discipline and morale of the unit, and appellant\u2019s actions in response to those expressions of concern. Without her admissions, the evidence reflected the speculation of others as to the possibility of an inappropriate relationship, but did not provide a legally sufficient basis upon which a reasonable factfinder could have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant\u2019s conduct with 1Lt Clemm crossed the line from permissible interaction to an illegal unprofessional relationship of inappropriate familiarity. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>25 MJ 324 (CMA 1987), citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">That conclusion, however, does not mean that the Air Force was precluded from holding appellant accountable for his conduct. Aside from the plethora of administrative actions that could have been taken with respect to matters such as efficiency reports, assignments, and promotions, appellant could have been held accountable in a court-martial for the offense of dereliction of duty under Article 92 or as a related charge under Article 133. The evidence makes abundantly clear that, from the outset of appellant\u2019s interactions with 1Lt Clemm, members of his command repeatedly called his attention \u2014 as squadron leader \u2014 to the deleterious impact of these interactions on the good order and discipline of the unit. Although these admonitions were brought to appellant\u2019s attention with increasing frequency and bluntness, he not only chose to ignore these expressions of concern \u2014 but he also willfully engaged in conduct that further undermined the morale of the unit, a unit actively engaged in combat operations. As squadron leader, he had a particular responsibility to set an example. Instead of conducting himself in a manner that would ensure that his interactions with 1Lt Clemm were limited to those necessary for their professional relationship, he repeatedly placed himself in situations which affected morale within the unit and which caused reasonable concern among the officers and enlisted members of his unit. Rather than making it clear to his subordinates that his relationship with 1Lt Clemm was confined to professional interaction, he inflamed the situation through comments suggesting that he viewed her as a sexual object rather than as a military officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">This is not a case of an isolated remark in a private conversation, nor does it involve a stray, careless or thoughtless act. It also does not involve a relationship in which the parties endeavored to act with discretion and circumspection. The case before us involves a commanding officer who \u2014 knowing of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>cerns within his unit about his relationship with a subordinate \u2014 repeatedly acted with flagrant disregard of the consequences upon his unit that would result from his remarks and his visible interactions with that subordinate.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, I would have had no difficulty in concluding that a reasonable fact-finder could have found that appellant did not conduct himself as an officer and a gentleman when he permitted the degradation of the morale, good order, and discipline of his unit by taking actions that further aggravated the reasonable concerns of members of his unit and that had been repeatedly called to his attention. Given the way the ease was charged and prosecuted, however, it would be difficult to hold that a dereliction charge would be fairly embraced within the Charge. In light of the Government\u2019s decision to center its prosecution on the existence of an inappropriate relationship rather than on appellant\u2019s dereliction of duty, I would dismiss the Charge and remand the ease for a rehearing on sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\">. Paragraph 2 of the Instruction directed commanders to take the following \u201ccorrective action\u201d with respect to relationships having an adverse effect on their units:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">2.1 Consider administrative actions....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">2.2 Consider punitive action, when appropriate, especially for favoritism, partiality, or misuse of grade or position, which may be violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
