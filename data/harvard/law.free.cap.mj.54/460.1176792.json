Contrary to his pleas, he was found guilty of wrongfully using cocaine between May 30 and June 30, 1997, in violation of Article 112a, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 912a. He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge and reduction to the grade of private. The convening authority approved this sentence on April 2, 1998, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion on May 18,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-19\">On September 5, 2000, this Court granted review on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-20\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE\u2019S ERRORS IN FAILING TO GIVE A CURATIVE INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING TRIAL COUNSEL\u2019S MISSTATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND COMPOUNDING THE ERROR PREJUDICED APPELLANT\u2019S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-21\">We hold that trial counsel\u2019s erroneous argument on the evidence presented in this case and the military judge\u2019s affirmation of that argument materially prejudiced appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Appellant was charged with wrongfully using cocaine \u201cat or near Fort Bragg, North Carolina, between on or about 30 May 1997, and on or about 30 June 1997.\u201d The prosecution presented its standard urinalysis case based on a positive urinalysis report, expert testimony explaining it, and chain-of-custody evidence. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>23 MJ 310 (CMA 1987). The defense\u2019s theory was that appellant\u2019s urine sample was tampered with or adulterated after it was seized from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">As part of its case in chief, the prosecution called Major Brian J. Lukey, U.S. Army, a board-certified toxicologist and officer-in-charge of Tripler Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratory in Hawaii. He testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Q. Could you explain for the panel members how the use of cocaine is detected in the human body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">A. Yes. When cocaine enters the body, whether you inhale it, smoke it, you can snort it, intravenously administer it or even ingest it, it will enter into the blood system. The blood will move it through the body to the brain, where it exerts its pharmacological effect, the high; but also, the body recognizes any substance, like cocaine, as a foreign substance and it tries to get rid of it. One of the ways it gets rid of it is it tries to make it more water-soluble, so it would attach a chemical moiety to it or break it into components that we call \u201cmetabolites.\u201d And, it\u2019s the metabolites that go into the urine and eliminate it from the body. And one particular metabolite \u2014 it\u2019s called \u201cBenzoylecgonine\u201d or \u201cBZE\u201d \u2014 is the one that we particularly look at for cocaine abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Q. Now, in your experience, can the metabolite referred to as BZE be produced in any other \u2014 from any other substance, but cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">Q. Can the human body naturally make and produce BZE?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">A. It cannot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-11\">Q. <em>If the human body consumes cocaine, can that body then produce the metabolite BZE?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-14\">A. <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-15\">Q. <em>So is it true that a human body which produces urine that contains the metabolite BZE has consumed or ingested somehow cocaine?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-16\">A. <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-17\">Q. What types of tests are done on urine to detect the metabolite BZE?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-18\">A. We actually do two different tests at our laboratory. We do a first test. It\u2019s called a \u201cScreening Test,\u201d which is immunological based. It\u2019s called \u201cKinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3P\">(Emphasis added.) He further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-19\">Q. You mentioned a fingerprint. Is that a fingerprint for the metabolite BZE?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-20\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-21\">Q. Is there any way for the machine to mistake the BZE fingerprint with any other metabolite fingerprint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-22\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-23\">Q. <em>So if your machine registers a fingerprint for BZE, then there was BZE in the specimen?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-24\">\n<em>A. That\u2019s coirect.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-25\">Q. Can you state for the panel what the cutoff level is, established by DoD, for the GC/MS test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-26\">A. Yes, it\u2019s 100 nanograms per milliliter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyS3\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-27\">On cross-examination, Major Lukey answered additional questions from defense counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-28\">Q. Okay, sir. And, a question about the BZE produced by cocaine \u2014 and I believe there was a prior witness who briefly discussed this. You said that the body processes that out. It comes out through the urine. It\u2019s detected there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-29\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-30\">Q. <em>If </em>\u2014 if <em>there were cocaine, basically, dumped into urine and shipped to your lab, what happens there?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-31\"><em>A. </em>It all depends upon the Ph of the urine itself. <em>The more basic the urine, the cocaine can actually go and fom BZE itself. So, you actually find BZE and, actually, in this case, the urine was fairly basic. </em>It was \u2014 actually, <em>I </em>think we \u2014 I don\u2019t have my chain \u2014 I had it on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>chain of custody form \u2014 but, I think it was 7 something, <em>which, if cocaine was added to that mine, it could form BZE.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\">Q. Okay. So, that is possible, unlike with say marijuana, whereas you can\u2019t \u2014 it couldn\u2019t be dropped into a urine specimen and then it would just \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t come up with anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Trial counsel, in his rebuttal argument on findings, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">Mr. President, members of the panel, the defense was right about one thing, testing procedures don\u2019t prove the accused\u2019s guilt. It was the accused\u2019s use of cocaine that proves him guilty. It\u2019s the evidence that proves him guilty. It\u2019s the fact that he provided a urine sample. The urine sample was tested. The testing was positive. That proves him guilty....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">He had the control where he was in his own room, where he could control everything without anyone coming in and he had the latrine, a mere 10 to 15 feet away. The bottom line is the sample taken from the accused was properly taken. It was his urine. It showed BZE. <em>BZE only appears when you\u2019ve been using cocaine. </em>These simple facts\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">ADC: <em>Your Honor, that\u2019s not a fact.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">MJ: <em>That was the testimony of the expert. Please be seated.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">(The assistant defense counsel did as directed.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">RCM 919, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-15\">Rule 919. Argument by counsel on findings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">(a) <em>In general. </em>After the closing of evidence, trial counsel shall be permitted to open the argument. The defense counsel shall be permitted to reply. Trial counsel shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-17\">(b) <em>Contents. Arguments may properly include reasonable comment on the evidence in the case, including inferences to be drawn therefrom, in support of a party\u2019s theory of the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-18\">(Emphasis added). The Court of Criminal Appeals, 54 MJ 318, held that trial counsel\u2019s argument that the evidence presented in this case showed \u201cBZE only appears when you\u2019ve been using cocaine\u201d was a misstatement. Unpub. op. at 2. We agree with the lower appellate court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-19\">RCM 919(e) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-20\">(c) <em>Waiver of objection to improper argument. </em>Failure to object to improper argument before the military judge begins to instruct the members on findings shall constitute waiver of the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-21\">Discussion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-22\">If an objection that an argument is improper is sustained, <em>the military judge should immediately instruct the members that the argument ivas improper and that they must disregard it. </em>In extraordinary cases improper argument may require a mistrial. See RCM 915. The military judge should be alert to improper argument and take appropriate action when necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-23\">Here, the defense immediately objected to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of the evidence in his closing argument. Instead of sustaining that objection and instructing the members to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement, the military judge agreed with trial counsel\u2019s reading of the record and communicated this belief to the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-24\">The remaining question before us is whether appellant was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s erroneous argument and the military judge\u2019s compounding of that error. In <em>United States v. Iglesias, </em>915 F.2d 1524, 1529 (11th Cir.1990), the Eleventh Circuit held that an erroneous-misstatement-of-evidence argument by trial counsel may be cured by an immediate instruction from the trial judge that the jury members, not counsel, must decide what evidence was admitted in a case. However, in <em>United States v. Achtenberg, </em>459 F.2d 91, 98 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>932, 93 S.Ct. 229, 34 L.Ed.2d 187 (1972), the Eighth Circuit, in different circumstances, found prejudice despite a curative instruction that the members of the jury \u201calone\u201d were \u201cjudges of what the evidence\u201d was. The particular circumstances of each case are controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In appellant\u2019s case, there was no immediate curative instruction given by the trial judge as to the prosecutor\u2019s erroneous argument, (R. 220) nor a timely one specifically repudiating his asserted view of the evidence in this case. (R. 226). Moreover, this was a urinalysis case and the misstatement pertained to a critical issue and its resolution based on scientific principles. <em>Cf. United States v. Mack, </em>33 MJ 251 (CMA 1991) (urinalysis conviction set aside because of inconsistent scientific proof); <em>United States v. Murphy, supra </em>at 312 (urinalysis conviction set aside for inadequate scientific proof). Finally, the judge\u2019s comments effectively blunted appellant\u2019s previously noted defense that his urine sample had been purposefully tampered with after he submitted it to military authorities. <em>See United States v. Lems, </em>51 MJ 376 (1999). We find material prejudice in these circumstances. Article 59(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed and the findings of guilty and the sentence are set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Army. A rehearing may be ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
