He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 8 years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>and reduction to the grade of E-1. The convening authority approved these results, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in an unpublished, memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">On appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">WHETHER THE STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT BY SUBMITTING A RECOMMENDATION TO THE CONVENING AUTHORITY REGARDING APPELLANT\u2019S REQUEST THAT FORFEITURES BE DEFERRED WHICH CONTAINED MATTERS NOT MENTIONED IN THE RECORD OF TRIAL, SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING THAT APPELLANT\u2019S WIFE WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THE SAME FACTS THAT GAVE RISE TO APPELLANT\u2019S COURT-MARTIAL, AND NOT ALLOWING APPELLANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBUT THIS NEW MATTER BY NEVER SERVING APPELLANT WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO THE CONVENING AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE REQUEST FOR DEFERMENT OF FORFEITURES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. Appellant has not made a colorable showing of possible prejudice flowing from the alleged error. <em>See </em>Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">I. BACKGROUND: FACTUAL SETTING</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Twelve days after appellant\u2019s trial ended, he asked the convening authority to defer the adjudged forfeitures pending the convening authority\u2019s final action in the case. <em>See </em>Art. 57(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 857(a)(1)(A) and (a)(2). The written submission by defense counsel noted: (1) appellant had a moral and financial obligation to his two children, both of whom were in foster care; (2) appellant\u2019s wife, who was expecting their third child, was unemployed and planned to relocate to her home in Maryland; and (3) deferment of the forfeitures was necessary to provide Mrs. Brown with \u201csome financial security while she seeks secure employment,\u201d and without the deferment, \u201cthe family will have no means of support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">On the following day, the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) provided the convening authority with a written recommendation on the request, which noted in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">PV2 Brown\u2019s two children are presently in foster care and are unlikely ever to be returned to him. He is not under any court ordered obligation to provide them financial support. In addition, his wife is expecting their third child, however, this child is due after the six month waiver period will expire.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Thus, his wife is the only dependent who will directly benefit during the period of the waiver/deferral, and she is currently under investigation for criminal abuse regarding the same facts and circumstances as in the present case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">On the following day, the convening authority disapproved the request. The defense was not served with the SJA\u2019s written recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">Approximately 6 months after denial of the deferment request, the SJA provided the convening authority with a recommendation to approve the findings and sentence under Article 60(d), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 860(d). The SJA included a reference to appellant\u2019s deferment request, reminding the convening authority that he had denied the request. The SJA\u2019s recommendation was served on appellant\u2019s newly assigned substitute defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">After receiving a copy of the SJA\u2019s recommendation, defense counsel submitted matters for consideration by the convening au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>thority under RCM 1105 and 1006, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2000 ed.). These submissions challenged the legal sufficiency of the pleas and effectiveness of trial defense counsel, but they did not address the decision to deny deferment of forfeitures or otherwise specifically request that the convening authority mitigate the forfeitures when taking action on the sentence. The defense submission included a letter from appellant\u2019s wife in which she wrote that she, not appellant, had hurt the children, describing what she had done and how she had done it. Approximately 3 weeks later, the convening authority approved the adjudged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">II. BACKGROUND: LEGAL CONTEXT</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">A. Recommendations to the Convening Authority: Notice and Comment</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The requirement for a written submission to the convening authority from the SJA under Article 60(d) is a longstanding feature of military law. <em>See </em>Act of June 4, 1920, ch. 227, 41 Stat. 796 (Article of War 46); Manual for Courts-Martial, U.S. Army, 1921, para. 370. In <em>United States v. Goode, </em>1 MJ 3, 6 (CMA 1975), we held that the written recommendation must be served <em>on </em>counsel for the accused in order to provide the accused \u201cwith an opportunity to correct or challenge any matter he deems erroneous, inadequate or misleading, or on which he otherwise wishes to comment.\u201d <em>Goode </em>drew upon earlier cases that required notice and an opportunity to comment on adverse matter in a post-trial review. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vara, 8 </em>USCMA 651, 25 CMR 155 (1958); <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>8 USCMA 206, 24 CMR 16 (1957). Subsequent to <em>Goode, </em>we held in <em>United States v. Narine, </em>14 MJ 55 (CMA 1982), that if the SJA supplements the original recommendation by providing the convening authority with new matter, the new matter must be served on counsel in order to ensure compliance with the opportunity for comment required by our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Congress incorporated the notice and response requirements of <em>Goode </em>into Article 60(d) as part of the Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-209, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 97 Stat. 1395-97. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 98-53 at 21 (1982). The President has incorporated this requirement and treatment of new matters under <em>Narine </em>into the Manual for Courts-Martial through RCM 1106(f)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">At the time the Military Justice Act of 1983 was debated, and for many years thereafter, forfeitures adjudged by a court-martial did not take effect until the convening authority acted on the findings and sentence. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 462-63, Congress amended the Code to provide that: (1) forfeitures adjudged by a court-martial would become effective in most cases prior to the convening authority\u2019s action, and (2) the convening authority could defer such forfeitures. Art. 57(a), <em>supra. </em>The 1996 legislation also amended the Code to require automatic forfeiture of pay in certain cases involving confinement, regardless of whether forfeitures were adjudged at trial, and to permit the convening authority to waive such forfeitures for a limited period of time, not to exceed 6 months. Art. 58b, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 858b. Neither the statute nor the subsequent amendments to the Manual addressed the issue of whether the convening authority was required to receive an SJA\u2019s recommendation before acting on a deferment or waiver request. Likewise, neither addressed the issue of whether the accused should be provided with notice of and an opportunity to respond to any written submission from the SJA to the convening authority with respect to deferment or waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">B. Post-Trial Processing: Prejudicial Error</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">In <em>United, States v. Chatman, 46 MJ </em>321 (1997), we set forth the following guidance to determine whether an erroneous failure to serve new matter on the defense constitutes prejudicial error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">[W]e will require appellant to demonstrate prejudice by stating what, if anything, would have been submitted to \u201cdeny, counter, or explain\u201d the new matter---- We believe that the threshold should be low, and if an appellant makes some colorable showing of possible prejudice, we will give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that appellant the benefit of the doubt and \u201cwe will not speculate on what the convening authority might have done\u201d if defense counsel had been given an opportunity to comment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><em>Id. </em>323-24 (citations omitted); <em>see </em>Art. 59(a), <em>supra; see also United States v. Wheelus, </em>49 MJ 283 (1998); <em>United States v. Catalani, </em>46 MJ 325 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">A. Post-Trial Action on Forfeitures</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Appellant relies on the views of the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals in <em>United States v. Spears, </em>48 MJ 768 (A.F.Ct.Crim. App.1998), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, United States v. Oiven, </em>50 MJ 629 (A.F.Ct.Crim. App.1998). In Spears, the court noted that although the literal requirements for the SJA\u2019s post-trial recommendation under RCM 1106 did not extend to waiver of automatic forfeitures under Article 58b(b), \u201cconcepts of basic fairness and procedural due process\u201d were violated by not providing the servicemember with a copy of the recommendation and an opportunity to \u201ccomment before sending it to the convening authority for his action on the waiver request.\u201d Id. at 775-76. Drawing an analogy to the notice and comment provisions of RCM 1106, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">The clear purpose behind the rule was to give the defense an opportunity to respond to the SJA\u2019s position in post-trial legal advice provided to the convening authority. The rule on new matter obviously prevents the SJA from bringing up new issues from outside the record to the convening authority and getting the last say without the defense even knowing about it. When the rule was written, Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ, did not exist and the issue presently before us could not be foreseen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Id. at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">We note that Congress has recognized the serious impact that such forfeitures would have on the family of the accused by providing the authority for deferment and waiver. The issue before us raises questions involving constitutional due process and statutory interpretation. Because appellant has not met the applicable standards for finding prejudicial error, as discussed in Part III.B., <em>infra, </em>we need not decide at this time whether the requirements of notice and an opportunity to comment apply to requests for deferment of adjudged forfeitures or waiver of automatic forfeitures.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">It is likely, however, that these questions will recur in the near future. Rather than attempt to resolve them in the present case, we believe the most prudent course of action is for the Executive Branch to consider whether, as a matter of law or policy, and consistent with due process considerations, such requests to the convening authority should be followed by a recommendation from the SJA and service on the accused with an opportunity to respond. In addition, given congressional focus on the interests of the family, consideration should be given as to whether there might be circumstances in which the family could have interests separate from the accused which might be brought to the attention of the convening authority directly by the family rather than through the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">B. Evaluation of Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">Even if we were to hold that notice and an opportunity to comment were required in the present case, appellant would not be entitled to relief. Under <em>Chatman, supra, </em>an accused who seeks appellate relief from such a post-trial processing error has the burden of making a colorable showing of possible prejudice. Appellant has not met this burden because he has not demonstrated what he would have said in response to the SJA\u2019s recommendation regarding deferment of forfeitures.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">The SJA, for example, stated that appellant was not under any court-ordered obligation to provide financial support for his children in foster care. This is the type of assertion which, if incorrect or misleading, can readily be corrected. In order to make the requisite showing of prejudice, appellant would have to demonstrate on appeal how he would have challenged the SJA\u2019s assertion, and he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Likewise, appellant has not demonstrated prejudice with respect to the SJA\u2019s statements that the deferment would not benefit the third, as yet unborn child, who was not due until more than 6 months after the request. Although the SJA erred in suggesting that there was a 6-month maximum period for deferment, appellant has failed to address the fact that any deferment would have ended as a matter of law well within the 6 month period when the convening authority acted on appellant\u2019s case. Appellant has not indicated what he might have said about the SJA\u2019s error that could have produced a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Appellant also has not demonstrated prejudice with respect to the SJA\u2019s assertion that appellant\u2019s wife was unworthy of favorable consideration because she then was \u201cunder investigation for criminal abuse regarding the same facts and circumstances as in the present case.\u201d Appellant has argued that he could have investigated that assertion and responded to it if inaccurate. He has had ample time to do so and has not demonstrated either that the statement was inaccurate or that there were circumstances that precluded him from obtaining the requisite information. Although the standard for prejudicial error under <em>Chatman </em>is low \u2014 a \u201ccolorable showing of possible prejudice\u201d \u2014 it does not include sheer speculation about factual matters that are within the normal investigative capabilities of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">IV. DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">. The SJA misspoke. There is no 6-month waiver period with respect to deferment of adjudged forfeitures. Adjudged forfeitures may be deferred until the convening authority takes formal action on the sentence. <em>See </em>Art. 57(a)(2), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 857(a)(2). The SJA apparently was referring to a statutory provision not at issue in this case, the authority under Article 58b(b), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 858b(b), to waive automatic forfeitures for certain persons in confinement for a period of up to 6 months. <em>Compare </em>Art. 57(a)(2) (deferment of adjudged forfeitures) <em>with </em>Art. 58b(b)(waiver of automatic forfeitures).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
