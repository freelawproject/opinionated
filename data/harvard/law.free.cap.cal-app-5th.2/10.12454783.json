J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIf\">The issues in this matrimonial case arise from the failure of an attorney serving as a temporary judge pursuant to article VI, section 21,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the California Constitution to disclose grounds for her disqualification in the manner required by a canon of the Code of Judicial Ethics<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applicable specifically to temporary judges. After the temporary judge had served for about two years, petitioner wife first learned that the judge had not disclosed \u201cin writing or on the record\u201d professional relationships she had had with lawyers in the present proceeding, as required by canon 6D(5)(a) and rule 2.831(d) of the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner filed in the superior court a statement alleging grounds for disqualification, to which the temporary judge failed to respond in accordance with statutory procedure. The presiding judge of the superior court ordered the temporary judge disqualified, holding that she was deemed to have consented to her disqualification as a result of her failure to file a consent or verified answer. The case was reassigned to a superior court judge and discovery proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The present writ petition was filed to challenge certain of the trial court\u2019s discovery orders and its decision to delay a hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to set aside orders previously made by the disqualified temporary judge. Pursuant to our order, proceedings in the trial court have been stayed. The questions presented to us all relate to whether the rulings made by the temporary judge prior to her disqualification are void or voidable and, if so, the legal consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>As will be seen, our resolution rests heavily on the temporary judge\u2019s failure to either consent to disqualification or answer the statement of disqualification. The temporary judge\u2019s failure to contest the claims that she failed to disclose in wrihng or on the record, and also that she was biased and prejudiced against petitioner, means that those factual allegations must be taken as true, and she was therefore automatically disqualified. (See discussion, <em>post, </em>at pp. 37\u201441.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">We shah find that (1) the rulings and orders issued by the temporary judge are ah void and must be vacated; (2) the settlement agreement signed by the parties prior to disqualification of the temporary judge was tainted by the disqualifying conduct of the temporary judge and therefore may not be enforced pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) the conduct of the disqualified temporary judge did not taint the proceedings before the superior court judge who replaced her. Finally, we shah decline to decide whether the fees paid the temporary judge for services rendered in violation of ethical obligations must be refunded, because the temporary judge is not a party to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Petitioner, Tracy Hayward, and real party in interest, Jose Osuch, married in 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tracy is the owner of The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley (PPNV), a fruit pureeing business in Napa County; Jose was employed by PPNV and in 2006 Tracy made him a 1 percent owner. The parties later separated and Tracy filed this petition for dissolution in 2011. Initially, Tracy was represented by Roger Lewis, but after she learned he was formerly the law partner of Robert Blevans, who represented Jose, she replaced Lewis with Attorney John Munsill.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">In January 2012, the superior court ordered Tracy to pay Jose $12,748 per month in temporary spousal support and, as additional temporary spousal support, 40 percent of any distributions or withdrawals from her businesses other than salary and other specified taxable income attributed to Tracy. The order also provided that if Tracy\u2019s tax payments exceeded her taxable obligations, she was required to claim a refund and pay 40 percent of the refunded overpayment to Jose as additional temporary spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\n<em>Appointment of the Temporary Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In March 2012, the parties decided not to further litigate the case in the superior court and to stipulate to the appointment of Attorney Nancy Perk-ovich as judge pro tempore\u2014commonly referred to as a \u201cprivate judge\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014 pursuant to rules 2.830 through 2.834, which apply to attorneys appointed temporary judges at the request of the parties pursuant to article VI, section 21, of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The stipulation provided that, subject to approval of the presiding judge of the superior court, Perkovich \u201cmay be designated as Temporary (\u2018Private\u2019) Judge of the Superior Court for all purposes, including, without limitation, conducting settlement conferences and case management conferences, hearing any pretrial motions/Orders to Show Cause, and sitting as trial/long cause judge in this proceeding. The parties waive any conflict that may exist because Perkovich conducts settlement conferences and thereafter serves as the hearing and/or trial judge.\u201d The parties and their attorneys all signed the stipulation on March 28, 2012, and Perkovich signed an oath of office the next day; the order designating her temporary judge was signed by the Honorable Robert G. Stone, Presiding Judge of the Napa County Superior Court, on April 3, 2012, and filed on April 5, 2012.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Rules of Court provide that \u201c[i]n addition to any other disclosure required by law, no later than five days after designation as a temporary judge ... a temporary judge must disclose to the parties any matter subject to disclosure under the Code of Judicial Ethics.\u201d (Rule 2.831(d).) As Perkovich was designated a temporary judge on April 5, 2012, her disclosure was required to be made no later than April 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Canon 6D(5)(a), provides that in \u201call proceedings\u201d temporary judges must \u201cdisclose in writing or on the record information as required by law, or information that is reasonably relevant to the question of disqualification under Canon 6D(3), <em>including personal or professional relationships known to the temporary judge . . . that he or she or his or her law firm has had with a party, lawyer, or law firm in the current proceeding, even though the temporary judge . . . concludes that there is no actual basis for disqualification.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Perkovich failed to comply with the foregoing requirement: She failed to disclose \u201cin writing or on the record\u201d any ground for disqualification even though she knew she, Blevans, and Munsill, had in the past served as private judges in each other\u2019s cases, i.e., that she or her law firm had professional relationships with lawyers in the proceeding before her. (Canon 6D(5)(a).) This information was required to be disclosed even if Perkovich concluded that these relationships provided \u201cno actual basis for disqualification,\u201d and the disclosure was required to be made \u201cin writing or on the record.\u201d (Canon 6D(5)(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Section 170.3, which applies to temporary judges, allows the parties and their attorneys to waive a disqualification after a judge determines himself or herself to be disqualified and discloses the basis of the disqualification. (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (b)(1).) Such a waiver must \u201crecite the basis for the disqualification, and is effective only when signed by all parties and their attorneys and filed in the record.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because Perkovich failed to disclose any grounds for disqualification in writing or on the record, much less to determine herself to be disqualified, neither party was called upon to waive or waived the disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Perkovich also failed to comply with a provision of the Rules of Court requiring a temporary judge to certify (in his or her oath of office or otherwise) \u201cthat he or she is aware of and will comply with applicable provisions of canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Ethics and the California Rules of Court.\u201d (Rule 2.831(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Although the stipulation and proposed order assigning Perkovich temporary judge was signed by the parties and their counsel late in March 2012, and filed with the court on April 5 of that year, the parties did not actually meet with Perkovich until seven months later, at the first settlement conference on October 30, 2012. As will be seen, Perkovich maintains that she verbally disclosed her personal and professional contacts with both Blevans and Munsill at the beginning of this conference, including that she had hired each of the attorneys as temporary judges in the past, and each of them had hired her. Tracy maintains that she did not hear or understand any such verbal disclosures, and did not learn of Perkovich\u2019s failure to disclose \u201cin writing or on the record\u201d until almost two years later, when her present counsel came into the case and requested information including Perkovich\u2019s disclosures, and Perkovich informed them of her verbal disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\n<em>Relations Between the Parties and Counsel Deteriorate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">On March 26, 2013, Tracy replaced Munsill with Trevor Jackson, a younger lawyer who did not limit his practice to family law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Jackson was unaware Perkovich and Blevans designated each other as private judges in matrimonial cases in which one of them represented a party. Perkovich did not disclose her professional relationship with Blevans at any time during which Jackson represented Tracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Shortly after Jackson entered the case, relations between the parties worsened. The contentiousness was most evident at a July 30, 2013, hearing on Jose\u2019s motions requesting attorney and expert witness fees, payment of spousal support arrearages and restraints on Tracy\u2019s ability to take distributions from PPNV without Jose\u2019s consent or a court order. Assuming testimony and other evidence would be received at the hearing, Jackson brought Kevin Ziegler, the chief operating officer of PPNV, to testify as to the adverse effect on PPNV of the restraints Jose sought to impose on its distributions and Tracy\u2019s corporate decisionmaking, and expected to be able to cross-examine Darlene Elmore, Jose\u2019s expert, regarding her declaration. Jackson had given advance notice Ziegler would testify by naming him on his witness list, and he and Tracy were surprised when Perkovich refused to allow Ziegler or any other person to testify and stated her intention to rule on Jose\u2019s motions solely on the basis of the declarations, exhibits and pleadings. Perkovich barred testimony on the erroneous ground that the hearing was analogous to a law and motion proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Jackson objected repeatedly during the hearing, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Jackson also complained that though Tracy was the founder and owner of PPNV, whose assets Jose sought to examine and encumber, neither she nor the chief operating officer of the company were allowed to testify at the hearing regarding its operations, cash flow, tax situation, or any other relevant matters. Instead, Perkovich allowed Blevans to submit a declaration determining the disputed financial issues based on his analysis of the company\u2019s tax returns. Additionally, with respect to attorney and expert witness fees, Perkovich appeared willing to rely solely on the declaration of Blevans, who (self-servingly in Jackson\u2019s view) characterized himself an expert on the subject, and to award fees to compensate for the costs of what in Jackson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>view were unnecessary depositions and \u201claw and motion\u201d proceedings that had been pursued instead of negotiating an expeditious settlement. Jackson objected to requiring Tracy to pay Jose\u2019s attorney and expert witness fees before Jose was compelled to disclose the extent and nature of his independent assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Perkovich ordered Tracy to pay Jose $13,335 for his attorney fees, to advance him attorney fees in the amount of $100,000 payable in 60 days, and to pay expert witness fees of $35,000 to Darlene Elmore. After Jackson objected to the \u201cabbreviated manner\u201d in which the proceeding had been held, Perkovich went on to find that in 2011 and 2012 Tracy had taken distributions of $605,576 in excess of taxes attributable to PPNV and Hayward Enterprises, Inc. (HEI), another company she controlled, which provided sizable tax refunds that pursuant to court order should have been shared with Jose; ruled that Jose was entitled to 40 percent of this amount, or $242,230; and directed Tracy to pay him this amount, plus interest at 10 percent, as additional spousal support. Finally, Perkovich restrained Tracy from allowing or causing the withdrawal of any sums from PPNV or HEI for payment to her for her personal benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Toward the end of the hearing, Jackson remarked on his \u201cshock\u201d at Perkovich\u2019s unexpected refusal to accept testimony he had planned to present. When he subsequently reiterated his objection to the lack of notice, Tracy interjected that Perkovich\u2019s failure to allow testimony \u201cmade you look like an idiot,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> adding that \u201c \u2018[m]y\u2019 COO is sitting right here and he could have cleared up many of these issues. How in the hell do you absolutely allow\u2014.\u201d Perkovich cut Tracy off, stating \u201cYour conduct is in contempt of court. You\u2019re disrespectful. You\u2019re in contempt.\u201d A colloquy ensued in which Perkovich complained that \u201cin presenting your case . . . you see things only your own way,\u201d and Tracy heatedly insisted that Perkovich \u201cnever asked the questions\u201d that needed to be asked \u201cfor the truth to be made known\u201d about the manner in which she ran PPNV.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In a ruling she filed with the superior court less than two weeks later, on August 12, 2013, Perkovich belatedly recognized that, under Family Code section 217, subdivision (c), Tracy was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on some of the motions heard and decided on July 30. Perkovich vacated portions of her earlier decision and ordered that the motions for spousal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>support arrearages and property restraints be set for evidentiary hearing. The August 12 ruling modified the earlier decision primarily by increasing the amount of attorney fees Tracy was required to advance to Jose from $100,000 to $150,000, apparently to cover the costs of the newly ordered evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\n<em>Tracy Tries but Fails to Remove the Temporary Judge and Jose Seeks to Wrest Control of PPNV from Tracy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Perceiving Blevans had an \u201cinside track\u201d to Perkovich\u2019s thinking and decisionmaking,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Jackson filed a motion in the superior court on September 5, 2013, to withdraw the stipulation and order, remove Perkovich as temporary judge, and reopen discovery. Unaware of Perkovich\u2019s failure to disclose in writing or on the record her mutual judging relationship with Blevans as required by canon 6D(5)(a), Jackson based the motion instead on the inconvenience and expense of having a temporary judge based in Sacramento in a case in which Jose was \u201cavidly pursuing litigation and discovery instead of settlement,\u201d and the fees of the temporary judge were certain to \u201cskyrocket.\u201d The motion was denied on October 20, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Meanwhile, the evidentiary hearing was held on October 9, 2013. Much of the hearing focused on distributions Tracy took from PPNV. At the end of the hearing, Jackson expressed his exasperation about the irrelevant \u201cminutiae\u201d into which Blevans was delving, his manipulation of the facts, and the unreasonableness of the restraints he sought to impose on Tracy and the company. Insisting Tracy received no personal benefit from PPNV\u2019s tax payments and other distributions, Jackson argued that setting aside a large amount of corporate assets for Jose would not only cripple the company but be unfair. If Jose was to benefit from PPNV\u2019s profits, Jackson argued, \u201cthen he should be liable for any taxes the company may have to incur,\u201d but \u201che\u2019s getting all the gain and Tracy is getting zero.\u201d Furthermore, Jackson complained, \u201cwe have been the ones that have been providing all the documents . . . and the depositions,\u201d and Jose was unjustifiably being held harmless without any inquiry into his independent assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Perkovich\u2019s October 28 ruling states that Jackson reported on the morning of the October 9 hearing that Tracy could not appear because she was ill, \u201cthere were potential tax issues which may implicate her rights against self-incrimination [that] may give rise to the assertion of her 5th Amendment privilege\u201d and her named expert, Kevin Ziegler, would not attend \u201cdue to 5th Amendment issues.\u201d Perkovich denied Jackson\u2019s request to continue the hearing to permit an arrangement in which Tracy and Ziegler would be able to testify, but received the testimony of Jose\u2019s expert Darlene Elmore and also considered the deposition testimony of Tracy and Ziegler, as well as documentary evidence presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Perkovich found that Tracy authorized payment from PPNV of $273,004.15 for legal fees she paid four attorneys, that under a prior court order Jose was entitled to 40 percent of this amount, $109,201.66, in order to pay his own attorneys, and ordered that amount paid to Jose in the form of spousal support, together with simple interest of 10 percent commencing on the date each distribution was made. The October 28 ruling also directed that, with respect to the arrearages in spousal support, \u201c[a] writ of execution shall issue forthwith.\u201d The ruling stated that there was evidence Tracy had improperly taken other corporate distributions for her personal benefit, and Perkovich reserved jurisdiction to make further orders about them and any other challenged distributions until the necessary business records were made available to Jose.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On November 7, 2013, Jose filed a request in the superior court \u201cFor Control and Management of [PPNV] or in the Alternative for Appointment of a Receiver.\u201d Jose claimed Tracy failed to pay him monthly spousal support in violation of the June 2011 support order, \u201cdirected [PPNV] to withhold her salary and is refraining from taking a paycheck so that her pay will not be subject to a Wage Garnishment Order reactivated by Jose on June 18, 2013,\u201d and authorized PPNV to pay various personal expenses on her behalf, thereby reducing the company\u2019s net income and profitability to Jose\u2019s detriment. He also claimed she was not involved in the daily operations of the company and was engaging in \u201cerratic conduct demonstrating] a renewed instability and inability to manage the community business.\u201d According to Jose, \u201cTracy\u2019s continued control of the company\u2019s operations virtually assures she will be able to thwart the court\u2019s rulings and deprive Jose of funds for support and fees.\u201d Jose asked the court to (1) award him \u201cexclusive management\u201d of PPNV and order him to (2) remove Tracy from her position as CEO of PPNV, (3) \u201cimmediately suspend\u201d her annual salary of $350,000, (4) direct PPNV to pay him an annual salary not to exceed $350,000, and authorize him to make distributions from PPNV \u201cto pay spousal support arrearages, attorney\u2019s fees, expert costs, and any outstanding Judge <em>Pro Tern </em>fees.\u201d In the alternative, Jose asked the court to appoint a named receiver to run the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\n<em>Settlement Efforts and Tracy\u2019s Claim of Duress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">According to Blevan\u2019s declaration, the parties had begun settlement negotiations at conferences in October 2012, and June 2013, the latter a few months after Jackson substituted into the case. Tracy extended two proposals in July 2013, and in August 2013, Jose proposed a \u201ccomplete and global resolution\u201d that Blevans later described as having become the \u201cfoundation\u201d for the memorandum of agreement (MOA) the parties eventually signed. In November, after Jose filed his request to gain control of PPNV, Tracy offered another settlement proposal. According to Blevans, Tracy, Jackson, and Tracy\u2019s attorneys, Ian Carter and Eric Jeppson, all attended an all-day settlement conference on December 4, 2013, though Tracy \u201cwas asked to leave . . . due to her disruptive behavior\u201d and discussions continued at a December 23 meeting attended by Jackson, Carter, and Jeppson. Blevans then met with Jeppson and Carter on January 10, 2014, to discuss how Tracy would structure payments Jose had agreed to accept at the December 23 meeting. At this point, the hearing on Jose\u2019s motion for control of the company or appointment of a receiver was set for January 14, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The agreement Tracy signed on January 13, 2014, required her to pay Jose $300,000 for the parties\u2019 residence, $2.4 million to equalize the division of property other than the residence, and spousal support of $25,000 per month, nonmodifiable until the equalizing payment was made in full. Tracy\u2019s spousal support obligation was to \u201csurvive\u201d Jose\u2019s remarriage and continue until his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">According to Tracy and Jackson, the MOA was negotiated without their participation at the January 10, 2014, meeting between Blevans, Jeppson and Carter. Jeppson and Carter worked for Tracy on corporate and tax matters involving PPNV; she stated in a declaration that they \u201cnegotiated without my authorization.\u201d Jackson stated that upon his arrival at Blevans\u2019s office on January 10, he was met by Jeppson and Carter, who informed him that Blevans \u201cwas unavailable because he was attending to another matter,\u201d and that an agreement had been reached \u201cresolving all material issues before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">As described in her brief and declaration in support of the present writ petition, Tracy considered the MOA \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Tracy stated in her declaration that she only received the document late on the afternoon of the day before the hearing on Jose\u2019s motion to take control of PPNV or put the company in the hands of a receiver, and she \u201cdid not understand the terms of the Agreement.\u201d Tracy claims she was \u201cemotional, confused, and afraid\u201d at being forced to decide either to sign the MOA or submit to a hearing before a judge she considered biased against her on a motion seeking to transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>control of PPNV to Jose. Tracy would not have executed the MOA, she said, \u201cexcept for the threats against my company\u201d; she \u201cfeared for her company\u2019s existence, her employees\u2019 futures, and her own livelihood [and] was also concerned about possible tax and criminal ramifications due to Jose\u2019s refusal to share information about off-shore bank and brokerage accounts he had established with company money, leaving Tracy to face the consequences here, while he stayed in Argentina.\u201d Assertedly on the basis of Jackson\u2019s prediction that Perkovich would likely grant Jose\u2019s motion to grant him control of PPNV or appoint a receiver, Tracy signed the MOA, but noted on the document that she did so \u201cunder protest.\u201d On January 14, 2014, after Jackson told her the MOA would not be accepted with that notation, Tracy signed a fresh copy without expressing protest. Jackson confirmed that, based on his assessment of the situation, he advised Tracy the document would not be accepted if she wrote on it that she signed \u201cunder protest,\u201d and her only options were: \u201c(a) execute an identical copy of the Agreement without the words \u2018under protest\u2019 on the document (thereby avoiding the receivership hearing), or (b) proceed with the receivership hearing on the following day.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\n<em>Tracy Obtains Disqualification of Perkovich</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On March 26, 2014, Jackson was substituted out of the case and Tracy\u2019s present lawyers, Keith E. Dolnick and David B. Ezra, entered the fray. Two months later, on May 20, 2014, Jose filed a motion to enforce the MOA pursuant to section 664.6. Tracy\u2019s new lawyers, who had not yet learned of the mutual private judging relationship between Blevans and Perkovich, opposed the motion on the grounds that (1) the parties had not, prior to signing the MOA, served on one another or mutually waived the final declarations of economic interests and income and expense as required by Family Code section 2105, and (2) Tracy signed the MOA under economic duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On May 30, 2014, Tracy filed a second motion to withdraw the stipulation and order appointing Perkovich temporary judge, this time on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that, due to Perkovich\u2019s failure to certify that she was \u201caware of and will comply with applicable provisions of canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Ethics and the California Rules of Court,\u201d as required by rule 2.831(b), she lacked the power to rule on the pending motion to enforce the MOA pursuant to section 664.6, and lacked judicial authority \u201cto make any of the determinations she has made in this matter to date.\u201d The motion maintained that Perkovich\u2019s failure to provide the certification required by the Rules of Court provided \u201cgood cause\u201d permitting Tracy to withdraw the stipulation (rule 2.831(1)). Tracy also contended that the stipulation and order did not grant Perkovich authority to decide a motion under section 664.6, which was outside the scope of the cause she was hired to judge. The motion was denied on July 11, 2014. Tracy filed a writ petition in this court challenging the ruling, which we denied on September 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">On September 22, 2014, Tracy\u2019s present counsel requested from Perkovich a copy of the \u201cengagement letter and any disclosures signed by [Tracy] that were made by Perkovich,\u201d as well as copies of billing statements in the case and a list of \u201cany articles co-authored by Perkovich and Blevans over the past four years and any seminars they had spoken at together.\u201d Perkovich responded by e-mail as follows: \u201cI gave a verbal disclosure of the personal and professional contacts I have had with Mr. Munsill and Mr. Blevans at our first meeting on October 29, 2012.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] All parties, their attorneys, and their forensic CPAs were present. I disclosed the professional committees I was on with Mr. Munsill and the professional organizations I had in common with both attorneys and the limited social contact I had with each attorney. I disclosed that I had hired both Mr. Munsill and Mr. Blevans to act as judge pro terns, or settlement judges on cases I had and that I had also been hired by each of them previously in the capacity of settlement judge or judge pro tern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On October 7, 2014, Tracy asked the Presiding Judge of the Napa County Superior Court to disqualify Perkovich.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Tracy\u2019s \u201cstatement of disqualification\u201d was based on two separate grounds. The first was that \u201cPerkovich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>violated the Canons of Judicial Ethics by disclosing her mutual judging relationship, if at all, only verbally and off the record,\u201d and \u201cthere is no written waiver.\u201d Tracy\u2019s motion asserted that \u201c[i]t was not until September of 2014 that I first learned that Perkovich uses Blevans as a private judge in cases where she acts as an attorney representing a client in a divorce case (and he returns the favor by using Perkovich as a private judge in cases where Blevans is representing a client in divorce proceedings).\u201d According to Tracy, \u201cPerkovich first disclosed that information in an informal e-mail dated September 22, 2014.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The second ground for disqualification alleged in Tracy\u2019s motion was that any person aware of her conduct \u201cwould have substantial doubt that Perkovich was or could be impartial,\u201d and Perkovich should therefore be disqualified under section 170.1, subdivision (a)(6)(A)(iii). In support of her bias claim, Tracy declared that Perkovich \u201cseemed to visibly favor\u201d Jose and Blevans and \u201ctook steps to block\u201d Tracy\u2019s attorney from introducing evidence supporting her contentions. Perkovich allegedly refused to order Jose to produce bank statements that Tracy claimed would show he was improperly withholding community property for himself; unfairly imposed a levy on the bank account from which Tracy directed payment of spousal support despite knowing the account \u201chad been swept to pay Mr. Blevans $185,000 in attorney fees\u201d and Tracy had no other personal funds; and conducted hearings unfairly, for example by giving no notice she would refuse to receive oral testimony at the July 30, 2013, hearing where she knew Tracy planned to present witnesses. Tracy declared that Perkovich conveyed bias by her \u201cbody language and her tone toward me and Mr. Jackson,\u201d which \u201cwas very different than it was toward Mr. Blevans and [Jose]. She was very standoffish, and regularly appeared to be visibly and noticeably annoyed with me\u201d and \u201coften would stand over me with her arms crossed. She would never make eye contact with me. When [Jose] or Blevans spoke, Perkovich was relaxed and thoughtful, often making helpful comments or asking insightful questions that would help them fully develop the point they were trying to make.\u201d Perkovich also allegedly engaged in \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d interactions with Blevans. \u201cFor example,\u201d Tracy stated, \u201cduring the July 30, 2013, hearing, I personally saw Perkovich flirt with Blevans, proclaiming, \u2018Oh Bob, that\u2019s so funny of you,\u2019 while she batted her eyelashes at him,\u201d and Perkovich and Blevans \u201cinappropriately spoke to each other about the case when my attorney was not present,\u201d which Tracy assertedly learned from an invoice billing her for the time Perkovich spent on the phone, without Tracy\u2019s lawyer, in preparation for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Jackson\u2019s declaration in support of Tracy\u2019s motion to disqualify corroborated Tracy\u2019s description of Perkovich\u2019s different demeanor with Tracy and Jackson than with Jose and Blevans. Jackson noted that Perkovich and Blevans \u201cwere on a first name basis\u201d and \u201cknew things about each other that were not generally known to the public,\u201d such as when Blevans congratulated Perkovich on the birth of her grandchild. Blevans had Perkovich\u2019s \u201cafter hours number,\u201d which Jackson never had, and appeared to have discussed the case with her outside Jackson\u2019s presence. During the proceedings, Perkovich \u201cdemonstrated a strong affinity toward Blevans\u201d through \u201ctone of voice, body language, eye contact and other physical means,\u201d such as rolling her eyes at Jackson and then \u201cmaking knowing eye contact with Blevans\u201d and \u201cshaking her head from side to side.\u201d Perkovich\u2019s \u201cbody language and voicetone toward [Tracy] was almost always very negative, indicating dismissiveness, condescension, and superiority,\u201d while she \u201calways appeared understanding and accommodating toward Jose and Blevans.\u201d Her \u201ctone, body language, and actions led everyone involved to believe that [Tracy] was not going to prevail on any significant issue that might be decided by Perkovich.\u201d Jackson believed Perkovich was aware that her actions were presenting the appearance that she was favoring Blevans and Jose, as indicated by her comment at a hearing that she could see from Tracy\u2019s pleadings and demeanor that Tracy did not trust Perkovich to judge the case fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Additionally, the declaration of Tracy\u2019s current counsel, Keith Dolnick, related an incident in which he believed Perkovich acted in a manner that appeared to favor Jose. After Tracy filed her motion to withdraw the stipulation appointing the temporary judge based on Perkovich\u2019s failure to provide the certification required by rule 2.831(b), Jose\u2019s attorneys sent Perkovich two certifications to sign, one stating that she was aware of and would comply with the applicable provisions and the other adding that the certification was \u201cfurther evidenced by\u201d Perkovich\u2019s \u201cConsent and Oath of Office\u201d in another case, which was attached as an exhibit. Dolnick declared that he objected to this \u201cimproper ex parte communication without prior notice\u201d and asked Perkovich to take no action and remain neutral, to which Blevans responded by telling Perkovich that signing the certification was appropriate \u201cand if it moots the issue raised by Mr. Dolnick, so be it.\u201d Perkovich signed the second certification. Dolnick further described Blevans communicating ex parte with Perkovich after Tracy filed a motion to quash, e-mailing her to ask \u201chow she would like to handle this issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On October 16, 2014, before any hearing or ruling on the request to disqualify, Perkovich delivered to the Presiding Judge of the Napa County Superior Court a letter expressing a desire to recuse herself from the case. Noting that Tracy had filed a motion to disqualify her \u201con the grounds of bias,\u201d the letter asserts that Tracy \u201cclaims a bias in favor of Blevans because Blevans has acted as a private settlement judge on one case where I was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>associated as counsel and because I have been hired on two cases where he was an attorney.\u201d Pointing out that she also \u2018\u201chad the same mutual judging relationship with two of [Tracy\u2019s] previous attorneys, Roger Lewis and John Munsill,\u201d Perkovich disagreed that her prior professional relationship with Blevans constituted bias and stated that Tracy consented to her retention as temporary judge \u2018\u201cafter disclosure from me at our first case management meeting about the details of my professional relationship with both Munsill and Blevans.\u201d Perkovich\u2019s letter to Presiding Judge Stone then ended with the following paragraph: \u201cI have, however, become concerned about my personal safety in this case due to [Tracy\u2019s] conduct. Her behavior has become increasingly hostile with angry outbursts to the point that I am fearful of her. It is also evident from [Tracy\u2019s] ongoing violations of the existing court orders that she will never accept anything I decide. I therefore feel that I am an impediment to resolution of the parties\u2019 case, which is not desirable. It is for these reasons that I request recusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In an order filed on November 7, 2014, Presiding Judge Stone granted Tracy\u2019s request to disqualify Perkovich. The order found that Perkovich\u2019s letter requesting recusal \u2018\u201cdoes not satisfy the requirement of the filing of consent to the disqualification\u201d imposed by section 170.3, subdivision (c)(3),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that \u2018\u201cas a result of her failure to file a consent or a verified answer within the time allowed, Nancy Perkovich is deemed to have consented to her disqualification pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.3[, subdivision] (c)(4).\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The order declared, \u2018\u201cNancy Perkovich is hereby disqualified as Judge Pro Tempore in this action and shall not participate in the proceedings in this action after October 7, 2014,\u201d the date Tracy filed her request for disqualification. The order reassigned the case to Superior Court Judge Diane M. Price.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>The Case Proceeds Before Judge Price</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">On December 10, 2014, Judge Price conducted a hearing on Jose\u2019s motions to reopen discovery and compel the production of documents and Tracy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>motions to quash subpoenas compelling her and Jackson to submit to deposition, all of which related to Jose\u2019s earlier motion to enforce the MOA, which had been submitted to Perkovich but not decided before she was found disqualified. At the hearing before Judge Price, Tracy objected to reopening discovery on matters related to whether she signed the MOA under duress primarily because much of the evidence Jose sought to discover regarding that matter was protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privilege. Rejecting this objection on the ground Tracy\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s declarations constituted a waiver of privilege as to certain communications between her and her attorney, Judge Price reopened discovery related to Jose\u2019s pending motion to enforce the MOA and requests pertaining to attorney fees and spousal support. Judge Price felt it would be \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d to allow Tracy to file declarations discussing her communications with Jackson without allowing discovery by Jose limited to those communications between Tracy and Jackson she relied upon in the declaration she filed in opposition to Jose\u2019s motion to enforce the MOA. Tracy withdrew her objections to the production of documents pertinent to a range of issues that did not implicate the attorney-client and/or work product privileges. Judge Price continued for further hearing Tracy\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena to Jackson and ordered him to submit all responsive documents for the court\u2019s in camera review to determine which were to be produced and whether redaction was required for any attorney-client privilege and/or work product information that had not been waived. Tracy\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena to her was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">On January 28, 2015,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Tracy asked Judge Price to declare void and vacate all orders issued by Perkovich, arguing that the orders of a disqualified judge are void and the disqualification occurs when the facts creating disqualification arise, not when the disqualification is established.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Judge Price subsequently filed an order granting Jose\u2019s motion to continue the hearing on Tracy\u2019s motion, because Tracy had not filed a declaration supporting the relief sought, and the scheduled depositions of Tracy and Jackson might \u201ccover the issues raised\u201d in the motion. Judge Price\u2019s March 2 order also denied Jose\u2019s motion to consolidate the hearings on Tracy\u2019s motion to set aside Perkovich\u2019s orders and Jose\u2019s motion to enforce the MOA because the motions \u201cinvolve discrete issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Meanwhile, at a hearing on February 3, Judge Price granted Jose\u2019s request for appointment of a discovery referee (\u00a7 639, subd. (a)(5)) to attend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>depositions of Tracy and Jackson.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accepting Jose\u2019s arguments, Judge Price granted the request on the basis of three \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d: (1) Tracy\u2019s behavior at the previous deposition was \u201cextraordinarily rude, nonre-sponsive, [and] argumentative,\u201d (2) the attorney-client privilege would probably be raised by Tracy and Jackson and it would be \u201cexpeditious\u201d to have rulings on those objections during the deposition, and (3) Tracy was \u201creluctant\u201d to turn over financial information legally required to be disclosed, and it would be helpful to have a referee present to \u201cmonitor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Also at the February 3 hearing, Judge Price addressed Jose\u2019s earlier motion to award him the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, he incurred in prevailing on his motions to reopen discovery, produce documents, and subpoena Tracy and Jackson for appearances at depositions. Finding that Tracy\u2019s opposition to all of Jose\u2019s discovery requests was without \u201csubstantial justification\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 2024.050, subd. (c), 1987.2, subd. (a))\u2014because it was unreasonable to think she could maintain she did not understand the MOA she signed and was relying on the statements or failures to act of her attorney \u201cand not think that opens the door to discovery\u201d\u2014Judge Price awarded Jose the total amount of $36,091.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">On March 10, Tracy filed a five-page declaration in support of her motion to vacate Perkovich\u2019s orders. Tracy explained that if Perkovich verbally disclosed her professional relationship with Blevans at the settlement conference on October 30, 2012\u2014which was almost seven months after Perkovich was appointed temporary judge\u2014Tracy was unaware of it because \u201cI was either not involved in those discussions or did not believe they were directed at me. Nor did I understand an informal discussion or exchange of pleasantries could later be used to argue that it had forced me to waive valuable rights, including the right to a neutral, unconflicted judge.\u201d Tracy\u2019s declaration reiterated that she did not learn of Perkovich\u2019s mutual judging arrangement with Blevans until the September 2014 e-mail. She also reiterated the concerns stated in her declaration in support of her motion to disqualify Perkovich about the manner in which Perkovich conducted hearings and, in Tracy\u2019s view, her demonstrated bias in favor of Jose and Blevans. Tracy further stated that she had not had any contact with Perkovich since the December 2013 settlement conference, and that she did not recall having any \u201cmeaningful interaction\u201d or exchanging any words with Perkovich at the conference, during which Tracy \u201cspent the large majority of time . . . sitting in my car or in the lobby of Blevans office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\n<em>Perkovich Resists Tracy\u2019s Demand for Refund of Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">On March 27, after Tracy demanded repayment of all fees paid Perkovich pursuant to the terms of the 2012 stipulation and order (Stipulation and Order), Perkovich filed a request for declaratory relief. Asking for \u201cdirection ... as to how she should respond to the demand that she refund all fees and costs paid by [Tracy] pursuant to the Stipulation and Order,\u201d Perkovich stated that she had performed all of the services she was called upon to perform and was entitled to be compensated for that work in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation and Order.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> She also pointed out that the superior court had twice (Oct. 10, 2013, and July 11, 2014) denied Tracy\u2019s requests to withdraw the Stipulation and Order appointing her temporary judge; the second of these rulings found the Stipulation and Order was \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d and, by voluntarily participating in proceedings before Perkovich, Tracy waived \u201cany objection to the Stipulation and Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Perkovich represented that she told the six persons present at the October 2012 settlement conference\u2014Tracy and Jose and their counsel, as well as David Schultze and Darlene Elmore, forensic accountants for the parties\u2014 \u201cabout my professional contacts with each attorney including the fact that (1) I had been hired once before as a judge pro tern in a case where Blevans was an attorney, (2) Blevans was hired as a judge pro tern once in a case where I was an attorney, (3) Munsill was hired as a judge pro tern once in a case where I was an attorney, (4) I was hired as a settlement judge once in a case where Munsill was an attorney, (5) Munsill and I had been previously associated as counsel on a case, (6) I served on the Sacramento Family Law Bar Association Committee with John Munsill and socialized once with he and his wife and children related to that professional organization, and (7) I am a member of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and was acquainted with Blevans from that organization. I also disclosed that I had hired David Schultze, CPA many times on cases throughout my career and had also had him as an opposing expert on many cases. I had not previously met Darlene Elmore, CPA. I asked all parties and attorneys if they were comfortable with my acting as judge pro tern. All parties indicated that they wished me to proceed in that capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Blevans, Elmore, and Schultze all stated in declarations or deposition testimony given in late 2014 or early 2015 that Perkovich verbally disclosed her prior contacts with Blevans and with Munsill at the October 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>meeting, including that she and each of the attorneys had acted as temporary judge in each other\u2019s cases, and that the parties agreed to proceed with Perkovich as temporary judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Munsill testified at a deposition in February 2015 that he recalled Perkovich discussing at the settlement conference \u201cher various prior connections with both [Blevans] and me,\u201d but did not recall \u201cthe details\u201d of that discussion. He did not recall Tracy expressing concerns about Perkovich\u2019s disclosures. Munsill acknowledged that he had a \u201cmutual judging relationship with Perkovich,\u201d each having served as judge in a case where the other represented a party. Munsill stated that he had no reason to believe inaccurate the statement in Blevan\u2019s declaration that after Perkovich\u2019s disclosures at the settlement conference, \u201cboth counsel and the parties acknowledged their understanding and agreement to move forward with Judge Pro Tern Perkovich presiding.\u201d He did not recall presenting Tracy with a written waiver of any potential conflict after Perkovich disclosed her professional relationships with the two attorneys and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t recall there being a need for that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\n<em>Judge Price Expands Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On April 13, over Tracy\u2019s objections, Judge Price granted Jose\u2019s motion to clarify her earlier ruling that Tracy waived her attorney-client privilege regarding matters Jose sought to discover. Judge Price clarified that Tracy\u2019s waiver of the attorney-client privilege included \u201cany communications with or between attorneys Trevor Jackson, Ian Carter, and or Eric Jeppson made from the time period beginning August 9, 2013 (when the parties began active settlement negotiations that lead to the Memorandum of Agreement) to [the] present,\u201d regarding the claims that (1) Tracy \u201cwas not part of the negotiations that took place regarding the Memorandum of Agreement\u201d and \u201chad no input whatsoever\u201d; (2) Eric Jeppson and Ian Carter were not authorized to negotiate the MOA on Tracy\u2019s behalf; (3) Tracy was unclear how the terms of the MOA were reached; (4) Tracy did not understand the terms of the MOA; and (5) Tracy was \u201cforced\u201d to execute the MOA due to a threat that her company would be taken away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Also over Tracy\u2019s objections, Judge Price expanded the time period of the documents relating to negotiation of the MOA that Jackson was required to provide for in camera review in response to Jose\u2019s subpoena duces tecum. In addition to the documents he prepared and gave Tracy between January 10 and January 13, 2014, Jackson was also required to produce those he prepared and provided Tracy during the period from August 9, 2013, to the present. Finally, the April 13 order found that Tracy\u2019s opposition to the foregoing discovery was \u201cnot reasonable\u201d in light of the court\u2019s prior ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>that Tracy waived the attorney-client privilege, and granted Jose\u2019s request for attorney fees and costs under section 1987.2, subdivision (a), in the amount of $6,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\n<em>We Issue an Order Staying All Trial Court Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">On April 16, 2015, we issued an order temporarily staying \u201call discovery proceedings,\u201d including the pending depositions of Tracy and Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">A little more than three weeks later, on May 21, 2015, Jose submitted to the trial court (which stamped the document \u201cReceived\u201d) a memorandum of points and authorities and declaration of Ble vans in support of Perkovich\u2019s right to refuse to refund the fees paid her by Tracy. Blevans stated in his declaration that the Stipulation and Order appointing Perkovich a temporary judge was drafted by Munsill, who did not \u201cinclude any provision authorizing any judge of the Superior Court to make any determination concerning the reasonableness of her fees or to order any refund of fees and costs that were advanced.\u201d Jose argued that Tracy\u2019s demand for a refund of fees she paid could not be granted because such relief was not authorized by the Stipulation and Order under which the fees were paid and because Perkovich was protected by a common law quasi-judicial immunity. The latter contention was based upon <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Drapkin </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 843 [271 Cal.Rptr. 893], which was a civil action seeking damages for professional negligence against a psychologist evaluating a child custody dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Tracy had responded to Perkovich\u2019s request for declaratory relief in a brief dated May 18 that, at least in the record before us, does not bear any stamp from the trial court. Relying on cases, such as <em>A.I. Credit Corp., Inc. v. Aguilar &amp; Sebastinelli </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1072 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 813] <em>(Aguilar), </em>holding as a matter of law that \u201can attorney disqualified for violating an ethical obligation is not entitled to fees\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1079), Tracy argued a private judge disqualified for violation of an ethical obligation should not be treated differently.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Tracy emphasized that Perkovich\u2019s request ignored the crucial fact that all of the orders she was paid by the parties to make were void and had to be vacated, and that the Stipulation and Order had no bearing on Perkovich\u2019s rights after she was disqualified for violating ethical obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>At the time we issued our stay, Judge Price had issued no ruling on Perkovich\u2019s request for declaratory fees regarding her entitlement to the fees Tracy had advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">On June 2, a week after Jose filed his support for Perkovich\u2019s request for declaratory relief, Tracy asked this court to expand the scope of the temporary stay of discovery we issued on April 16 because, since issuance of that stay, Perkovich had been aggressively pursuing her motion for declaratory relief, Jose had asked Judge Price to direct Tracy to advance him $250,000 for attorney fees he might incur in this and related efforts, and a hearing on many of Jose\u2019s requests had been set for June 1, 2015. Tracy represented that her attorneys \u201chave been required to prepare multiple opposition/responses and participate in multiple hearings in response to the flurry of paperwork initiated by [Jose] and Perkovich\u201d and that counsel for Jose refused to stipulate to a stay of litigation in the trial court pending action on this writ petition. Tracy maintained that the discovery issues Jose and the trial court were preoccupied with should have been put on hold pending a determination whether the rulings of a disqualified judge are void and must be vacated, because that determination would facilitate a resolution of most other issues presented, including Perkovich\u2019s right to receive fees for services rendered in violation of her ethical obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On June 3, we expanded the earlier stay by additionally staying \u201call trial court proceedings\u201d pending determination of this writ petition or further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The fundamental question presented is whether the rulings of disqualified Temporary Judge Perkovich are void and must be set aside. If so, additional questions are whether Perkovich must refund fees she received for her services and whether the disqualifying acts of the temporary judge so tainted the MOA that it must be deemed unenforceable, and so tainted the proceedings before Judge Price that her rulings must also be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\n<em>Disqualified Temporary Judge Perkovich\u2019s Orders Are All Void and Must Be Vacated</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Under section 170.1, \u201c(a) A judge shall be disqualified if any one or more of the following are true: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (6)(A) For any reason: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (iii) A person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.\u201d (\u00a7 170.1, subd. (a)(6)(A)(iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>As we have said, Tracy\u2019s motion to disqualify was based on Perkovich\u2019s alleged violation of canon 6D by failing to disclose her personal or professional relationships with Blevans \u201cin writing or on the record\u201d and failure to obtain the parties\u2019 written waiver to disqualification on that ground and file it with the record as required by section 170.3, subdivision (b)(1). The motion to disqualify was also based upon the claim that Perkovich\u2019s conduct during the proceedings over which she presided demonstrated that she was actually biased and prejudiced against Tracy. Tracy maintains that a person aware of the facts Perkovich declined to disclose in writing or on the record, and/or her biased conduct during the proceedings, \u201cmight reasonably entertain a doubt that [Perkovich] would be able to be impartial.\u201d (Canon 6D(3)(a)(vii)(C); \u00a7 170.1, subd. (a)(6)(A)(iii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The statutory scheme governing the disqualification process presents three options to a judge whose impartiality has been challenged by the filing of a statement of disqualification. First, the judge may, \u201c[wjithout conceding his or her disqualification, . . . request any other judge agreed upon by the parties to sit and act in his or her place.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(2).) The second option is to timely \u201cfile a consent to disqualification in which case the judge shall notify the presiding judge ... of his or her recusal\u201d and the presiding judge appoints a replacement. (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(3).) The third option is to \u201cfile a written verified answer admitting or denying any or all of the allegations contained in the party\u2019s statement and setting forth any additional facts material or relevant to the question of disqualification.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Presiding Judge Stone held that Perkovich\u2019s October 16, 2014, letter requesting recusal (for reasons independent of Tracy\u2019s allegations in her statement of disqualification) did not constitute a consent to disqualification within the meaning of section 170.3, subdivision (c)(3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>\n                   Judge Stone therefore applied section 170.3, subdivision (c)(4), which provides that where a challenged judge fails to timely file either a consent or an answer to the statement of disqualification, he or she \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to his or her disqualification.\u201d (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The meaning of this determination is disputed by the parties: In Tracy\u2019s view, \u201cconsent\u201d and \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to disqualification are equivalent to admitting the facts alleged in the statement of disqualification. Jose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sees it differently, viewing \u201cconsent to disqualification\u201d as consent to being removed from the case <em>without </em>admission of the truth of the alleged basis for disqualification. Jose\u2019s view misinterprets the statutory scheme. As indicated, the option section 170.3 provides for a challenged judge who wishes to consent to disqualification \u201c[wjithout conceding\u201d there is a factual basis for disqualification is to \u201crequest any other judge agreed upon by the parties to sit and act in his or her place.\u201d (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(2).) Perkovich elected not to pursue that course. Nor did she file a response to the motion to disqualify her. Instead, informally, by letter to Judge Stone, she denied Tracy\u2019s allegations and sought recusal on different grounds. Because she elected not to either seek replacement or file a consent or an answer conteshng Tracy\u2019s allegations as provided in section 170.3, Perkovich was properly \u201cdeemed to have consented\u201d to her disqualification. That determination treats the judge\u2019s failure to file a response to the statement of disqualification as an admission of the truth of its allegations, and authorizes the presiding judge to appoint a replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">It is settled that, as stated in <em>Urias, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 415, \u201c[w]hen no answer is filed in response to a statement of disqualification, <em>the facts set out in the statement </em>are taken as true.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424, italics added.) In support of that proposition, the <em>Urias </em>court cited the statement in <em>Oak Grove School Dist. </em>v. <em>City Title Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678 [32 Cal.Rptr. 288] <em>(Oak Grove) </em>that where the \u201cstatement of disqualification\u201d of the party seeking disqualification \u201cis legally sufficient and the judge fails to file an answer thereto within five days,[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] the facts alleged in the statement must be taken as true and the judge becomes disqualified automatically.\u201d <em>(Oak Grove, </em>at p. 702.) The California Supreme Court was equally clear in <em>Calhoun v. Superior Court </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 257, 262 [331 P.2d 648]: After identifying the two factual issues raised by the statement of disqualification, the court concluded, \u201csince the judge has failed to file a written answer to the statement of bias and prejudice, verified as required by sechon 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the facts alleged in the statement must be taken as true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The opinion in <em>Oak Grove </em>stated that that the failure of a challenged judge to file a verified answer within the specified period \u201chas the same effect as if the judge admits his disqualification or is found disqualified.\u201d <em>(Oak Grove, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.2d at p. 702.) As <em>Urias, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 415 explained, a challenged judge \u201ccannot simply ignore [a statement of disqualification], If the judge does not strike the statement [as untimely or legally insufficient on its face] and wants to contest his disqualification, he must file an answer within section 170.3, subdivision (c)(3)\u2019s 10-day period admitting or denying the allegations in the statement. If he fails to do so, he is deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>to have consented to the disqualification and he is disqualified.\u201d <em>(Urias, </em>at p. 421.) In short, <em>Urias, Oak Grove, </em>and the cases they rely upon stand for the proposition that the facts alleged in a statement of disqualification must be considered true where, as here, the judge whose impartiality was challenged fails to consent to or challenge the allegations of the statement of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Repeatedly dismissing <em>Urias </em>and <em>Oak Grove </em>as \u2018\u201clacking substantive analysis\u201d and \u2018\u201cwithout analytical support\u201d Jose claims they are also distinguishable, because \u2018\u201cthe facts establishing disqualification in [those cases] were undisputed, making the only relevant issue the legal sufficiency of the statement of disqualification.\u201d According to Jose, unlike the situations in <em>Urias </em>and <em>Oak Grove, </em>the facts alleged in Tracy\u2019s statement of disqualification <em>are </em>disputed. Moreover, Jose argues, because Perkovich declined to answer the statement of disqualification, he was left \u2018\u201cwith no alternative but to stipulate to her disqualification with the caveat that he did not agree that Perkovich is subject to disqualification for the reasons stated in Tracy\u2019s motion.\u201d In other words, Jose asserts that Perkovich\u2019s failure to dispute the allegations of Tracy\u2019s statement of disqualification cannot deprive him of the right to contest the truth of those allegations. He states, \u2018\u201c[b]efore any fact is determined to be true and used to adversely affect a party, that party must be given the opportunity to be heard concerning whether or not those facts are true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The dispute Jose perceives and desires to engage in is whether the unanswered allegations of Tracy\u2019s statement of disqualification are factually true. But he offers no authority for the proposition that a party has a right to dispute grounds for disqualification alleged by another party which the challenged judge does not contest. The only instance in which the statutory scheme appears to allow a party to participate in a disqualification dispute is when the challenged judge files an answer denying any or all of the allegations contained in a statement of disqualification, and the judge deciding the question of disqualification sets the matter for hearing or receives evidence in some other fashion. (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">If, as Jose maintains, a judge who files neither a consent nor an answer to the statement of disqualification filed by a party does not dispositively concede the truth of the facts alleged in the statement, a challenged judge\u2019s failure to respond to a motion to disqualify would be relatively inconsequential and render purposeless section 170.3, subdivision (c)(2), which expressly permits a challenged judge to secure a replacement without conceding disqualification. The statutory scheme places the decision whether to contest the factual basis of a statement of disqualification solely in the hands of the challenged judge. Jose fails to appreciate that, as <em>Urias </em>explained and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>previously noted (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 26, fn. 15), a request for disqualification is not genuinely a \u201cmotion\u201d but in the nature of a charging document: a \u201cwritten verified statement objecting to the hearing or trial before the judge and setting forth the facts conshtuhng the grounds for disqualification of the judge.\u201d (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(1).) \u201c[T]he determination of a judge\u2019s disqualification is outside the usual law and motion procedural rules.\u201d <em>(Urias, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 422.) \u201cWhile the challenged judge and ah parties must be served with the statement of disqualification, the matter need not be set for hearing. Moreover, while the judge determining the issue may request argument or evidence from the other parties, he is not obligated to do so. Accordingly, [a party] cannot complain that it was not given an opportunity to be heard before the judge was disqualified.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Permitting a party to defend the propriety of allegedly unethical conduct and bias where the challenged judge refuses to respond at ah to the charges, and is therefore deemed to have consented to the allegations in the statement of disqualification, would wreak havoc with the disqualification process prescribed by the Legislature in sechon 170.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Because she pursued neither of the ophons provided by subdivision (c)(2) and (3) of section 170.3, Perkovich left Presiding Judge Stone with no alternative but to deem her to have conceded disqualification on the factual bases alleged in Tracy\u2019s motion. Perkovich could have avoided this result by consulting section 170.3 and following one of the options it sets forth for responding to a statement of disqualification. Blevans\u2019s office specifically called her attention to the statute in a letter sent to Perkovich the day after Tracy filed the statement of disqualification. While this letter omitted reference to the option that would have permitted Perkovich to do what Jose now maintains she should be seen as having done\u2014remove herself from the case without conceding the disqualification\u2014this option would have been apparent if Perkovich had referred to the statute.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(2).) As authorized by section 170.3, provided Judge Stone decided the disqualification issue solely on the basis of the statement of disqualification (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(6)); he did not conduct an evidentiary hearing <em>(ibid.) </em>because Perkovich did not seek or provide any need for a hearing. And while we recognize that Judge Stone made \u201cno finding\u201d as to the truth of the allegations of Tracy\u2019s statement of disqualification, the legal effect of Perkovich\u2019s failure to file a response was that she effectively conceded disqualification was warranted on the grounds alleged and no factual determination by the court was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The dissent objects to our application of these principles on the theory that Perkovich\u2019s letter, although neither verified nor stated under penalty of perjury, was a \u201cresponse\u201d to the statement of disqualification. In the sense that it was written in reaction to the statement of disqualification, yes. But rather than admitting or denying Tracy\u2019s allegations, the letter was dismissive of the claimed inadequate disclosure, made no mention of the detailed examples of conduct Tracy claimed reflected actual bias, and requested recusal for a reason independent of the alleged basis for disqualification\u2014 Perkovich\u2019s professed fear of Tracy. Perkovich was not attempting to \u201canswer\u201d the statement of disqualification within the meaning of section 170.3; she was attempting to circumvent the procedures required by the statute.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">We also take issue with the insistence of the dissent that Tracy\u2019s motion to disqualify was untimely. To be sure, the motion was filed long after the conference at which Perkovich assertedly made her verbal disclosures. But the dissent utterly disregards Tracy\u2019s claim that she did not hear or understand the significance of any such disclosures. Tracy claimed that she learned Perkovich had not disclosed her mutual judging relationship with Blevans in writing or on the record only after her current counsel sought documentation of Perkovich\u2019s disclosures and Perkovich responded that they had been made verbally at the October 2012 conference. Tracy filed her motion to disqualify two weeks later. It is only by assuming Tracy\u2019s claim to be untrue that the dissent can view her to have violated the requirement of moving for disqualification \u201cat the earliest practicable opportunity.\u201d (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(1).) The record provides no basis for this assumption; on the contrary, under the principles just discussed, Tracy\u2019s allegations must be taken as true. Perkovich could have challenged the timeliness of the disqualification motion, but she chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Jose claims it would raise \u201cfundamental due process concerns\u201d if Tracy\u2019s allegations were accepted as true for any purpose that would \u201cadversely affect Jose.\u201d The authority he cites is <em>In re Marriage of Kelso </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 374 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 39] <em>(Kelso), </em>a marital dissolution proceeding in which the wife\u2019s former attorney sought attorney fees and costs. The commissioner presiding over the case recused himself from determining that issue, stating he was biased against the former attorney, but then, at a hearing with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>notice to the former attorney or opportunity for her to be heard, addressed \u201c \u2018the whole issue of attorney fees\u2019 \u201d and ordered the wife to pay $5,000 as a sanction for making the litigation unduly acrimonious. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 379-380.) The new judge to whom the issue of the former attorney fees had been assigned then refused to conduct a hearing, finding it would be futile in light of the commissioner\u2019s findings that the wife was not entitled to any award of attorney fees and costs. Reversing, the Court of Appeal explained that the judge should not have relied upon findings made by the commissioner after he had recused himself and without providing the former attorney an opportunity to be heard. Because the right to the award is the party\u2019s, not the attorney\u2019s, \u201ca judicial officer who is disqualified from ruling on the motion because of bias against the attorney cannot rule on the motion indirectly by ruling against the party. The issues are too intertwined to permit such a splitting of the disqualification.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 383.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Jose describes <em>Kelso </em>in a parenthetical as holding that \u2018\u201cit is error to give conclusive effect to the findings of a Commissioner that were made after he recused himself and without affording one party the opportunity to be heard,\u201d and does not otherwise explain its applicability to the case at hand. But the situations have nothing in common. In <em>Kelso, </em>the commissioner tried to justify adjudicating matters he was disqualified from hearing by artificially separating the interests of the attorney he was biased against from those of the wife, resulting in the former attorney being denied her right to a hearing on the previously reserved issue of her right to a fee. The case says nothing about a party\u2019s right to be heard when a challenged judge declines to contest the allegations of a statement of disqualification under section 170.3.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Jose does not explain how he is \u2018\u201cadversely affect[ed]\u201d by the factual allegations of the disqualification statement being taken as true. Presumably, his concern is with having lost his chosen decision maker and her rulings, as well as the time and money spent on all the proceedings. As we have no occasion to review the merits of the rulings involved here, neither Jose nor this court can anticipate whether the ultimate outcome of the dissolution proceedings will be more or less favorable to him. While we recognize that a party may be adversely affected by the disqualification of a judge who has participated in a complex proceeding, that price may have to be paid. It is justified by the need for enforcement of the disqualification statutes, which are designed \u201c \u2018to ensure public confidence in the judiciary and to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>right of the litigants to a fair and impartial adjudicator . . . \u201d <em>(Peracchi v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1245, 1251 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 639, 70 P.3d 1054].)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Under section 170.3 and the case law we have discussed, we conclude that Perkovich was disqualified for the reasons stated in the statement of disqualification\u2014that is, because a person aware of her failure to disclose her mutual judging relationship with Blevans in writing or on the record, and her conduct indicative of bias and prejudice, might reasonably entertain a doubt about her impartiality. The cases Tracy relies upon, culminating most recently in <em>Christie, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th 767, and <em>Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th 1353, compel us to also agree with her contention that all the orders issued by Perkovich were void.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In <em>Christie </em>the trial court set aside a nonsuit and dismissal in favor of the city, its police department, and police officers in an arrestee\u2019s action for false arrest and wrongful imprisonment. The trial court granted a new trial after finding that the judge who granted the nonsuit was disqualified to act in the matter as of the time at which he had had a conversation with a previously disqualified judge. Having found the judge who granted nonsuit disqualified to rule on the matter, the trial court set aside the resulting dismissal as void.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In affirming this determination, the Court of Appeal explained that \u201c[e]xcept in very limited circumstances not applicable here, a disqualified judge has no power to act in any proceedings after his or her disqualification.\u201d <em>(Christie, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 776.) Significantly, the appellate court emphasized that \u2018\u201cdisqualification occurs when the facts creating disqualification arise, not when disqualification is established. [Citations.] The acts of a judge subject to disqualification are void or, according to some authorities, voidable.[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>] [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Christie, </em>at p. 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\"><em>Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th 1353, which relied on <em>Christie, </em>was an action by a trust against a bank alleging numerous causes of action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tort and contract arising from financial transactions. The bank sought and obtained arbitration and an arbitration award was entered in favor of the bank. The parties filed cross-petitions to vacate and confirm the award. The trial judge who had issued the order compelling arbitration, the Honorable Alexander Williams III, disqualified himself under section 170.1, subdivision (a)(8), because he had engaged in conversations with private dispute resolution providers regarding possible employment prior to issuing his order compelling arbitration. After the matter was transferred to a new judge, the trial court granted the trust\u2019s motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration due to disqualified Judge Williams\u2019s lack of authority to issue that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The Court of Appeal held that Judge Williams was properly disqualified under section 170.1 and the order compelling arbitration was void. Quoting <em>Christie, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th 767, the court explained: \u201c \u2018[Disqualification occurs when the facts creating disqualification arise, not when the disqualification is established\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[I]t is the fact of disqualification that controls, not subsequent judicial action on that disqualification.\u2019 [Citation.] On February 25, 2004, Judge Williams had before him a motion to compel arbitration in this case. At that point in time he had, within the past two years, participated in discussions regarding prospective employment as a dispute resolution neutral. He was therefore disqualified from the case, regardless of his lack of knowledge of the law providing for his disqualification. His order compelling arbitration was therefore void.\u201d <em>(Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1363, italics omitted; see \u00a7 170.1, subd. (a)(8)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Tracy also relies on <em>Urias, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d 415, in which, after summary judgment was granted for the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney learned that the judge\u2019s former law firm had represented the defendant for the past 10 years. The court held that, \u201d[b]ecause the summary judgment [had been] rendered by a disqualified judge, the judgment was voidable upon [the] plaintiff\u2019s objection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In short, Tracy contends the case law establishes that Perkovich\u2019s orders were all void and must be set aside because all issued after Perkovich\u2019s failure to comply with the Code of Judicial Ethics, which constituted one of the grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Jose disagrees, arguing that the cases Tracy relies on are all inapplicable because the facts establishing disqualification in those cases were undisputed, whereas those in the present case are disputed. As we have explained, Perkovich\u2019s failure to file a consent or answer to the statement of disqualification established the truth of the facts it alleged. There is no basis for Jose\u2019s apparent assumption that the rulings of a judge who neither consents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>disqualification nor answers a motion to disqualify cannot be declared void and vacated without an independent judicial hearing as to whether the unanswered allegations of the statement of disqualification are true and constitute grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">It is important to clarify that we are not holding that the facts alleged in the statement of disqualification have been determined to be true for any purpose other than establishing the basis of disqualification and consequences thereof. Nor are we making an independent factual finding that Perkovich failed to verbally disclose the mutual judging relationship or that she was in fact biased and prejudiced against Tracy, matters upon which we express no opinion. What we <em>are </em>saying is that by operation of the disqualification statute, the facts alleged in the statement of disqualification and not disputed by the challenged judge must be taken as true for purposes of determining the basis and effect of a disqualification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">None of the alternative arguments Jose advances in order to sustain Perkovich\u2019s rulings stands up to scruhny. The first is that, even if Perkovich did violate canon 6D(5)(a), her orders should not be deemed void and set aside because section 170.3, subdivision (b)(4), provides that if a judge is disqualified before he or she has completed judicial action in a proceeding, \u201cin the absence of good cause the rulings he or she has made up to that time shall not be set aside by the judge who replaces the disqualified judge.\u201d As earlier explained, \u201cdisqualification occurs when the facts creahng disqualification arise, not when the disqualification is established.\u201d <em>(Christie, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.4th at p. 776; see <em>Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1363.) The facts creating disqualification in this case first occurred in October 2012, when Perkovich was required, but failed, to make her on the record disclosures. This preceded ah of her rulings.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In these circumstances, preserving the orders she made prior to the disqualification order would undermine the purpose of the ethical rules she violated and the disqualification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">While the text of section 170.3, subdivision (b)(4)\u2014\u201c[i]f grounds for disqualification are first learned of or arise after the judge has made one or more rulings ... in the absence of good cause the rulings he or she has made up to that time shah not be set aside\u201d\u2014read literally and in isolation, might support Jose\u2019s reading, the context in which this text appears demonstrates it does not apply to the situation presented in this case. Subdivision (b) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>section 170.3 addresses only the situation of \u201c[a] judge who determines himself or herself to be disqualified.\u201d Subdivision (b)(4), therefore, necessarily applies when the grounds for disqualification \u201carise after\u201d or \u201care first learned of\u2019 <em>by the judge. </em>This makes sense, because the rulings made prior to the existence or knowledge of the disqualifying facts likely were not affected by them. Outside the context of a judge recognizing his or her own disqualification, subdivision (b)(4) does not apply. Aside from the fact that this conclusion is required by the structure of the statute, to conclude otherwise would be to validate rulings made by a judge who was disqualified at the time the rulings were made simply because the parties had not yet learned of the grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Jose\u2019s argument is also unavailing because consideration of the circumstances he relies upon to show the absence of good cause to vacate Perkovich\u2019s rulings would effectively vitiate the ethical obligation she failed to discharge. The mitigating circumstance Jose relies on most heavily is that Perkovich \u201cfully and completely disclosed her prior professional relationships with counsel for the parties\u2019 and the parties\u2019 forensic CPAs\u201d at the first settlement conference on October 30, 2012, and Tracy was not prejudiced by the fact that the disclosures were not made on the record within five days of her designation as a temporary judge. But the fact and effect of a verbal disclosure is disputed: Tracy insists she did not hear Perkovich describe her professional relationship with counsel. Moreover, Jose ignores the fact that Munsill, the only one of Tracy\u2019s attorneys with whom Perkovich had a professional relationship and knew of the relationship with Blevans, quickly substituted out as Tracy\u2019s attorney and Perkovich never disclosed her professional relationship with Blevans to the attorneys who represented Tracy during almost all of the proceedings, until one of them finally sought the disclosures that were never made in writing or placed on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Munsill\u2019s departure from the case also defeats Jose\u2019s suggestion that because Perkovich\u2019s mutual judging relationships were with counsel for \u201cboth parties,\u201d she lacked any incentive to favor one over the other. Even if Munsill had remained, the argument misses the point. There is no telling how a temptation to stray from impartiality in one direction may balance out against a temptation pulling in another direction. If there is conflict of interest adverse to a party, that party is entitled to know and to make a decision whether to proceed regardless of whether there is a second conflict that may work in her favor. It would distort the purpose of ethical rules to say that a failure to disclose a relationship with one party is excused because the judge <em>also </em>failed to disclose a relationship with the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In any case, the reason both disclosure and any waiver are required to be in writing and/or on the record is to eliminate the use of other, much less certain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>factors of the sort Jose relies upon to create doubt whether disclosure has been made or disqualification waived. The wisdom of requiring both disclosure and waiver to be in writing or on the record is dramatically demonstrated by this case, as is the need to enforce the requirement rigorously. The parties dispute whether Tracy was aware, or can be charged with knowledge, of the verbal disclosures Perkovich represents she made, as well as the scope of the disclosure. In the absence of documented disclosures and a documented waiver, we are presented with a sideshow of competing declarations and deposition transcripts describing what the participants in the October 2012 settlement conference\u2014the parties, the lawyers, two expert witnesses and the temporary judge herself\u2014remembered two years later about what Perkovich said and how Tracy responded. There have been discovery disputes, motions, and writ proceedings\u2014all relating to issues completely extraneous to the primary dispute between the parties. The dispute over whether there was a disclosure and whether there was a waiver, and if not, the effect of the disqualification, has consumed an inordinate amount of the trial court\u2019s and this court\u2019s time, not to mention the parties\u2019 and their counsel\u2019s, and significantly delayed the ultimate resolution of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Lauding the many virtues of private judges in matrimonial cases, which we do not dispute, our dissenting colleague takes us to task, first, for \u201cshowing] no appreciation for the realities of the situation, no consideration for what I understand, anecdotally at least, to be the real life facts facing trial judges,\u201d and, secondly, for our indifference to the fact that Perkovich lacked the resources available to sitting judges sought to be disqualified and had to act \u201con her own.\u201d (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 72.) With all due respect, we think it is the dissent that ignores the pertinent realities, and also Perkovich\u2019s deliberate disregard of the statutory disqualification scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The reality that seems to us most pertinent to this case is that, unlike permanent judges, temporary judges operate in a context that greatly increases the likelihood of potential conflicts. Temporary judges have broad powers substantially comparable to those of a sitting judges <em>(In re Estate of Kent </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 154, 163 [57 P.2d 901]), but most who serve as temporary judges simultaneously maintain private law practices, as in this case. Consequently, these lawyer/judges commonly engage in continuing business relationships with lawyers likely to come before the court to which they are appointed\u2014unlike public judges, who are precluded from doing so by the provision of canon 4D(1)(b) that \u201c[a] judge shall not engage in financial or business dealings that . . . involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with lawyers or other persons likely to appear before the court on which the judge serves.\u201d This is particularly true within a specialized field like matrimonial law, the legal area most private judges engage in. (Comment, <em>The Marriage of Family Law and Private Judging in California </em>(2007) 116 Yale L.J. 1615, 1617 [more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>half of private judges\u2019 cases in California are family law disputes].) The private practice of most temporary judges therefore presents a greater likelihood reasonable doubt can be cast on their impartiality than on that of permanent judges. Moreover, because temporary judges are appointed and supervised by the presiding judges of the superior courts, doubts about the impartiality of private judges may also reflect adversely on the integrity of the California judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The gravity of this danger, and the likelihood lawyers who serve as temporary judges may not be as acculturated as full time judges to the demands of the Code of Judicial Ethics, are undoubtedly reasons the Rules of Court require such lawyers to certify to their awareness of and compliance with \u201capplicable provisions of canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Ethics and the California Rules of Court.\u201d (Rule 2.831(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Although disclosure may be onerous, matrimonial practitioners (and others who frequently participate in the private judging process) have a greater interest in assiduous disclosure than they may realize. As one such practitioner has pointed out, the use by the \u201csmall\u201d and \u201ccollegial\u201d family law bar \u201cof our friends, colleagues, and prior opposing counsel as private judges unwittingly exposes all of us, as a community and as individuals, to potential liability for violations of the various ethical canons, claims of cronyism, allegations of bias, complaints of self-dealing, and malpractice law suits. I believe that we are well Mentioned, but I also believe the problems related to the inter-relationships of our bar in this way have been \u2018under-discussed\u2019 and \u2018under-examined. \u2019 \u201d (Hersh, <em>Ethical Considerations in Appointing our Colleagues as Private Judge </em>(2009) 31 No. 4 Family L. News 31.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The requirement that disclosure be \u201cin writing or on the record,\u201d as well as that any waiver of disqualification be in writing and recite the basis of disqualification (see \u00a7 170.3, subd. (b)(1)), cannot be treated casually by a temporary judge except at his or her peril\u2014and also that of the system of private judging in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The dissent\u2019s lament that Perkovich lacked the resources available to permanent judges sought to be disqualified, and was obliged to act on her own, is unconvincing. First of all, Blevans informed Perkovich of the requirements of the disqualification scheme spelled out in section 170.3 and advised her to either consent to disqualification or answer the motion (see, <em>ante, </em>at p. 40, fn. 27), which advice she ignored. Secondly, the alternatives available to Perkovich set forth in section 170.3 are not complicated. Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>as we have said, the dissent\u2019s acceptance of Perkovich\u2019s hand-delivered letter to Judge Stone\u2014which was highly unprofessional in several ways\u2014as the functional equivalent of a \u201cwritten verified answer\u201d to the motion to disqualify (see dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 73-74) that satisfies the requirements of section 170.3, subdivision (c)(3), seems to us extraordinarily unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Jose and the dissent suggest that the stipulation and order designating Perkovich temporary judge, which was signed by the parties and their attorneys, should be considered a timely waiver of the \u201con the record\u201d disclosure requirement. They rely on paragraph 4 of the stipulation, which simply states: \u201cBoth parties waive the clerk\u2019s minutes.\u201d The obvious meaning of this brief sentence is simply that the parties intended to forgo formal clerk\u2019s minutes for the proceedings to be held before the temporary judge. It is a waiver of formal clerk\u2019s minutes in general, making no reference to disclosures or otherwise suggesting it was designed to eliminate the need for the written or on the record disclosure mandated by the Code of Judicial Ethics. The fact that memorialization in the clerk\u2019s minutes is among several ways a disclosure can be placed on the record<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> does not provide a sufficient basis upon which to infer that the parties\u2019 choice to forgo formal clerk\u2019s minutes in general constitutes a waiver of the specific requirement for on-the-record disclosure. And in any event, paragraph 4 certainly did not waive the alternative means by which the statute allows a disclosure to be documented\u2014\u201cin writing.\u201d If the parties\u2019 choice to forgo a formal record meant disclosures were not required to be, or could not be, made \u201con the record,\u201d it was incumbent upon Perkovich to make them \u201cin writing\u201d as required by canon 6D(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">As for Jose\u2019s argument that Tracy waived disqualification after Perkovich verbally disclosed her professional relationships with counsel, as we have said, section 170.3, subdivision (b)(1), requires a waiver of disqualification to \u201crecite the basis for the disqualification\u201d and to be \u201csigned by all parties and their attorneys and filed in the record.\u201d (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (b)(1).) No such waiver exists in the present case. Jose maintains section 170.3, subdivision (b)(1), is inapplicable because it relates to the situation in which a judge \u201cdetermines himself or herself to be disqualified after disclosing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>basis for his or her disqualification on the record,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and Perkovich did not find herself disqualified. But neither Jose nor the dissent, which adopts Jose\u2019s argument, explains how Perkovich\u2019s failure to disclose the basis for her disqualification can excuse the requirement of a written waiver that would apply if she had properly determined herself disqualified after disclosing the basis of that determination. The information Perkovich was obliged to disclose was clearly disqualifying\u2014a professional relationship between the temporary judge and counsel for one of the parties in which each had the power to determine the outcome of the other\u2019s cases, thereby affecting each other\u2019s financial and professional interests.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Neither her failure to disclose those disqualifying facts as required, nor any failure on her part to recognize that they were disqualifying, can relieve Perkovich of the additional obligation to obtain a written waiver that describes the disqualifying conduct to which it refers. Accepting the dissent\u2019s view that the requirement of a written waiver applies only where the judge actually finds himself or herself disqualified would permit a disqualified judge to avoid the consequences of disqualification, even in the absence of a waiver, by simply failing to acknowledge his or her own disqualifying conduct. Such a result cannot be countenanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Finally, the implied waiver cases Jose relies upon are inapposite. To be sure, parties can waive disqualification by their conduct where they are aware of grounds for disqualification but continue to participate in the proceedings without raising the objection. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(2015) 60 Cal.4th 966, 978-979 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 612, 343 P.3d 808] <em>(Johnson) </em>[judge disclosed close personal and professional relationship with prosecutor; defense counsel stated readiness to proceed and defendant personally agreed]; <em>Las Canoas Co., Inc. v.

But here, Tracy stated that she was not aware of Perkovich\u2019s mutual judging relationship with Blevans until shortly before she filed her statement of disqualification. By failing to answer the statement of disqualification, Perkovich conceded these facts. Perkovich was disqualified as of the time she should have disclosed her professional relationship with respondent\u2019s attorney in writing or on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">None of the implied waiver cases upon which Jose and the dissent rely purport to establish a rule applicable in all circumstances, and none involve the circumstances presented here. These cases address waiver of known bases for disclosure; none address waiver of the disclosure itself, and none involved a clearly disqualifying direct conflict of interest like the one presented here or an unwaivable claim of personal bias and prejudice. In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at pages 977-978, the judge disclosed a close personal and professional relationship with the prosecutor, stating that \u201c \u2018there was never anything inappropriate,\u2019 \u201d they did not discuss business, and \u201c \u2018there\u2019s always a separation and a distance from what I do as a judge.\u2019 \u201d Defense counsel represented that he had explained to the defendant that in his experience, judges with whom he had personal relationships nevertheless ruled impartially, and both counsel and the defendant agreed to proceed. The potential conflict in <em>Johnson </em>was thus the amorphous possibility of the judge favoring one attorney, perhaps unconsciously, due to familiarity and personal fondness. (See also <em>Las Canoas Co., Inc. v. Kramer, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.4th at p. 101 [judge in civil suit against court reporter disclosed having used the reporter\u2019s services in private practice].) The risk of divided loyalty, conscious or unconscious, is considerably stronger where, as here, the temporary judge has a direct professional incentive to favor an attorney who has been and likely again will be in a position to determine the outcome of cases in which the present temporary judge acts as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In <em>Steven O., supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at page 55, the issue was that the referee who presided over hearings on two juvenile supplemental petitions alleging probation violations had been the prosecutor on the original petition. The prior representation may have given the now-judge background information about the minor, but to the extent any such information went beyond what was presented at the hearings on the probation violations, judges often are called upon to put aside inadmissible evidence of which they are aware. That the judge has heard these things \u201c \u2018does not mean that [s]he cannot divorce them from [her] mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1206 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354] <em>(Scott), </em>quoting <em>People v. Beaumaster </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 996, 1009 [95 Cal.Rptr. 360].) In <em>Scott, </em>at page 1207, the defendant argued on appeal that the judge who presided over his court trial should have disqualified herself because, at pretrial hearings at which he was not present, the judge received information that made it impossible for her to remain impartial. The court noted (in the context of a different issue) that the information the judge had received was not of a type that would undermine the judge\u2019s impartiality, as the pretrial hearings were solely concerned with ensuring a defense witness would appear for trial and not with the witness\u2019s credibility. The same reasoning\u2014that a judge is presumed able to put aside inadmissible information\u2014applies to <em>Tri Counties Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.4th at pages 1336-1338, in which the judge allegedly undertook an improper independent investigation of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In our view, none of the foregoing cases supports excusing the statutory requirement of a written waiver where a judge who has business and professional relationships with counsel in the proceeding that constitute an actual direct conflict of interest, and are required to be disclosed on the record in writing, fails to make the disclosures as required and then fails to contest a statement of disqualification based on the insufficient disclosure. A fortiori they do not excuse the requirement when the alleged basis of disqualification is conduct indicating actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Drawing on the evidence discussed above that Perkovich verbally disclosed her mutual judging relationships with both Blevans and Munsill at the October 2012 settlement conference, and Tracy\u2019s claim that she did not hear such disclosures, Jose and the dissent emphasize that a client\u2019s personal waiver is not necessary where counsel chooses not to challenge a judge. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at p. 980; Scott, <em>supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1207.) Aside from our view, just discussed, that implied waiver does not apply in the particular circumstances of this case, it is worth observing that <em>Johnson, </em>while stating that \u201cdeciding whether to challenge a judge\u201d is one of the tactical decisions surrendered by a defendant represented by professional counsel, in fact involved a defendant who, after the judge disclosed his relationship with the prosecutor, personally stated his agreement with his attorney\u2019s belief the judge would be fair. <em>(Johnson, </em>at p. 979.) We question whether the same rule should control in a case where the client and his or her current counsel are unaware of a disqualifying conflict of the sort presented here. <em>Scott, </em>the case <em>Johnson </em>relied upon in holding a personal waiver was not required, involved facts suggesting the defendant may not have been aware of the alleged basis for disqualification, which was based on the judge\u2019s receipt of information at pretrial hearings at which the defendant was not present. <em>(Scott, </em>at p. 1207.) As indicated above, however, the information was not of a type that threatened to undermine the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>(Ibid.) Scott, </em>in turn, relied upon <em>In re Horton </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 82, 95 [284 Cal.Rptr. 305, 813 P.2d 1335], a case which did not involve disqualification but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>held that defense counsel could impliedly stipulate to trial before a court commissioner without the defendant having personally waived his right to a regularly elected or appointed superior court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Of most fundamental significance, none of the implied waiver cases upon which Jose and the dissent rely involved a private judge. As we have explained, and as this case illustrates, private judges are not insulated in the way public judges are: Unlike public judges, they often have continuing and reciprocal business relationships with the lawyers who appear before them. Because private judges operate within a system in which potential conflicts are likely, adherence to requirements for written or on the record disclosure and waiver is imperative. Viewing the decision whether to waive a judge\u2019s conflict as a tactical one to be exercised by the attorney, even if the client is unaware of the facts, takes on a different light in the context of private judging, where it is possible for three attorneys\u2014opposing counsel and the temporary judge\u2014to mutually agree to work on each other\u2019s cases to serve their own professional interests, which may or may not align with those of their clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Finally, Jose argues that, waiver aside, the failure of a temporary judge to disclose potential conflicts in the manner prescribed by the Code of Judicial Ethics \u201cdoes not, without more, result in disqualification.\u201d The dissent agrees. The argument that a violation of the disclosure requirement of canon 6D(5)(a), standing alone, cannot support disqualification\u2014a proposition not supported by the cases Jose relies upon<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>\u2014presents an interesting question. But this is not Tracy\u2019s claim. Tracy\u2019s argument is that a person aware that Perkovich had a mutual judging relationship with Jose\u2019s lawyer and failed to disclose it in the manner required by the Code of Judicial Ethics \u201cmight reasonably entertain a doubt that [she] would be able to be impartial.\u201d (\u00a7 170.1, subd. (a)(6)(A)(iii).) In other words, Tracy\u2019s nondisclosure claim is not that Perkovich\u2019s failure to properly disclose is disqualifying in and of itself; the claim rests as well on the nature of the information she failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>reveal in writing and on the record, which itself may reasonably be seen as an indication of partiality. The claim of nondisclosure therefore does not \u201cstand alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The nondisclosure claim also cannot be said to stand alone because it is accompanied by the independent claim that Perkovich was actually biased against Tracy. Not only did Perkovich decline to formally contest the allegation of actual bias, her letter to Judge Stone\u2014complaining for the first time about hostile conduct some 10 months earlier\u2014provides reason to believe the allegation.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Furthermore, unlike the failure to disclose, which can be waived, a claim that the judge \u201chas a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\u201d cannot be waived. (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (b)(2)(A).) In short, entirely apart from the alleged failure to properly disclose, Tracy\u2019s motion to disqualify alleges a sufficient basis upon which to disqualify Perkovich.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Finally, it deserves to be emphasized that all of the arguments advanced by Jose and the dissent as to why Tracy should be seen as having waived disqualification, or the claims upon which she sought and obtained disqualification were untimely or otherwise untenable, <em>could have been raised by Perkovich herself, and a hearing on those claims could have been conducted by the trial court. </em>The most legally significant factor in this case, it seems to us, is not Perkovich\u2019s asserted failure to disclose in writing or on the record as required, nor even her alleged bias and prejudice. As indicated, like the trial judge, we make no independent findings on those matters. The regnant factor is instead Perkovich\u2019s complete indifference to the legal rules regarding the disqualification process specified in section 170.3. As provided in subdivision (c)(2) of section 170.3, Perkovich, without conceding her disqualification, could have simply requested any other judge agreed upon by the parties to sit and act in her place; but she did not. Alternatively, as provided in subdivision (c)(3), she could have filed a written verified answer denying any or all of the allegations of Tracy\u2019s statement of disqualification and set forth \u201cany additional facts material or relevant to the question of disqualification,\u201d but she did not do that either. The result of those failures, and also her failure to consent to disqualification (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c)(3)), is that, as Judge Stone found, she must be \u201cdeemed to have consented to her disqualification.\u201d The statement of the Supreme Court, echoed by the Courts of Appeal, that where a judge \u201chas failed to file a written answer to the statement of bias and prejudice . . . [citation], the facts alleged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>statement must be taken as true\u201d <em>(Calhoun v. Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 262) declares a rule of law. Unlike Jose, and also our dissenting colleague, we are unwilling to treat that rule of law as if it were an equitable doctrine, whose application is not universal but depends upon circumstances that will vary from case to case. Doing so would undermine the uniformity, certainty, and predictability essential to effective enforcement the disqualification process, which strengthens the integrity of the judicial process.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Perkovich\u2019s orders were all void at the time they issued and must be vacated, regardless whether they were legally correct.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>(Cadenasso </em>v. <em>Bank of Italy </em>(1932) 214 Cal. 562, 568-569 [6 P.2d 944]; <em>Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\n<em>Berkovich Cannot in This Proceeding Be Required to Refund Fees She Received for Her Services</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Tracy claims that due to Perkovich\u2019s failure to comply with her ethical obligations, Tracy is entitled to a refund of the fees she paid Perkovich. The claim is based on <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th 1072, which confirmed that \u201d \u2018[i]t is settled in California that an attorney may not recover for services rendered if those services are rendered in contradiction to the requirements of professional responsibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1076, quoting <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Lees </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 614, 618 [120 Cal.Rptr. 253]; accord, <em>Jeffry v.

Acknowledging that no case addresses the question whether a temporary judge who violates the Code of Judicial Ethics is also barred from receiving fees for his or her services, Tracy maintains that no rationale supports the use of a lesser standard for lawyers serving as temporary judges.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Jose has not responded to this argument,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and we will not resolve it. The dispute is between Tracy and Perkovich, and because Perkovich is not a party to these proceedings, we cannot adjudicate her rights to the fees in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>The MOA Was Tainted by Perkovich\u2019s Void Rulings and Is Therefore Unenforceable Under Section 664.6</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Tracy emphasizes that the MOA was proposed in the wake of a series of adverse rulings issued by Perkovich after Munsill was replaced as her counsel by Jackson, who was unaware of the mutual judging relationships between Perkovich and Blevans. According to Tracy, Blevans was aware of the hostility between Perkovich and Tracy and her counsel and, in that context, the MOA presented Jackson and Tracy a Hobson\u2019s choice: Considering that Perkovich had repeatedly ruled in Jose\u2019s favor, had threatened Tracy with contempt and appeared hostile, Tracy feared her refusal to sign the MOA (which according to Tracy required her to pay \u201capproximately $800,000 per year over a hve-year period, and then $300,000 per year for the rest of Jose\u2019s life\u201d) would likely result in loss of control of the business she founded and had run for two decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Tracy now argues that the MOA was tainted by the void rulings that induced it and, therefore, enforcing it under section 664.6 would thwart the policy informing the disclosure requirements. As she says in her briefs, \u2018\u201c[i]f there <em>is any possibility </em>that the hostile interactions at hearings or the void orders Perkovich issued impacted the circumstances leading to its execution, the MOA should be declared unenforceable,\u201d because \u2018\u201cthe legitimacy of the judicial system\u201d is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Preliminarily, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s view that this claim is a \u2018\u201c180-degree change of position\u201d from the position Tracy took in an earlier writ petition challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of the second motion to withdraw the stipulation appointing Perkovich, which had been filed <em>before Tracy\u2019s attorneys learned of the undisclosed mutual judging relationship. </em>(Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 69, fn. 2.) The trial court rejected Tracy\u2019s arguments that Perkovich lacked power to rule in the case because of her failure to sign the certification required by rule 2.831(b) and that the terms of the stipulation did not permit her to hear a motion to enforce the MOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">With regard to the second point, Tracy argued in her writ petition that the stipulation did not allow Perkovich to hear a motion to enforce \u2018\u201can agreement in which she had no role.\u201d Urging that the jurisdiction of a temporary judge, circumscribed by the stipulation, is limited to matters that are \u2018\u201ca continuation of the stipulated cause or question its finality, such as motions to vacate or reconsider\u201d and not to \u2018\u201cancillary\u201d matters \u2018\u201cheard on a separate record\u201d and seeking \u201can independent judgment or reviewable order\u201d <em>(Orange County Dept. of Child Support Services v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 798, 807 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 877]), Tracy maintained that Jose\u2019s motion to enforce the MOA was ancillary because Perkovich had no role in negotiating, drafting, or approving it.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The dissent views Tracy\u2019s assertions in the prior writ petition that Perkovich had \u201cno nexus\u201d to the MOA as incompatible with Tracy\u2019s present claim that she entered the MOA due to duress caused by Perkovich\u2019s rulings. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 69, fn. 2.) But saying Perkovich played no part in the negotiations, drafting, or approval of the MOA is a far cry from saying that Tracy\u2019s evaluation of and reasons for signing the MOA were not influenced by rulings Perkovich had previously issued. Tracy\u2019s argument in the prior writ petition\u2014that Perkovich did not participate in the development or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>execution of the MOA, and enforcement of the MOA exceeded the scope of her stipulated appointment\u2014addresses a completely different point from, and is not inconsistent with, Tracy\u2019s present argument that Perkovich\u2019s rulings had a psychological effect on Tracy and influenced her evaluation of and decision to enter the MOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Jose\u2019s view is that the enforceability of the MOA has nothing to do with Perkovich\u2019s \u201ctechnical noncompliance\u201d with the disclosure requirements, her disqualification, or the voidness of her orders, but rather presents \u201ca question of fact for the trial court to determine\u201d as part of its determination of Jose\u2019s motion to enforce the MOA under section 664.6. The \u201cquestion of fact\u201d Jose posits is whether Tracy can establish her claim that she signed the document under economic duress; he emphasizes that this claim is now \u201conly a yet-to-be-proven allegation in a declaration that has yet to be subjected to discovery or cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Jose\u2019s argument is based on the status of his motion to enforce the MOA <em>at the time it was presented to Perkovich. </em>As we have explained, at that time Tracy and her counsel were unaware of Perkovich\u2019s noncompliance with canon 6D(5)(a), and Tracy\u2019s opposition to enforcement of the MOA was based solely on her claims that she signed the document under economic duress and that the parties had not served on one another or mutually waived the final financial declarations required by Family Code section 2105 prior to signing the MOA. By the time the issue of enforcing the MOA was presented to Judge Price, Tracy and her counsel had learned of Perkovich\u2019s failure to disclose \u201cin writing or on the record\u201d and successfully obtained her disqualification. The disqualification of Perkovich dramatically changed the focus of the motion to enforce the MOA: The question was no longer whether Tracy signed the MOA under duress but whether Perkovich\u2019s void orders so influenced the MOA that it is tainted and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\"><em>Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th 1353, is instructive on the manner in which the acts of a disqualified judge may taint subsequent proceedings. As earlier described, the trial judge in the case disqualified himself after issuing an order compelling arbitration. The newly assigned judge vacated not only the order compelling arbitration, but also the subsequent arbitration award. While affirming that the disqualified judge\u2019s order compelling arbitration was void, the reviewing court reversed the order vacating the arbitration award as premature because the award was not necessarily improper: Since the basis for the order compelling arbitration was a contractual arbitration clause, if the clause governed the parties\u2019 dispute, they would be required to arbitrate independently of the judge\u2019s void order. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1365.) In that case, the arbitration award should be vacated only if the trial court determined that the arbitration was tainted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the disqualified judge, or should be vacated on other grounds. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1367.) <em>Rossco Holdings </em>described the appropriate standard for determining whether the arbitration was tainted as \u201cwhether \u2018[a] person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the [arbitrators] would be able to be impartial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">While <em>Rossco Holdings </em>was concerned with the effect of a void order compelling arbitration on the arbitrators deciding the merits of the case, and the question here is the effect of void court orders on the parties\u2019 own decisions whether to accept the terms of a settlement, the policy considerations are the same. In explaining why the disqualification of the judge who issued the order compelling arbitration did not require invalidation of the arbitration award absent a determination that the arbitration proceedings were tainted, the <em>Rossco Holdings </em>court pointed out that \u201cthe policy behind judicial disqualification is not thwarted by allowing an untainted arbitration to stand. \u2018Statutes governing disqualification for cause are intended to ensure public confidence in the judiciary and to protect the right of the litigants to a fair and impartial adjudicator.\u2019 [Citation.] Public confidence in the judiciary is not undermined by allowing an untainted arbitration to stand. To the contrary, public confidence . . . would be undermined if the court threw out an arbitration award issued by fair and impartial arbitrators, thereby requiring a second arbitration, simply because the judge who initially granted the motion to compel arbitration should not have ruled on the motion.\u201d <em>(Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Similarly, here, enforcement of a marital settlement agreement that was <em>not </em>influenced by void orders of a disqualified judge would not undermine the policy behind judicial disqualification, and public confidence in the judiciary would be undermined if such an independent agreement was not enforced. But the contrary is also clearly true: Enforcement of an agreement that <em>was </em>influenced by the void rulings of a disqualified judge would both undermine the policy of judicial disqualification and cast doubt on the impartiality of, and therefore public confidence in, the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It warrants reiteration that the legal correctness of the void rulings is irrelevant, as is the question whether Tracy signed the MOA under economic distress as she originally claimed. The relevant inquiry is whether Perkovich\u2019s void rulings influenced the parties\u2019 assessment of the strengths of their respective cases and therefore their willingness to accept terms of the settlement. Adapting the standard described in <em>Rossco Holdings </em>to the present question, the appropriate standard is whether a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that, in the absence of the void rulings, the parties would have agreed to the terms of the MOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>It is virtually a truism that parties considering settlement after a lengthy period of litigation take into consideration the court\u2019s rulings to that point; those rulings tell the parties where they stand on whatever issues have been determined, providing some basis for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their respective cases and anticipating the outcome of further rulings. While there may well be cases litigated as long as this one was in which the rulings of the judge or temporary judge did not affect the parties\u2019 settlement, this case is not one of them. As <em>Rossco </em>indicates, if there is doubt about the effect of a disqualified judge\u2019s conduct, the issue of taint presents a factual, not a legal, issue. There can be no such doubt in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">After initially pursuing dissolution proceedings in superior court in April 2012, the parties submitted their dispute to a private judge who presided over multiple settlement conferences and hearings. Perkovich\u2019s rulings were almost all in Jose\u2019s favor. That Tracy and her counsel perceived Perkovich as favoring Jose and Blevans is evident from Tracy\u2019s two attempts to withdraw from the stipulation appointing Perkovich before finally seeking disqualification. Tracy signed the MOA the day before the hearing at which Perkovich was to rule on Jose\u2019s motion to transfer control of Tracy\u2019s company to Jose or a receiver, threatening Tracy with the potential loss of any say in the running of the company she had founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Might a person aware of these facts reasonably entertain a doubt whether Tracy would have signed the MOA in the absence of Perkovich\u2019s rulings? To ask the question is to answer it: Even if she did not sign the MOA under economic duress, how could she <em>not </em>have taken into consideration the orders that had been issued in the case and what they led her to expect from the highly consequential hearing the next day? It would be a waste of judicial resources to remand this case to inquire whether this was in fact the case. As <em>Rossco Holdings </em>points out, judicial economy is a factor properly considered in cases of judicial disqualification. <em>(Rossco Holdings, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1365, fn. 20.) We conclude as a matter of law that the MOA cannot be enforced under section 664.6, because the effectuation of a settlement tainted by the void rulings of a disqualified temporary judge would undermine public confidence in the judiciary and the right of litigants to fair and impartial adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\n<em>Judge Price\u2019s Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Tracy urges that Judge Price should also be disqualified, and her orders vacated, because she was familiar with Perkovich\u2019s \u201canti-Tracy\u201d arguments before she began to rule in the case and because she analyzed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>privileged communications between Tracy and her attorneys in camera. Tracy emphasizes Perkovich\u2019s letter expressing fear of Tracy and her participation in this case after being disqualified, in violation of Judge Stone\u2019s order; she characterizes Perkovich\u2019s motion for declaratory relief concerning fees as \u201cportraying] Tracy and her attorneys in a bad light, while advocating for Blevans and his client.\u201d Tracy views Perkovich as having violated canon 3(B)(7)(a), which prohibits a judge who knows she is disqualified from hearing a case and from discussing the matter with the judge assigned to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Even accepting the inappropriateness of Perkovich\u2019s conduct, we have no basis for concluding it tainted the proceedings to the extent of interfering with Judge Price\u2019s ability to maintain impartiality. Perkovich\u2019s motion for declaratory relief portrayed the facts in a self-serving light, but it did not expressly cast aspersions on Tracy or her attorneys. The motion and supporting declaration stated that Perkovich had acted in accordance with the stipulation and order appointing her and was entitled to be paid for the services she rendered, pointing out that Tracy\u2019s first two attempts to disqualify her had been denied and characterizing her eventual disqualification as having resulted from her \u201crequest for recusal\u201d in response to Tracy\u2019s claim of bias. She stated that Judge Stone\u2019s order denied Tracy\u2019s \u201crequest for a finding that I acted beyond the authority granted by the Stipulation and Order to Appoint Judge Pro Tern.\u201d Perkovich\u2019s letter to Judge Stone was considerably more inflammatory, referring to concern for her \u201cpersonal safety\u201d due to Tracy\u2019s \u201cincreasingly hostile\u201d behavior and \u201cangry outbursts.\u201d But this does not mean Judge Price was influenced by Perkovich\u2019s injudicious comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u201c \u2018A trial judge hears many items during the course of a trial which are inadmissible, and [s]he is called upon to rule on the admissibility of numerous evidentiary matters. The fact that [s]he has heard these things does not mean that [s]he cannot divorce them from [her] mind.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beaumaster[, supra,] </em>17 Cal.App.3d [at p. 1009], quoted in <em>In re Richard W. </em>[(1979)] 91 Cal.App.3d [960,] 968 [155 Cal.Rptr. 11] [both cases involving a court trial].)\u201d <em>(Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1206.) \u201c \u2018As an aspect of the presumption that judicial duty is properly performed [(Evid. Code, \u00a7 664)], we presume . . . that the court knows and applies the correct statutory and case law [citation] and is able to distinguish admissible from inadmissible evidence, relevant from irrelevant facts, and to recognize those facts which properly may be considered in the judicial decisionmaking process.\u2019 <em>(People v. Coddington </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 529, 644 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 528, 2 P.3d 1081].) Stated another way, a trial court is presumed to ignore material it knows is incompetent, irrelevant, or inadmissible.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Davenport </em>(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1507, 1526 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 292].) \u201cOnly proof that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>evidence actually figured in the court\u2019s decision will overcome these presumptions. [Citations.] Clearly, the mere fact that the court heard or read the evidence is not sufficient to overcome the presumptions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">When Judge Price entered the case, it was clear that relahons between Perkovich and Tracy had soured irredeemably; Perkovich\u2019s letter was obviously not written from an impartial perspective. This had to have been clear to Judge Price. We presume Judge Price viewed the letter in proper context and did not allow it to influence her view of the parties\u2019 positions and legal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Judge Price stated at a hearing regarding reopening discovery, \u201cI read Perkovich\u2019s [letter]. And it generally said that anything she decided would never be sahsfactory to petitioner and so she was asking to be relieved.\u201d Pointing to this statement and noting that Judge Price did not mention Perkovich\u2019s \u2018\u201cnumerous ethical violahons, the disqualifying conflicts that led to the motion to disqualify, the favor Perkovich had done to help Blevans defeat a motion that was pending before Judge Stone, or even Perkovich\u2019s highly inappropriate (and probably false) suggestion that she suddenly perceived Tracy as a physical threat,\u201d Tracy states that Perkovich \u201csuccessfully poisoned the new judge against the party who had called for disqualification\u201d in violation of the canons of Judicial Ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We will not assume, as Tracy seems to, that Judge Price\u2019s comment at the hearing reflects her acceptance of Perkovich\u2019s view of Tracy or of the disqualification. In an aside not directly relevant to the issue actually being discussed, Blevans asked the court to \u201c[r]emember\u201d that Tracy had had \u201ca desperate desire\u201d to no longer have Perkovich on the case and \u201cultimately succeeded in having [Perkovich] say, T don\u2019t want this case either.\u2019 \u201d When Tracy\u2019s attorney interjected that this was a misstatement of facts and evidence, Judge Price made the statement quoted above. Her description of the \u201cgist\u201d of Perkovich\u2019s letter was correct, and the circumstances did not call for any further comment on Tracy\u2019s allegations or the import of the disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Furthermore, Perkovich\u2019s letter to Judge Stone, as well as her motion for declaratory relief, is a part of the record in this case, available to any judge who presides over it in the future. Any future judge will be placed in the same position as Judge Price, having to ignore Perkovich\u2019s negative comments about Tracy. We presume their ability to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Aside from seeking to have Judge Price\u2019s orders vacated as a consequence of her asserted disqualification, Tracy asks us to reverse Judge Price\u2019s sanctions orders on the merits. All the sanctions orders related to discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>relevant to the question of enforceability of the MOA. In ordering the $36,000 in sanctions, Judge Price found that it was unreasonable for Tracy to think the door to discovery was not opened by her claim that she signed the MOA without understanding what she was signing and in reliance upon her attorney\u2019s statements or failures to act, and Tracy therefore had no substantial justification for opposing Jose\u2019s motions to reopen discovery related to enforcement of the MOA and to compel documents (aside from certain attorney billing records), or for moving to quash the subpoenas issued to Tracy and to Jackson (with the same exception). The final sanctions order was imposed because Judge Price found Tracy had no substantial justification for opposing Jose\u2019s motion to clarify, which sought to broaden the scope of discovery related to enforcement of the MOA to include all settlement negotiations and not just those the few days surrounding the date the MOA was signed. Judge Price noted that when the motion to reopen discovery was first heard, no one argued the time frame of the discovery request or argued negotiations had extended over months before the date of execution; the judge knew only that the MOA was executed in January 2014 and \u201chad no idea what the background was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In light of our decisions that Perkovich\u2019s orders were void and that the MOA is unenforceable, Judge Price\u2019s decision to postpone resolution of Tracy\u2019s motion to set aside Perkovich\u2019s orders and proceed with discovery related to enforcement of the MOA was misguided; the discovery that Judge Price ordered to proceed, and sanctioned Tracy for opposing, was unnecessary and is now moot. But the question is whether the sanctions orders were within Judge Price\u2019s discretion at the time she made them. Tracy\u2019s arguments in this regard are not convincing. She maintains that the $36,000 sanctions order resulted from motions pertaining to \u201cremnants of Perkovich\u2019s actions that never should have occurred in the first place.\u201d Perkovich did not issue any orders relevant to the motion to enforce the MOA. The discovery motions Tracy opposed pertained to \u201cremnants of Perkovich\u2019s actions\u201d in the sense that those actions were the basis of Tracy\u2019s successful argument in this court that her decision to sign the MOA was influenced by Perkovich\u2019s orders and conduct. But this was not the posture of the case before Judge Price. Tracy was opposing Jose\u2019s motion to enforce the MOA by arguing that she signed it under duress caused by Perkovich\u2019s rulings and conduct, and Jackson\u2019s advice, and we can find no fault in Judge Price\u2019s determination that Tracy\u2019s argument opened the door to discovery related to the parties\u2019 negotiation of the MOA. Tracy argues that the additional order for $6,000 in sanctions imposed on April 13, 2015, was unreasonably based on the fact that in opposing Jose\u2019s motion to clarify Judge Price\u2019s prior discovery order, Tracy argued that the order was correct and clear. The point of Jose\u2019s motion, however, was that the entire history of negotiations was relevant, not just the few days in January when the final version of the MOA was negotiated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>executed. Judge Price viewed Tracy as having no substantial justification for insisting that discovery should be limited to those few days. We see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Further, even if Judge Price had properly considered Tracy\u2019s motion to vacate Perkovich\u2019s orders before considering the discovery issues, the discovery issues would have remained when the judge turned to Jose\u2019s motion to enforce the MOA. Our conclusion that we can, and should, decide the enforceability issue as a matter of law in the interest of judicial economy does not mean Judge Price necessarily should have done so. No party had asked her to do so; indeed, even in her initial brief in support of her petition to this court, Tracy asked us to order the trial court to address the \u201cinvalidity\u201d of the MOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The petition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The orders entered by Perkovich are void and must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The matter is remanded to the Napa County Superior Court for proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein, including resolving the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations created by vacation of the orders, most of which pertained to matters bearing upon spousal support and attorney and expert witness fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-9\">Stewart, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\"> Article VI, section 21 of the California Constitution provides that \u201cOn stipulation of the parties litigant the court may order the cause to be tried by a temporary judge who is a member of the State Bar, sworn and empowered to act until final determination of the cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-11\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent citations to canons refer to the California Code of Judicial Ethics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-12\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all subsequent citations to rules refer to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> As is customary in marital dissolution actions, we refer to the parties to the marriage hereinafter by their first names. <em>(In re Marriage of James &amp; Christine C. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1264, fn. 1 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 715].)

Tracy\u2019s motion to disqualify Perkovich was sufficient because it met the requirements of the statute: It objected to the temporary judge\u2019s participation and stated the basis for the claimed disqualification, and its execution under penalty of perjury served the purpose of verification. <em>(Urias, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.4th 415; <em>Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at pp. 25-26.) The same cannot be said of Perkovich\u2019s letter, which was neither verified nor executed under penalty of perjury and sought recusal for a reason independent of the alleged bases for disqualification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\"> The only other authority Jose cites on this point\u2014also without explanation of its relevance to the present situation\u2014is section 2033.410.

While the disqualified judge totally lacks power to hear and determine the cause, the court itself is not without jurisdiction. [Citation.] But the court, with subject matter jurisdiction, may properly be held to lack jurisdiction to act while the judge is disqualified. The problem is more accurately one of excess of jurisdiction.

Neither of these cases has any bearing on the consequence of a private judge ordered disqualified after failing to answer a statement of disqualification alleging violation of a disclosure requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\"> Perkovich\u2019s last direct contact with Tracy was at the settlement conference in December 2013. The record certainly reflects Tracy\u2019s uncooperative, agitated, and disruptive conduct and verbal expressions of anger, including loud and \u201caggressive\u201d demands to see Jose at the December 2013 conference described by Blevans, Elmore, and another of Jose\u2019s attorneys, the heated exchange at the July 30, 2013, hearing, and \u201cstrange\u201d e-mails from Tracy to Jose. We are not aware of any suggestion of threat of physical harm, nor of any contact between Tracy and Perkovich for approximately 10 months preceding Perkovich\u2019s letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\"> The dissent\u2019s suggestion that our decision will wreak havoc by invalidating orders in any case where a private judge did not strictly comply with the requirement of canon 6D that disclosure be made in writing or on the record is, we believe, greatly exaggerated. Several unusual circumstances combined to present the problem we have addressed in this case: An experienced private judge failed to place her disclosures in writing or on the record, a party sought to disqualify the temporary judge for this reason and for alleged actual bias, and the challenged temporary judge failed to seek replacement without conceding disqualification or to file a consent or an answer contesting the allegations. We will not presume that temporary judges commonly disregard the requirements of the Code of Judicial Ethics. And it cannot be common for a temporary judge who is challenged to fail to respond to a statement of disqualification in any of the ways prescribed by section 170.3. The result we have reached in this case would not obtain absent these unusual circumstances. Moreover, if the dissent is correct that temporary judges routinely ignore the requirement of canon 6D(5)(a) that disclosures be made in writing or on the record, there is all the more reason to insist upon adherence to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> Until further action is taken by the parties or the trial court on remand, the effect of vacating Perkovich\u2019s orders will be to return the parties to the positions they were in before the temporary judge entered the case, governed by the superior court\u2019s 2012 spousal support order. We recognize, however, that the orders we are vacating required the payment of substantial sums for attorney and expert witness fees and additional amounts of spousal support. We express no opinion on the correctness of any of these orders. On remand, the parties and the trial court will have to devise a practical means of determining the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations with regal'd to payments or other accommodations that have been made in compliance with Perkovich\u2019s void orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\"> Since a temporary judge is constitutionally required to be a member of the California State Bar, such a judge who violates canon 6D of the Code of Judicial Ethics also necessarily violates rule 1-710 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the California State Bar, which requires a temporary judge to comply with canon 6D, and therefore violates his or her ethical obligation both as a temporary judge <em>and as an attorney.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> In his trial court pleadings in support of Perkovich\u2019s request for declaratory relief, Jose raised the different arguments that Tracy\u2019s demand for a refund could not be granted because (1) the fees paid were authorized by and consistent with the terms of the Stipulation and Order, which did not authorize the court to order any refund of fees, and (2) the refund request amounted to \u201can assertion of liability\u201d for improper performance of duties as a pro tempore judge and, under <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Drapkin, supra. </em>222 Cal.App.3d 843, Perkovich enjoyed quasi-judicial immunity against a suit for \u201cmonetary compensation\u201d on this basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> The dissent quotes Tracy\u2019s statement that the MOA \u201c \u2018is not the result of a ruling or order of attorney Perkovich, and she did not sign it.

In early 2012, the parties and their attorneys signed a stipulation that Sacramento Attorney Nancy Perkovich be appointed a private judge to handle the matter, an appointment approved by the Napa Superior Court in April 2012. Perkovich presided over hearings and issued orders, including orders that transferred monies between the parties. Perkovich\u2019s last involvement was in 2013, probably October. Meanwhile, without any involvement by Perkovich, the parties engaged in five months of settlement negotiations, culminating in a January 2014 \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d (MOA) signed by the parties and their attorneys. On May 20, 2014, Jose filed a motion to enforce the MOA. Ten days later a new attorney entered the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">On May 30, 2014, Tracy\u2019s current attorney\u2014her fourth\u2014substituted in, and began what can only be described as a vituperative attack on Perkovich, on Jose\u2019s attorney\u2014indeed, on the very concept of private judging. It began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>with a motion to withdraw the stipulation and remove Perkovich, based on her claimed failure to make a certification. The trial court denied the motion. Tracy sought a writ. We denied it. The Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">On October 7, 2014, Tracy filed the petition before us here, asserting for the first time two new grounds for removing Perkovich, two grounds of claimed disqualification never before urged, and based on claimed facts that had been known for over a year, some for almost two. Despite that history, despite that timing, the majority wholeheartedly agrees with Tracy, in an opinion that for some reason views every fact and interprets every circumstance in favor of Tracy\u2014an approach that, as a close reading of the majority opinion will reveal, sometimes results in the majority engaging in a lengthy explanation or justification, and other times in simply dismissing any contrary reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Based on that approach, the majority holds that disqualification occurred when Perkovich did not comply with canon 6D(5) of the Code of Judicial Ethics requiring disclosures either \u201cin writing or on the record\u201d when she presided over her first session with the parties, on October 30, 2012. The majority also holds that Perkovich\u2019s response to Tracy\u2019s petition was not a \u201cwritten, verified answer,\u201d and Perkovich was thus \u201cdeemed to have consented to the disqualification,\u201d which in turn resulted in \u201can admission of the truth of its allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The majority also holds that all of Perkovich\u2019s orders are void, a holding that necessarily requires disgorgement of all the monies that Perkovich caused to be transferred, doing so without any guidance or direction to the trial court as to how to accomplish that disgorgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Finally, the majority goes so far as to hold that as a matter of law the MOA \u201cwas tainted\u201d by Perkovich\u2019s orders and is \u201ctherefore unenforceable.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 55, capitalization &amp; italics omitted.) This holding is notwithstanding that the MOA followed five months of negotiations in which Perkovich had no involvement\u2014and notwithstanding that taint is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">I cannot agree with any of that, and I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">As will be discussed, I have a much different view of the salient facts here, facts not mentioned by the majority, that lead me to disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusions as to the law of disqualification. Moreover, the majority disregards that the petition before us here, filed on October 7, 2014\u201424 months after the first claimed disqualifying circumstance and 12 months after the second\u2014is in abject violation of Code of Civil Procedure, section 170.3, subdivision (c)(1), which requires that Tracy must move \u201cat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>earliest practicable opportunity\u201d after the facts of disqualification become known. Put otherwise, even if there were a proper basis for disqualification\u2014 which there was not\u2014it was waived. Not to mention time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Pertinent Facts as I See Them</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Presiding Justice Kline\u2019s majority opinion contains a 23-page statement of \u2018\u201cFacts and Proceedings Below,\u201d an extensive recitation to be sure. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 17.) But there are other facts pertinent to all that transpired here, and I begin with those background facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On February 16, 2011, Tracy filed in Napa County a petition to dissolve marriage. She was represented by Napa Attorney Roger Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">On April 1, 2011, Jose filed his response, represented by Napa Attorney Robert Blevans.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Various proceedings were held before Napa County Superior Court judges, in at least one of which Tracy was sanctioned. And at a case management conference on January 9, 2012, the case was set for trial on May 21, 2012. Eleven days later, on January 20, Attorney Lewis substituted out. Tracy was now in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Sometime later, apparently in late March, Blevans received a communication from Attorney John Munsill, of Gold River, Sacramento County. Munsill advised that he had been asked to substitute in as attorney for Tracy, and was considering it, but would only do so if Blevans would agree to have the matter dropped from the calendar and presided over by a private judge, Nancy Perkovich, a Sacramento attorney who specialized in family law. Blevans, who knew Perkovich from previous relationships, on behalf of Jose, agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In late March 2012 a comprehensive five-page \u2018\u201cStipulation and Order\u201d (Stipulation) was prepared, drafted by Munsill. The Stipulation was signed on March 28 by Tracy, Jose, Munsill, and Blevans. On March 29, Perkovich signed the oath at the end of the Stipulation. On April 3, Presiding Judge Stone of the Napa County Superior Court signed this order: \u201cPursuant to Rule 2.830 et seq. of the California Rules of Court, the foregoing selection of Nancy Perkovich, Esq. as Temporary (\u2018Private\u2019) Judge in the above-titled cause is hereby approved, and said attorney is so designated and assigned. In addition, all other terms set forth in the above Stipulation and Order are hereby so ordered.\u201d On April 5, the Stipulation was filed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">The Stipulation began with a 10-line recital of the broad powers given to Perkovich. Paragraph 4 of the Stipulation recited that \u201cBoth parties waive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>clerk\u2019s minutes.\u201d The Stipulation went on to include orders vacating the trial date and deferring discovery, apparently done with an eye toward possible resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The first session before Perkovich was not until October 30, 2012, held in her office in Sacramento, a settlement conference. Those in attendance included Tracy and her attorney, Munsill; Jose and his attorney, Blevans; and two accountants, David Schultze on behalf of Tracy, and Darlene Elmore on behalf of Jose. There is no dispute that at the session Perkovich made oral disclosures about her prior relationships with Munsill and Blevans. As the majority describes it, Perkovich has represented that she told all present \u201c \u2018about my professional contacts with each attorney including the fact that (1)1 had been hired once before as a judge pro tern in a case where Blevans was an attorney, (2) Blevans was hired as a judge pro tern once in a case where I was an attorney, (3) Munsill was hired as a judge pro tern once in a case where I was an attorney, (4) I was hired as a settlement judge once in a case where Munsill was an attorney, (5) Munsill and I had been previously associated as counsel on a case, (6) I served on the Sacramento Family Law Bar Association Committee with John Munsill and socialized once with he and his wife and children related to that professional organization, and (7) I am a member of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and was acquainted with Blevans from that organization. I also disclosed that I had hired David Schultze, CPA many times on cases throughout my career and had also had him as an opposing expert on many cases. I had not previously met Darlene Elmore, CPA. I asked all parties and attorneys if they were comfortable with my acting as judge pro tern. All parties indicated that they wished me to proceed in that capacity.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 32.) Indeed they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As the majority also acknowledges, \u2018\u201cBlevans, Elmore, and Schultze all stated in declarations or deposition testimony . . . that Perkovich . . . disclosed her prior contacts with Blevans and with Munsill at the October 2012 meeting, including that she and each of the attorneys had acted as temporary judge in each other\u2019s cases, and that the parties agreed to proceed with Perkovich as temporary judge. . . . [\u00b6] Munsill testified at a deposition in February 2015 that he recalled Perkovich discussing at the settlement conference \u2018her various prior connections with both [Blevans] and me,\u2019 but did not recall \u2018the details\u2019 of that discussion. He did not recall Tracy expressing concerns about Perkovich\u2019s disclosures. Munsill acknowledged that he had a \u2018mutual judging relationship with Perkovich, each having served as judge in a case where the other represented a party. Munsill stated that he had no reason to believe inaccurate the statement in Blevan\u2019s declaration that after Perkovich\u2019s disclosures at the settlement conference, \u2018both counsel and the parties acknowledged their understanding and agreement to move forward with Judge Pro Tern Perkovich presiding.\u2019 He did not recall presenting Tracy with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>written waiver of any potential conflict after Perkovich disclosed her professional relationships with the two attorneys and stated, \u2018I don\u2019t recall there being a need for that.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 32-33.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The register of actions reflects one uneventful entry after October 30, 2012, on December 12. The next two entries, on March 26 and April 19, 2013, are substitutions of attorneys. Under the first, Munsill was out, and Tracy was again in propria persona. Under the second, Trevor Jackson, an attorney in Napa, substituted in.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Over the ensuing months various hearings were held before Perkovich. A \u201cSummary of Hearings, Conferences and Orders\u201d prepared by Perkovich\u2014 which is not disputed by either Tracy or Jose\u2014shows that there were seven telephonic case management conferences (on Nov. 2 and 20, 2012, Feb. 11, Mar. 4, Apr. 26, June 3 and 13, 2013) before a case management order was filed on September 10, 2013, and another telephonic conference on November 18, 2013, before a second case management order was filed on December 16, 2013. There were two actual hearings (on July 30, 2013, and a \u201clong cause hearing\u201d on Oct. 9, 2013) and a telephonic hearing \u201cre Claim of Exemption\u201d on October 24, 2013. And, of course, Perkovich made the various orders Tracy seeks to void here.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Meanwhile, settlement negotiations resumed, without any Perkovich involvement, which negotiations continued over many months. They began with a conference in June 2013, a few months after Jackson substituted into the case. In July Tracy extended two proposals, and Jose responded in an August 9 letter, where he proposed a \u201ccomplete and global resolution,\u201d the terms of which included that Tracy pay Jose $300,000 to equalize the award to Tracy of the parties\u2019 residence; $2.5 million to equalize the community interest in the companies; and spousal support of $25,000 per month until Jose\u2019s death, remarriage or further court order. As the majority puts it, \u201cBlevans . . . described [this proposal] as having become the \u2018foundation\u2019 for the memorandum of agreement (MOA) the parties eventually signed.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">While those settlement negotiations continued, on November 7, 2013 Jose filed a \u201cRequest for Control and Management of PPNV or in the Alternative for Appointment of A Receiver,\u201d set for hearing on January 14, 2014. The basis of Jose\u2019s motion was that Tracy had engaged in various shenanigans vis-a-vis the business, to Jose\u2019s detriment. As Jose\u2019s counsel represented to the court below, the complained-of conduct includes Tracy\u2019s \u201cactions in terminating her salary so that [Jose] would not be paid. It includes the court\u2019s finding that she took $600,000 in excess distribution from the company at a time when she was saying the company was in precarious financial condition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>paid out $270,000 for her own personal litigation expenses, shipped off $30,000 to Grand Cayman, turned over control of the company to Howell Bennett and Stan Blyth who then attempted a corporate takeover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Meanwhile, settlement negotiations continued. On November 25, Tracy proposed a settlement providing for payments of $300,000 for the residence, $2 million for the companies, and $10,000 monthly spousal support for Jose\u2019s life, regardless of remarriage. On December 4, Blevans, Tracy, Jackson, and Tracy\u2019s business attorneys, Ian Carter and Eric Jeppson, attended an all-day settlement conference, which was adjourned in order to provide Jose time to prepare a disclosure statement regarding foreign bank accounts. After the disclosure was made, discussions resumed at a December 23 meeting attended by Blevans, Jackson, Carter and Jeppson. Through these three attorneys, Blevans says, Tracy proposed a $2.5 million equalizing payment and spousal support of $18,000 per month, to be reduced to $16,500 per month after six years and terminated after 11 years. Jose\u2019s counterproposal specified payment of $300,000 for the residence, $2.5 million for the companies, and spousal support of $25,000 per month, nonmodifiable until Tracy paid the $2.5 million in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On January 10, 2014, Blevans met with Jeppson and Carter to discuss how Tracy would structure the payments Jose had agreed to accept at the December 23 meeting, and Blevans agreed to the equalizing payment being reduced to $2.4 million. And on that day the MOA was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On May 20, 2014, Jose filed a motion to enforce the MOA. Ten days later, another substitution of attorneys was filed. Jackson was out, and Tracy was now represented by her fourth attorney, Keith Dolnick of Irvine (apparently later to be associated with David Ezra, also of Irvine).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">With that, the litigation took off, the upshot of which is the last 25 pages in the register of actions. But the litigation did not just increase in quantity, but in intensity, with Tracy\u2019s papers reflecting a tone that can only be called intemperate. Below, and here, Tracy filed papers riddled with vituperation, filled with attacks on the very system of private judging, not to mention ad hominem attacks on Perkovich and Blevans, attorneys I understand to be reputable members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. Jose\u2019s briefs implore us to disregard what he claims are the unsupported attacks manifest in Tracy\u2019s briefs. For sure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Regardless, with briefs riddled with such invective, Tracy\u2019s lawyers set out to undo all that had transpired: to have Perkovich disqualified, to have her orders declared void\u2014indeed, to have the MOA held invalid because it was signed against the background of Perkovich\u2019s rulings, which, in the words of Tracy\u2019s attorneys, \u201ccreated the ultimate duress.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The majority agrees on all counts. I agree on none. The law does not support disqualification. But even if it did, Tracy\u2019s motion was untimely. And I do not understand how the majority can decide duress, ultimate or otherwise, as a matter of law. Duress is an issue of fact. <em>(Kravitz </em>v. <em>BT Visual Images </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 164, 176 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">Private Judges</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Article VI, section 21 of the California Constitution provides that \u201cOn stipulation of the parties litigant the court may order a cause to be tried by a temporary judge who is a member of the State Bar, sworn and empowered to act until final determination of the cause.\u201d As described in <em>In re Marriage of Assemi </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 907-908 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 265, 872 P.2d 1190]: \u201c \u2018California has created a full-fledged system of private judges, colloquially \u201crent-a-judge,\u201d which permits the parties to agree to a temporary judge .... Such an agreement allows the parties to bypass urban courts\u2019 crowded calendars, obtain a trial on a certain, prearranged date convenient to parties and witnesses, and avoid the cost of trailing on a master calendar while waiting for a courtroom.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Recognizing the propriety of private judging, the majority, however obliquely, casts a skeptical eye on it, especially in the family law setting, suggesting it needs some special oversight there, apparently because the participants are familiar with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">I see it differently, and perhaps especially in the family law area, for reasons described, for example, by retired Los Angeles Superior Court Family Law Commissioner Jill S. Robbins: \u201cUnlike public judges, private judges are selected by the parties. One tremendous advantage of private judging is that it allows counsel to ensure that the judicial officer has experience in the relevant substantive area of law involved. Family law, for example, has become so sophisticated that the attorney must have a working knowledge of juvenile dependency, bankruptcy, general corporate formation, business transactions and valuation techniques, cash flow analysis, security and enforcement methodology for future payments, and behavioral sciences, to name a few. This knowledge, of course, is in addition to the substantive area of family law and all its intricacies. Some family law judges never practiced family law before their appointment. Accordingly, the selection of a private judge with expertise in the applicable area or areas provides a significant advantage, not only in reducing \u2018education time\u2019 but in providing the attorney and client with the certainty that the private judge will understand the evidence presented.\u201d (Robbins, <em>The Private Judge: California Anomaly or Wave of the Future </em>(2000) 3 IAFL L.J. at p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">As the law review article cited by the majority sums up: \u201cprivate judges will likely have had years of experience . . . adjudicating family disputes. Parties can select a mutually agreeable private judge who has specialized knowledge of the relevant area of family law, such as . . . property division, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>or alimony. . . . [\u00b6] . . . Given that divorce . . . battles can drag on ... to the detriment of all . . . involved, speed and efficiency are invaluable.\u201d (Comment, <em>The Marriage of Family Law and Private Judging in California (2007) </em>116 Yale L.J. 1615, 1618-1619, fns. omitted; see Judicial Council of Cal., <em>Report and Recommendations of the Judicial Council Advisory Committee on Private Judges </em>(1990) pp. 14-15.) In sum, not only do private judges provide expediency, but perhaps most important of all they provide the parties and their counsel an expert to preside over the dispute, someone counsel knows, and for whom he or she has respect. And trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Whether these reputed virtues of a private judge are real is not at issue. What is relevant is that Tracy and Jose elected the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">There Is No Basis for Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">\n<em>Introduction to the Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The majority begins its substantive discussion as follows: \u2018\u201cTracy\u2019s motion to disqualify was based on Perkovich\u2019s alleged violation of Canon 6D by failing to disclose her personal or professional relationships with Blevans \u2018in writing or on the record\u2019 and failure to obtain the parties\u2019 written waiver to disqualification on that ground and file it with the record as required by section 170.3, subdivision (b)(1). The motion to disqualify was also based upon the claim that Perkovich\u2019s conduct during the proceedings over which she presided demonstrated that she was actually biased and prejudiced against Tracy. Tracy maintains that a person aware of the facts Perkovich declined to disclose in writing or on the record, and/or her biased conduct during the proceedings, \u2018might reasonably entertain a doubt that [Perkovich] would be able to be impartial.\u2019 (Canon 6D(3)(a)(vii)(C); \u00a7 170.1, subd. (a)(6)(A)(iii).)\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Tracy\u2019s petition in support of disqualification devoted the bulk of its argument, more than two-thirds, to the first claim of disqualification, the claimed noncompliance with canon 6D of the California Code of Judicial Ethics. Similarly, the oral arguments here focused almost exclusively on the canon. Despite that, the majority essentially disregards that claim, to the point that it is virtually ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">So despite Tracy\u2019s focus and emphasis, and despite her argument, I will address the issues in the same order as the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\n<em>Code of Civil Procedure Section 170.3 Does Not Support Disqualification.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The majority focuses on Tracy\u2019s second basis for disqualification and holds that because Perkovich did not \u201c \u2018file a written verified answer admitting or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>denying\u2019 \u201d the allegations in Tracy\u2019s statement, she was \u201c \u2018deemed to have consented to . . . her disqualification.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 36.) And, the majority concludes, \u201cThat determination treats the judge\u2019s failure to file a response to the statement of disqualification as an admission of the truth of its allegations . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">This holding, I submit, is not supported here. Worse, it is flatly contrary to Presiding Judge Stone\u2019s order below.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Before turning to a demonstration of why, I begin with the observation that the majority\u2019s conclusion shows no appreciation of the realities of the situation, no consideration for what I understand, anecdotally at least, to be the real-life facts facing trial judges. Specifically: I understand that the standing order in many superior courts is that a judge who receives a challenge is to immediately advise his or her presiding judge. And I understand that the challenged judge is put in contact with the Judicial Council, which provides assistance, usually in the form of a lawyer to advise and assist the judge in how to respond. Put simply, a challenge to a judge is a most significant, yet infrequent, occurrence, one requiring expert help and guidance, help the court system provides. Thus, for example, there are at least two publications by the Judicial Council addressing the subject: (1) California Judges Bench Guide: Disqualification of Judge; and (2) Disqualification and Disclosure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is also a video to assist judges in dealing with judicial challenges: &lt;http://www2.courtinfo.ca.gov/cjer/judicial/1715.htm&gt; (as of Aug. 3, 2016). And a Serranus Web site.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Perkovich, of course, had access to none of that assistance. So, acting on her own, in response to Tracy\u2019s request for disqualification Perkovich prepared a letter to Presiding Judge Stone that was hand delivered to the court and filed on November 7, 2014. That letter provided in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201cDear Judge Stone,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">\u201cI would like to recuse myself from the case of Marriage of Hayward &amp; Osuch. The Petitioner, Tracy Hayward, filed a motion for disqualification on the grounds of bias on October 7, 2014. She alleges that I have a financial interest in the proceedings because I am paid for my work pursuant to the stipulation of the parties appointing me as the Judge Pro Tempore. She further claims a bias in favor of Blevans because Blevans has acted as a private settlement judge on one case where I was associated as counsel and because I have been hired on two cases where he was an attorney. I also had the same mutual judging relationship with two of Ms. Hayward\u2019s previous attorneys, Roger Lewis and John Munsill. I disagree that these professional relationships constitute bias. The California Rules of Court, Rule 2.830, et. seq. specifically allows for retention of private judges. The Petitioner consented to my retention. She did so after disclosure from me at our first case management meeting about the details of my professional relationship with both Munsill and Blevans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u201cI have, however, become concerned about my personal safety in this case due to Ms. Hayward\u2019s conduct. Her behavior has become increasingly hostile with angry outbursts to the point that I am fearful of her. It is also evident from Ms. Hayward\u2019s ongoing violations of the existing court orders that she will never accept anything I decide. I therefore feel that I am an impediment to resolution of the parties\u2019 case, which is not desirable. It is for these reasons that I request a recusal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The effect of this, the majority concludes, is the \u201cadmission of the truth of its allegations.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The Supreme Court has held that although the disqualification statute refers to a written, verified answer, a written declaration under penalty of perjury will satisfy the \u201cstatutory requirement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 668, 811 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 928 P.2d 485].) While admittedly not a verified answer or a declaration, Perkovich filed a response. In the cases the majority cites, the challenged judge filed nothing. <em>(Urias v. Harris Farms, Inc. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 415, 419 [285 Cal.Rptr. 659] [judge \u201cdid not respond\u201d]; <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 257, 260 [331 P.2d 648] [\u201cno denial of the allegations thereof by Judge Hewlicker\u201d].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>But most troubling of all is the majority\u2019s conclusion as to the claimed effect of this\u2014that it \u201cadmi[ts] the truth of [the] allegations\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 37.)\u2014is that it disregards Presiding Judge Stone\u2019s order of November 7, 2014. There, he disqualified Perkovich, finding that her letter requesting recusal \u2018\u201cdoes not satisfy the requirement of the filing of consent to the disqualification,\u201d and that \u2018\u201cas a result of her failure to file a consent or a verified answer within the time allowed, Nancy Perkovich is deemed to have consented to her disqualification pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.3(c)(4).\u201d But most significantly, Judge Stone\u2019s order held that \u2018\u201cThe court is making no finding as to whether the allegations set forth in Petitioner Tracy Hayward\u2019s Request for Order re Motion for Disqualification, filed October 7, 2014, is true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\n<em>Canon 6(D) Does Not Support Disqualification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As noted, the claimed noncompliance with canon 6D of the California Code of Judicial Ethics was the focus of most of Tracy\u2019s position here. That position is treated by the majority almost as an afterthought, relegated to a brief discussion. Whatever the significance to the majority, the claim does not support disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I do not understand that a failure to comply with a canon results in per se disqualification. The majority cites no law that it does. The law relied on by Jose holds it does not. (See, e.g., <em>Wechsler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 384, 387 [168 Cal.Rptr.3d 605] [judge not disqualified for failing to disclose potentially disqualifying information absent additional facts, even though disclosure required under Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 3E(2)(a)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 1, 16 [147 Cal.Rptr. 208] [judge not disqualified even though his \u2018\u201cintemperate and inflammatory remarks were totally improper; his conduct clearly violated canon 2A\u201d].) So, the fact that Perkovich failed to make disclosures as required does not, without more, result in disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">But beyond that, the majority assumes that there was noncompliance with the canon, without any meaningful discussion of paragraph 4 in the Stipulation, that \u201cBoth parties waive the clerk\u2019s minutes.\u201d That provision, I submit, could\u2014and should\u2014be read to say the parties expressly waived the canon\u2019s requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Under the canon, the disclosure must be \u201cin writing <em>or </em>on the record.\u201d (Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 6D(5), italics added.) No question there was no \u201cwriting.\u201d But there is a real question whether \u201con the record\u201d alternative was waived. As the majority recognizes, \u201cThe Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinions, which operates under the aegis of the California Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>has pointed out that one of the ways in which a disqualifying disclosure can be placed \u2018on the record\u2019 pursuant to canon 3E(2)(a) when there is no court reporter or electronic recording of the proceedings is to \u2018[e]nter the disclosure document in the case file as a minute order, official court minutes, or a formal order.\u2019 (Cal. Supreme Court, Com. on Judicial Ethics, <em>Disclosure on the Record When There Is No Court Reporter or Electronic Recording of the Proceedings, </em>formal opinion No. 2013-002 (Dec. 11, 2013) p. 9.)\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 48, fn. 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">As I understand it, Perkovich conducted the settlement conference in her office, with no court reporter, and no clerk, no one in the usual position who would create a \u201cminute order, official court minutes, or a formal order.\u201d Perhaps Munsill and Blevans, both experienced and involved with private judging, provided for that in the Stipulation, agreeing that \u201cBoth parties waive the clerk\u2019s minutes.\u201d What this means is nowhere discussed in the record, there being no testimony about it. The majority says, however unsupportedly, \u201c[t]he obvious meaning of this brief sentence is simply that the parties intended to forgo formal clerk\u2019s minutes for the proceedings to be held before the temporary judge.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 48.) That may be the \u201cobvious meaning\u201d to the majority. The \u201cobvious meaning\u201d to me is that this is an agreement, by knowledgeable counsel, using words of art, to effect an express waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The majority notes that Jose argues that \u201cTracy waived [the on the record requirement].\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 48.) The majority rejects the argument based on Code of Civil Procedure section 170.3, subdivision (b)(1), which the majority says \u201crequires a waiver of disqualification to \u2018recite the basis for the disqualification\u2019 and to be \u2018signed by all parties and their attorneys and filed in the record.\u2019 (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (b)(1).) No such waiver exists in the present case.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 48.) This, I submit, is simply wrong, as section 170.3, subdivision (b)(1) applies only \u201cwhen the judge determines himself or herself to be disqualified.\u201d Perkovich did not do that here.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">But even if the record does not support an express waiver, it certainly supports an implied one.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Any Claimed Disqualification Was Waived</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">There is no doubt that parties can waive disqualification by their conduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(2015) 60 Cal.4th 966, 979-980 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 612, 343 P.3d 808] <em>(Johnson); Tri Counties Bank v. Superior Court </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1337-1338 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 835] <em>(Tri </em>Counties); <em>In re Steven O. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 46, 53-54 [279 Cal.Rptr. 868].) Thus in <em>Johnson, </em>a capital murder case, the Supreme Court held that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>waived his right to disqualify the judge based on the judge\u2019s close professional and personal relationship with the prosecutor when, at the outset of the proceeding, and after full disclosure of the relationship, counsel agreed to proceed. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at pp. 978-980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The majority observes that Tracy claims she did not hear Perkovich\u2019s disclosure. But even if she did not, it would not matter. Again <em>Johnson </em>is apt, where a unanimous Supreme Court noted that even if the defendant was not properly told by his counsel about the judge\u2019s relationship, the right to challenge the judge is within \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018counsel\u2019s complete control of . . . strategies and tactics.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at p. 979, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354] is similar. There, the defendant argued he was not personally present when the circumstances giving rise to the waiver occurred. The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s \u201cabsence makes no difference. He was represented by counsel, who <em>was </em>present at the hearing. \u2018 \u201cWhen the accused exercises his constitutional right to representation by professional counsel, it is counsel, not defendant, who is in charge of the case. By choosing professional representation, the accused surrenders all but a handful of \u2018fundamental\u2019 personal rights to <em>counsel\u2019s </em>complete control of defense strategies and tactics.\u201d \u2019 <em>(In re Horton </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 82, 95 [284 Cal.Rptr. 305, 813 P.2d 1335], original italics [holding that counsel may impliedly stipulate to trial before a court commissioner].) \u2018 \u201cAn attorney may not sit back, fully participate in a trial and then claim that the court was without jurisdiction on receiving a result unfavorable to him.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Here, Tracy did not promptly seek Perkovich\u2019s disqualification even though she and her attorney, Munsill, knew on October 30, 2012, that the disclosures were not made on the record. They decided not to challenge Perkovich at the time, and in fact consented to her continuing as the private judge. This decision \u201ccame within the range of tactical decisions competent counsel may make\u201d; it is not to be second guessed. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>60 Cal.4th at p. 980.)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">That waiver is present here is also demonstrated by Tracy\u2019s earlier attempts to have Perkovich removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">As indicated in the majority, Tracy first attempted to have Perkovich removed on September 3, 2013, via a motion filed by Attorney Jackson. Nothing was said about noncompliance with canon 6(D) of the California Code of Judicial Ethics, nothing about any claimed biased conduct or rulings. The motion was denied three weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Then, on May 30, 2014, represented by Attorney Dolnick, Tracy filed what the majority calls a \u201csecond motion to withdraw the stipulation,\u201d in the words of the majority, \u201cthis time on the ground that, due to Ms. Perkovich\u2019s failure to certify that she was \u2018aware of and will comply with applicable provisions of canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Ethics and the Rules of Court,\u2019 as required by rule 2.831(b), she lacked the power to rule on the pending motion to enforce the MOA pursuant to section 664.6, and lacked judicial authority \u2018to make any of the determinations she has made in this matter to date.\u2019 The motion maintained that Ms. Perkovich\u2019s failure to provide the certification required by the Rules of Court provided \u2018good cause\u2019 permitting Tracy to withdraw the stipulation (Rule 2.831(1)).\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 25-26.) Again, nothing was said about claimed noncompliance with the canon. And nothing about any claimed biased conduct or rulings by Perkovich, all of which had happened many months before.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Tracy\u2019s second motion to remove Perkovich was denied on July 11, 2014. She took a writ. We denied it. The Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Only in Tracy\u2019s third attempt to remove Perkovich, filed on October 7, 2014, did Tracy make the claims as to noncompliance with the canon and the claimed biased conduct the majority relies on here. This time, as the majority states, \u201cTracy\u2019s \u2018statement of disqualification\u2019[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] was based on two separate grounds\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 26), those quoted above. And as to the second ground, the majority describes it this way: \u201cThe second . . . was that any person aware of her conduct \u2018would have substantial doubt that Perkovich was or could be impartial,\u2019 and Perkovich should therefore be disqualified under section 170.1, subdivision (a)(6)(A)(iii). In support of her bias claim, Tracy declared that Ms. Perkovich \u2018seemed to visibly favor\u2019 Jose and Blevans and \u2018took steps to block\u2019 Tracy\u2019s attorney from introducing evidence supporting her contentions. . . . Tracy declared that Perkovich conveyed bias by her \u2018body language and her tone toward me and Mr. Jackson,\u2019 which \u2018was very different than it was toward Mr. Blevans and [Jose]. She was very standoffish, and regularly appeared to be visibly and noticeably annoyed with me\u2019 and \u2018often would stand over me with her arms crossed. She would never make eye contact with me. When [Jose] or Blevans spoke, Perkovich was relaxed and thoughtful, often making helpful comments or asking insightful questions that would help them fully develop the point they were trying to make.\u2019 Perkovich also allegedly engaged in \u2018highly inappropriate\u2019 interactions with Blevans. \u2018For example,\u2019 Tracy stated, \u2018during the July 30, 2013, hearing, I personally saw Perkovich flirt with Blevans, proclaiming, \u201cOh Bob, that\u2019s so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>funny of you,\u201d while she batted her eyelashes at him,\u2019 and Perkovich and Blevans \u2018inappropriately spoke to each other about the case when my attorney was not present,\u2019 which Tracy assertedly learned from an invoice billing her for the time Perkovich spent on the phone, without Tracy\u2019s lawyer, in preparation for a hearing.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">As seen, to the extent Tracy identified any date when any allegedly biased activity occurred, the latest date mentioned is \u2018\u201cJuly 30, 2013,\u201d the day Tracy claims she saw Perkovich \u201cflirt\u201d with Blevans. Her attempt at disqualification filed 14 months later was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Any Claim for Disqualification Was Untimely</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In the express language of the disqualification statute, a party seeking disqualification must move \u201cat the earliest practicable opportunity after discovery of the facts constituting the ground for disqualification.\u201d (\u00a7 170.3, subd. (c); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1067, 1111 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 118, 129 P.3d 321]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1206.) Failure to comply with the promptness requirement constitutes forfeiture or an implied waiver of the disqualification. <em>(Tri-Counties Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1337 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 835]; <em>In re Steven O., supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 54-55.) The Supreme Court has many times set out the reason for the promptness rule: \u201c\u2018 \u201c[I]t would seem . . . intolerable to permit a party to play fast and loose with the administration of justice by deliberately standing by without making an objection of which he is aware and thereby permitting the proceedings to go to a conclusion which he may acquiesce in, if favorable, and which he may avoid, if not.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1207, quoting <em>In re Steven O., supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 53-55.) Those principles govern here.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Perkovich\u2019s claimed noncompliance with canon 6D of the California Code of Judicial Ethics was in late October 2012. It was necessarily known at that time. The claimed biased rulings and biased conduct were all known by mid-2013, October at the latest. Tracy\u2019s request to disqualify was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The MOA Cannot Be Set Aside as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The majority\u2019s penultimate holding is that \u201cthe MOA was tainted by Perkovich\u2019s void rulings and is therefore unenforceable\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 55, capitalization &amp; italics omitted.), a holding apparently made in response to Tracy\u2019s assertion that the MOA was the result of the \u201cultimate duress.\u201d As the majority describes it, \u201cTracy emphasizes that the MOA was proposed in the wake of a series of adverse rulings issued by Perkovich after Munsill was replaced as her counsel by Jackson, who was unaware of the mutual judging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>relationships between Perkovich and Blevans. According to Tracy, Blevans was aware of the hostility between Perkovich and Tracy and her counsel and, in that context, the MOA presented Jackson and Tracy a Hobson\u2019s choice <em>(Ibid.) </em>And so the majority finds such \u201ctaint,\u201d expressly doing so \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">I disagree, for reasons both legal and factual.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">As to the legal, as noted, duress is a question of fact. <em>(Kravitz </em>v. <em>BT Visual Images, supra, </em>89 Cal.App.4th 164, 176.) The majority cites nothing to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">As to the factual, the circumstances leading to the MOA are described in detail above. To briefly recap, the MOA was signed in January 2014, following months of settlement discussions that resumed in August 2013. The terms of the MOA were very much along the lines of a proposal Tracy had made, though one of the monetary terms was increased. And the MOA followed an all day settlement conference on December 14 attended by Tracy and three attorneys on her side: Jackson, representing her, and Ian Carter and Eric Jeppson, representing her company. I do not understand how that can be duress as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">That it is not is made clear by <em>Rossco Holdings, Inc. v. Bank of America </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1353 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 141], the one case cited by the majority, a case the majority describes as follows: \u201cAs earlier described, the trial judge [Judge Williams] in the case disqualified himself after issuing an order compelling arbitration. The newly assigned judge vacated not only the order compelling arbitration, but also the subsequent arbitration award. While affirming that the disqualified judge\u2019s order compelling arbitration was void, the reviewing court reversed the order vacating the arbitration award as premature because the award was not necessarily improper: . . . [T]he arbitration award should be vacated only if the trial court determined that the arbitration was tainted by the disqualified judge, or should be vacated on other grounds. [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 57-58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In other words, the Court of Appeal remanded for further proceedings, with the trial court to vacate the arbitration award \u201c[o]nly if the trial court concludes that the arbitration was tainted by Judge Williams.\u201d <em>(Rossco Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bank of America, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.4th at p. 1367.) Or, to put it bluntly, \u201ctaint\u201d is a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Some Closing Observations</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">I conclude with the observation that I have no dispute with the majority\u2019s laudatory characterizations of the goals of canon 6D of the California Code of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Judicial Ethics and the importance of having judicial decision makers free from the suspicion of possible bias. And certainly I do not disagree with the majority that disclosure requirements must be taken seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">That said, I do disagree that a private judge\u2019s failure to make such a disclosure irretrievably taints everything done by him or her. No case I am aware of so holds, and I am not prepared to sign on to the first case that does, especially not in light of the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Moreover, I would not be surprised to learn that there may be cases where parties through their attorneys have chosen to proceed with a private judge\u2014 the respected person they want, and trust, to decide their case\u2014in which the private judge may not have strictly complied with canon 6D of the California Code of Judicial Ethics, not making the required disclosure \u201cin writing or on the record.\u201d If that is true, parties up and down California will wake up to a majority opinion that tells them that the orders under which they are proceeding with their financial affairs\u2014not to mention, the custody of their children\u2014are void. If, heaven forbid, that is the case, I can only imagine the havoc that will follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The majority goes where no court has gone before. I refuse to join them. And I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was granted November 9, 2016, S237174. On March 1, 2017, review dismissed and cause transferred to Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Two.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\"> Here are a few quotations from the briefs:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u201cNo California litigant should ever have to wonder whether the paid private judge they entrusted with their' case is corrupt and aligned with the other side\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u201cThe relationship between Mr. Blevans and Ms. Perkovich has cast a pall over this case. The thought that a system could be manipulated to the point that a \u2018settlement\u2019 could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>obtained by threatening to have a private judge who was subject to disqualification take away a litigant\u2019s company and her livelihood unless millions of dollars were forfeited via \u2018settlement\u2019 is stomach toning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u201cInstead, these attorneys and experts had worked together and side-stepped ethical requirements so often, that they never even considered complying with the Canons of Judicial Ethics by making on the record disclosures. Nor did they ever consider requesting a proper signed, written waiver they could file with the court. [\u00b6] If a litigant caught on and protested, these family law attorneys planned to chele the wagons and try to blame the litigant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">\u201cApparently, attorneys and experts who all know each other and work together on case after case, get in a room or call each other\u2019s cell phones, and they collectively decide what is going to happen and how the litigants\u2019 money will be doled out to the involved professionals. [\u00b6] Attorneys who are socially and professionally connected to the experts and other attorneys in the case, acting as paid judges for their friends, is bad enough. But where the \u2018judging\u2019 relationship is <em>mutual, </em>there is a strong temptation for attorneys who act as \u2018paid private judges\u2019 to engage in unethical and inappropriate \u2018you scratch by back; I\u2019ll scratch yours\u2019 behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"au-dedup-0\">\u201cHowever, by systematically \u2018relaxing\u2019 these ethical rules, small groups of family law attorneys can dominate their local markets, knowing reciprocity will ensure ample attorney\u2019s fee awards and outcomes that financially benefit the attorneys who hire their friends as judges. [\u00b6] This routinized departure from the ethical rules helps ensure that money will be free-flowing for the attorneys and experts\u2014handed out by a \u2018judge\u2019 who, in reality, is a friend they can count on.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\"> Hyperbole by attorneys is one thing. Disingenuousness is another. And I am particularly concerned by the 180-degree change of position manifest by the belated claim of duress here, in light of the express concession of Tracy and her attorneys in their writ petition to this court. There, in arguing that Perkovich should not be the one to enforce the MOA, they made these representations: \u201cThe MOA is not the result of a ruling or order of attorney Perkovich, and she did not sign it. She had no role in its preparation or execution. The MOA was negotiated by lawyers working in the office of Jose\u2019s counsel. It was signed initially by Tracy at her private residence and later by her at her family law attorney\u2019s office. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] [Perkovich\u2019s] role as a judicial officer was <em>not in play </em>in the MOA. Her imprimatur was not necessary for it to have effect. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Nancy Perkovich has no nexus with the MOA Tracy and Jose executed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">I do not understand such a blatant change of position to be ethical advocacy. And the majority\u2019s labored effort to explain this away in a two-page discussion of \u201cancillary\u201d matters does not convince me otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\"> The introduction to Disqualification and Disclosure, described as a \u201cCompilation of Advice From the Ethics Committee of the California Judges Association and Discipline by the Commission on Judicial Performance,\u201d nicely synthesizes the situation:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u201cINTRODUCTION \"\u2019This paper addresses the problems facing judges in recognizing situations and cases in their court assignments that mandate disclosure and potential disqualification. Judges are required by statute (CCP \u00a7 170) and the canons (Code of Judicial Ethics Canon 3B( 1)) to hear and decide all matters in which they are not disqualified, and they may be disciplined for improper recusal [citation]. At the same time, they are required to adhere diligently to the statutes governing disqualification (CCP \u00a7\u00a7 170.1 et seq.) .... However, in determining the propriety of presiding in matters which contain factors that overlap on the remainder of their personal and professional lives, judges are frequently confronted with questions that cannot be resolved by simple reference to the codes and the canons.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u201cThe California Judges Association provides a hot line service with immediate member access to a judge serving on the Committee on Judicial Ethics. The presented problem is analyzed, and informal advice is rendered ....</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u201cThis paper focuses on disqualification and disclosure problems . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\"> As shown below (see fn. 5), the majority notes, but excuses, that Tracy\u2019s attempt to remove Perkovich was not the correct document, not the required \u201cstatement of disqualification.\u201d No matter, the majority says, we\u2019ll consider it as proper. But not as to Perkovich\u2019s letter denying the charges and asking to be released. No, that was not the required \u201canswer,\u201d and so the majority concludes Perkovich admitted all charges of bias. In other words, no need to hold Tracy to the letter of the law. Just Perkovich.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> Actually, Tracy\u2019s request was not a \u201cstatement of disqualification,\u201d and thus not the proper pleading. It was filed on a Judicial Council form \u201cRequest for Order,\u201d and characterized as a \u201cMotion to Disqualify Nancy Perkovich.\u201d The proper form is a \u201cStatement of Disqualification.\u201d (See <em>Urias </em>v. <em>Harris Farms, Inc., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 421.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
