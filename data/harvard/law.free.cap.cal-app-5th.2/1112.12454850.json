(minor) to expunge his DNA samples from the state\u2019s database following the juvenile court\u2019s grant of his simultaneous request to redesignate his admitted felony offense as a misdemeanor. Minor brought these requests under Penal Code section 1170.18, a measure enacted following passage of Proposition 47, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, which reduced the classification of certain crimes from felony to misdemeanor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to minor, his DNA samples should be expunged because, had his offense been classified as a misdemeanor at the time he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>admitted committing it, the juvenile court would have, in the first instance, lacked authority to order him to submit the samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">However, as explained below, Proposition 47 construed in conjunction with the DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Data Bank Act of 1998 (DNA Database Act), section 295 et seq., supports the juvenile court\u2019s decision to deny minor\u2019s expungement request in this case. Moreover, and confirming this conclusion, our Legislature recently enacted Assembly Bill No. 1492 (2015-2016 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill No. 1492), which clarifies that, pursuant to section 299, a trial court is not authorized to order expungement of a defendant\u2019s DNA sample when granting relief under section 1170.18 to redesignate a felony offense as a misdemeanor. Accordingly, we affirm the juvenile court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">On September 20, 2013, a petition was filed pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, alleging that minor committed second degree robbery in violation of Penal Code sections 211 and 212.5 (count one), and first degree residential burglary in violation of sections 459 and 460, subdivision (a) (count two). This petition was amended on October 1, 2013, to add allegations that minor also committed felony grand theft from the person (\u00a7 487, subd. (c)) (count three), and misdemeanor burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a)) (count four).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the same date, minor admitted the amended allegations (counts three and four) and the remaining allegations (counts one and two) were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">On October 15, 2013, the juvenile court adjudged minor a ward of the court with no termination date, ordered his out-of-home placement and, among other things, ordered him to submit DNA samples for the state DNA database.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">On July 6, 2015, minor filed a petition for relief under section 1170.18, requesting that his felony grand theft adjudication be redesignated as a misdemeanor, that the order requiring submission of DNA samples be vacated, and that his DNA samples be expunged from the state DNA database. Following a hearing, on July 21, 2015, the juvenile court granted minor\u2019s request to redesignate his felony offense as a misdemeanor, but denied his requests to vacate the order to submit DNA samples and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>expunge his samples from the state DNA database. On September 14, 2015, minor filed a timely notice of appeal of this order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Minor raises one argument on appeal\u2014to wit, that the juvenile court misconstrued Proposition 47 when finding that he was not entitled to have his DNA samples expunged from the state database after reclassifying his felony offense as a misdemeanor. The standard of review is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">We review de novo questions of statutory or voter initiative interpretation. <em>(Evangelatos v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1212 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585] [rules of statutory interpretation apply to voter initiatives]; <em>Argaman v. Ratan </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1176 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 917].) The fundamental rule of statutory (or voter initiative) construction is that we must ascertain the intent of the drafters so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(Preston </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 197, 213 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 407, 19 P.3d 1148].) \u201cTo determine the intent of legislation, we first consult the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(DaFonte </em>v. <em>Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 601 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140].) \u201cWe do not, however, consider the statutory language in isolation; rather, we look to the entire substance of the statutes in order to determine their scope and purposes. [Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question in context, keeping in mind the statutes\u2019 nature and obvious purposes. [Citation.] We must harmonize the various parts of the enactments by considering them in the context of the statutory frame work as a whole. [Citation.] If the statutory language is unambiguous, then its plain meaning controls. If, however, the language supports more than one reasonable construction, then we may look to extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 964, 975 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 261, 135 P.3d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">In this case, minor contends proper interpretation of Proposition 47 requires a trial court to expunge DNA samples submitted by a criminal defendant (including a juvenile) whose offense is reclassified from a felony to a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18. Proposition 47, as mentioned above, \u201c \u2018reduces penalties for certain offenders convicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes\u2019 and \u2018allows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for reduced sentences.\u2019 (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35 (Ballot Pamphlet).) One of those \u2018nonserious and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>nonviolent property and drug crimes\u2019 is shoplifting, so long as the value of the stolen property is less than $950. (See Ballot Pamphlet, <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 47, \u00a75, p. 71.)\u201d <em>(In re J.C. </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 731].) Minor, relying on a recent decision from the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, <em>Alejandro N. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1209 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 907] <em>(Alejandro), </em>contends the juvenile court was required under Proposition 47 to grant his request to expunge his DNA record because, once his crime was reclassified as a misdemeanor, it was no longer a \u2018\u201cqualifying offense\u201d for purposes of the DNA Database Act. (See \u00a7 296, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">The People, to the contrary, contend, first, that <em>Alejandro </em>was wrongly decided and, second, that, even if correctly decided when published, <em>Alejandro </em>is no longer good law because, in enacting Assembly Bill No. 1492, the Legislature made clear that section 1170.18, properly read, does not authorize a trial court to expunge a defendant\u2019s DNA sample when granting a petition to redesignate the qualifying offense from felony to misdemeanor. We agree with the People\u2019s latter point and, thus, need not directly address the wisdom of <em>Alejandro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Turning first to the relevant statutory framework, section 1170.18 provides a procedure by which persons, like minor, found to have committed a felony, yet \u2018\u201cwho would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under [Proposition 47]\u201d had it been in effect at the time of their offense, may request redesignation of the offense from felony to misdemeanor. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) Relevant here, section 1170.18, subdivision (1), provides that a person who has \u2018\u201ccompleted his or her sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under this act had this act been in effect at the time of the offense, may file an application before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case to have the felony conviction or convictions designated as misdemeanors.\u201d Further, where the section 1170.18 applicant has satisfied the criteria in subdivision (1), the trial court \u2018\u201cshall designate the felony offense or offenses as a misdemeanor.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">There is no dispute in this case that minor satisfied the criteria in section 1170.18, subdivision (g), such that the juvenile court was required to (and did) redesignate his offense as a misdemeanor. The dispute, rather, centers around whether the juvenile court was required, in light of this redesignation, to order expungement of minor\u2019s DNA samples from the state database pursuant to section 299, the statute governing DNA record expungement. Part of the DNA Database Act, section 299 was amended in 2004 through passage of Proposition 69, the DNA Fingerprint, Unsolved Crime and Innocence Protection Act, which \u201csubstantially expanded the range of persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>who must submit DNA samples to the state\u2019s forensic identification databank.\u201d <em>(Good v. Superior Court </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1498 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 125].) Persons qualifying under this act for submission of DNA samples include any person, including any juvenile, who is convicted of or pleads guilty or no contest to any felony offense, or is found not guilty by reason of insanity of any felony offense, or any juvenile who is adjudicated under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code for committing any felony offense; any adult person arrested for or charged with one of the enumerated felony offenses; any person, including any juvenile, required to register under section 290 or 457.1 because of the commission of, or the attempt to commit, a felony or misdemeanor offense; or any person, including any juvenile, who is housed in a mental health facility or sex offender treatment program after referral to such facility or program by a court after being charged with any felony offense. (\u00a7 296, subd. (a).) The DNA submission requirements \u2018\u201cshall apply to all <em>qualifying </em>persons regardless of sentence imposed . . . and regardless of disposition rendered or placement made in the case of juvenile who is found to have committed any felony offense . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 296, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Under section 299, a person whose DNA profile has been included in the state data bank \u2018\u201cshall have his or her DNA specimen and sample destroyed and searchable database profile expunged from the databank program ... if the person has no past or present offense or pending charge which qualifies that person for inclusion within the state\u2019s DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Databank Program and there otherwise is no legal basis for retaining the specimen or sample or searchable profile.\u201d (\u00a7 299, subd. (a).) Further, under subdivision (f) of this statute, <em>\u2018\u201c[n]oWithstanding any other law,\" </em>a judge is barred from relieving a person of his or her administrative duty to submit DNA pursuant to this chapter if the person has been found guilty or was adjudicated a ward of the court for a qualifying offense under section 296, subdivision (a), or pleaded no contest to one of these qualifying offenses. (\u00a7 299, subd. (f), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">This provision, as it read at the time of minor\u2019s petition for relief, set forth a nonexhaustive list of three statutes pursuant to which a judge is prohibited from relieving a person of his or her duty to submit DNA for the state forensic identification DNA database\u2014to wit, sections 17, 1203.4 and 1203.4a. (\u00a7 299, former subd. (f).) Each of these three enumerated statutes is similar to section 1170.18 in that it provides postconviction relief from punishment or penalties to qualifying defendants by, for example, reclassifying a felony offense as a misdemeanor, or dismissing the information entirely upon successful completion of a probationary term. (See \u00a7\u00a717 [authorizing a trial court, in its discretion, to treat a qualifying offense as either a felony or a misdemeanor], 1203.4, subd. (a)(1) [authorizing a trial court, in certain cases, to set aside a guilty verdict and \u2018\u201cdismiss the accusations or information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>against the defendant,\u201d thereby releasing the defendant \u201cfrom all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense\u201d], 1203.4a, subd. (a) [authorizing a trial court to, among other things, set aside a guilty verdict and dismiss the information against a misdemeanant who was not granted probation, has served his sentence, has not been charged with or convicted of a subsequent crime, and has, since judgment, lived \u201can honest and upright life\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">In October 2015, Assembly Bill No. 1492 was signed by the Governor. Among other things, it amended section 299, subdivision (1) to include section 1170.18 in the nonexhaustive list of statutes that do <em>not </em>authorize a judge to relieve a person of his or her administrative duty to provide DNA. Thus, effective January 1, 2016, this provision reads: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other law, including Sections 17, 1170.18, 1203.4, and 1203.4a, </em>a judge is not authorized to relieve a person of the separate administrative duty to provide . . . samples . . . required by this chapter if a person . . . was adjudicated a ward of the court by a trier of fact of a qualifying offense as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 296.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 299, subd. (1), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Notwithstanding the former or amended version of section 299, subdivision (1), minor contends a criminal defendant\u2019s right to expungement of DNA records is triggered by a court\u2019s redesignation of a criminal offense under Proposition 47 by way of another statute, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), which states: \u201cAny felony conviction that is . . . designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) <em>shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, </em>except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm or prevent his or her conviction [for being a felon in possession of a firearm].\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (k), italics added.) According to minor, this statutory command that his offense be considered a misdemeanor \u201cfor all purposes\u201d requires expungement of his DNA samples because, under California law, juvenile delinquents are not required to submit DNA unless they are found to have committed a felony. Minor\u2019s argument finds support in <em>Alejandro, </em>which held that a felony redesignated a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18 \u201cno longer qualifies as an offense permitting DNA collection\u201d and, thus, is \u201coutside the matters contemplated by the Penal Code DNA expungement statute.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Alejandro, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.4th at p. 1229, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>We reject minor\u2019s analysis on several grounds. First, as the People (and the juvenile court) have noted, Proposition 47 nowhere mentions DNA expungement. Rather, it is completely silent with respect to the state-maintained DNA data bank. As such, we question minor\u2019s interpretation of Proposition 47 as <em>requiring </em>expungement whenever a court grants relief to a criminal defendant under section 1170.18. (See <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(2015) 62 Cal.4th 340, 350 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 773, 362 P.3d 417] [courts are not \u201c[o]rdinarily . . . free to add text to the language selected by the Legislature\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Further, the DNA sample submission requirement under the DNA Database Act does not necessarily hinge on whether a person is convicted of a felony or misdemeanor. Rather, under the relevant statutory language, the act\u2019s triggering point is when \u201c[a]ny person, including any juvenile, ... is convicted of or <em>pleads guilty or no contest to any felony offense.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 296, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) In addition, the act does not apply only to convicted felons, but extends to several categories of misdemeanants, including those required to register with law enforcement as sex offenders or arsonists (see \u00a7 296, subd. (a)(3)), a fact reflective of the measure\u2019s administrative\u2014and nonpunitive\u2014design of creating a state data bank to \u2018\u201cto assist in the accurate identification of criminal offenders\u201d (\u00a7 295, subd. (d); see also \u00a7 295, subd. (b)(2) [\u201cIt is the intent of the people of the State of California, in order to further the purposes of [the act], to require DNA and forensic identification data bank samples from all persons, including juveniles, for the felony <em>and misdemeanor </em>offenses described in [section 296, subdivision (a)]\u201d (italics added)]; <em>Good v. Superior Court, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1508 [\u201cProposition 69, immediately effective, listed felon and misdemeanant registrants as among those who qualified for DNA sampling. The requirement is not punitive, does not involve concepts of retroactivity or ex post facto implications, but is confined to a simple administrative identifying procedure akin to fingerprinting or keeping one\u2019s whereabouts known to law enforcement.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Travis </em>(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1271, 1295 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 177] [DNA collection is \u201cnonpenal\u201d]). We thus find without legal support minor\u2019s assumption that reclassification of the offense underlying a conviction from a felony to a misdemeanor, in and of itself, triggers the right of a criminal defendant to have his or her DNA records expunged. (See <em>Taxpayers to Limit Campaign Spending v. Fair Pol. Practices Com. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 744, 764 [274 Cal.Rptr. 787, 799 P.2d 1220] [when interpreting statutory language, courts must try to \u201creconcile or harmonize conflicting statutory provisions in an effort to give effect to all provisions if it is possible\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Indeed, and to the contrary, the DNA Database Act expressly limits the right to seek expungement to persons with \u201cno past or present qualifying offense\u201d whose cases fall within one of four legal categories: (1) following arrest no accusatory pleading is filed for prosecution or a qualifying charge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>dismissed prior to adjudication; (2) the qualifying conviction has been reversed and the case dismissed; (3) the defendant has been found factually innocent; or (4) the defendant has been found not guilty or acquitted of the qualifying offense. (\u00a7 299, subd. (b)(1)\u2014(4).) Here, minor, who admitted committing the qualifying offense, falls within none of the identified categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">In addition, we find persuasive the decision relied upon below by the juvenile court, <em>Coffey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 809 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 59] <em>(Coffey), </em>which addressed whether the defendant, who pled guilty to a \u201cwobbler\u201d offense as a felony, was entitled to expungement of his DNA sample after the court reduced the charge pursuant to section 17, the so-called \u201cwobbler\u201d statute, and sentenced him to a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There, as here, the defendant claimed a right to expungement on the ground that \u201cDNA sampling is not required or authorized for a misdemeanor offense.\u201d <em>(Coffey, </em>at p. 818.) The defendant relied upon subdivision (b) of section 17, which reads: \u201cWhen a crime is punishable, in the discretion of the court, either by imprisonment in the state prison ... or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail, it is a misdemeanor <em>for all purposes </em>under the following circumstances: [\u00b6] (1) After a judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, as the <em>Coffey </em>court noted, under this provision, \u201cif a judge sentences the defendant to a misdemeanor punishment, the defendant\u2019s crime becomes a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>(Coffey, </em>at p. 818, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">The <em>Coffey </em>court nonetheless rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his offense should be treated as a misdemeanor for purposes of DNA record expungement. The court reasoned that, \u201cfor purposes of the DNA Database Act, Coffey was convicted of a felony when he pled guilty to a wobbler offense as a felony. He was therefore subject to the DNA Database Act when his DNA samples were taken, and the collection of the samples was lawful [under section 296] .... Because the samples were lawfully collected, there is no constitutional right to their return.\u201d <em>(Coffey, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">According to the People, this analysis in <em>Coffey </em>resonates here, in that, like a felony reclassified as a misdemeanor under section 17, a felony reclassified as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18 remains a qualifying offense for purposes of the administrative duties set out in the DNA Database Act, such that the offender is not eligible for expungement on the basis of the reclassification. Minor, in turn, insists section 17 is distinct from section 1170.18 and, thus, irrelevant to the issue raised herein. He reasons that, when an offense is reduced to a misdemeanor under section 17, the offense is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>deemed a misdemeanor for all purposes only going forward, yet when, as here, an offense is reclassified as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18, it is deemed a misdemeanor for all purposes, going forward <em>and </em>retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">We agree with the People that <em>Coffey </em>is instructive here. As aptly explained by our colleagues in Division One of this District when recently addressing the identical legal issue: \u201cPrior to the addition of section 1170.18 by Bill No. 1492, section <em>299(f) </em>referred to sections 17, 1203.4, and 1203.4a. Section 17 governs \u2018wobbler\u2019 offenses, which are offenses that can be treated as felonies or misdemeanors in the discretion of the sentencing court. <em>([People </em>v.] <em>Lynall </em>[(2015)] 233 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1108 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 129].) Subdivision (b) of section 17 dictates \u2018[w]hen\u2019 a wobbler is treated as a misdemeanor, including after a defendant has been sentenced to a punishment other than prison <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)(1)), when a court declares a wobbler a misdemeanor upon granting probation <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)(3)), and when the prosecutor designates the crime as such in a charging document <em>(id., </em>subd. (b)(5)). In addition, under subdivision (c) of section 17, if a juvenile is committed to the Division of Juvenile Justice on the basis of a wobbler conviction, the violation is \u2018thereafter . . . deemed a misdemeanor for all purposes\u2019 following his or her discharge. Sections 1203.4 and 1203.4a govern the dismissal of charges following a successful completion of probation. (See, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(2013) 57 Cal.4th 64, 72-73 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 290, 302 P.3d 598].) These statutes have one thing in common. Their application generally results in the reduction of a felony conviction suffered by a defendant to something less serious\u2014either a misdemeanor under section 17 or, in the case of sections 1203.4 and 1203.4a, dismissal altogether. The felony conviction necessarily required provision of a DNA sample, but the defendant would not have been required to provide a sample had the conviction been designated a misdemeanor from the outset or if there had been no criminal charges at all. <em>The unmistakable implication of the reference to these statutes in section 299(f) is that the section was intended to prohibit trial courts, when reducing or dismissing charges pursuant to the listed statutes, from cdso expunging the DNA record given in connection with the original felony conviction.\u201d (In re J.C., supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1472-1474, fn. omitted &amp; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">Our colleagues went on to note that a conviction for a wobbler offense charged as a felony has \u201ctraditionally been regarded as a felony until the point in time at which the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision converts it to a misdemeanor,\u201d and is only deemed a misdemeanor for all purposes following the decision. <em>(In re J.C., supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479.) Thus, \u201c[i]f redesignation under section 1170.18 is similarly analogized to the treatment of wobbler offenses, the redesignation of a felony conviction would not justify DNA record expungement. Under section 299, subdivision (b), a person is entitled to expungement of his or her DNA record only \u2018if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>person has no past or present offense or pending charge which qualifies that person for inclusion.\u2019 (\u00a7 299, subd. (a).) If a felony conviction redesignated as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18 is treated as a felony up until the time of redesignation, similar to a wobbler felony conviction under section 17, the defendant would continue to have a past qualifying conviction even after the redesignation. Under the terms of section 299, the defendant would not be entitled to expungement of his or her DNA record.\u201d <em>(In re J.C., supra, </em>at p. 1479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">We agree with our colleague\u2019s reasoning in this regard and, thus, conclude, like our colleagues, that section 1170.18 should be treated like section 17 for purposes of the DNA Database Act, with the effect that a felony reclassified as a misdemeanor under section 1170.18 remains a qualifying offense under the act, precluding the offender from obtaining additional relief in the form of expungement on the basis of such reclassification. (Accord, <em>Coffey, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 821-822 [\u00a7 299, subd. (f), as enacted in 2004, \u201cmerely clarified existing law\u201d that a defendant is not entitled to expungement of a DNA record when a wobbler conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor pursuant to \u00a7 17].) As stated above, the act is quite clear that a defendant, including a juvenile, becomes subject to the DNA submission requirement upon being \u201cconvicted of or pleading] guilty or no contest to any felony offense,\u201d and \u201cregardless of [the] disposition rendered or placement made in the case of juvenile who is found to have committed any felony offense.\u201d (\u00a7 296, subds. (a)(1), (b).) As such, the fact that an admitted felony offense is later reclassified as a misdemeanor does not change the offense\u2019s status as a qualifying offense for purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">Moreover, even before its recent amendment, section 299, subdivision (1), expressly stated that, <em>notwithstanding any other law, </em>a judge cannot relieve a defendant of the administrative duty to provide DNA for inclusion in the state\u2019s DNA database. Given this particular language, we decline to read the more general language in section 1170.18, subdivision (k) that an offense reclassified as a misdemeanor must be treated as a misdemeanor \u201cfor all purposes\u201d as a legislative grant of authority to a judge to disregard the restrictions placed upon his or her authority by section 299, subdivision (1). (See <em>Coffey, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 823 [\u201csince the definition and consequence of a \u2018misdemeanor\u2019 is a creation of the Legislature, the term \u2018all purposes\u2019 merely refers to the purposes delineated by the Legislature. And because the Legislature has determined that a defendant whose sentence is reduced to a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b), <em>must </em>provide DNA samples (\u00a7 296), it cannot be that a defendant is insulated from providing DNA samples merely because his sentence is reduced to a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b)\u201d].) Indeed, the law of statutory interpretation requires the opposite. (See <em>Ni v. Slocum </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1636, 1647 [127 Cal.Rptr.3d 620] [The phrase \u201c \u2018[notwithstanding any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>provision of law\u2019 \u201d generally expresses a legislative intent \u201c \u2018 \u201cto have the specific statute control despite the existence of other law which might otherwise govern\u201d \u2019 \u201d and to \u201c \u2018 \u201cdeclare[] the legislative intent to override all contrary law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].) The law of statutory interpretation also dictates that where, similar to here with section 17, subdivision (b), \u201clegislation has been judicially construed and a subsequent statute on a similar subject uses identical or substantially similar language, the usual presumption is that the Legislature [or the voters] intended the same construction, unless a contrary intent clearly appears.\u201d <em>(In re Jerry R. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1437 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 155]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1100 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 362] [\u201cthe language in [section 1170.18, subdivision (k)] that a conviction that is reduced to a misdemeanor under that section <em>\u2018shall be </em>... <em>a misdemeanor for all </em>purposes\u2019 is not significantly different from the language in section 17(b), which provides that after the court exercises its discretion to sentence a wobbler as a misdemeanor, and in the other circumstances specified section 17(b), <em>\u2018it is a misdemeanor for all purposes: </em>(Italics added.) . . . [I]n construing this language from section 17(b), the California Supreme Court has stated that the reduction of the offense to a misdemeanor does not apply retroactively\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Moreover, our interpretation of section 1170.18 is consistent with the goal of promoting harmony among different, but related, statutory schemes if reasonably possible. (See <em>State Dept. of Public Health v. Superior Court </em>(2015) 60 Cal.4th 940, 955-956 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 60, 342 P.3d 1217].) As mentioned above, both Proposition 47 and Proposition 69 were intended to promote public safety. And while Proposition 47 does indeed serve the goal of reducing penalties for certain nonserious and nonviolent offenders, the electorate, when passing Proposition 69, specifically acknowledged the link between nonviolent convicted criminals and violent crime. To wit, as set forth in Proposition 69\u2019s statement of purpose: \u201c(d) Expanding the statewide DNA Database and Data Bank Program is: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (2) The most reasonable and certain means to solve crimes as effectively as other states which have found that the majority of violent criminals have nonviolent criminal prior convictions, and the majority of cold hits and criminal investigation links are missed if a DNA database or data bank is limited only to violent crimes.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 2004) text of Prop. 69, p. 135.) By interpreting section 1170.18 as redesignating minor\u2019s felony offense as a misdemeanor for all purposes going forward from the date of the court\u2019s redesignation order (and, thus, not for the purpose of determining whether the offense qualifies for DNA submission under Prop. 69), we reconcile any potential tension or inconsistency between section 1170.18, on the one hand, and sections 296 and 299, on the other, while still advancing the measures\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>common goals of promoting public safety, enhancing crime-solving capabilities, focusing prison spending on violent and serious offenses, and maximizing alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime. (See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 47, at p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">We hasten to add that, if there was any doubt about the proper interplay between Proposition 47 and the DNA Database Act, it was recently laid to rest by the legislative amendment adding section 1170.18 to the nonexhaustive list of statutes identified in section 299, which, by statutory mandate, bar a trial court from relieving an otherwise qualified person from his or her administrative duty to submit DNA samples. This amendment clarified what was arguably ambiguous in the former statute\u2014to wit, that the redesignation procedure under section 1170.18 does not give rise to a right to relief from the defendant\u2019s DNA submission obligations under section 299. As such, the legislative amendment confirms our interpretation of the statutory framework set forth above that expungement is not part of the relief available to criminal defendants under Proposition 47.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-6\">Minor attempts to draw a distinction between the \u201cadministrative duty to provide [DNA samples],\u201d referred to in the amended version of section 299, subdivision (1), and the requirement that the Department of Justice DNA Laboratory \u201cexpunge DNA . . . samples\u201d under certain circumstances, referred to in section 299, subdivision (e), but not in section 299, subdivision (1). However, the same argument was discussed and rejected by our colleagues in <em>In re J.C.: </em>\u201cThe minor argues section 299(f) could not have been intended to affect a court\u2019s duty to order expungement under section 299, subdivision (b) because section <em>299(f) </em>speaks of \u2018relieving]\u2019 a defendant of the \u2018duty to provide\u2019 a DNA sample, language that, as the minor argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>\u2018applies to a situation where a person has yet to submit a sample.\u2019 As explained above, while we might agree in the absence of the statutory references to sections 17, 1203.4, and 1203.4a, the inclusion of those statutes makes sense only if section 299(f) is interpreted as precluding expungement when an originally qualifying offense is reduced to a nonqualifying offense in the course of judicial proceedings. We acknowledge the use of the phrase \u2018relieve ... of the separate administrative duty to provide\u2019 is not an intuitive way to refer to expungement, but the language has been so understood at least since the issuance of <em>Coffey, </em>over 10 years ago.\u201d <em>(In re J.C., supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 1475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">We again agree with our colleagues\u2019 reasoning and adopt it for purposes of this case. Under a reasonable reading of section 299, considered in its entirety and as a whole, if a judge is not authorized to relieve a defendant of his or her administrative duty to submit DNA, the judge is not authorized to order the expungement of his or her DNA. (See also <em>Taxpayers to Limit Campaign Spending v. Fair Pol Practices Com., supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 764 [principles of statutory interpretation require courts to \u201creconcile or harmonize conflicting statutory provisions in an effort to give effect to all provisions if it is possible\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">Finally, we turn to minor\u2019s argument that Assembly Bill No. 1492, enacted after entry of the challenged order, cannot apply retroactively to his case because it impermissibly amends section 299. (See <em>Proposition 103 Enforcement Project v. Quackenbush </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1473, 1487 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 342] [\u201cthe Legislature cannot indirectly accomplish . . . what it cannot accomplish directly by enacting a statute which amends the initiative\u2019s statutory provisions\u201d].) According to minor, this bill \u201ceffectively amend[ed] Proposition 47 by creating a new exception to the treatment of reclassified crimes as misdemeanors.\u201d Or, \u201c[s]aid another way, it authorizes the retention of DNA samples from reclassified offenders\u2014something Proposition 47 prohibits by mandating that reclassified offenses be treated as misdemeanors for all purposes except firearm restrictions.\u201d We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">As our discussion from above makes clear, Assembly Bill No. 1492 did not amend section 1170.18. Rather, the bill clarified section 299 by adding section 1170.18 to the otherwise nonexhaustive list of statutes in section 299, subdivision (f) barring lower courts from excusing qualifying defendants from their administrative duty to submit DNA. Even assuming the former version of the statute was susceptible to minor\u2019s proposed interpretation (to wit, an interpretation omitting \u00a7 1170.18 from the list of statutes delineated therein), the fact that two equally reasonable interpretations exist merely confirms the statute\u2019s ambiguity and, thus, the impetus for its legislative amendment. (See <em>In re J.C., supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479 [acknowledging two distinct, yet equally plausible, readings of the relevant statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>governing DNA record expungement, to wit, one treating a redesignated conviction under \u00a7 1170.18 as a misdemeanor from the date of conviction, per <em>Alejandro, </em>and the other treating it as such from the date of sentence recall, per <em>Coffey </em>and \u00a7 17].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the current version of section 299, subdivision (f), may be properly applied to this appeal regardless of the fact that the juvenile court order under challenge predated its amendment. (E.g., <em>Carter v. California Dept. of Veterans Affairs </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 914, 922 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 223, 135 P.3d 637] [\u201cA statute that merely clarifies, rather than changes, existing law is properly applied to transactions predating its enactment.\u201d]; <em>Negrette v.

The court explained that section 1170.18, subdivision (k) \u201creflects the voters [intent that] the redesignated misdemeanor offense should be treated exactly like any other misdemeanor offense, except for firearm restrictions. Because the statute explicitly addresses what, if any, exceptions should be afforded to the otherwise all-encompassing misdemeanor treatment of the offense, and because only the firearm restriction was included as an exception, the enactors effectively directed the courts not to carve out other exceptions to the misdemeanor treatment of the reclassified offense absent some reasoned statutory or constitutional basis for doing so. [\u00b6] At the time they enacted section 1170.18, the voters were presumed to have known of the existing statute authorizing DNA collection for felony, but not misdemeanor, offenders [citation], and yet they did not include DNA collection as an exception to the misdemeanor treatment of the offense. Thus, absent an intervening enactment providing otherwise, future offenders who commit a Proposition 47 reclassified misdemeanor offense will not be subject to DNA collection based solely on that offense.\u201d <em>(Alejandro, supra, </em>at pp. 1227-1228, fn. omitted.) \u201c[T]he voters did not intend that a reclassified misdemeanor offense be deemed a felony for purposes of retention of DNA samples.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1228.)

[Citations.] The grounds for expungement listed in section 299 concern circumstances where an alleged offender is charged with an offense that qualifies for DNA collection, and then the case is not pursued or is dismissed, or the alleged offender is found not guilty or innocent. [Citation.] In these circumstances, the charged offense retains its qualification for DNA collection, but expungement of the DNA is warranted because the particular defendant is not guilty of that offense. In contrast here, under Proposition 47 <em>the reclassified misdemeanor offense itself no longer qualifies as an offense permitting DNA collection. </em>This circumstance is outside the matters contemplated by the Penal Code DNA expungement statute.\u201d <em>(Alejandro, </em>at pp. 1228-1229, fn. omitted; see also <em>Coffey, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 817 [rejecting Attorney General\u2019s argument that \u00a7 299 is defendant\u2019s \u2018\u201csole remedy\u201d because it is the \u2018\u201conly statute[] addressing the destruction, expungement, and retention of DNA samples and profiles collected under the DNA [and Forensic Identification Database and Data Bank Act of 1998].\u201d].)

In <em>Coffey, </em>the defendant was convicted of a \u201cwobbler\u201d that was charged as a felony, but after the defendant completed a successful probationary period was sentenced as a misdemeanor under section 17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that his DNA should never have been collected because \u201c[a]t the time the DNA samples were collected from Coffey, he had pled guilty to the charge of felony assault, and had not yet completed the requirements for reduction of the charge to a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>(Coffey, </em>at p. 820.) The court also held that Coffey was not entitled to expungement because even though section 17, subdivision (b) made the offense a \u201cmisdemeanor for all purposes,\u201d his plea to the offense as a felony was determinative of the right to enter his DNA into the data bank and section 17 rendered his offense a misdemeanor for all purposes only <em>\u201cthereafter, </em>without any retroactive effect.\u201d <em>(Coffey, </em>at p. 823.) In reaching this conclusion the court relied on the fact that section 299, subdivision (f) explicitly prohibited the court from relieving a person of the obligation to provide a DNA sample if found guilty of a qualifying offense, \u201c \u2018[notwithstanding any other provision of law, <em>including [,s]ection </em>. . . <em>17: </em>\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Coffey, </em>at p. 821.) \u201c[B]ecause the Legislature has determined that a defendant whose sentence is reduced to a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b), <em>must </em>provide DNA samples (\u00a7 296), it cannot be that a defendant is insulated from providing DNA samples merely because his sentence is reduced to a misdemeanor under section 17, subdivision (b).\u201d <em>(Coffey, </em>at p. 823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\"><em>Alejandro </em>correctly distinguished the circumstances in <em>Coffey, </em>where the defendant had pled guilty to the offense as a felony but at sentencing the offense was deemed a misdemeanor under section 17, from the situation in which a defendant\u2019s offense has been reclassified as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18. Reclassification of a conviction under section 1170.18 is not analogous to reduction of charges under section 17. Wobbler offenses may be sentenced and classified as misdemeanors because the court determines in its discretion that the particular circumstances of a case justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>treating the offense as less serious than a felony. Relevant factors in the exercise of that discretion are \u201c \u2018the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s appreciation of and attitude toward the offense, or his traits of character as evidenced by his behavior and demeanor at the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Alvarez) (1997) 14 Cal.4th 968, 978 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171].) While the trial court sentencing a wobbler as a misdemeanor determined that \u201c \u2018the rehabilitation of the convicted defendant either does not require, or would be adversely affected by, incarceration in a state prison as a felon\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Park </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 782, 790 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 307, 299 R3d 1263]), it remains true that the person was found or pleaded guilty to the offense as a felony. In contrast, when the voters reclassified certain offenses as misdemeanors under Proposition 47, they changed the nature of those offenses in all cases from felonies (or wobblers) to misdemeanors. As explained in <em>Alejandro, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.4th at page 1230, \u201cdistinct from wobbler offenses\u2014the offenses now classified as misdemeanors for qualifying offenders under Proposition 47 have permanently been removed from the felony category and are no longer subject to DNA collection.\u201d Moreover, as the court in <em>Alejandro </em>pointed out\u2014correctly at the time\u2014\u201c[u]nlike the circumstances in <em>Coffey, </em>there is no statutory provision reflecting a Legislative or voter determination that a DNA sample should be retained for an offender whose offense has been designated a misdemeanor under Proposition 47.\u201d <em>(Alejandro, </em>at pp. 1229-1230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">The Attorney General argues that whatever the situation when <em>Alejandro </em>was decided, the law has been changed by an amendment to section 299, subdivision (f) that was enacted subsequent to that decision. The majority here adopts this argument. In the course of enacting alternative amendments to sections 298 and 299, one of which will become effective depending on how the Supreme Court rules on an appeal challenging the constitutionality of requiring a DNA sample from an individual on the basis of the person\u2019s arrest, the Legislature inserted reference to section 1170.18 into section 299, subdivision (1). (Stats. 2015, ch. 487, \u00a7 4.) Thus, the provision quoted in footnote 6 above now begins, \u201cNotwithstanding any other law, including Sections 17, <em>1170.18, </em>1203.4, and 1203.4a . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 299, subd. (1), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">It is doubtful that this amendment bears upon the right to an expungement. Section 299, subdivision (1) precludes the court from \u201crelieving] a person of the separate administrative duty to provide\u201d a specimen if found to have committed a qualifying offense. (Italics added.) Unlike all other subdivisions of section 299, which address the right to have one\u2019s \u201cDNA specimen and sample destroyed and searchable database profile expunged from the databank program\u201d (\u00a7 299, subd. (a); see <em>id., </em>subds. (b), (c)(1), (2), (d), (e)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>subdivision (f) refers to \u2018\u201cproviding]\u201d a sample and says nothing about expungement (\u00a7 299, subd. (f)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Even accepting the Attorney General\u2019s questionable premise that the amendment to section 299, subdivision (f) was intended to preclude expungement based on the reclassification of a felony as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18, I disagree with the Attorney General and my colleagues that the amendment would be valid. Although section 1170.18, subdivision (k)\u2014 part of Proposition 47\u2014provides that offenses reclassified as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18 shall be treated as a misdemeanor for all purposes, the amendment to section 299, so construed, would treat a reclassified offense as a felony precluding expungement rather than as a misdemeanor entitling the defendant to expungement. Article II, section 10, subdivision (c) of the California Constitution requires that \u201c \u2018[w]hen a statute enacted by the initiative process is involved, the Legislature may amend it only if the voters specifically gave the Legislature that power, and then only upon whatever conditions the voters attached to the Legislature\u2019s amendatory powers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Armogeda </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 428, 434 [182 Cal.Rptr.3d 606].) Section 15 of Proposition 47 provides that \u2018\u201c[t]he provisions of this measure may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the members of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor so long as the amendments are consistent with and further the intent of this act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 15, p. 74.) An amendment is \u201d \u2018a legislative act designed to change an existing initiative statute by adding or taking from it some particular provision.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Pearson) (2010) 48 Cal.4th 564, 571 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 265, 227 P.3d 858].) If the amendment to section 299 is construed to treat a reclassified offense as a felony rather than as a misdemeanor for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>of determining the right to expungement, the amendment would be inconsistent with the intent of Proposition 47, and therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">In <em>J.C. </em>the court found no inconsistency between this understanding of the amendment and the initiative, reasoning that Proposition 47 \u201cdoes not clearly either require or prohibit expungement [of] the records of previously provided DNA samples.\u201d <em>(J.C., supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 1483.) However, section 1170.18, subdivision (k) provides that the redesignated offense shall be treated as a misdemeanor \u201cfor all purposes\u201d and one such purpose clearly is determining whether the offender is entitled to have his or her DNA sample expunged from the data bank. The initiative explicitly excepted from \u201call purposes\u201d the application of firearm restrictions but contains no such exception for application of the DNA sampling provisions. For those purposes, therefore, Proposition 47 requires the offense to be treated as a misdemeanor, requiring expungement. If the amendment to section 299, subdivision (f) is construed to prohibit expungement, the section would prohibit what Proposition 47 authorizes. So construed, the amendment therefore would be invalid. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Pearson), supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">This conclusion is not at odds with the interpretation of section 17, as construed in <em>Coffey, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th 809. As the court pointed out in <em>Alejandro, </em>when a defendant is sentenced for an offense pled as a felony but sentenced as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 17, it remains true that the defendant was found or pleaded guilty to a felony offense. In contrast, \u201coffenses now classified as misdemeanors for qualifying offenders under Proposition 47 have permanently been removed from the felony category.\u201d <em>(Alejandro, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.4th at p. 1230.) Moreover, although <em>Coffey </em>did involve a request for expungement, the court\u2019s analysis focused on the petitioner\u2019s contentions that <em>taking </em>the DNA sample violated the petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and that a \u201cconviction\u201d under a wobbler did not occur until sentencing. As the Court of Appeal opinion states, Coffey \u201cessentially argued that the collection of the DNA samples violated his Fourth Amendment rights because it was not authorized by the DNA Database Act. Although Coffey asserted that the proper remedy was expungement under section 299 . . . , in context he was merely attempting to justify a particular remedy by analogy, not undertaking to meet the prerequisites of section 299 or rely on its statutory authority.\u201d <em>(Coffey, supra, </em>at p. 816.) In rejecting Coffey\u2019s arguments, the Court of Appeal held that the \u201cfor all purposes\u201d language in section 17 did not mean that the prior order under section 296 requiring the petitioner to <em>provide </em>a DNA specimen, correct when entered, should retroactively be determined to have been erroneous. This conclusion was consistent with prior Supreme Court decisions that section 17 applies only prospectively. (E.g., <em>People v. Feyrer </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 426, 439 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 226 P.3d 998] [\u201cIf ultimately a misdemeanor sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>imposed [pursuant to section 17, subdivision (b)], the offense is a misdemeanor from that point on, but not retroactively.\u201d], superseded by statute on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th 782, 789, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">The opinion in <em>Coffey </em>did not suggest that a wobbler sentenced as a misdemeanor, though formerly a felony, should not be treated as a misdemeanor when relevant to a future application before the court. The petition before the court in <em>Coffey </em>challenged retroactively the validity of the order that required Coffey to provide his DNA sample. The court did not focus on whether the reduced classification of the offense should apply to a future application not based on a challenge to the validity of the prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">Unlike the application before the court in <em>Coffey, </em>minor\u2019s request for expungement is not based on a challenge to the validity of the order that required him to provide his DNA sample. He does not seek to retroactively invalidate an order he acknowledges was correctly entered. Rather, he contends that although he was correctly ordered to provide the sample, now that his offense has been reclassified as a misdemeanor pursuant to section 1170.18 he no longer has been convicted of a qualifying offense and therefore he is entitled to have his specimen removed from the database. He does not seek retroactive application of section 1170.18 but prospective application to his request for expungement. The distinction parallels the distinction that has been made in interpreting section 17. The \u2018\u201cfor all purposes\u201d phrase in section 17 does not mean that an enhancement in another case based upon the defendant having previously been convicted of a wobbler charged as a felony should be set aside when the wobbler offense is later sentenced under section 17 as a misdemeanor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 802 [\u201cThere is no dispute that, under the rule in [cases holding a wobbler to be a felony for all purposes unless reduced pursuant to section 17], defendant would be subject to the section 667(a) enhancement had he committed and been convicted of the present crimes before the court reduced the earlier offense to a misdemeanor.\u201d].) However, the \u201cfor all purposes\u201d requirement does mean that the offense cannot be used prospectively to impose a new enhancement based on the offense having previously been designated as a felony. <em>(Park, </em>at p. 804 [The \u201creduction of a wobbler to a misdemeanor under section 17(b) generally precludes its use as a prior felony conviction in a subsequent prosecution.\u201d]. ) That is the same distinction that has been recognized in recent cases applying section 1170.18, rejecting applications to set aside enhancements previously imposed based on an offense that was formerly but is no longer classified as a felony,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but holding that prospectively offenses reclassified under section 1170.18 cannot be treated as a felony to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>new enhancements. <em>(People v. Abdallah </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 736, 747 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 198] [\u201cProposition 47 precludes the court from using [a conviction reclassified under its terms as a misdemeanor] as a felony merely because it was a felony at the time the defendant committed the offense.\u201d].) Similarly, in the present case minor seeks only prospective application of section 1170.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">Section 299, subdivision (a) provides that a person has the right to have his or her DNA specimen expunged from the data bank pursuant to the procedures specified in subdivision (b) \u201cif the person has no past or present offense or pending charge which qualifies that person for inclusion within\u201d the data bank. The reclassification of minor\u2019s offense thus brings him or her within the scope of section 299, subdivision (a), even though the circumstances creating the right to expungement are not within those specified in section 299, subdivision (b). Both <em>Alejandro </em>and <em>Coffey </em>recognize that section 299 does not provide exclusive authority for removing a specimen from the data bank that does not belong there. <em>(Alejandro, supra, </em>238 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1228-1229; <em>Coffey, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 817.) When section 299 was originally enacted, the alternatives specified in subdivision (b) were virtually the only possible scenarios by which a person\u2019s DNA sample could have been included in the data bank even though the person was not convicted of a qualifying offense. By changing what formerly was a qualifying offense into a nonqualifying offense, Proposition 47 has created a new situation in which this is now possible. There is no good reason why a person whose offense, by virtue of Proposition 47, has been determined to be a nonqualifying offense, should not be entitled to expungement in the same manner as those within the categories specified in subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">The fundamental public policy that is relevant with respect to application of the DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Data Bank Act of 1998, as amended (\u00a7 295 et seq.) is that the data bank should include DNA samples from persons committing felonies and certain specified misdemeanors and not from persons who have not committed any such offense. The situation would of course be different if section 296 required the inclusion of DNA from persons convicted of any misdemeanor, but that is not the law. That is why the interest in crime solving, the reason for the DNA data bank, provides no support for retaining the DNA of a person whose offense has been reduced to a misdemeanor under Proposition 47. Given the dichotomy drawn by the data bank statute between felonies and (most) misdemeanors, the implementation of the policy choice made by the Legislature dictates removal from the data bank of a DNA sample from a person who has committed what has now been classified as a (nonsex or arson) misdemeanor. The data bank statute reflects the policy determination that persons convicted of less serious offenses\u2014 most misdemeanors\u2014need not have their DNA sample included in the data bank, and Proposition 47 has established that certain offenses previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>classified as felonies are less serious and are now misdemeanors for all purposes. No reason has been suggested why in light of these policies, DNA from persons convicted of a nonqualifying misdemeanor in the future should be excluded from the data bank, but DNA from persons previously convicted of the same offense should be retained in the data bank. Whatever ambiguity there may be in the meaning of sechon 299, subdivision (f), or uncertainty concerning the validity of the amendment to that provision, should be resolved in favor of upholding the policy decisions reflected in the data bank statute and in Proposition 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">I therefore conclude that insofar as the denial of minor\u2019s request to expunge his DNA sample from the state data bank was based on the ground that the offense redesignated as a misdemeanor was previously a felony, the trial court erred in denying the request. Absent some other statutory basis for retention, minor\u2019s DNA sample should be expunged from the state data bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Appellant\u2019s petihon for review by the Supreme Court was granted November 9, 2016, S237801.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1129-12\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1130-7\"><em> </em>Proposition 47, an initiative measure, was adopted at the November 4, 2014 General Election.
