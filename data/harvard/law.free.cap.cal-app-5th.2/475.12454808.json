(Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Abarca pled guilty to one felony count of second degree burglary (\u00a7 459)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on his attempt to pass a forged check for $300 at a bank. After the electorate passed Proposition 47, Abarca sought to have his felony conviction redesignated as the newly created misdemeanor of shoplifting\u2014entering an open commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny of $950 or less. (\u00a7 459.5, subd. (a).) Abarca\u2019s petition says \u201cthe value of the check . . . does not exceed $950.00.\u201d The People responded by contending Abarca\u2019s offense does not constitute shoplifting because banks are not commercial establishments. The superior court concluded banks are commercial establishments, granted Abarca\u2019s petition, and resentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">The People advance three grounds for reversing the superior court order granting the petition. First, the People contend the superior court erred in reaching the merits because Abarca did not carry his initial burden by attaching evidence to his petition. Second, the People contend the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>court erred in determining a bank is a commercial establishment. Third, they contend the superior court erred because Abarca\u2019s underlying conduct could have been punished as felony burglary even after Proposition 47, because Abarca\u2019s act of passing a forged check constituted identity theft. We disagree with each asserted error and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">According to a declaration supporting an arrest warrant for Abarca, on July 10, 2013, \u201cWillie Abarca walked into the U.S. Bank [at 12612 Limonite Avenue] and attempted to cash a check (#557) from Newport Coach Works Inc. in the amount of $300.00.\u201d Abarca left the bank without obtaining cash while a bank employee was checking the signature against bank records. The investigahng deputy sheriff \u201ccontacted the account owner[,] Carter Read,\u201d who reported \u201che does not know Abarca, never gave Abarca a check . . . and did not give permission for any of his employees to give Abarca a check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The Riverside County District Attorney charged Abarca with one felony count of burglary (\u00a7 459; count 1) and one felony count of forgery (\u00a7 475, subd. (c); count 2). The information also alleged Abarca had five prison priors within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In the burglary count, the prosecution accused Abarca of committing \u201ca violation of Penal Code section 459, a felony, in that on or about July 10, 2013, in the County of Riverside, State of California, he did wilfully and unlawfully enter a certain building located at 12612 LIMONITE AVE, EASTVALE, CA, with intent to commit theft and a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">In the forgery count, the prosecution accused Abarca of committing \u201ca violation of Penal Code section 475, subdivision (c), a felony, in that on or about July 10, 2013, in the County of Riverside, State of California, he did wilfully and unlawfully possess a completed check, money order, traveler\u2019s check, warrant, and county order, with the intent to utter and pass and facilitate the utterance and passage of the same, in order to defraud READ C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">On November 18, 2013, Abarca pled guilty to the commercial burglary count and admitted two prison priors. At the plea hearing, the superior court asked Abarca, \u201c[I]s it true on July 10th, 2013 in Riverside County, you went into a building with the intent to commit a felony?\u201d Abarca replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The superior court found \u201ca factual basis for the plea and . . . accepted] the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>On December 9, 2013, in accordance with the plea agreement, the superior court dismissed the forgery count and struck the remaining three prison prior allegations. The superior court sentenced Abarca to an upper term of three years in county jail on the burglary count and consecutive one-year enhancements for each of the two prison priors. The court suspended execution of the final two years of the sentence and ordered two years of mandatory supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">On November 4, 2014, the voters of California passed Proposition 47, reducing some felony theft- and forgery-related offenses to misdemeanors when the value of the stolen property does not exceed $950. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 459.5, subd. (a) [redefining some theft as shoplifting], 490.2, subd. (a) [redefining some grand theft as petty theft], 473, subd. (b) [changing punishment for some forgery and counterfeiting offenses].) The initiative also created a resentencing procedure allowing offenders to petition for resentencing if they are \u201ccurrently serving a sentence for a conviction\u201d for committing a felony and \u201cwould have been guilty of a misdemeanor under\u201d the provisions added by Proposition 47. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On December 10, 2014, Abarca submitted a petition asking the superior court to recall his commercial burglary conviction and resentence him under section 1170.18, subdivision (a). The petition declares \u201cthe value of the check or property does not exceed $950.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">On March 11, 2015, the prosecution submitted a response stating \u201c[d]efendant is <em>not entitled </em>to the relief requested\u201d because a \u201c[b]ank is not a commercial establishment.\u201d The prosecution did not contest the value of the forged check or contend Abarca was ineligible for resentencing for any other reason. Nor did the prosecution check boxes provided to request a hearing to determine whether defendant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the public safety or for any other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On April 23, 2015, the superior court entered an order granting Abarca\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order indicates the superior court did not hold a hearing on his petition. The order overruled the prosecution\u2019s \u201cobjection that [a] bank is not [a] commercial establishment.\u201d The superior court ordered count one \u201cdeemed a misdemeanor . . . amend[ed] count 001 to a violation of 459.5 PC,\u201d and sentenced Abarca to county jail \u201cfor the term of 364 days.\u201d Because Abarca had already served 364 days, the superior court ordered him released. The superior court also gave both parties \u201c10 days to file briefs preserving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>appellate issues.\u201d The appellate record indicates neither party filed a brief raising additional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">On May 27, 2015, the People filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">A. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Burden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The People contend the superior court erred in granting the petition because Abarca did not \u2018\u201cpresent any evidence whatsoever regarding the underlying facts of his section 459 conviction.\u201d In effect, the People contend the superior court was not permitted to reach the merits of Abarca\u2019s petition without first finding the petitioner had made a prima facie case of entitlement to resentencing. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In the first place, the People fail to set forth what constitutes a prima facie case or how Abarca\u2019s petition was defective. \u2018\u201cAn appellate court is not required to examine undeveloped claims, nor to make arguments for parties.\u201d <em>(Paterno </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 68, 106 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 754].) We decline to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Even assuming the People\u2019s argument is that Abarca failed to show he passed a forged check for an amount that did not exceed $950, we refuse to reverse on that basis. Abarca filed a signed petition declaring, under penalty of perjury, that \u2018\u201cthe value of the check\u201d he was convicted of passing \u201cdoes not exceed $950.\u201d The People did not contest the assertion in their responsive pleading in the superior court. Nor did they in any way address the sufficiency of the petition. Even when the superior court granted the petition and gave the People \u201c10 days to file briefs preserving appellate issues,\u201d they chose not to object to the sufficiency of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Moreover, in this court, the People admit Abarca\u2019s offense involved passing a bad $300 check, and also admit \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s order granting the petition was based on a review of the court\u2019s record,\u201d which contained the arrest warrant showing the value of the bad check. Under these circumstances, we cannot find the superior court abused its discretion by reaching the merits of Abarca\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>B. <em>Commercial Establishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The People contend the superior court erred by determining Abarca was entitled to resentencing on his conviction for burglarizing U.S. Bank as shoplifting (\u00a7 459.5) on the ground that a bank is not a commercial establishment. Again, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Proposition 47 added section 459.5 to the Penal Code. The new section provides: \u201cNotwithstanding Section 459 [burglary], shoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950). Any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary.\u201d We review de novo the superior court\u2019s interpretation of this provision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Neither Proposition 47 nor the Penal Code defines <em>commercial establishment. </em>We therefore understand it to have the meaning it bears in ordinary usage. (See <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. County of Riverside </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 84, 91 [255 Cal.Rptr. 670, 767 P.2d 1148].) If the language is unambiguous on its face, we interpret it accordingly. If the language is ambiguous, we may consult ballot summaries and other extrinsic materials to aid us in determining the voters\u2019 intent. <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Pearson) (2010) 48 Cal.4th 564, 571 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 265, 227 P.3d 858].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u201cWhen attempting to ascertain the ordinary, usual meaning of a word, courts appropriately refer to the dictionary definition of that word.\u201d <em>(Wasatch Property Management v. Degrate </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1111, 1121-1122 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 262, 112 P.3d 647].) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cestablishment\u201d as \u201c[a]n institution or place of business.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 566, col. 2.) It defines \u201ccommerce\u201d to mean: \u201cThe exchange of goods <em>and services.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 263, col. 1, italics added.) Other sources are in accord. (Merriam-Webster Diet. Online (2016) &lt;Merriam-Webster.com&gt; [as of Aug. 18, 2013] [defining \u201ccommerce\u201d as \u201cactivities that relate to the buying and selling of goods and services\u201d]; Business Diet. Online (2016) &lt;BusinessDictionary.com&gt; [as of Aug. 12, 2016] [defining \u201ccommerce\u201d as the \u201c[e]xchange of goods or services for money or in kind\u201d].) Thus, we interpret the term \u201ccommercial establishment\u201d as it appears in section 459.5, subdivision (a) to mean a place of business established for the purpose of exchanging goods or services. (Accord, <em>In re J.L. </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1114 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Banks satisfy this definition. Bank customers use banks to deposit and withdraw funds in exchange for fees. In the context of approving banks\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ability to collect fees from nondepositors who use their automatic teller machines, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit noted \u2018\u201c[t]he depositing of funds and the withdrawal of cash are services provided by banks since the days of their creation. Indeed, such activities define the business of banking.\u201d <em>(Bank of America v. City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 309 F.3d 551, 563.) Thus, a business like \u00dc.S. Bank provides financial services in exchange for fees, and is therefore a commercial establishment within the ordinary meaning of that term. We conclude, therefore, that the superior court did not err in holding Abarca\u2019s offense qualified as shoplifting under section 459.5, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The People argue we should take a narrower view of the ordinary meaning of \u2018\u201ccommercial establishment\u201d as meaning a place of business established for the purpose of exchanging goods or merchandise. Some definitions of \u2018\u201ccommerce\u201d and \u2018\u201ccommercial\u201d are in accord with this argument. (E.g., American Heritage Diet. (New College ed. 1976) p. 267 [defining commerce as \u2018\u201cthe buying and selling of goods\u201d (italics added)].) Under that definition, banks would not be commercial establishments because they offer services, not goods or merchandise. At best, this alternative definition creates an ambiguity in the statute. However, as the initiative directs, we construe the act \u2018\u201cbroadly ... to accomplish its purposes.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 15, p. 74, online at &lt;http://vig.cdn. sos.ca.gov/2014/general/en/pdf/complete-vigrl.pdf&gt;; see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 18 at p. 74 [act shall be \u2018\u201cliberally construed to effectuate its purposes\u201d].) The stated purposes of the electorate include \u2018\u201c[r]equir[ing] misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious, nonviolent crimes like petty theft and drug possession.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>subds. (3) &amp; (4), \u00a7 3, at p. 70.) Adopting the limited definition of \u2018\u201ccommercial establishment\u201d will frustrate those purposes and result in the continued incarceration of persons who committed petty theft crimes.  Accordingly, we construe section 459.5, subdivision (a) to include as shoplifting thefts from commercial ventures, such as banks, which sell services.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">C. <em>Identity Theft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The People contend the superior court erred in granting Abarca\u2019s petition for resentencing because identity theft, not larceny or forgery, was the predicate act for the burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">To begin with, the People have forfeited this claim of error. The prosecution did not raise identity theft in relation to the original conviction. Instead, it charged Abarca with entering the bank with the intent to commit \u2018\u201ctheft and a felony\u201d (the burglary count) and forgery. Neither the prosecution nor the superior court mentioned identity theft at the plea hearing. The superior court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>asked only if Abarca \u201cwent into a building with the intent to commit a felony.\u201d Nor did the prosecution raise identity theft in any way during resentencing proceedings. It did not claim identity theft was the predicate for Abarca\u2019s burglary conviction. Nor did it contend Abarca was ineligible for resentencing for that reason. The People\u2019s only objection to resentencing Abarca was their contention that a bank does not qualify as a commercial establishment. In addition, in its order granting the petition, the superior court allowed both parties 10 days to brief any additional issues they wished to preserve for appeal. The People did not take advantage of the opportunity to raise identity theft even then, and therefore forfeited the issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 920, 937 [94 Cal.Rptr.3d 756].)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Even if the claim had not been forfeited, we would find no error on the merits. Abarca was entitled to resentencing if his conviction for burglary was predicated on his intent to commit theft or forgery, both of which are eligible offenses under Proposition 47. (\u00a7\u00a7 490.2, subd. (a) [\u201cobtaining any property by theft where the value of the money . . . does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950) shall be considered petty theft and shall be punished as a misdemeanor\u201d], 473, subd. (b) [\u201cany person who is guilty of forgery relating to a check . . . where the value of the check . . . does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), shall be punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year\u201d].) The superior court\u2019s determination that Abarca was entitled to resentencing was based on the implicit finding that his conviction <em>was </em>predicated on his intent to commit theft or forgery. On review, we indulge in every presumption to uphold the judgment and look to the appellant to show error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 524, 549 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 876].) The People have not shown error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">As we have discussed, identity theft played no role in the prosecution of Abarca. The People charged him with burglary and forgery. The prosecution entered a plea bargain with Abarca whereby he pled guilty to burglary, and the People agreed to dismiss the forgery count. At the plea hearing, the superior court asked Abarca whether he had entered a building with the intent to commit a felony. The same court decided Abarca\u2019s petition for resentenc-ing and presumably had access to all the records we have on appeal. Based on this history and these records, we conclude the superior court did not abuse its discretion in finding theft or forgery to be the predicate of the burglary charge, and therefore did not err in granting Abarca\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Proposition 47 provides a petitioning procedure allowing offenders to seek resentencing on existing felony <em>convictions </em>by showing Proposition 47 reclassified the crime of conviction as a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) If a petitioner qualifies, the remedy in subdivision (b) is for \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s felony sentence [to] be recalled and the petitioner resentenced to a misdemeanor.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (b).) The statutory language is entirely focused on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>resentencing offenders for existing, but reclassified, <em>convictions. </em>It does not require a petitioner to examine the Penal Code for other offenses his conduct would have supported and prove he would not have been convicted of those in addition. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) Nor does it suggest the superior court must examine the Penal Code to assure itself before granting a petition that an offender could not have been convicted of a different felony for the same underlying conduct. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (b).) Accordingly, we decline to reverse the superior court\u2019s order granting the petition on the basis that the People could have prosecuted Abarca for felony burglary predicated on identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We affirm the order granting Abarca\u2019s petition for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-7\">McKinster, Acting P.
