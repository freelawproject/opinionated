Humberto Miranda, Felix Vega, and Isaac Rangel appeal from the judgment entered after a jury trial. All were convicted of assault with a deadly weapon (count 1; Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1));<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (count 2; \u00a7 245, former subd. (a)(1), now subd. (a)(4)); and battery with serious bodily injury (count 3; \u00a7 243, subd. (d)). Codefendant Chris DeLeon was acquitted. As to each appellant, the jury found true great bodily injury allegations (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)) and gang enhancements (\u00a7 186.22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>subd. (b)(1)(A) &amp; (Q). As to Miranda, the jury found true an allegation that, in the commission of battery with serious bodily injury, he had personally used a \u201cknife and razor.\u201d (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1).) Vega and Rangel admitted prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Miranda was sentenced to prison for 17 years, to be served first before serving life sentences in another case. (See \u00a7 669.) Vega was sentenced to prison for 11 years four months, to be served consecutively to a prior sentence in another case of 37 years four months. The aggregate term for both cases was 48 years eight months. Rangel was sentenced to prison for seven years four months, to be served consecutively to a prior sentence in another case of 25 years. The aggregate term for both cases was 32 years four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to support the gang enhancements. In addition, they argue that the trial court erroneously (1) denied their <em>Wheeler-Batson </em>motions, (2) instructed the jury during jury selection, and (3) excluded evidence of the guilty pleas of three codefendants. Vega claims that the trial court erroneously limited his closing argument to the jury. Finally, Vega and Rangel contend that the trial court erroneously sentenced them and failed to calculate the custody credits to which they are entitled. Only the final contention has merit. Miranda makes no claim of sentencing error, but his sentence is also erroneous. We vacate appellants\u2019 convictions on count 2 and reverse their sentences on counts 1 and 3. We remand the matter with directions to resentence them and calculate Vega\u2019s and Rangel\u2019s custody credits. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Appellants and DeLeon were members of different Southern California local criminal street gangs. Estuardo Tobias, the victim, claimed that he was not a gang member. In June 2008 Tobias, appellants, and DeLeon were inmates in \u201cDorm 816\u201d at the North County Correctional Facility (NCCF) of the Los Angeles County jail. The dorm housed approximately 65 inmates, all of whom were Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">In the presence of Miranda, Rangel, and DeLeon, Vega ordered Tobias to cut another inmate with a knife. Tobias refused. Vega replied, \u201c \u2018All right. If you don\u2019t do it, you got that coming.\u2019 \u201d Later that same day, Vega told Tobias that someone wanted to speak to him upstairs. Tobias understood that he was going to see \u201cPuppet,\u201d \u201cthe gang member who was running the jail.\u201d According to Tobias, \u201cPuppet was the one who would give orders about who should get beat up and what should happen among the gang members . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>After Tobias walked upstairs, Vega started fighting with him and \u201ctried to take [him] down on the ground.\u201d Miranda, Rangel, DeLeon, and \u201cnot less than another five [persons]\u201d ran toward Tobias. The other persons included gang members Edgar Centeno, Skary Paredes, and Ivan Toscano.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Appellants cut Tobias with razor blades attached to toothbrushes. Tobias was punched and kicked. \u201cThere were blows, but there were so many of them [that Tobias] couldn\u2019t tell . . . who did what.\u201d Someone said, \u201c \u2018Cut him, but make sure that you\u2019re getting him on the neck.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe last thing [Tobias] remember[ed] was that someone said, \u2018Hide. They\u2019re coming.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived and stopped the fight. A deputy testified that he \u201csaw five people attacking one person.\u201d The deputy subsequently testified: \u201cThere could have been more.\u201d \u201c[I]t looked like there was approximately five or more.\u201d Another deputy testified that he \u201csaw approximately five inmates\u201d surrounding Tobias and \u201cpunching him repeatedly in a violent manner.\u201d \u201cIt could have been more, but I\u2019m pretty certain that it was at minimum five.\u201d Neither deputy saw the beginning of the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Tobias was \u201cdrenched in blood.\u201d Blood was \u201csquirting from his wrist onto the walls.\u201d He had \u201csix or seven different injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Appellants had blood on their clothing and bodies. The DNA profile of blood found on Vega and Rangel matched the DNA profile of Tobias\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">[[]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAuq\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"75\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdsAAABLAQAAAACgyWPsAAABGElEQVR4nO2aQU6EQBQFH8YFO72B3kRvhjuPpYkHkTmBs5NEoFwwjS3bkbw4ebWk8n+Kppc06N9yuHIXnEPiXSTeReJdJN5F4l0k3kXiXSTeReJdJN5F4l0k3kXiXSTeReJdJN5F4l0k3sUFxB8lDZJGSUjSk6RXSX0l5iKLKFPzdmrHdXMtBMAbcACOwPgA8x1wAzxXYugWuYoyVcQ6teO6ofsR/XLy9cuP25fvdc5Z/vG6X5/mAu78o6R7SbeSrk9PG2k5kSLak1xFmWq3Uzuua2ux3PkP4BP4AmaADngB3isxFVlEmZq2UzuumyrRN/lxwkTiXSTeReJdJN5F4l0k3kXiXSTeReJdJN5F4l0k3kXiXSTexTdsEbF/ERhU6gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"1499\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support the Gang Enhancements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Appellants contend that the evidence is insufficient to support the criminal street gang enhancements. The People were required to prove that the crimes for which appellants were convicted had been \u201ccommitted for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">\u201cIn considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support an enhancement, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] We presume every fact in support of the judgment the trier of fact could have reasonably deduced from the evidence. [Citation.] If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. [Citation.] \u2018A reviewing court neither reweighs evidence nor reevaluates a witness\u2019s credibility.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Albillar </em>(2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 59-60 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 244 P.3d 1062].) \u2018\u201cA reversal for insufficient evidence \u2018is unwarranted unless it appears \u2018\u201cthat upon no hypothesis whatever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support\u201d \u2019 the jury\u2019s verdict. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zamudio </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 357 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 289, 181 P.3d 105].)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">\n<em>Gang Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Deputy Francis Hardiman testified for the People as a gang expert. He had qualified \u2018\u201cabout 60 times\u201d in Los Angeles County Superior Court as an expert on the Mexican Mafia or the Southside criminal street gang. The following summary of the gang evidence is primarily based on his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Appellants and DeLeon were members of both Southside and different Southern California Hispanic local criminal street gangs. Other inmates who participated in the assault upon Tobias\u2014Edgar Centeno, Skary Paredes, and Ivan Toscano\u2014were also gang members. Centeno was a member of the Pasadena Latin Kings gang and Southside, Paredes was a member of Southside, and Toscano was a member of the North Side Longos\u2019 gang and Southside.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Dorm 816, where the inmates were housed, was \u2018\u201ca Southside dorm.\u201d An inmate was assigned there only if he had identified himself as a Southsider or jail officials had \u2018\u201cdesignated [him as a] possible Southsider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Southside was created by the Mexican Mafia in the early 1990s. The Mexican Mafia is a Hispanic prison gang. It and a rival Hispanic prison gang, Nuestra Familia, agreed to divide California into two territories. Hispanic gang members south of Delano are considered to be \u2018\u201cSouthsiders.\u201d Hispanic gang members north of Delano are considered to be \u2018\u201cNorte\u00f1os.\u201d Southsiders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>owe their allegiance to the Mexican Mafia, while Norte\u00f1os owe their allegiance to Nuestra Familia.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">If you are a Southern California Hispanic gang member, \u2018\u201c[w]hen you come in from the street into [Los Angeles County jail], your gang rivalries out on the street end, and you are a member of the Southside\u201d criminal street gang. When Tobias arrived at Dorm 816, Vega told him that, \u2018\u201csince they were working for the South, there was no fighting among them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">A Southern California Hispanic gang member who did not want to be a Southsider always had the option of informing jail authorities that he \u2018\u201ccan\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d The gang member would then \u201cbecome a protective custody inmate.\u201d Southsiders have an obligation to attack protective custody inmates if the opportunity arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">A Mexican Mafia member in the Los Angeles County jail \u201cis in control of all of the Southsiders within the . . . jail.\u201d He is at the top of \u201ca pyramid-like structure of leadership within the jail that controls the actions of the individual Southsiders.\u201d The Los Angeles County jail is divided into seven facilities, and a \u201cSouthsider shot caller ... is in charge\u201d of each facility. \u201cThe next step down from the facility shot caller [is] the floor shot caller.\u201d Each floor is divided into modules or dorms, and each module or dorm has a Southside shot caller. If a Southsider wants to use violence against an inmate, he generally must get permission \u201cfrom the various shot callers above [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Every week, each dorm shot caller collects \u201ctaxes\u201d from the Southsiders in his dorm. The taxes are forwarded to the Mexican Mafia. \u201cSo each dorm each week . . . generate [s] income\u201d for the Mexican Mafia.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">A set of rules called \u201cthe Southside rules\u201d applies to all Southsiders in jail. \u201cThe rules are designed to strictly control violence by the Southside [rs].\u201d \u201c[E]ach individual member of the Southside is expected to keep an eye on the other members and help enforce those rules.\u201d Hardiman gave several examples of the Southside rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Any Hispanic from Southern California, regardless of whether he is a gang member, who \u201ccomes into the jail. . . falls under the control of the Southside. And they have to follow the [Southside] rules.\u201d \u201cPaisa,\u201d \u201cResident,\u201d and \u201cChristian\u201d are \u201cdesignation[s] by the Southside of a person who is not a member of the Southside but has to follow the rules.\u201d When Tobias arrived at Dorm 816, Vega informed him of the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Vega testified that in June 2008, when the incident involving Tobias occurred, he was the \u201cbar man\u201d for Dorm 816. Deputy Hardiman defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u201cbar man\u201d as \u201ca person within the Southside who is designated to be a contact point in a dorm with the staff of the facility.\u201d The bar man also \u201ccommunicates with the hierarchy of the Southside.\u201d The bar man sometimes \u201cgive[s] out the orders about who gets beat up, who gets kicked</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Raymond Cuevas worked for Hardiman as an informant. His gang moniker was \u201cPuppet.\u201d When Vega told Tobias that someone wanted to speak to him upstairs, Tobias understood that he was going to see \u201cPuppet,\u201d \u201cwho would give orders about who should get beat up and what should happen among the gang members . . . .\u201d Hardiman testified that in about August 2009 Cuevas became \u201cthe shot caller for the entire facility . . . .\u201d Cuevas said that \u201cVega had status within the Southside and eventually became the shot caller for the entire facility . . . .\u201d Deputy Christian Lopez, who worked at NCCF and had frequent contact with Vega, testified that Vega had \u201cworked his way up from bar man\u201d to \u201cfacility shot caller, for a short period of time\u201d between October and December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Deputy Hardiman saw \u201croll call lists,\u201d which were generated by Southside and listed its members as well as inmates under its control. Vega\u2019s, Miranda\u2019s, and DeLeon\u2019s names were on the lists. Rangel \u201cappear[ed] on roll calls with [his] name, booking number, and moniker [\u201cEvil\u201d] and [local street] gang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The prosecutor asked Deputy Hardiman a hypothetical question incorporating the facts of the assault committed upon Tobias. Deputy Hardiman opined that the assault \u201cwas committed at the direction of, for the benefit [of], and in association with a criminal street gang, to wit, the Southside.\u201d Hardiman explained that the assault benefited Southside because \u201cit tells both other Southsiders, people that aren\u2019t Southsiders but fall under the control of the Southside, and the other groups within the jail\u2014like the black inmates, the white inmates . . .\u2014that the Southside is ... so strong and so committed that they\u2019re willing to attack their own because their own in this instance wouldn\u2019t follow their rules.\u201d This creates fear and intimidation among other inmates and \u201ccauses [Hispanic inmates] to follow the rules.\u201d The fear and intimidation deter \u201cother organizations from hying to influence or stick their nose into the interests of the Southside, such as extortion, money laundering, drug dealing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Vega testified that he was a member of a gang called Pacoima Project Boys, not a gang called Southside. \u201cSure\u00f1o\u201d or \u201cSouthside\u201d means \u201clike saying you\u2019re from Southern California.\u201d Vega claimed that Tobias had said he was a member of the Langdon Sheet gang in the San Fernando Valley.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>Rangel testified that he was a member of a gang called Compton Varrio Tres. He identified himself as a \u201cSure\u00f1o,\u201d which means a \u201cgang member from the south\u201d of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">DeLeon testified that, when he \u201cwas younger,\u201d he had been a member of a gang called La Mirada Locos. But DeLeon told Vega that he was a current member of the La Mirada gang. Vega heard other inmates address DeLeon by his gang moniker, \u201cCapone.\u201d DeLeon testified that \u201cSouthsiders\u201d means \u201cHispanic from down south.\u201d He was asked, \u201c[Is] everyone who is Hispanic who is a member of a gang south of Delano, a member of Southside?\u201d DeLeon replied, \u201cOnly when you\u2019re in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Miranda did not testify. Deputy Hardiman opined that Miranda had \u201ca leadership rol[e] within [the] San Fer\u201d criminal street gang in the San Fernando Valley. Miranda told Vega that he was from San Fer.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\n<em>Expert Gang Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Miranda and Rangel assert that the evidence is insufficient to support the gang enhancements because Deputy Hardiman\u2019s \u201cconclusions were spun out of whole cloth\u201d and \u201care not worthy of any assignment of value or credibility.\u201d They allege that his \u201cconclusions are based upon matters which are not reasonably relied upon by other experts, and upon factors which are speculative, remote or conjectural.\u201d (Boldface &amp; capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Miranda and Rangel impugn Deputy Hardiman\u2019s gang expertise. They claim that he \u201cconcluded South Side was a criminal street gang, upon his arrival at the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, without any prior gang experience or training.\u201d They also impugn his motives, accusing him of going over the head of his superior, Sergeant Meade, to \u201cOSJ leader[,] Gregory Thompson, soon to be indicted on corruption then occurring at the jail, to test the waters and in so doing, to advance up the ladder.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They attempt to tarnish Hardiman\u2019s character by linking him with Thompson: \u201cThis self[-]made expert climbed up the ladder after 7 months at OSJ with the blessings of its leader at a time when the FBI was investigating corruption at the jail which led to conviction of its OSJ leader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">For four reasons, we reject Miranda\u2019s and Rangel\u2019s allegations concerning Deputy Hardiman\u2019s testimony. First, they are not supported by meaningful analysis with record citations to evidence before the jury. <em>(In re S.C. </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 396, 408 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 453].) Second, by not objecting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Hardiman\u2019s qualifications as a gang expert, Miranda and Rangel forfeited this issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 321 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].) Third, Hardiman\u2019s credibility was a matter for the jury to decide, and it impliedly found him to be credible. \u201c \u2018 \u201cConflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. [Citation.]\u201d . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barnes </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 306 [228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Fourth, Hardiman\u2019s \u201cconclusions were [not] spun out of whole cloth.\u201d Nor were they based on speculation. Hardiman listened to a recorded \u201cface-to-face conversation\u201d between Miranda and two other inmates \u201cabout the conduct and operations of the Southside.\u201d Miranda had a \u201c \u2018thirst for blood\u2019 tattoo,\u201d which is \u201can earned tattoo within the Southside.\u201d Hardiman\u2019s opinion that Vega was a member of Southside was based on \u201chis actions, his conduct,\u201d his tattoos, \u201cadmissions that he made to Deputy Christian Lopez,\u201d and Hardiman\u2019s conversations with the informant Raymond Cuevas. Hardiman conversed with Cuevas \u201cat least 30 times.\u201d In addition to having been the Southside \u201cshot caller for the entire facility,\u201d Cuevas was also \u201ca crew chief for a member of the Mexican Mafia.\u201d Hardiman was familiar with the \u201cSouthside rules\u201d in force at NCCF. He saw \u201chundreds\u201d of Southside \u201croll call lists,\u201d some of which included appellants\u2019 and DeLeon\u2019s names. He spoke to \u201chundreds of Southsiders\u201d and to several members of the Mexican Mafia, plus more than 100 \u201cdropouts\u201d from the Mexican Mafia and Southside. He listened to \u201chundreds of hours of recorded conversations . . . between Southsiders talking to other Southsiders and . . . sometimes members of the Mexican Mafia about their criminal enterprise.\u201d He spoke to police officers who were working in an undercover capacity within the Mexican Mafia or Southside.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Hardiman\u2019s conclusions are supported by Tobias\u2019s and codefendant DeLeon\u2019s testimony. When Tobias arrived at Dorm 816, Vega told him that \u201cthey were working for the South\u201d and explained the rules to him. DeLeon testified that Southern California Hispanic local gang members are members of Southside \u201c[o]nly when [they are] in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Hardiman\u2019s conclusions are also supported by the nature of the attack upon Tobias. The attack involved concerted, apparently preplanned action by members of different local street gangs against an inmate who had refused to follow the command of a Southside \u201cshot caller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Appellants argue that the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s \u201cclassification system created a gang it called South Sider making membership mandatory\u201d for \u201cany Hispanic geographically from southern California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>regardless of whether or not he was a gang member before incarceration This constituted \u201can unlawful classification system which was based on ethnicity.\u201d \u201cIn the context of whether a finding is supported by substantial evidence, opinion evidence based on ethnic discrimination is not reasonable, credible, and of solid value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Appellants\u2019 argument is not supported by the evidence. Hardiman testified that, upon entry into the Los Angeles County jail, only Southern California Hispanic gang members become members of Southside. Incarcerated Southern California Hispanics who are not gang members are not members of Southside, although they \u201cfall[] under [its] control.\u201d \u201c[Y]ou really don\u2019t have to be a member of a street gang to be subject to the power [Southside] hold[s] over you</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The sheriff\u2019s department did not create Southside. Southside was created by the Mexican Mafia. Hardiman testified: \u201c[T]he Sheriff\u2019s Department doesn\u2019t designate anybody as a Southsider. That\u2019s for the Southside and for the individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\n<em>Elements of Statutory Definition of a Criminal Street Gang</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Vega and Rangel claim that the evidence is insufficient to establish the elements of the statutory definition of a criminal street gang. \u201c \u2018[Criminal street gang\u2019 means any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of [statutorily enumerated] criminal acts . . . , having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol, and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">\n<em>Common Name or Common Identifying Symbol</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Vega and Rangel assert that \u201cSouthside did not have its own unique symbolism. Rather, it used the same iconic Mayan imagery and the number 13 used by the Mexican Mafia.\u201d But the gang statute does not require \u201cunique\u201d symbolism. It requires only a \u201ccommon identifying sign or symbol.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (1).) Furthermore, the statute provides that a criminal street gang must have \u201ca common name <em>or </em>common identifying . . . symbol,\u201d not both. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (1), italics added.) Either is sufficient. Deputy Hardiman testified that the Southside gang had a common name: the terms \u201cSure\u00f1o, Sur, Southside, [and] Southsider\u201d were all \u201csynonymous\u201d with the gang. \u201cSur\u201d is Spanish for \u201csouth,\u201d and \u201cSure\u00f1o\u201d is Spanish for \u201ca person who is from the south.\u201d Southside also had a \u201ccommon identifying . . . symbol.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It had \u201ca symbol called the Kampol, . . . which is two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>horizontal lines with three dots above the horizontal lines which is a Mayan representation of the number 13.\u201d The 13th letter of the alphabet is \u2018\u201cM which stands for the Mexican Mafia. Hardiman\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence of \u201c \u2018a common name or common identifying . . . symbol.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 620 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713] [gang expert\u2019s testimony was sufficient to satisfy most of the elements of definition of a criminal street gang, including that the gang \u2018\u201cshares \u2018a common name or common identifying . . . symbol\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">\n<em>Primary Activities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Vega and Rangel maintain that the evidence is insufficient to show that \u2018\u201cone of [Southside\u2019s] primary activities\u201d was \u2018\u201cthe commission of one or more\u201d of the \u201ccriminal acts\u201d enumerated in the gang statute. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f).) Deputy Hardiman testified that the \u201cmost common\u201d activities of Southside were \u201cextortion, drug dealing, assault with deadly weapons, [and] conspiracies to [commit] murder.\u201d These activities are among the criminal acts enumerated in the statute. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (e)(1), (3), (4), (19).) Deputy Hardiman\u2019s testimony constitutes substantial evidence of the \u201cprimary activities\u201d element of the definition of a criminal street gang. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prunty </em>(2015) 62 Cal.4th 59, 82 [192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309, 355 P.3d 480] [gang expert\u2019s testimony \u201cthat \u2018the Norte\u00f1os\u2019 in the area engage in various criminal practices\u201d was \u201clikely sufficient\u201d to establish \u201cprimary activities\u201d element]; <em>People v. Sengpadychith </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 316, 324 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 27 P.3d 739]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\n<em>Pattern of Criminal Gang Activity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Finally, Vega and Rangel allege that the evidence is insufficient to show that Southside \u201cmembers individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (f).) The prosecution has \u201cthe choice of proving the requisite \u2018pattern of criminal gang activity\u2019 by evidence of \u2018two or more\u2019 predicate offenses committed \u2018on separate occasions\u2019 <em>or </em>by evidence of such offenses committed \u2018by two or more persons\u2019 on the same occasion.\u201d <em>(People v. Loeun </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 1, 10 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313].) The prosecution may \u201crely on evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of the charged offense and the contemporaneous commission of a second predicate offense by a fellow gang member.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The People contend that the predicate offenses were sufficiently proved by Hardiman\u2019s testimony that two other named individuals had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and murder and had committed these crimes while they were members of Southside, although they were also members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>different local criminal street gangs. Hardiman was the investigating officer in the assault with a deadly weapon case and testified at the trial in the murder case. The People also contend that the predicate offenses requirement was proved by all of appellants\u2019 contemporaneous commission of the charged offenses. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Loeun, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 14 [\u201cThrough evidence of defendant\u2019s commission of the charged crime of assault with a deadly weapon on Ivan Corral and the separate assault on Corral seconds later by a fellow gang member, the prosecution established the requisite \u2018pattern of criminal gang activity\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">But appellants argue that the evidence is insufficient to show that they and the two other named individuals belonged to the same \u201cumbrella\u201d Southside gang. \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that those who commit the predicate acts must belong to the same gang that the defendant acts to benefit.\u201d <em>(People v. Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 76.) Where, as here, \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s case positing the existence of a single \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 [Southside] for purposes of section 186.22(1) turns on the existence and conduct of one or more gang subsets [the different local street gangs at NCCF], then the prosecution must show some associational or organizational connection uniting those subsets. That connection may take the form of evidence of collaboration or organization .... Alternatively, it may be shown that the subsets are part of the same loosely hierarchical organization, even if the subsets themselves do not communicate or work together.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 71.) The associational or organizational connection may be \u201cformal or informal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 74.) The People acknowledge that the different Southern California Hispanic local criminal street gangs at NCCF \u201cwere subsets of South Side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\u201cThe most straightforward cases [of an associational or organizational connection] might involve subsets connected through formal ways, such as shared bylaws or organizational arrangements. Evidence could be presented, for instance, that such subsets are part of a loose approximation of a hierarchy. Even if the gang subsets do not have a formal relationship or interact with one another ... the subsets may still be part of the same organization if they are controlled by the same locus or hub. For example, Norte\u00f1o gang subsets may be treated as a single organization if each subset contains a \u2018 \u201cshot caller[]\u201d \u2019 who \u2018answer[s] to a higher authority\u2019 in the Norte\u00f1o chain of command. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prunty, supra, 62 </em>Cal.4th at p. 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The evidence here shows that this is one of \u201c[t]he most straightforward cases\u201d of an associational or organizational connection. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prunty, supra, 62 </em>Cal.4th at p. 77.) The Southern California Hispanic gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>subsets at NCCF were \u201ccontrolled by the same locus or hub.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Deputy Hardiman described in detail the \u201cpyramid-like structure of leadership within the jail that controls the actions of the individual Southsiders,\u201d with a Mexican Mafia member at the top and Southside shot callers at different levels of the pyramid. The subset gang members were governed by \u201ca set of rules\u201d called \u201cthe Southside rules.\u201d \u201c[P]roof that different Norte\u00f1o subsets are governed by the same \u2018bylaws\u2019 may suggest that they function . . . within a single hierarchical gang. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In proving the requisite associational or organizational connection, prosecutors may \u201cshow that members of the various subsets collaborate to accomplish shared goals.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 78.) The prosecutor in the instant case made such a showing. When Tobias arrived at Dorm 816, Vega told him that, \u201csince they were working for the South, there was no fighting among them.\u201d Prosecutors may establish collaboration by showing \u201cthat members of different subsets have \u2018work[ed] in concert to commit a crime,\u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 78, fn. omitted.) Here, the evidence shows that members of different gang subsets worked in concert to commit the aggravated assault upon Tobias. The subsets were \u201cunited by their activities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Accordingly, \u201c \u2018 \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the People\u201d \u2019 \u201d and \u201cpresuming] in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact reasonably could infer from the evidence\u201d <em>(People v.
