Effective January 1, 2013, the Legislature amended Government Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 31461, a provision of the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937, with the aim of curtailing pension spiking by excluding specified items from the calculation of retirement income. A number of individuals currently employed by various governmental entities in the County of Marin, together with a number of organizations representing current county employees, brought suit to halt implementation of the revised formula. The trial court concluded application of the new formula to current employees did not amount to an unconstitutional impairment of the employees\u2019 contracts, and sustained the pension authority\u2019s general demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">After an extensive independent review, we reach the same conclusion and affirm, holding that the Legislature did not act impermissibly by amending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>section 31461 to exclude specified items and categories of compensation from the calculation of pensions for current employees. As will be shown, while a public employee does have a \u201cvested right\u201d to a pension, that right is only to a \u201creasonable\u201d pension\u2014not an immutable entitlement to the most optimal formula of calculating the pension. And the Legislature may, prior to the employee\u2019s retirement, alter the formula, thereby reducing the anticipated pension. So long as the Legislature\u2019s modifications do not deprive the employee of a \u201creasonable\u201d pension, there is no constitutional violation. Here, the Legislature did not forbid the employer from providing the specified items to an employee as compensation, only the purely prospective inclusion of those items in the computation of the employee\u2019s pension. Neither the statutory change, nor the implementation of that change by the county pension agency, amounts to an impairment of the employee\u2019s receipt of a \u201creasonable\u201d pension upon retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Statutory Framework and the Emergence of the Unfunded Pension Liability Crisis</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (CERL; see Stats. 1937, ch. 677, p. 1898), as codified in 1947 (\u00a7 31450 et seq.) allows, but does not require, a county to establish and operate a retirement plan for its employees. Twenty of the state\u2019s 58 counties have elected to do so. Each county plan is administered by a retirement board, which, as we previously characterized it, is \u201crequired to determine whether items of remuneration paid to employees qualify as \u2018compensation\u2019 under section 31460 and \u2018compensation earnable\u2019 pursuant to section 31461, and therefore must be included as part of a retiring employee\u2019s \u2018final compensation\u2019 (\u00a7 31462 or \u00a7 31462.1) for purposes of calculating the amount of a pension.\u201d <em>(In re Retirement Cases </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 426 [433, 1 Cal.Rptr.3d 790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In the aftermath of the severe economic downturn of 2008 and 2009, public attention across the nation began to focus on the alarming state of unfunded public pension liabilities. (E.g., Cong. Budget Off., U.S. Cong., The Underfunding of State and Local Pension Plans (May 2011) p. 1 [estimating unfunded liabilities as of 2009 at \u201cbetween $2 trillion and $3 trillion\u201d]; State Budget Crisis Task Force, Rep. of the State Budget Crisis Task Force, Full Rep. (2012) p. 2 [\u201cPension funds for state and local government workers are underfunded by approximately a trillion dollars according to their actuaries and by as much as $3 trillion or more if more conservative investment assumptions are used\u201d]; Novy-Marx &amp; Rauh, <em>Public Pension Promises: How Big Are They and What Are They </em>Worth? (2011) 66 J. Fin. 1206, 1211 [estimating \u201cstate employee pension liabilities as of June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>2009\u201d at between $3.2 trillion to $4.43 trillion].) One legal commentator characterized unfunded pension obligations as the \u2018\u201cticking fiscal time bomb for state and local governments.\u201d (Beermann, <em>The Public Pension Crisis </em>(2013) 70 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 3, 13; cf. Rauh, <em>The Pension Bomb, </em>Milken Inst. Rev. (2011) 28 [\u2018\u201cMany pension systems are rapidly approaching a day of reckoning.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">As so often occurs, California was in first place: \u2018\u201cThe state with the biggest absolute level of underfunding is California, with underfunding of approximately $475 billion.\u201d (Novy-Marx &amp; Rauh, <em>The Liabilities and Risks of State-Sponsored Pension Plans </em>(2009) 23 J. Econ. Persp. 191, 197-199.) In 2010, the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, studying only the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, and the University of California Retirement System, estimated \u2018\u201cthe current shortfall at more than half a trillion dollars.\u201d (Bornstein et al., <em>Going for Broke: Reforming California\u2019s Public Employee Pension Systems, </em>Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Policy Brief (April 2010) p. 2; see also Nation, <em>The Funding Status of Independen t Public Employee Pension Systems in California, </em>Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Policy Brief (Nov. 2010) pp. 1, 13 [examining 24 systems operating under CERL which \u201caccount for approximately 91 percent of the total assets and liabilities for independent systems\u201d and estimating their \u201caggregate unfunded liability ... at nearly $200 billion in June 2008\u201d].) \u201cThe magnitude of the problem in California ... is staggering\u201d and \u201cis without peer.\u201d (Hylton, <em>Combating Moral Hazard: The Case for Rationalizing Public Employee Benefits </em>(2012) 45 Ind. L.Rev. 413, 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In 2011, the Little Hoover Commission advised the Governor and the Legislature: \u201cCalifornia\u2019s pension plans are dangerously underfunded, the result of overly generous benefit promises, wishful thinking and an unwillingness to plan prudently. Unless aggressive reforms are implemented now, the problem will get far worse, forcing counties and cities to severely reduce services and layoff employees to meet pension obligations.\u201d (Little Hoover Com., Public Pensions for Retirement Security (Feb. 2011) [cover letter of Chairman Daniel Hancock].) The commission urged a number of \u201cstructural changes that realign pension costs and expectations of employees, employers and taxpayers.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The situation was described as \u201cdire,\u201d \u201cunmanageable,\u201d a \u201ccrisis\u201d that \u201cwill take a generation to untangle,\u201d and \u201ca harsh reality\u201d that could no longer be ignored: \u201cThe money coming in is nowhere near enough to keep up with the money that will need to go out.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. v. 38, 12, 21, 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\u201cThe state must exercise its authority\u2014and establish the legal authority\u2014to reset overly generous and unsustainable pension formulas for both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>current and future workers.\u201d (Little Hoover Com., Public Pensions for Retirement Security, <em>supra, </em>at p. 53.) And because \u2018\u201cState and local governments have made a promise to workers they can no longer afford,\u201d the commission recommended: \u201cTo provide <em>immediate savings of the scope needed, </em>state and local governments must have the flexibility to alter future, unac-crued retirement benefits for current workers.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 42, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">One feature of the system that drew the commission\u2019s critical attention was \u201cpension spiking,\u201d which the commission defined as follows: \u201cThe practice of increasing [an employee\u2019s] retirement allowance by increasing final compensation or including various non-salary items (such as unused vacation pay) in the final compensation figure used in the [employee\u2019s] retirement benefit calculations, and which has not been considered in prefunding of the benefits.\u201d (Little Hoover Com., Public Pensions for Retirement Security, <em>supra, </em>at p. 73.) The commission found the practice had become \u201cwidespread throughout local government,\u201d and had generated \u201cpublic outrage [that] . . . cannot continue to be ignored.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Little Hoover Com., Public Pensions for Retirement Security, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 36, vi.) \u201cThe spiking games must end. Pensions must be based only on actual base salary ... not padded with other pay for clothing, equipment or vehicle use, or enhanced by adding service credit for unused sick time vacation time or other leave time.\u201d (Little Hoover Com., Public Pensions for Retirement Security, <em>supra, </em>at p. 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Pension Reform Act</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The Legislature heard, and agreed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The following year, it passed Assembly Bill No. 340 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill 340), enacting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>California Public Employees\u2019 Pension Reform Act of 2013 (Pension Reform Act), which made fundamental alterations in the manner in which public pensions are calculated. (\u00a7 7522 et seq.; Stats. 2012, ch. 296.) Concurrent with that effort, the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 197 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill 197), with the declared purpose to \u201cexclude from the definition of compensation earnable any compensation determined by the [county retirement] board to have been paid to enhance a member\u2019s retirement benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 197 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.); Stats. 2012, ch. 297.) To this end, both Assembly Bill 340 and Assembly Bill 197 amended section 31461 by adding subdivision (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201c(b) \u2018Compensation earnable\u2019 does not include, in any case, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201c(1) Any compensation determined by the board to have been paid to enhance a member\u2019s retirement benefit under that system. That compensation may include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">\u201c(A) Compensation that had previously been provided in kind to the member by the employer or paid directly by the employer to a third party other than the retirement system for the benefit of the member, and which was converted to and received by the member in the form of a cash payment in the final average salary period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">\u201c(B) Any one-time or ad hoc payment made to a member, but not to all similarly situated members in the member\u2019s grade or class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>\u201c(C) Any payment that is made solely due to the termination of the member\u2019s employment, but is received by the member while employed, except those payments that do not exceed what is earned and payable in each 12-month period during the final average salary period regardless of when reported or paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\u201c(2) Payments for unused vacation, annual leave, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off, however denominated, whether paid in a lump sum or otherwise, in an amount that exceeds that which may be earned and payable in each 12-month period during the final average salary period, regardless of when reported or paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201c(3) Payments for additional services rendered outside of normal working hours, whether paid in a lump sum or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201c(4) Payments made at the termination of employment, except those payments that do not exceed what is earned and payable in each 12-month period during the final average salary period, regardless of when reported or paid.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">There is no dispute that the purpose of this change was to curtail pension spiking.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Marin County, which was already wrestling with its own pension difficulties,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was one of the first to act to implement the Pension Reform Act. On December 18, 2012, the board of directors of the Marin County Employees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Retirement Association and its directors (collectively MCERA)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> adopted a \u201cPolicy Regarding Compensation Earnable and Pensionable Compensation Determinations\u201d implementing Assembly Bill 197 with \u201cthe new rules set forth herein regarding the definition of Compensation Earnable,\u201d that would comply with the \u201cnew . . . section 31461.\u201d Commencing on January 1, 2013, specified items would be excluded from the new definition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Reaction to the change in policy was almost immediate. On January 18, 2013, less than three weeks after the Pension Reform Act took effect, five recognized employee organizations and four individuals (collectively plaintiffs) commenced this action against MCERA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiffs alleged that on December 18, 2012: \u2018\u201c[T]he MCERA BOARD voted to implement AB 197 effective January 1, 2013 and announced a new policy for the calculation of retirement benefits. Under the policy, MCERA would begin excluding standby pay, administrative response pay, callback pay, cash payments for waiving health insurance, and other pay items from the calculation of members\u2019 final compensation for all compensation earned after January 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Plaintiffs further alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">\u201cSince at least 1997, ... if not before then, MCERA, the County, and other MCERA-participating employers agreed to include certain elements of compensation, in addition to base pay, as compensation earnable for purposes of calculating retirees\u2019 final compensation, and thus, pension benefits. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">\u201cAmong other elements of compensation that have long been included in pension calculations are standby pay, administrative response pay, call-back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>pay, and cash payments made to employees who waive health insurance coverage. More recently, the County negotiated changes to its Internal Revenue Code Section 125 cafeteria plan[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] . . . resulting in payments in cash in lieu of fringe benefits, which the County and MCERA agreed would be treated as compensation earnable (so-called \u2018hold harmless\u2019 payments). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\u201cOver the years, MCERA and employers who participate in MCERA, such as the County, have repeatedly communicated and committed to MCERA members that these and other elements of compensation would be included in the calculation of members\u2019 final compensation and encouraged MCERA members to plan their retirement based on the idea that these pay items would be included in the determination of their pension benefits. MCERA and participating employers made these representations and commitments to members in MOUs, plan documents, newsletters, bulletins, handbooks, handouts, official policy statements, and other publications and correspondence with MCERA members. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u201cBecause MCERA has included these various pay items in the calculation of retirement benefits, the cost of these benefits has been actuarially factored into contribution rates and has been paid for by both member and employer contributions. Additionally, the value and associated costs of these benefits have also been a factor in determining the wage and benefit packages offered to MCERA members through collective bargaining . . . and in some instances has led to employees accepting lower wages or other benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Plaintiffs also complained about the generalized way in which MCERA had changed its policy: \u201cIn addition to impairing MCERA members\u2019 vested rights,\u201d MCERA \u201calso decided to exclude certain pay items from compensation earnable without making a determination that such compensation has been paid to enhance MCERA members\u2019 retirement benefits, as required by AB 197. To the extent any determination has been made that these pay items have been paid to enhance retirement benefits, such determinations are incorrect and constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Plaintiffs further alleged that they \u201crelied on MCERA and participating employers\u2019 commitment to include these pay items in the calculation of final compensation, and they agreed to accept employment and remain employees of their respective employers based on the promised pension benefit\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he elimination of these various pay items from the calculation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>MCERA members\u2019 final compensation will result in a reduction in members\u2019 pension benefits below what they had previously been promised,\u201d and \u2018\u201cthe value of the benefits ... are a form of deferred compensation for work already performed,\u201d and \u2018\u201cprotected by Article I, section 9 of the California Constitution and Article I, section 10, clause 1 of the United States Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And plaintiffs concluded: \u2018\u201cBy excluding items from the final compensation calculation that MCERA had previously committed to provide, AB 197 unconstitutionally impairs MCERA members\u2019 vested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Plaintiffs prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief that Assembly Bill 197 and MCERA\u2019s \u2018\u201cactions are unconstitutional impairments of vested rights and therefore unenforceable.\u201d Plaintiffs also prayed for issuance of a writ of mandate \u2018\u201cto compel [MCERA] to continue to calculate the pensions of its members in a manner consistent with its policies in effect before December 18, 2012 and in a manner consistent with binding promises made to MCERA members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The State of California was granted leave to intervene, as expressly directed by the Governor, in order that it could defend the constitutionality of Assembly Bill 197. Shortly thereafter, MCERA interposed a general demurrer on the sole ground that, because \u2018\u201cAB 197 . . . [is] constitutional,\u201d and MCERA was \u2018\u201crequired by law to implement . . . AB 197,\u201d plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action. Plaintiffs filed opposition vigorously disputing both of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In June 2013, after hearing extensive argument, the trial court sustained MCERA\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">The crux of this appeal is whether MCERA may eliminate benefits previously treated as compensation earnable from the calculation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>pension formula for what plaintiffs term \u201clegacy members\u201d\u2014employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2013\u2014because Assembly Bill 197 modified that formula. In legal terms, did the narrowing achieved by Assembly Bill 197 impair plaintiffs\u2019 vested pension rights? Because there is no genuine factual dispute presented (see fn. 12, <em>ante), </em>the issue is purely one of law for our independent review. <em>(Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Genest </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1028 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 326], and decisions cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">However, before we consider the constitutional issue, we are obligated to ascertain if the appeal may be decided on some other, nonconstitutional ground. (E.g., <em>Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 66 [195 P.2d 1]; <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd. v. Genest, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1043.) Plaintiffs advance two such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The Order Sustaining MCERA\u2019s Demurrer Is Not Procedurally Defective</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Plaintiffs first attack the trial court\u2019s order as procedurally defective because it \u201cdoes not provide a justification for sustaining the demurrer.\u201d If the attack were to succeed, the judgment can be reversed on a nonconstitutional basis. But the attack will not succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In its entirety, the trial court\u2019s order read: \u201cRespondents\u2019 Demurrer to the Verified Writ Petition is sustained without leave to amend. The court finds the Respondents\u2019 actions implementing Govt. Code \u00a7 31461, as amended effective January 1, 2013, are proper and that the Public Employees\u2019 Pension Reform Act of 2013 is constitutional. The Respondent Board of Retirement has the exclusive authority and responsibility to determine its members \u2018compensation earnable,\u2019 which is used to calculate members\u2019 retirement allowance, pursuant to Govt. Code \u00a7 31461. (See <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers\u2019 Ass\u2019n. v. Bd. of Supervisors of Los Angeles County </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1373 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 157], and <em>In re Retirement Cases[, supra,] </em>110 Cal.App.4th 426, 453.) A statute, once duly enacted, is presumed to be constitutional. [\u00b6] SO ORDERED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">This order was filed on June 19, 2013, and mailed to the parties the following day. On June 24, MCERA mailed plaintiffs notice of entry. The ensuing judgment, which quoted almost all of the order, was entered on June 26, the same day plaintiffs unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration of the order, following which they were rebuffed in their request for extraordinary relief from this court. <em>(Marin Assn. of Public Employees v. Superior Court </em>(Feb. 25, 2014, A139621) [nonpub. opn].) At no time during these proceedings did plaintiffs advise the trial court, or attack the order, on the ground now advanced. By reason of this inaction, the claim was forfeited. (E.g., Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Civ. Proc., \u00a7 472d, quoted at fn. 13, <em>post: E. L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 504, fn. 2 [146 Cal.Rptr. 614, 579 P.2d 505]; <em>Lambert v. Carneghi </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1128, fn. 4 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 626].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Even if the claim had been preserved for review, it would not require reversal. California has a statute governing this precise subject, one not cited in plaintiffs\u2019 briefs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Concerning that statute, this court long ago recognized that it \u201chas been interpreted to require the affirmance of trial court rulings on demurrers if any of the grounds raised by defendant require the sustaining of the demurrer, whether or not the court specifies all the grounds.\u201d <em>(Banerian v. O\u2019Malley </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 604, 610 [116 Cal.Rptr. 919].) That is why the ruling is examined de novo on the sole legal question of whether the complaint states a claim for relief upon any theory. (E.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 589; <em>McCall </em>v. <em>PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 415 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d 1189]; cf. <em>Wells v. Marina City Properties, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 781, 787 [176 Cal.Rptr. 104, 632 P.2d 217] [\u201c \u2018a demurrer of course calls for the determination of an issue of law only.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">So it is incorrect to treat the ruling on a demurrer as akin to a statement of decision, which is only required, upon request, \u201cupon the trial of a question of fact.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 632.) But this is clearly what plaintiffs believe is missing from the trial court\u2019s order. Instead of \u201crationaliz[ations],\u201d \u201cgeneral proposition^],\u201d and \u201cplatitude[s],\u201d plaintiffs appear to think the trial court should have provided a point-by-point analysis of each of the legal issues raised by the petition. That belief is patently unreasonable and far exceeds the statutory requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See <em>Mautner v. Peralta </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 796, 801-802 [263 Cal.Rptr. 535] [\u201cCode of Civil Procedure section 472d does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>not mandate a detailed statement explaining the court\u2019s reasons for sustaining the demurrer\u201d]; <em>Berkeley Police Assn. v.

The decisive issue, as even MCERA and the state concede, is whether MCERA\u2019s implementation of Assembly Bill 197 constitutes an unconstitutional impairment of plaintiffs\u2019 contracts of employment and concomitant pension benefits. MCERA\u2019s general demurrer required the trial court to decide that issue as a matter of law with a yes or a no answer, which would resolve the sole ground for MCERA\u2019s demurrer: did plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action? The trial court made that decision, with its reasons given. Plaintiffs may not like the brevity of those reasons, but Code of Civil Procedure section 472d requires no more for our de novo review. <em>(E. L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 497, 504, fn. 2; <em>Berkeley Police Assn. v. City of Berkeley, supra, </em>at p. 943.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">\n<em>The Maimer in Which MCERA Implemented Assembly Bill 197 Was Not Improper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The second nonconstitutional ground for reversal advanced by plaintiffs is that MCERA \u2018\u201cdid not follow the correct procedural requirements\u201d of Assembly Bill 197 \u2018\u201cfor excluding payments made to \u2018enhance a member\u2019s retirement benefit.\u2019 \u201d Again, plaintiffs are not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Pension Reform Act added section 31542, the pertinent provisions of which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u2018\u201c(a) The board shall establish a procedure for assessing and determining whether an element of compensation was paid to enhance a member\u2019s retirement benefit. If the board determines that compensation was paid to enhance a member\u2019s benefit, the member or the employer may present evidence that the compensation was not paid for that purpose. Upon receipt of sufficient evidence to the contrary, a board may reverse its determination that compensation was paid to enhance a member\u2019s retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">\u2018\u201c(b) Upon a final determination by the board that compensation was paid to enhance a member\u2019s retirement benefit, the board shall provide notice of that determination to the member and employer. The member or employer may obtain judicial review of the board\u2019s action by filing a petition for writ of mandate within 30 days of the mailing of that notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Plaintiffs correctly recognize that these provisions are intended to govern individualized determinations. As plaintiffs describe it: \u2018\u201c[T]he focus is on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>whether compensation was made to enhance a particular member\u2019s retirement\u2014hence the instruction that the procedure determine whether <em>\u2018a </em>member\u2019s retirement benefit\u2019 has been enhanced. [\u00b6] . . . [I]f the board makes such a determination, the member or the member\u2019s employer must be given an opportunity to present evidence to the contrary. This presumes, of course, that the employee and employer must be given some kind of notice of the determination, since otherwise the right to present contrary evidence would be meaningless. The retirement board then has an opportunity to reverse its decision, if the employee or employer presents \u2018sufficient evidence to the contrary.\u2019 [\u00b6] Finally, if the retirement board persists in holding that the compensation was paid to enhance the member\u2019s retirement benefit, either the individual member or the member\u2019s employer may thereafter seek review of the board\u2019s decision by filing a petition for writ of mandate. Again, this is an individualized right and requires an analysis specific to the particular member.\u201d But here, plaintiffs conclude, \u2018\u201cMarin CERA did not make a determination that payments for in-kind benefits converted to cash were made in order to enhance any particular member\u2019s retirement benefit.\u201d This analysis of section 31542 is perfectly reasonable, but plaintiffs misapprehend its application here, particularly as the situation is defined by the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Section 31542 is clearly intended to serve as the mechanism for calculating the pension of an employee about to retire. There is nothing to indicate the statute was intended to govern the situation here\u2014a shift in policy by the retirement board in compliance with a new command from the Legislature, clearly intended to be applied in the future to plaintiffs\u2019 so-called \u201clegacy\u201d employees when they put in for retirement. Indeed, if plaintiffs\u2019 construction were correct, section 31542 would initiate the calculation process for every employee affected by the change, without regard to whether actual retirement is imminent for him or her. This would entail a massive expenditure of administrative resources devoted to an individualized inquiry that would be pointless for all employees not on the cusp of retirement.  We have repeatedly emphasized that statutory language is to be construed to avoid such absurd or outlandish consequences. (See <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 812, 857 [188 Cal.Rptr.3d 374], and decisions cited.) We conclude that MCERA has not, in plaintiffs\u2019 words, \u201cfailed to follow the required procedure for excluding payments\u201d from the determination of each employee\u2019s \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\n<em>The Amendment to Section 31461 Is Not an Unconstitutional Impairment of Plaintiffs\u2019 Vested Pension Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 essential position is clearly set out in their opening brief: \u201c[PJublic employees earn a vested right to their pension benefits immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>upon acceptance of employment and . . . such benefits cannot be reduced without a comparable advantage being provided.\u201d \u2018\u201cA corollary of this approach is that public employees are also entitled to any increase in benefits conferred during their employment, beyond the pension benefit in place when they began. . . . [S]ince they are performing work under the improved pension system, the terms of that system become an integral part of their compensation, and they immediately become vested in the improved benefit.\u201d \u2018\u201cBecause A.B. 197 has resulted only in the exclusion of payments from pension benefits, with no new benefit to offset the decreased pensions, this infringes employees\u2019 vested rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Plaintiffs candidly admit, \u201c[i]n practice, this means that for existing employees, any changes must generally be neutral with regard to the overall benefit provided and cannot represent a net decrease in the pension benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Less ambiguously, they assert \u201cneither Marin CERA nor the Legislature can now curtail those benefits.\u201d Plaintiffs insist that if their position is not vindicated on this appeal, California will have returned to \u201cthe view that public employee pensions are mere \u2018gratuities\u2019 to be granted or taken away at the whim of the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">A brief review of principles governing public employee pensions will show that much of plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning is not controversial, but their ultimate conclusion cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>Some General Law of Pensions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">States are prohibited by the United States Constitution from passing a law \u201cimpairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d (U.S. Const., art.

Article I, section 9 of the California Constitution states a parallel proscription: \u201cA . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts may not be passed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u2018\u201c[P]ublic employment gives rise to certain obligations which are protected by the contract clause of the Constitution, including the right to the payment of salary which has been earned.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 808, 815 [135 Cal.Rptr. 386, 557 P.2d 970] <em>(Miller).) </em>\u201cEarned\u201d in this context obviously means in exchange for services already performed.

While payment of these benefits is deferred, and is subject to the condition that the employee continue to serve for the period required by the statute, the mere fact that performance is in whole or in part dependent upon certain contingencies does not prevent a contract from arising, and the employing governmental body may not deny or impair the contingent liability any more than it can refuse to make the salary payments which are immediately due.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cAlthough vested prior to the time when the obligation to pay matures, pension rights are not immutable. For example, the government entity providing the pension may make reasonable modifications and changes in the pension system. This flexibility is necessary \u2019to permit adjustments in accord with changing conditions and at the same time maintain the integrity of the system and carry out its beneficent policy.\u2019\u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 815-816, quoting <em>Kern v.

[\u00b6] Thus it appears . . . that an employee may acquire a vested contractual right to a pension but that this right is not rigidly fixed by the specific terms of the legislation in effect during any particular period in which he serves. The statutory language is subject to the implied qualification that the governing body may make modifications and changes in the system. The employee does not have a right to any fixed or definite benefits, but only to a substantial or reasonable pension. There is no inconsistency therefore in holding that he has a vested right to a pension but that the amount, terms and conditions of the benefits may be altered.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Kern v.

City of Long Beach </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 128, 131 [287 P.2d 765].) It is a onetime variation of this last sentence that is a foundation of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">In 1983, our Supreme Court stated: \u201cA constitutional bar against the destruction of such vested contractual pension rights, however, does not absolutely prohibit their modification. With respect to <em>active </em>employees, we have held that any modification of vested pension rights must be reasonable, must bear a material relation to the theory and successful operation of a pension system, and, when resulting in disadvantage to employees, <em>must </em>be accompanied by comparable new advantages.

The single word we have italicized, and the thought it seemingly expresses, permeates plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief. However, we do not believe the word \u201cmust\u201d was intended to be given the literal and inflexible meaning attributed to it by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The Supreme Court in the 1983 <em>Allen </em>opinion cited three decisions as support for the quoted proposition. The two Supreme Court decisions cited employed the word \u201cshould.\u201d <em>(Allen v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 128, 131 [\u201cTo be sustained as reasonable, alterations of employees\u2019 pension rights must bear some material relation to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation, and changes in a pension plan which result in disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new advantages\u201d]; see <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d 438, 449 [quoting this sentence from <em>Allen].) </em>It is only a 1969 Court of Appeal decision, which cites the same two Supreme Court decisions, that uses \u201cmust.\u201d <em>(Lyon </em>v. <em>Flournoy </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 774, 782 [76 Cal.Rptr. 869] <em>(Flournoy) </em>[\u201cIn brief, modifications affecting the earned pension rights of active employees must be reasonable, related to the theory of a sound pension system, and changes detrimental to the individual must be offset by comparable new advantages. <em>(Abbott </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d at pp. 447, 449; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d at pp. 131-133.)\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">There is, of course, no bar to the Supreme Court adopting a Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning as its own. Yet there is legitimate reason to question whether that was what the Supreme Court intended in 1983. First, as just shown, only the least authoritative of the three sources cited actually supports the word \u201cmust,\u201d while the two Supreme Court decisions employ \u201cshould.\u201d Second, barely a month later, the Supreme Court\u2014speaking though the same justice\u2014filed another decision, which used the \u201cshould\u201d formulation from the 1955 <em>Allen </em>decision as quoted in <em>Abbott.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Third, the 1983 <em>Allen </em>decision involved retirees (and <em>Flournoy </em>the widow of a retiree), who historically receive a heightened degree of judicial protection. (See fn. 19, <em>ante.) </em>Fourth, and most significantly, the \u201cmust\u201d formulation has never been reiterated by the Supreme Court, which has instead uniformly employed the \u201cshould\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>language from the 1955 <em>Allen </em>decision. <em>(Olson v. Cory, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 532, 541 [\u201cAlthough an employee does not obtain any \u2018absolute right to fixed or specific benefits . . . there [are] strict limitation^] on the conditions which may modify the pension system in effect during employment.\u2019 [Citation.] Such modifications must be reasonable and any \u2018 \u201cchanges in a pension plan which result in disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new advantages\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Legislature v.

City of Long Beach, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 128, 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">It thus appears unlikely that the Supreme Court\u2019s use of \u201cmust\u201d in the 1983 <em>Allen </em>decision was intended to herald a fundamental doctrinal shift. \u201cShould,\u201d not \u201cmust,\u201d remains the court\u2019s preferred expression. And \u201cshould\u201d does not convey imperative obligation, no more compulsion than \u201cought.\u201d <em>(Lashley </em>v. <em>Koerber </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 83, 90 [156 P.2d 441]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 401, 409, fn. 2 [230 Cal.Rptr. 755] [\u201cthe word \u2018should\u2019 is advisory only and not mandatory\u201d].) In plain effect, \u201cshould\u201d is \u201ca recommendation, not ... a mandate.\u201d <em>(Cuevas v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 406, 409 [130 Cal.Rptr. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">But the most persuasive evidence against the Supreme Court intending to impose a quid pro quo standard is circumstantial\u2014the bottom line of who won. The issue in <em>Allen </em>was whether pension payments to retired legislators could be reduced pursuant to new statutory and constitutional language. The trial court had concluded that reduction would be contrary to the contract clauses of both state and federal Constitutions. <em>(Allen v. Board of Administration, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 114, 118-119.) The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the reduction was not constitutionally improper. There is nothing in the opinion linking the reduction to provision of some new compensating benefit. If the court intended \u201cmust\u201d to have a literal meaning, the retirees would have won. They lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In light of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that <em>Allen v. Board of Administration </em>in 1983 was meant to introduce an inflexible hardening of the traditional formula for public employee pension modification. Consequently, we do not deem ourselves bound by expressions in Court of Appeal opinions\u2014including our own in <em>In re Retirement Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th 426, 448\u2014reiterating the <em>Allen </em>language.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In any event, we think there is a \u201cnew benefit\u201d provided by the Pension Reform Act. That measure made no change to the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d in CERL, namely section 31460. The change in policy adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>MCERA\u2014which is not an employer of any individual plaintiff or of persons employed by other governmental entities\u2014is not alleged to have changed in the way compensation is calculated by any of those entities. Thus, for all we know, employees who prior to MCERA changing its policy in December 2012 collected any of the items or payments at issue (see fn. 9, <em>ante) </em>continued to have those items or payments included in their monthly compensation. However, due to MCERA\u2019s change in policy, each of those employees\u2019 paychecks is no longer being reduced by deductions to cover those sums in funding the employee\u2019s retirement. Put simply, the new benefit is an increase in the employee\u2019s net monthly compensation. Put even more simply, it is more cash in hand every month.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\n<em>Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That Their Vested Right to a Reasonable Pension Has Been Substantially Impaired</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 initial premise, and the centerpiece of their oral argument, is that the moment each individual plaintiff commenced working for a public agency in Marin County, that person acceded to a \u201cvested right\u201d to a pension. To a large extent, that premise is correct. As already established by <em>Miller, </em>the \u201cright\u201d to a pension \u201cvests\u201d when the first portion of wages or salary already earned is deferred by being withheld for a future pension. (See fn. 17 and accompanying text, <em>ante.) </em>But to call a pension right \u201cvested\u201d is to state a truism. As one Court of Appeal sensibly noted, \u201cALL pension rights are vested\u201d in the sense they cannot be destroyed. <em>(Santin </em>v. <em>Cranston </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 438, 443 [59 Cal.Rptr. 1].) Until retirement, an employee\u2019s entitlement to a pension is subject to change short of actual destruction. That same Court of Appeal aptly\u2014and accurately\u2014characterized that entitlement as only \u201ca limited vested right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 441.) Even plaintiffs concede there is no talismanic significance to \u201cvested rights\u201d that will prevent legislative modification between hiring and retirement. However, what plaintiffs fail to acknowledge is that in the very authority on which their position is based, our Supreme Court explained just how potent is this governmental power.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\u201cNot every change in a retirement law constitutes an impairment of the obligations of contracts, however. [Citation.] Nor does every impairment run afoul of the contract clause. The United States Supreme Court has observed, \u2018Although the Contract Clause appears literally to proscribe \u201cany\u201d impairment, . . . \u201cthe prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.\u201d [Citation.] Thus, a finding that there has been a technical impairment is merely a preliminary step in resolving the more difficult question whether that impairment is permitted under the Constitution.\u2019 [Citation.] An attempt must be made \u2018to reconcile the strictures of the Contract Clause with the \u201cessential attributes of sovereign power,\u201d . . .\u2019 [Citation.] For example, \u2018[m]inimal alteration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>contractual obligations may end the inquiry at its first stage. Severe impairment, on the other hand, will push the inquiry to a careful examination of the nature and purpose of the state legislation.\u2019 [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\u201cThe high court also has expressed the relevant principles another way: \u2018The constitutional prohibition against contract impairment does not exact a rigidly literal fulfillment; rather, it demands that contracts be enforced according to their \u201cjust and reasonable purport\u201d; not only is the existing law read into contracts in order to fix their obligations, but the reservation of the essential attributes of continuing governmental power is also read into contracts as a postulate of the legal order. [Citations.] The contract clause and the principle of continuing governmental power are construed in harmony; although not permitting a construction which permits contract repudiation or destruction, the impairment provision does not prevent laws which restrict a party to the gains \u201creasonably to be expected from the contract.\u201d [Citation.] Constitutional decisions \u201chave never given a law which imposes unforeseen advantages or burdens on a contracting party constitutional immunity against change.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Allen v. Board of Administration, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 114, 119-120, quoting <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 1 [52 L.Ed.2d 92, 97 S.Ct. 1505] and <em>El Paso </em>v. <em>Simmons </em>1965) 379 U.S. 497 [13 L.Ed.2d 446, 85 S.Ct. 577].)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">To return to <em>Miller: </em>\u201cThe scope of permissible modifications of vested pension rights was established in <em>Allen v. City of Long Beach], supra,] </em>45 Cal.2d 128 . . . : \u2018Such modifications must be reasonable, and it is for the courts to determine upon the facts of each case what constitutes a permissible change. To be sustained as reasonable, alterations of employees\u2019 pension rights must bear some material relation to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation, and changes in a pension plan which result in disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new advantages.\u2019 <em>(Allen, supra, </em>at p. 131.)\u201d <em>{Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Implicit in the formula, however expressed, is that alterations, changes, and modifications do not invariably work to the employee\u2019s benefit. In large measure, the judicial history of examining pensions is largely given over to broken promises and changed circumstances. Nevertheless, the basic limits are established.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">When the Supreme Court says that vested pension rights may not be \u201cdestroyed,\u201d it means a pension system cannot be abolished on the eve of retirement (see <em>Kern v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 848 [municipal pension plan repealed 32 days before employee completed 20-years\u2019 service needed for retirement]); or not after substantial service has been provided (see <em>Legislature v. Eu, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 492 [initiative measure abolishing legislative pension system valid only as to persons subsequently elected]); or not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>effectively abolishing a pension plan the legislative authority refuses to fund (see <em>Bellus </em>v. <em>City of Eureka </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 336, 352 [71 Cal.Rptr. 135, 444 P.2d 711]; <em>Valdes </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 773, 787 [189 Cal.Rptr. 212]; <em>Klench </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Fd. Commrs. </em>(1926) 79 Cal.App. 171, 182 [249 P. 46]).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">But there are acceptable changes aplenty that fall short of \u201cdestroying\u201d an employee\u2019s anticipated pension. \u201cReasonable\u201d modifications can encompass reductions in promised benehts. (E.g., <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808 [change of retirement age with reduction of maximum possible pension]; <em>Claypool </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 646 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 77] [repeal of cost of living adjustments]; <em>Brooks v. Pension Board </em>(1938) 30 Cal.App.2d 118 [85 P.2d 956] [pension reduced prior to retirement from two-thirds to one-half of employee\u2019s salary].) Or changes in the number of years service required. <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 818 [\u201cUpon being required by law to retire at age 67 rather than age 70, plaintiff suffered no impairment of vested pension rights since he had no constitutionally protected right to remain in employment until he had earned a larger pension at age 70\u201d]; <em>Amundsen </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 856 [106 Cal.Rptr. 759] [change in minimum service requirement].) Or a reasonable increase in the employee\u2019s contributions. (\u00a7 31454; <em>International Assn. of Firefighters v. City of San Diego, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 292, 300-301; <em>City of Downey </em>v. <em>Board of Administration </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 621, 632 [121 Cal.Rptr. 295]; cf. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 128, 131 [invalidating \u201cprovision raising the rate of an employee\u2019s contribution . . . from 2 per cent of his salary to 10 per cent\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Thus, short of actual abolition, a radical reduction of benehts, or a fiscally unjushhable increase in employee contributions, the guiding principle is still the one identified by <em>Miller </em>in 1977: \u201c \u2018the governing body may make <em>reasonable </em>modifications and changes before the pension becomes payable and that until that time the employee does not have a right to any fixed or definite benehts but only to a substantial or <em>reasonable </em>pension.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 816, italics added.) As made clear by the 1947 decision quoted in <em>Miller: </em>\u201can employee may acquire a vested contractual right to a pension but . . . this right is not rigidly fixed by the specihc terms of the legislation in effect during any particular period [the employee] serves,\u201d and \u201cthe amount, terms and conditions of the benehts may be altered.\u201d <em>(Kern v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 848, 855.) Hence the reiterahon of reserved legislative power: \u201c \u2018[A] public pension system is subject to the implied qualihcation that the governing body may make reasonable modifications and changes before the pension becomes payable and that until that time the employee does not have a right to any fixed or definite benehts but only to a substantial or reasonable pension.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The ordinary progression of analysis for an alleged contract clause violation goes as follows: Is there a valid contract to be impaired? If there is a valid contract, has it been impaired? Lastly, is the impairment substantial, meaning was a substantial right secured by the contract extinguished, made invalid, or significantly altered? (E.g., <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Romein </em>(1992) 503 U.S. 181, 186 [117 L.Ed.2d 328, 112 S.Ct. 1105]; <em>Home Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. </em>v. <em>Blaisdell </em>(1934) 290 U.S. 398, 430\u2014431 [78 L.Ed. 413, 54 S.Ct. 231].) \u201cAnalysis of a contract clause claim requires inquiry into: \u2018 \u201c(1) the nature and extent of any contractual obligation . . . and (2) the scope of the Legislature\u2019s power to modify any such obligation.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] The party asserting a contract clause claim has the burden of \u2018mak[ing] out a clear case, free from all reasonable ambiguity,\u2019 [that] a constitutional violation occurred. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. of San Diego County v. County of San Diego </em>(2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 573, 578 [182 Cal.Rptr.3d 759].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The contract clauses do not foreclose government action which reflects changing concepts of public policy, concomitantly granting government the power to make illegal that which was previously legal. That power has been exercised over a myriad of products and practices, and has not been stymied simply because a contract was in existence when the ban took effect. (E.g., <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1879) 101 U.S. 814 [25 L.Ed. 1079] [prohibition of existing state lottery]; <em>Beer Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1877) 97 U.S. 25 [24 L.Ed. 989] [state license to produce liquor invalidated by adoption of state prohibition law].) Such a contract might provide for a rate of interest which a statute later makes usurious and invalid, yet there is no contract clause violation. <em>(Griffith </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1910) 218 U.S. 563, 571 [54 L.Ed. 1151, 31 S.Ct. 132].) Or it might be a contract for transporting freight on public highways at a cost below that fixed by a subsequently established utility commission which is statutorily authorized to fix minimum rates. Abrogation or modification of the contract presents no constitutional violation. <em>(Stephenson v. Binford </em>(1932) 287 U.S. 251, 276 [77 L.Ed. 288, 53 S.Ct. 181].) Enacting a new tax or increasing an existing one does not require exemption of existing contracts. <em>(National Ice etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Pacific F. Exp.

The following is a useful summary: \u201c \u2018The contract clause does not protect expectations that are based upon contracts that are invalid, illegal, [or] unenforceable .... Nor does the contract clause protect expectations which are based upon legal theories other than contract, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>quasi-contract or estoppel.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>(Medina </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 864, 871 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 634].)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">It is without dispute that (1) up to January 1, 2013, there was a contract between MCERA and certain public employees concerning how those employees would be compensated, and (2) that after January 1, 2013, under compulsion of the Pension Reform Act, the agreement was unilaterally altered by MCERA to reduce the scope of compensation that had been accounted as \u2018\u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d The issue here is whether the amendment of section 31461\u2014the only part of Assembly Bill 197 challenged by plaintiffs and addressed here\u2014qualifies as an \u201cunreasonable\u201d change, a \u201csubstantial\u201d impairment, and thus a violation of the state and federal Constitutions. There being no factual dispute, the issue is properly resolved as one of law. (See <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd. v. Genest, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1028, and decisions cited.) We conclude the dual answer is no: MCERA\u2019s implementation of the amended version of section 31461 does not qualify as a substantial impairment of plaintiffs\u2019 contracts of employment with its right to a \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d pension. Thus there is no violation of the state and federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Plaintiffs do not\u2014indeed could not\u2014dispute that the Legislature possesses broad power to regulate the conditions of employment and the terms of compensation of those employed in public service. It has already been established that plaintiffs cannot rely on the \u201cmust be accompanied by comparable new advantages\u201d language in <em>Allen v. Board of Administration, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 114, 120, to frustrate the application to them of the Pension Reform Act\u2019s redefinition of \u201ccompensation earnable.\u201d It has also been shown that plaintiffs adopt an unrealistic notion of the immutability of employees\u2019 \u201cvested\u201d rights. Plaintiffs obviously do not assert that the entirety of their contracts of employment have been extinguished. Although plaintiffs do not develop the point, they implicitly assert that their contracts of employment were substantially impaired by (1) the amendment of section 31461 by the Pension Reform Act, and (2) the December 18, 2012 policy change by MCERA. They challenge only one aspect of how they have been compensated, insisting they have a constitutionally protected right to continue using the old definition of \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d when their pension benefits are calculated, and that right will be substantially impaired if the current version of section 31461 is enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The dispositive issue is one of degree only. The extent of the new rule of section 31461 is quite modest, as is the scope of the parties\u2019 disagreement. The parties accept that the catalyst for the Pension Reform Act was dire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>financial predictions necessitating urgent and fundamental changes to improve the solvency of various pension systems, including CERL. They do not dispute that the Legislature\u2019s intent in amending section 31461 was to make it illegal after January 1, 2013, for the enumerated items and payments to figure in compensation earnable and the calculation of final compensation. And plaintiffs concede in their opening brief that MCERA\u2019s change of policy is purely prospective: MCERA \u201cis applying its policy only to compensation earned after January 1, 2013, meaning that if a member\u2019s final compensation period includes pay periods before 2013, the excluded pay items would be included in pension calculations for those pay periods.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, all the parties agree the Pension Reform Act does not prohibit public employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>from receiving \u201ccompensation\u201d from items and payments enumerated in subdivision (b) of section 31461.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">So, whatever moral opprobrium it attached to \u201cpension spiking,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Legislature\u2019s \u201creform\u201d was hardly one-sided. The amendment of section 31461 had no immediate adverse financial impact on employees (save those planning imminent retirement, a group from which plaintiffs exclude themselves) because the items and payments listed in subdivision (b) could still be pocketed as compensation. Those years where employees had received the now prohibited payments would not be erased but would still be included by MCERA in the employees\u2019 compensation earnable and final compensation, the basic units of pension computation. In light of the unquestioned need for change, we conclude this one was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The very careful examination we have given to the parties\u2019 extensive briefing convinces us that plaintiffs are unable to overcome too many fundamental and established principles. Understandably, they focused on what they have lost. This has caused them to lose focus on the essential bilateral nature of the problem. Plaintiffs\u2019 insistence on retaining their claimed \u201cvested rights\u201d measured by the former version of section 31461 and <em>Ventura County </em>(see fns. 14 &amp; 22, <em>ante) </em>has hindered their appreciation of how that right is only to a \u201creasonable\u201d pension, that the public employee \u201cdoes not have a right to any fixed or definite benefits\u201d that may be \u201cfixed by the specific terms of the legislation during any particular period.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 unbending resistance to the new section 31461 betrays an inability to accept that \u201cstatutory language is subject to the implied qualification that the governing body may make modifications and changes in the system.\u201d <em>(Kern v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 848, 855.) The qualification \u201cis a necessary one since pension systems must be kept flexible to permit adjustments in accord with changing conditions and at the same time maintain the integrity of the system.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 854-855; accord, <em>International Assn. of Firefighters v. City of San Diego, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 292, 300-301; <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Restricting their unyielding focus to only their \u201cvested rights\u201d has led plaintiffs to pay insufficient attention to the ever-present possibility of legislative involvement, one of the \u201cessential attributes of sovereign power\u201d that is always to be consulted. <em>(Home Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, supra, </em>290 U.S. 398, 435; see <em>Allen v. Board of Administration, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 114, 119.) The Legislature\u2019s involvement would obviously take statutory form, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>which is relevant because \u201c \u2018[t]he terms and conditions of [public] employment are fixed by statute and not by contract. . . . The statutory provisions controlling the terms and conditions of [public] employment cannot be circumvented by purported contracts in conflict therewith.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Henderson </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 583, 590-591 [255 P.2d 416].) Thirteen years ago this court made the same point in connection with the enforced downward adjustment of anticipated pension benefits: \u201c \u2018The contractual basis of a pension right is the exchange of an employee\u2019s services for the pension right <em>offered by </em>. . . statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Retirement Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th 426, 447, italics added.) We also left no doubt that private agreement could not substitute: \u201cthe determination of what items were to be included in \u2018compensation earnable,\u2019 ... is <em>not </em>subject to a contract right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 453.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Plaintiffs make no real effort to demonstrate why the Pension Reform Act\u2019s modification of the definition of compensation earnable does not \u201cbear some material relation to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation\u201d <em>(Allen v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 128, 131), or is not a \u201creasonable modification\u201d of the pension system projected to plunge into a fiscal and actuarial abyss. (See <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 816.) Plaintiffs make numerous references to <em>In re Retirement Cases, </em>but they ignore our statement that statutory changes to \u201cthe determination of what items were to be included in \u2018compensation earnable is <em>not </em>subject to a contract right.\u201d <em>(In re Retirement Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th 426, 453.) Perhaps because they believe the 1983 <em>Allen </em>decision requires that there must first be a quid pro quo, plaintiffs do not mention the economic storm clouds that attended enactment of the Pension Reform Act, or how their presence was perceived by the Legislature as a spur to fundamental change. Repeated invocation of the inviolability of their \u201cvested rights\u201d cannot substitute for analysis of just how the change to section 31461 demonstrates that employees will not retire with a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d pension. (See <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Board of Administration, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 859, 863; <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 816; <em>Wallace v. City of Fresno, supra, </em>42 Cal.2d 180, 183; <em>Kern v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 848, 855.) Unfortunately, the exercise of that power can be a harsh reminder to employees that \u201c \u2018a public pension system is subject to the implied qualification that the governing body may make reasonable modifications and changes before the pension becomes payable and that until that time the employee does not have a right to any fixed or definite benefits\u2019 \u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>at p. 816), which can mean that \u201cany one or more of the various benefits . . . may be wholly eliminated prior to the time they become payable,\u201d so long as \u201cthe employee retains the right to a substantial pension\u201d <em>(Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 212, 218).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">In the circumstances presented, plaintiffs have failed \u201cto make out a clear case, free from all reasonable ambiguity\u201d and \u201creasonable doubt[],\u201d that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>are the victims of a constitutional violation. <em>(Floyd v. Blanding </em>(1879) 54 Cal. 41, 43; see <em>Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. of San Diego County v. County of San Diego, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.4th 573, 578.) Put another way, after January 1, 2013, payment of any of the items specified in section 31461, subdivision (b), could not be deemed salary already earned pursuant to a contract that enjoyed constitutional protection. (See, e.g., <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 528, 566, 571; <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 815; <em>Kern v. City of Long Beach, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 848, 853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">We emphasize the limited nature of our holding. The Legislature\u2019s change to the definition of \u201ccompensation earnable\u201d was expressly made purely prospective by the Pension Reform Act. MCERA\u2019s responsive implementation was also explicitly made prospective only. (See fn. 9 and accompanying text, <em>ante.) </em>Neither altered the status of compensation or payments accrued prior to January 1, 2013: what had previously met the old definition of compensation earnable would still be included by MCERA in calculating worker pensions. Nothing in Assembly Bill 197 prevents employers from compensating employees with any of the items or payments specified in subdivision (b) of section 31461, a point on which the parties are unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Given that this case never cleared the pleading stage, we are in effect deciding an odd hybrid\u2014whether the Pension Reform Act is unconstitutional on its face as it applies to the claimed vested contractual rights of MCERA employees. That is a limited issue of legislative power considered in an undisputed factual context.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because we conclude plaintiffs had no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>rights after January 1, 2013, we have no occasion to consider whether any other modification effected by Assembly Bill 197 qualifies as a reasonable alteration of employee contractual or pension rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-8\">Kline, P.

The volatility of the cost of these pensions has caused extreme stress on the budgets of many of these entities.\u201d (Marin County Civil Grand Jury, The Bloated Retirement Plans of Marin County, Its Cities and Towns (May 9, 2005) p. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">Six years later, the grand jury reported that the chickens were coming home to roost, and were in part responsible for current financial difficulties: \u201cDuring the financial fiasco of 2008 and 2009, the Marin County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association\u2019s (MCERA) net assets . . . declined by . . . 25.5% . . . due to investment losses.

Under current actuarial assumptions, it is projected that the County of Marin will experience an approximately 40% increase in employer pension contribution rates in FY 2010-11 .... This represefnts an increased General Fund cost of approximately $11.4 million next fiscal year, the most significant component of the County\u2019s estimated $15 million structural gap for FY 2010-11. Employer costs will continue to rise in subsequent years barring a significant rebound in investment earnings.\u201d (Marin County Civil Grand Jury, Public $ector Pensions: A Perspective, <em>supra, </em>at p. 7.) The grand jury also noted the county\u2019s \u201cAnnual Financial Report,\u201d which had concluded that employee compensation and pension costs were likely to endure beyond stock market fluctuations: \u201c \u2018Public pensions are ... a significant factor contributing to the projected budget shortfall. . . .

This increase may expose the citizens of Marin County to additional tax burdens to cover the unfunded costs and may place the future financial viability of the pension plans at significant risk. Additionally, such an impact may impair' the governments\u2019 ability to provide the broad range of essential services that citizens are expecting; instead those funds may be used to pay for employee pensions.\u201d (Marin County Civil Grand Jury, Pension Enhancements: A Case of Government Code Violations and A Lack of Transparency (2015) p. 2.)

Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of compensation earnable under section 31461 as it read in 1997 <em>(Ventura County, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 483), plaintiffs assert: \u201cCERL retirement boards do not have complete discretion over what can [be] considered compensation earnable. <em>Ventura </em>makes clear that before A.B. 197, compensation paid in cash and which was not overtime was required to be included as compensation earnable. And while it is true that the retirement boards have some discretion to interpret and apply CERL\u2014for example, they have the discretion to include as compensation earnable items not required to be included by CERL [citation]\u2014this discretion is limited by the contours of the statute and the constitution, including the Contracts Clause. Even if it were a discretionary decision for Marin CERA to include these various payments as compensation earnable\u2014which Appellants maintain it was not, because CERL required these payments to be considered compensation earnable\u2014once Marin CERA established their inclusion as paid of the pension system, members earned a vested right to the continuation of that benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of compensation earnable in <em>Ventura County, </em>as plaintiffs note, antedated enactment of the Pension Reform Act. Given that \u201c[a]n opinion is not authority for a point not raised, considered, or resolved therein\u201d <em>(Styne </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 42, 57 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 14, 26 P.3d 343]), <em>Ventura County </em>would appear to have little, if any, relevance to the scope and meaning of the subsequently amended language of section 31461 we are considering here. The utility of <em>Ventura County </em>is also weakened because none of the words \u201cconstitution,\u201d \u201ccontract,\u201d or \u201cimpair'\u201d were used in the opinion, so it is no authority for an unchanging constitutional dimension to a statute as substantially amended as was section 31461. The permanence plaintiffs attribute to MCERA\u2019s exercise of discretion in allowing certain payments to be included in compensation earnable is troubling because it seems to deny MCERA the discretion to change that decision. Plaintiffs also seem to believe that discretion once granted by a statute cannot thereafter be withdrawn. But that is indisputably what the Legislature accomplished with the addition of subdivision (b) to section 31461 and the command that \u201c \u2018Compensation earnable\u2019 does not include, <em>in any </em>case\u201d (italics added). At that point\u2014subject to section 31542, subdivision (c), quoted at footnote 5, ante\u2014MCERA\u2019s discretion disappeared because, as we have held, there is no discretion to act \u201ccontrary to specific statutory command\u201d <em>(Karuk Tribe of Northern California </em>v. <em>California Regional Water Quality Control Bd., North Coast Region </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 330, 363, fn. 25 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 40]), and because \u201cthe determination of what items were to be included in \u2018compensation earnable is <em>not </em>subject to a contract right.\u201d <em>(In re Retirement Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th 426, 453.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\"> See footnotes 2, 6, <em>ante. </em>At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel vehemently insisted this term should be confined to those employees looking only to artificially inflate their' pensions on the eve of retirement and had no application to his clients. The plain implication is that none of the individual plaintiffs plan to stop working in the immediate future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> In the final two pages of their brief, and without providing much detail, plaintiffs maintain the allegations of their petition can be \u201cfleshed out\u201d to \u201cestablish a right to the continued calculation of their pension benefits under equitable estoppel theories,\u201d which forms the basis for their' conclusion that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion by refusing to grant leave to amend.\u201d Plaintiffs are defeated by three firmly established and interlocking principles, all of which are found in a 1979 decision by our Supreme Court, a decision unusually apposite because it involved a county employee\u2019s rejected claim for overtime pay that was initially allowed by statute, but thereafter cancelled by statute prior to the employee\u2019s retirement: <em>Longshore </em>v. <em>County of Ventura </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 14 [157 Cal.Rptr. 706, 598 P.2d 866], The first principle is \u201c[a] public employee is entitled only to such compensation as is expressly and specifically provided by law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 22-23.) The second, \u201c[t]he statutory compensation rights of public employees are strictly limited and cannot be altered or enlarged by conflicting agreements between the public agency and its employee.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 23.) And the third, \u201cno court has expressly invoked principles of estoppel to contravene directly any statutory or constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28.) The employee\u2019s attempt to recover compensation failed because \u201c[application of estoppel to enlarge [the employee\u2019s] . . . retroactive compensation . . . would effectively purport to enforce an employment contract in contravention of law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Any promises or representations made to plaintiffs could have no validity if contrary to plain statutory language forbidding what plaintiffs wish to have recognized. As we said in 1959, \u201cthere is no estoppel to prove illegality.\u201d <em>(Holland </em>v. <em>Morgan &amp; Peacock Properties </em>(1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 206, 211 [335 P.2d 769].) Indeed, even if the agreements and understandings had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>been reduced to writing, this court has recognized that they could not displace clear statutory language or delay its implementation. (See <em>In re Retirement Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th 426, 453 [\u201cthe determination of what items [are] to be included in \u2018compensation earnable\u2019 ... is <em>not </em>subject to a contract right\u201d]; <em>id, </em>at p. 447 [\u201c \u2018The contractual basis of a pension right is the exchange of an employee\u2019s services for the pension right <em>offered by .. . statute\u2019 </em>\u201d (italics added)].) In these circumstances, MCERA could never have the authority to create a right to receive pension benefits. (E.g., <em>City of San Diego </em>v. <em>Haas </em>(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 472, 495 [143 Cal.Rptr.3d 438] [\u201conly the [legislative body] has the power to grant employee benefits, and [the retirement association] exceeds its authority when it attempts to \u2018expand pension benefits\u2019 beyond those the [legislative body] has granted\u201d (italics omitted)]; cf. <em>Miller, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 808, 814 [Legislature\u2019s power to control \u201c \u2018the terms and conditions of civil service employment cannot be circumvented by purported contracts in conflict therewith\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Retired Employees Assn. of Orange County, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Orange </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1171, 1176 [134 Cal.Rptr.3d 779, 266 P.3d 287] [\u201ca county may be bound by an implied contract ... if there is no legislative prohibition against such arrangements, such as a statute or ordinance\u201d], 1183 [\u201cas long as there is no statutory prohibition against such an agreement\u201d].) Plaintiffs would have this court elevate private agreement over public policy, frustrating lawfully enacted legislation that in plain effect declared such agreement illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">In sum, even if plaintiffs could present allegations establishing a factual basis for a nonconstitutional estoppel (see <em>Medina </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th 864, 871), the legal hurdles for success are insurmountable. This is a situation where the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claim is clear, but there can be no liability on that claim as a matter of law. Accordingly, there could be no prejudicial error in denying plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to set up an estoppel that would prevent MCERA from implementing and enforcing the new definition of compensation earnable set out in subdivision (b) of section 31461. (See <em>Schonfeldt </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1465 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 464] [\u201cIf there is no liability as a matter of law, leave to amend should not be granted\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
