(Minor), a ward of the juvenile court, appeals a dispositional order continuing her wardship, removing her from parental custody, committing her to the San Mateo County juvenile rehabilitation facility, the Margaret J. Kemp Camp for Girls (Girls Camp), and imposing various conditions of probation. The sole focus of her appeal is on whether six of these probation conditions are facially unconstitutional for vagueness. We vacate one of the challenged conditions and modify two others, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">In August 2014, Minor, then 17 years old, was arrested following a joyriding incident involving a stolen car. According to the probation report, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>California Highway Patrol officer spotted the car driving erratically on Highway 101 and initiated a traffic stop, but the car accelerated to a speed exceeding 90 miles per hour and eventually crashed along the side of a freeway off-ramp. Appellant and two friends emerged from the car. The two others, one of whom was Minor\u2019s boyfriend, Eduardo F., fled the scene, but Minor was arrested. Minor falsely reported to the arresting officer that she had been driving. The officer determined that Eduardo F. had been driving, which was confirmed when, following Eduardo F.\u2019s later arrest, he admitted to having been the driver. There was also evidence that, before the crash, Minor had been drinking. Following her arrest, she submitted to a blood test, which showed a blood-alcohol level of 0.01 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Based on this incident, the district attorney filed a petition under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging Minor with stealing a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a)), driving a vehicle with wanton disregard for the safety of others (Veh. Code, \u00a7 2800.2), possession of stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496, subd. (a)), selling a vehicle without the vehicle registration number (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10751, subd. (a)), displaying a false license plate (Veh. Code, \u00a7 4463, subd. (a)(1)), resisting a peace officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148, subd. (a)(1)), possessing burglary tools (Pen. Code, \u00a7 466), giving false information to a peace officer (Veh. Code, \u00a7 31), and falsely reporting a crime to a peace officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148.5, subd. (a)). Minor admitted two misdemeanor counts (resisting arrest, and falsely reporting a crime) and the remaining counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In August and September 2014, the juvenile court sustained the section 602 petition, as modified, and declared Minor to be a ward of the court with a maximum confinement time of 14 months, detaining her in the custody of her mother, and imposing various conditions of probation. Among the conditions of probation was a curfew requiring Minor to be home between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.; a stay-away order barring Minor from seeing Eduardo E; a ban on possession or use of alcohol, drugs or tobacco (the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban); a ban on possession of drug paraphernalia (the Drug Paraphernalia Ban); and a requirement that Minor attend school regularly (the School Attendance Requirement). For the first 30 days of Minor\u2019s wardship, the court placed her under house arrest in her mother\u2019s home, subject to electronic monitoring (the Electronic Monitoring Condition). Minor was directed to \u201cobey all rules and regulations of the Electronic Monitoring Program,\u201d and, while she was subject to electronic monitoring, the probation department was given discretion to detain her for up to five days in juvenile hall for any \u201cviolation of Court orders or the Electronic Monitoring Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Within three weeks of the declaration of her wardship, according to a probation report, Minor left her mother\u2019s home without permission and cut her electronic monitoring bracelet from her ankle. As a result, she was charged in a second section 602 petition with misdemeanor vandalism, and in a section <em>111 </em>notice of probation violation she was charged with violating the terms of her probation. On November 5, 2014, Minor admitted the vandalism allegation, and her maximum confinement time was extended to 18 months. Minor was detained in juvenile hall for 27 days, and ordered to participate in family preservation services so that she and her mother could receive counseling assistance designed to facilitate successful at-home completion of her probation. The Electronic Monitoring Condition, which was limited by its terms to a 30-day period, was vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Upon a referral from the probation department based on a report that Minor left her mother\u2019s home in violation of her curfew, on March 19, 2015, Minor was found to have violated her probation. The court ordered 30 days of detention in juvenile hall and committed Minor to the G.I.R.L.S. Program, an out-of-home placement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but stayed the G.I.R.L.S. Program commitment in order to give Minor another chance to demonstrate that she could meet the terms of her probation while detained at home. At the section <em>111 </em>hearing, in light of the reportedly strained relationship between Minor and her mother, the court ordered mediation in addition to the previously ordered family preservation services.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In April 2015, according to a probation report, Minor left her mother\u2019s home in violation of her curfew again, this time for a period of several days. After finding Minor to be in violation of her probation, on June 15, 2015, the juvenile court determined that in-home detention had failed, removed Minor from her mother\u2019s custody, and ordered her into the G.I.R.L.S. Program at Girls Camp (the June 15 Dispositional Order). The June 15 Dispositional Order was structured to anticipate what would occur once Minor completed phase one of the G.I.R.L.S. Program. When released from Girls Camp, Minor was to begin phase two of the G.I.R.L.S. Program and was to return to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>mother\u2019s custody, but would remain subject to the conditions of probation that were originally imposed on her in September 2014, with some additions and modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Several of the added conditions in the June 15 Dispositional Order focused on alcohol and drug use and on Internet activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To prevent interference with chemical testing for drug usage, Minor was barred from \u201cconsuming] any poppy seed products or other substances known to adulterate or interfere with chemical testing\u201d (the Poppy Seed Products Ban). To track Minor\u2019s Internet activities, the court imposed an electronic search condition requiring Minor to surrender, upon demand by her probation officer or a peace officer, all encryption keys or passwords to electronic devices used by her. And to prevent deletion of digital data from any of her electronic devices, the court ordered that \u201d[t]he Minor shall not possess or utilize any program or application, on any electronic data storage device, that automatically or through a remote command deletes data from that device\u201d (the Data Deletion Tools Ban).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The June 15 Dispositional Order also reinstated the Electronic Monitoring Condition, placing Minor under electronically monitored house arrest for at least 30 days following her release from Girls Camp. Minor\u2019s probation officer was given discretion, as appropriate, to extend the time Minor will be subject to the electronic monitoring, to detain Minor at Girls Camp for violation of electronic monitoring program rules, to lift or impose house arrest, and to adjust Minor\u2019s curfew. The June 2015 Dispositional Order stated: \u2018\u201cDuring the Minor\u2019s time in the Girls Program, the probation officer has the discretion ... to place the Minor on and vacate the Electronic Monitoring Program, ... or House Arrest/Supervision, and to impose or adjust a curfew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Minor timely appealed, and now argues that the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban, the Drug Paraphernalia Ban, the Poppy Seed Products Ban, the Electronic Monitoring Condition, the Data Deletion Tools Ban, and the School Attendance Requirement are unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>II.

When <em>Sheena K </em>review is undertaken, it is important to bear in mind that not all cases of facial vagueness are cases of <em>unconstitutional </em>vagueness, involving language so obscure that it fails to give fair warning of potential violation. Context matters, even in a facial challenge. \u2018\u201cIn deciding the adequacy of any notice afforded those bound by a legal restriction, we are guided by the principles that \u2018abstract legal commands must be applied in a specific context,\u2019 and that, although not admitting of \u2018mathematical certainty,\u2019 the language used must have \u2018 <em>\u201creasonable </em>specificity.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Thus, the void for vagueness doctrine does not apply simply \u201c \u2018 \u201cbecause there may be difficulty in determining whether some marginal or hypothetical act is covered by [the challenged] language.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 593, 606 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 753, 170 R3d 129]; see also <em>Tapia, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 1167 [\u201cThe fact that a statute contains \u2018one or more ambiguities requiring interpretation does not make the statute unconstitutionally vague on its face\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People v.

[even where it is] easy to conjure them up . . . .\u201d].) The meaning of a challenged condition will often be plain enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>when its language is considered as a whole, together with related conditions, against the backdrop of governing law, or with reference to other aids to practical construction. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 615, 630 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] <em>{Lopez) </em>[\u201ca statute \u2018will not be held void for vagueness \u201cif any reasonable and practical construction can be given its language or if its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">B. <em>The Omission of an Express Scienter Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">With one exception (her challenge to the School Attendance Requirement), Minor bases her appeal on a single argument: Because five of the challenged probation conditions in this case lack an express scienter requirement, she contends we must add one by modification. Relying primarily on <em>Kevin F, supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th 351, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Freitas </em>(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 747 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 51] <em>{Freitas), </em>she argues that a knowledge requirement \u201cshould not be left to implication.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 97, 102 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 340]; see <em>Sheena K. supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890.) In her view, <em>Kevin F </em>and <em>Freitas </em>correctly apply <em>Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at page 890, our Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decision addressing \u201cthe need for a scienter clause in probation cases.\u201d Without an express scienter requirement, she argues, she might innocently and inadvertently violate her probation. (See <em>Pirali, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.4th at p. 1352; <em>People v. Kim </em>(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 836, 843 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 599] <em>{Kim); Victor L., supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at p. 912.) With respect to each of the five conditions she challenges for lack of an express scienter requirement, Minor claims there is no need to resort to the specific facts of her situation. Each condition challenged on this ground \u201cis either constitutional or unconstitutional [on its face] in every juvenile case,\u201d without reference to the individualized circumstances that drove its imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">By way of response, the Attorney General contends we should follow <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaines </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1035 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 842] <em>{Gaines), </em>review granted and opinion superseded February 17, 2016, S231723, and imply a scienter requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See also <em>People v. Appleton </em>(20160 245 Cal.App.4th 717, 728 [199 Cal.Rptr.3d 637]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Contreras </em>(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 868, 887 [188 Cal.Rptr.3d 698]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1186 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 437] <em>{Moore).) </em>Under this line of authority, we are told, so long as the proscribed conduct is described with sufficient clarity\u2014which the Attorney General contends is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>case for each of the conditions challenged as lacking an express knowledge requirement\u2014the \u201cwillfulness\u201d standard in probation revocation proceedings provides adequate protection against unwitting violation. Reminding us that <em>Sheena K </em>\u201crecognized a limited class of claims [eligible to be] raised ... for the first time on appeal,\u201d the Attorney General argues that <em>Sheena K </em>review for facial vagueness is subject to \u201cthe overriding principle\u201d that \u201c \u2018discretion to excuse forfeiture <em>should be exercised rarely </em>and only in cases presenting an important legal issue\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sheena K, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 888, fn. 7, italics added). Here, the Attorney General contends, Minor\u2019s claims of facial unconstitutionality raise no such issue, and in any event cannot be resolved without reference to the facts and circumstances surrounding the imposition of these conditions on Minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The Attorney General insists that <em>Gaines, </em>not <em>Kevin F, </em>\u201cprovides the better rule.\u201d \u201cUntil our Supreme Court rules differently, we will follow its lead on this point\u201d <em>(Pirali, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.4th at p. 1351), which may be found in <em>Sheena K, </em>as we explained in <em>Kevin F </em>In the meantime, we will concern ourselves here only with the narrower question of whether, under the cases calling for the addition of an explicit knowledge requirement, of which <em>Kevin F </em>is but a recent example, such a modification is warranted by the particular phrasing of the conditions presented for review. Under <em>Sheena K, </em>\u201can appellate claim\u2014amounting to a \u2018facial challenge\u2019\u2014that phrasing or language of a probation condition is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because, for example, of the absence of a requirement of knowledge . . . , does not require scrutiny of individual facts and circumstances but instead requires the review of abstract and generalized legal concepts,\u201d which is \u201ca task that is well suited to the role of an appellate court.\u201d <em>(Sheena K, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 885.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In undertaking <em>Sheena K </em>review here, it is important to note that, even where a challenged probation condition is phrased in language raising genuine due process concerns, the addition of an express knowledge requirement may not be adequate or appropriately fitted to the task of curing vagueness. \u201cThough in some situations, a scienter requirement may mitigate\u201d lack of fair warning due to vagueness, \u201csuch a requirement will not cure all defects for all purposes . . . .\u201d (Lay, <em>supra, </em>237 F.3d at p. 265.) That is why in <em>Kevin F, </em>recognizing that facial vagueness is context sensitive, we declined to take a categorical approach to the express scienter issue in probation conditions cases, either always dispensing with the need for scienter language on grounds it is unnecessary, or always finding it to be required. <em>(Kevin F., supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at p. 362, fn. 5.) Instead, we saw a need to evaluate each challenged probation condition as it comes to us, on a case-by-case basis. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We now turn to specific consideration of the probation conditions challenged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>C. <em>Condition-by-condition Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">1. <em>The Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The juvenile court ordered that \u2018\u201c[t]he Minor is not to use, possess, or be under the influence of any alcoholic beverages, controlled substances, or tobacco, including electronic cigarettes.\u201d We see no need to add an express scienter requirement here. For the most part, the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban simply implements applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">With respect to alcohol, \u2018\u201cany person under 21 years of age who purchases any alcoholic beverage ... is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 25658; see also Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22 [\u201cno person shall sell, furnish, give, or cause to be sold, furnished, or given away any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of 21 years, and no person under the age of 21 years shall purchase any alcoholic beverage\u201d].) Similarly, pursuant to recent statutory amendments, it generally is illegal to sell or distribute tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, to persons under 21 years of age (raised from the previous age limit of 18 years of age). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 308, subd. (a)(1)(A)(i), (f); Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22950.5, subd. (d), 22950 et seq., commonly known as the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement Act (STAKE Act) [regulating the manner in which tobacco products may be sold and distributed and prohibiting such sales and distribution to persons under 21 years of age]; Stats. 2016, 2nd Ex. Sess. 2015-2016, chs. 7 &amp; 8, eff. June 9, 2016.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The prohibition on possession and use of alcohol in the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban is readily understandable to the average juvenile, in our view. Among young people Minor\u2019s age, we believe these age minimums are so well known that there is no need for any express scienter requirement. Under the \u201cfundamental principle that, in the absence of specific language to the contrary, ignorance of a law is not a defense to a charge of its violation\u201d <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 396 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 590, 592-593 [186 Cal.Rptr. 485, 652 P.2d 42]), Minor can be expected to abide by the law applicable to her. Indeed, one of the other conditions imposed on her\u2014a condition that she does not challenge\u2014requires her to \u201cobey all laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">With respect to controlled substances, the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Health and Safety Code section 11000 et seq., broadly prohibits the transportation, sale and possession of controlled substances so as to protect the health and safety of all persons within this state, except as permitted by prescription, license or other statutory authorization. (See, e.g., Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11350, 11351, 11352.) \u201cCase law has construed these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>statutes as including implicit knowledge elements. \u2018[A]lthough criminal statutes prohibiting the possession, transportation, or sale of a controlled substance do not expressly contain an element that the accused be aware of the character of the controlled substance at issue ([Health &amp; Saf. Code,] \u00a7\u00a7 11350-11352, 11357-11360, 11377-11379), such a requirement has been implied by the courts.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The essential elements of unlawful possession of a controlled substance are \u201cdominion and control of the substance in a quantity usable for consumption or sale, with knowledge of its presence and of its restricted dangerous drug character.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Although the possess- or\u2019s knowledge of the presence of the controlled substance and its nature as a restricted dangerous drug must be shown, no further showing of a subjective mental state is required.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 578, 593 [166 Cal.Rptr.3d 187] <em>{Rodriguez) </em>[\u201cTo the extent condition 8 reinforces defendant\u2019s obligations under the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act, the same knowledge element which has been found to be implicit in those statutes is reasonably implicit in the condition. What is implicit is that possession of a controlled substance involves the mental elements of knowing of its presence and of its nature as a restricted substance.\u201d]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Nice </em>(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 928, 945-946 [202 Cal.Rptr.3d 860].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><em>Rodriguez </em>adopted the implied scienter analysis of <em>Kim, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.4th at page 847. In <em>Kim, </em>the challenged probation condition, a lifetime ban on possession of weapons and ammunition, expressly referenced Penal Code former sections 12021 and 12316, subdivision (b), which together barred possession of firearms and ammunition by felons for life.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the appellant in <em>Kim, </em>an adult probationer who had been convicted of a felony, was already subject to these statutes, the appellate court there viewed the counterpart ban imposed as a condition of his probation as merely \u201cimplementing\u201d the statutory scheme. The court then analyzed cases applying these statutes, and concluded that \u201c[i]mplicit in the crime of possession of a firearm is that a person is aware both that the item is in his or her possession and that it is a firearm. We believe the same is true of a probation condition prohibiting possession of a firearm, and, by logical extension, possession of ammunition.\u201d <em>{Kim, supra, </em>at p. 846.) Because the \u201cconduct proscribed by [Penal Code former] sections 12021 and 12316 is coextensive with\u201d the challenged probation condition, the court held, the \u201cprobation condition need not be modified to add an explicit knowledge requirement.\u201d <em>{Kim, supra, </em>at p. 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">That was not the situation we addressed in <em>Kevin F </em>There, a juvenile probationer was found in section 602 proceedings to have committed robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and was placed on probation. <em>(Kevin F. supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at p. 356.) He was subject to a statutory ban on firearm possession until age 30. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 29820, subds. (a)-(c); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(3).) But the ban on weapons possession in his probation conditions went far beyond this statutory prohibition and covered conduct that, for him, was otherwise lawful. It was an extraordinarily broad prohibition, covering a wide range of conduct that might be considered innocent (\u201c \u2018You\u2019re not to possess any toys that look like weapons\u2019 \u201d) or that was difficult to know was wrongful (\u201c \u2018You are not to possess anything that . . . someone else might consider to be a weapon\u2019 \u201d). <em>(Kevin F, supra, </em>at p. 357.) Because of the sheer breadth of the ban, we modified it to require the addition of express scienter language.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Kevin F., supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at pp. 365-366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In this case, by contrast, the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban reinforces otherwise applicable statutory proscriptions. <em>Rodriguez </em>applied <em>Kim </em>to a prohibition on use and possession of controlled substances even though the probation condition at issue did not, in express terms, incorporate specific sections of the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act. We take the same approach here. When read against the backdrop of applicable law, the meaning of the prohibition on possession and use of \u201calcoholic beverages\u201d and \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d is plain enough without an express scienter requirement. (See <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.4th at p. 593; <em>Kim, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.4th at p. 847.) It may be, to be sure, that the antismoking clause of the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban\u2014barring Minor from possessing or using \u201ctobacco, including electronic cigarettes\u201d\u2014goes beyond otherwise applicable law. When the June 15 Dispositional Order issued, electronic cigarettes were not defined as regulated \u201ctobacco products\u201d in Penal Code section 308 and the STAKE Act, and Minor had turned 18 by then. But even assuming that, absent the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban, Minor was free to buy and smoke cigarettes and electronic cigarettes when the June 15 Dispositional Order issued, we are satisfied there is no due process problem here. The anti-smoking clause of the Alcohol, Drugs and Smoking Ban is phrased in terms that are specific and clear enough so that an express scienter requirement is not needed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Minor relies heavily on <em>Freitas, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th 747, a case involving a probation condition prohibiting \u201c \u2018possession,] . . . custody or control\u2019 \u201d of \u201c \u2018firearms or ammunition.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 750, fn. omitted.) In that case, a panel of the Third District Court of Appeal required the addition of express scienter language to cure facially unconstitutional vagueness. Minor points to the observation in <em>Freitas </em>that \u201cwithout the addition of a scienter requirement, [the probationer] could be found in violation of probation if he merely borrows a car and, unbeknownst to him, a vehicle owner\u2019s lawfully obtained gun is in the trunk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 752.) We do not think an imagined scenario in which a probationer unknowingly comes into possession of some prohibited item warrants the addition of an express scienter requirement in all circumstances. The holding in <em>Freitas </em>is not that broad when read with its facts in mind. There, the language of the condition at issue included constructive possession wording (\u201c \u2018possession,] . . . custody or control\u2019 \u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at p. 750, fn. omitted.) Evidently, the <em>Freitas </em>court saw a need to mitigate the potential that that particular language might have the effect of charging the probationer with the knowledge and responsibility of third parties in some circumstances. None of the probation conditions at issue in this appeal includes constructive possession language presenting any similar concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">2. <em>The Drug Paraphernalia Ban</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The Drug Paraphernalia Ban provides that \u201c[t]he Minor shall not possess any drug paraphernalia.\u201d As we shall explain, this condition does not simply implement a statutory prohibition. And in light of the breadth of the Drug Paraphernalia Ban, we conclude that the addition of an express knowledge requirement is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Under Health and Safety Code section 11014.5, subdivision (a), \u201c \u2018Drug paraphernalia\u2019 means all equipment, products and materials of any kind which are designed for use or marketed for use, in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repackaging, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance . . . .\u201d The statute provides a nonexclusive list of items that qualify as drug paraphernalia, and specifies factors a court or other authority may consider in determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11014.5, subds. (a), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Other provisions of the Health and Safety Code prohibit possession of such items under certain circumstances, but those provisions are not coextensive with the prohibition on simple possession of all \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d set forth in the Drug Paraphernalia Ban. First, Health and Safety Code section 11364.7, subdivision (a) criminalizes possession of \u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d but it also requires a further specific intent to \u201cdeliver, furnish, or transfer.\u201d It provides: \u201cExcept as authorized by law, any person who delivers, furnishes, or transfers, <em>possesses with intent to deliver, furnish, or transfer, </em>or manufactures with the intent to deliver, furnish, or transfer, drug paraphernalia, knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, that it will be used to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance, except as provided in subdivision (b), in violation of this division, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11364.7, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Second, Health and Safety Code section 11364, subdivision (a) prohibits possession of some, but not all, types of drug paraphernalia. That subdivision states that \u201c[i]t is unlawful to possess an opium pipe or any device, contrivance, instrument, or paraphernalia used for unlawfully <em>injecting or smoking </em>(1) a controlled substance specified in subdivision (b), (c), or (e) or paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of Section 11054, specified in paragraph (14), (15), or (20) of subdivision (d) of Section 11054, specified in subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 11055, or specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 11055, or (2) a controlled substance that is a narcotic drug classified in Schedule III, IV, or V.\u201d (Italics added.) Not every drug or controlled substance is covered by Health and Safety Code section 11364. For example, marijuana is not one of the substances listed in Health and Safety Code section 11364, subdivision (a). (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11054, subd. (d)(13) [marijuana].) An appellate court has held that the possession of a device for smoking marijuana, without more, is not a crime in California. <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>Johnny O. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 888, 897 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 471].) Moreover, Health and Safety Code section 11364, subdivision (a) does not cover paraphernalia used for introducing a drug into a human body by means other than injecting or smoking, such as snorting or inhaling. Because Health and Safety Code sections 11364 and 11364.7 do not prohibit simple possession of all drug paraphernalia, \u2018\u201c[t]his is not a situation in which it is possible to infer that a probation condition has the same implicit mental element as the penal statutes it was written to enforce.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carreon </em>(2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 866, 882 [203 Cal.Rptr.3d 857] [distinguishing <em>Kim </em>and <em>Rodriguez].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Instead, the Drug Paraphernalia Ban is similar to the weapons prohibition at issue in <em>Kevin F., </em>which provided in part that the probationer could not \u201c \u2018possess anything that [he] could use as a weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kevin E., supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at pp. 357, 360.) That condition was \u2018\u201cbroad enough to include any object that <em>could </em>injure someone, even an ordinary household object, regardless of [the probationer\u2019s] intent in possessing it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 360.) In light of the wide array of items that could be considered weapons, we concluded addition of an express knowledge requirement (specifying in part that the minor could not knowingly possess anything that he intended to use as a weapon) was necessary to provide adequate notice of the prohibited conduct and to protect against unwitting violations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 360-361, 365-366.) We concluded \u2018\u201cthe probationer must engage in the proscribed conduct <em>knowingly </em>(i.e., with actual intent and understanding that he possesses something constituting a weapon).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 365.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Drug Paraphernalia Ban here is similarly open-ended. Common household items that are needed for or associated with drug use arguably could constitute \u2018\u201cdrug paraphernalia,\u201d and thus could fall within the Drug Paraphernalia Ban even if Minor possessed them for legitimate purposes and was ignorant of their use as drug paraphernalia. As noted, a broad prohibition on Minor\u2019s possession of ordinary objects that it is lawful for her to own \u2018\u201cimpacts the constitutional right to possess property.\u201d <em>(People v. Contreras, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.4th at p. 888.) For these reasons, we conclude it is necessary to modify the Drug Paraphernalia Ban to prohibit only knowing conduct\u2014Minor \u201cmust engage in the proscribed conduct <em>knowingly </em>(i.e., with actual intent and understanding that [she] possesses something constituting [drug paraphernalia]).\u201d <em>(Kevin F., supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at p. 365.) We will modify the Drug Paraphernalia Ban to state: \u201cThe Minor shall not possess any item that she knows is drug paraphernalia.\u201d Under this revised condition, if Minor possesses a common item that has a legitimate purpose but she is unaware it is intended for use as drug paraphernalia by someone, she will not be in violation of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>3. <em>The Poppy Seed Products Ban</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Poppy Seed Products Ban bars Minor from \u2018\u201cconsuming] any poppy seed products or other substances known to adulterate or interfere with chemical testing.\u201d We see no need for an express scienter requirement here.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We are satisfied that the meaning of this clause is sufficiently comprehensible for an average 18 year old bound by it to understand. Reading the Poppy Seed Products Ban in its proper context\u2014together with the probation condition subjecting Minor to drug testing on demand (a condition she does not challenge), and keeping in mind the references to \u2018\u201cadulterating] or interfering] with chemical testing\u201d\u2014it is clearly designed to <em>protect </em>Minor from violating her probation based on false positive drug test results. The wording could have been more precise, since the person to whom the effect of poppy seed products or other adulterating foods on drug testing must be \u2018\u201cknown\u201d is not clear. But despite that ambiguity, we think the meaning of the prohibition is clear enough to avoid due process concerns. In conducting a review for facial vagueness, we do not require optimum precision and exactitude. \u2018\u201cCondemned to the use of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language.\u201d <em>(Grayned v. City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 110 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Given its context and purpose (see <em>Lopez, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 630), we think the wording of the Poppy Seed Products Ban adequately conveys the message to an ordinary 18 year old who knows she is subject to chemical drug testing that, for her own protection, it is her responsibility to find out what kinds of foods might cause false positive drug test results and to avoid those foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">4. <em>The Data Deletion Tools Ban</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">In an apparent effort to strengthen the electronic search condition by ensuring preservation of all of Minor\u2019s electronic communications, the juvenile court ordered that \u2018\u201cMinor shall not possess or utilize any program or application, on any electronic data storage device, that automatically or through a remote command deletes data from that device.\u201d We are constrained to conclude that this clause is unconstitutionally vague on its face, and that the addition of an express knowledge requirement will not cure the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Because all computing devices are \u2018\u201celectronic data storage devices\u201d and virtually all software programs available to consumers for those devices have the capability to \u2018\u201cautomatically\u201d delete data\u2014which is the purpose of the \u2018\u201cdelete\u201d key on any keyboard and the \u2018\u201cdelete\u201d command in any software <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>application\u2014the Data Deletion Tools Ban, plainly read, bans Minor from using or possessing any smartphone or computer. We doubt that is what the court intended, but it is the unavoidable meaning of the language used. Whether this infirmity is characterized as a problem of vagueness or of overbreadth, the Data Deletion Tools Ban, as phrased, fails to give fair warning of the scope of its prohibition. (See <em>Victor L., supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at p. 926 [striking probation condition barring all access to Internet-enabled computers on vagueness grounds, since the ban \u201ccould ensnare a minor in a claimed probation violation even if he were engaged in completely innocent and legitimate use of a computer for scholarly or job-related purposes\u201d]; <em>In re Stevens </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1239 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 168] [\u201cthe broad prohibition on use of the computer and Internet bore no relation to Stevens\u2019s conviction for child molestation and imposed a greater restriction of his rights than was reasonably necessary to accomplish the state\u2019s legitimate goal\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Perhaps the Data Deletion Tools Ban was designed to ban Minor from using apps, such as Snapchat, which allow electronic communications to be sent, received, and automatically deleted after they are read, thus effectively destroying all evidence that any communications occurred. Perhaps it was aimed at remote \u201cerase\u201d capability, which is available on many modern, cloud-enabled handheld devices such as iPhones to delete data from lost or stolen phones. Or perhaps the court had some other specific tool in mind. Rather than modify this condition on appeal in an effort to save it based on surmise, we think the better course is to vacate it and invite modification on remand by using examples designed to narrow it to its intended purpose. (See <em>Lopez, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 630 [\u201c \u2018A contextual application of otherwise unqualified legal language may supply the clue to a law\u2019s meaning, giving facially standardless language a constitutionally sufficient concreteness.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">5. <em>The Electronic Monitoring Condition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The Electronic Monitoring Condition requires Minor to \u201cobey all rules and regulations of the Electronic Monitoring Program\u201d and grants to Minor\u2019s probation officer discretion to extend the duration of electronic monitoring and to detain Minor temporarily at Girls Camp for \u201cviolating the . . . Electronic Monitoring Agreement.\u201d Nowhere are the referenced \u201crules and regulations\u201d set forth or summarized. This condition, too, is unconstitutionally vague on its face, and the addition of an express knowledge requirement will not cure the defect. Nothing on the face of the June 15 Dispositional Order, in the transcript of the hearing leading to its imposition, or anywhere else in the record, indicates that Minor was apprised of the \u201crules and regulations\u201d of the Electronic Monitoring Program, or that steps were taken to make sure she understands those rules. There are references to a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>(the \u201cElectronic Monitoring Agreement\u201d), but these references are without content and provide no guidance about where to find whatever standards of conduct that instrument may impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Attorney General asks that we presume the trial court fulfilled its duty to ensure Minor was aware of her obligations of compliance. But this appeal raises claims of facial vagueness, our review is de novo, and there is nothing in the challenged probation condition or anywhere else in the June 15 Dispositional Order to justify indulging such a presumption. Here, at least on the face of the challenged order, one can only guess at what the \u201crules and regulations\u201d of the Electronic Monitoring Program may be. The vagueness problem is exacerbated by the broad delegation of authority to Minor\u2019s probation officer. \u201cA [probation] condition with no core meaning . . . cannot be cured by allowing the probation officer an unfettered power of interpretation, as this would create one of the very problems against which the vagueness doctrine is meant to protect, i.e., the delegation of \u2018basic policy matters to policemen ... for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.\u2019 \u201d (Lay, <em>supra, </em>237 F.3d at p. 266.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Because the Electronic Monitoring Condition, on its face, is standardless, without content and potentially exposes Minor to arbitrary deprivations of her liberty, we find it to be unconstitutionally vague. We will modify it to specify that Minor shall \u201cobey all rules and regulations of the Electronic Monitoring Program, as posted on the probation department\u2019s website, as approved by the court, and as explained to her by her probation officer.\u201d (See <em>Rodriguez, supra, 222 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 586 [\u201cprobation conditions \u2018need not be spelled out in great detail in court as long as the defendant knows what they are; to require recital in court is unnecessary in view of the fact the probation conditions are spelled out in detail on the probation order,\u2019 \u201d or incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>therein by reference, \u201c \u2018and the probationer has a probation officer who can explain to him the contents of the order\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">6. <em>The School Attendance Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The School Attendance Requirement requires Minor to \u201cattend school regularly without tardiness or unexcused absence . . . and to . . . behave at all times while in school.\u201d Minor contends the word \u201cregularly\u201d renders this condition so ambiguous and susceptible of multiple meanings that it cannot be understood by an average person. She asks that we modify it to make it more precise, replacing \u201cregularly\u201d with language requiring that she \u201cattend school every day that school is in session without tardiness or unexcused absence.\u201d We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">This condition does not implicate any \u201cimportant issue of constitutional law or a substantial right.\u201d <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 887, fn. 7.) Absent a chilling effect on constitutionally protected conduct, a broadly stated prohibition phrased in inexact terms may in some instances be perfectly appropriate to use, by design, with the aim of ensuring that a probationer errs on the side of compliance. We cannot say that that approach is improper here. The manifest purpose of the School Attendance Requirement is to prohibit truancy. Read with that purpose in mind, we think its phrasing is clear enough for the target audience, an average juvenile of Minor\u2019s age, to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">III. CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The conditions of probation imposed on Minor in the June 15 Dispositional Order are modified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">(1) The condition that Minor \u201cshall not possess any drug paraphernalia\u201d is modified to state that Minor \u201cshall not possess any item that she knows is drug paraphernalia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">(2) The condition that \u201cMinor shall not possess or utilize any program or application, on any electronic data storage device, that automatically or through a remote command deletes data from that device\u201d is vacated, subject to reinstatement in narrower form should the juvenile court wish to reinstate it after further consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">(3) The condition that Minor shall \u201cobey all rules and regulations of the Electronic Monitoring Program\u201d is modified to provide that Minor shall \u201cobey all rules and regulations of the Electronic Monitoring Program, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>posted on the probation department\u2019s website, as approved by the court, and as explained to her by her probation officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Except as so modified, the June 15 Dispositional Order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b377-6\">Ruvolo, R J., and Rivera, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted October 19, 2016, S237208.

(Cf. <em>In re Shaun R. </em>(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1129, 1137 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 84] <em>(Shaun R.) </em>[in juvenile probation case where a probationer appealed from a 2009 dispositional order and sought to bring a vagueness challenge to multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>probation conditions, some of which were originally imposed in 2008 but were merely incorporated by reference in the 2009 order, the conditions imposed in 2008 were not appealable].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> The traditional test in cases involving facial vagueness challenges to legislation is often phrased as whether the language or phrasing at issue is reasonably understandable to \u201cordinary people.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Kolender, supra, </em>461 U.S. at p. 357 [\u201cthe void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\u201d]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Tapia </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1167 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 158] <em>(Tapia).) </em>More specifically stated, however, vagueness analysis looks to whether the language in question is definite enough to \u201c \u2018 \u201cprovide ... a standard of conduct <em>for those whose activities are proscribed.'\u2019 </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Garcetti </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 561, 567 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 341, 853 P.2d 507], italics added.) Thus, in a juvenile probation case, the most accurate way to frame the test for vagueness is that we must ask whether the language claimed to be vague is reasonably understandable to <em>an ordinary juvenile of the age of the minor. </em>After all, probation conditions, unlike generally applicable legislation, are in effect \u201cspecial Taws\u2019 tailored only to\u201d an individual probationer <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Toy </em>(3d Cir. 2001) 237 F.3d 251, 260 <em>(Toy)), </em>and here that person is a juvenile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> Late last year, the Supreme Court granted review in another case, presenting the same issue, from the same appellate panel that decided <em>Gaines. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1124 [187 Cal.Rptr.3d 301], review granted and opinion superseded Sept. 9, 2015, S227193.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> Those prohibitions are now contained in Penal Code sections 29800, subdivision (a)(1) and 30305, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> To the extent it covered a wide range of undefined objects and things that it was lawful for the minor to own (see <em>Kevin F., supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at p. 360, fn. 4), the challenged condition \u201cimpactfed] the constitutional right to possess property\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Contreras, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.4th at p. 888; see <em>Freitas, supra, </em>179 Cal.App.4th at p. 751; Cal.

As the People point out, a trial court may not revoke probation unless the defendant willfully violated the terms and conditions of probation.\u201d]). Although we part company with <em>Moore </em>on the latter point for the reasons explained at length in <em>Kevin F. supra. </em>239 Cal.App.4th at pages 357-362, we agree with the initial premise of its logic. It is unnecessary to add an express scienter requirement to a prohibition that is stated with reasonable clarity. The problem with the ban on weapons possession in <em>Kevin F. </em>was that it was inherently ambiguous. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\"> Health and Safety Code section 11364.5 (which generally requires any business that offers or displays \u201cdrug paraphernalia\u201d to exclude persons under 18 years of age) sets forth a similar, but not identical, definition of drug paraphernalia that applies to the term \u201c[a]s used in this section.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf.

We are not persuaded. Minor appeals from the June 15 Dispositional Order, mounts a facial challenge to the language of probation conditions imposed in that order, and the record she supplied to us\u2014which includes the June 15 Dispositional Order itself and enough of the remainder of the record to show the procedural context surrounding that order\u2014is sufficient to satisfy her burden of furnishing an adequate record supporting her appeal, as she framed it. To the extent anything in the September 22, 2014 hearing transcript might have undercut Minor\u2019s argument that her claims of vagueness are susceptible of resolution facially\u2014the Attorney General posits, for example, that there might be something in that transcript showing that the court explained the terms of the Electronic Monitoring Condition then\u2014that transcript could have been supplied by the Attorney General by counter-designation or request to augment, to show that Minor\u2019s vagueness challenges can only be resolved by reference to \u201cthe particular' sentencing record developed in the trial court . . . .\u201d <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 887.)
