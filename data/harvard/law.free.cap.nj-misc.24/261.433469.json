The determinative question is the constitutionality <em>vel non </em>of chapter 84 of <em>Pamph. L. </em>1945, the operation whereof is expressly confined to (a) cities (b) bordering' on the ocean (c) in fifth class counties (d) having a population of less than 150,000 according to the last federal census.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Without expressly adopting in its entirety the somewhat lengthy opinion of the court below, we are entirely in accordance with the finding that the classification above stated is so-restricted and tenuous as to be illusory and unconstitutional\u00bb The judgment under review is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
