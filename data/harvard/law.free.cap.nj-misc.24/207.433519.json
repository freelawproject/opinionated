The applicant did not begin office service until May 20th, 1946. He was entitled to credit on a total of twenty-four months clerkship of sixteen months attendance at law school; and consequently under the rules there should be a clear eight months of office clerkship before being admitted to the examination. The present n\u00faes do not contemplate admission of a candidate to examination until the office clerkship required by the rules has been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The application is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
