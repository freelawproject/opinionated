It is my judgment that if a notice to terminate a tenancy is to be given by either party to the other it should be given at some time during the period when the tenancy is actually in effect and not at a time when no relation of landlord and tenant exists, and apparently before it has begun to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">This view leads to a judgment setting aside the judgment of dispossession of the District Court, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
