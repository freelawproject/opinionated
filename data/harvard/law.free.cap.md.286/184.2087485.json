Section 12-1.18A imposed a duty upon the property owner\u2019s agent, or upon the property owner should an agent not be employed, to provide a prospective purchaser of realty with the opportunity to examine the Master Plan prior to entering into a contract of sale. This could be done by either (1) producing and making available for examination a copy of the Plan or (2) escorting the purchaser to a place where the Plan was available for inspection and obtaining the Plan for the purchaser\u2019s inspection. Section 12-1.18A further provided that, in the event its provisions were violated, the purchaser would have the right to terminate the contract of sale at any time prior to the conveyance of the property. The issue presented on this appeal is whether the City of Rockville had the authority to enact that part of \u00a7 12-1.18A providing that the purchaser shall have the right to terminate the contract upon a failure of the agent or the owner to comply with the duty imposed upon them. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the City of Rockville had such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The plaintiffs, John J. Dennis II and Robert S. Montgomery, real estate agents engaged in selling real estate in Rockville, and Waddell S. Taylor, a resident of Rockville, filed a bill in equity in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The plaintiffs, raising several arguments challenging the authority of the City of Rockville to enact any part of the ordinance, sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 12-1.18A was invalid as a whole and an injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance. In a decree filed October 4, 1978, the trial court (Frosh, J.) declared that \u00a7 12-1.18A was valid and constitutional in all respects. After the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, we issued a writ of certiorari prior to a decision by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In this Court, the plaintiffs concede that the City has the authority to regulate the sale of real property by enacting that part of \u00a7 12-1.18A imposing a duty upon the seller or his agent to provide the purchaser with the opportunity to examine the Master Plan. The only issue raised by the plaintiffs on this appeal, and thus the only issue decided by us, is whether the City, in order to <em>enforce </em>the ordinance, has the authority to authorize the purchaser to terminate the contract of sale in the event of a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The plaintiffs contend that the provision permitting the purchaser to terminate the contract creates a \u201cforfeiture\u201d of their contractual rights which may not be done by a municipality without express authority. In support of this contention, the plaintiffs cite the rule set forth in I J.Dillon, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 237 (5th ed. 1911), that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Moreover, the plaintiffs assert that this principle is especially applicable to forfeitures, relying primarily upon <em>Rossberg v. State, </em>111 Md. 394, 74 A. 581 (1909). The plaintiffs point out that neither the Rockville City Charter nor Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.), Art. 23A, contains express authorization to enact a forfeiture. They further point out that the charter and code provisions directly relating to the enforcement of municipal ordinances provide only for the imposition of fines and imprisonment.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, they argue that because the power to create a forfeiture was not expressly or by necessary implication granted to the City, under <em>Rossberg v. State, supra, </em>the City lacked the authority to declare contracts terminable at the purchaser\u2019s option.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>\u201ca municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers, and no others: </em>First, those granted in <em>express words; </em>second, those <em>necessarily or fairly implied </em>in or <em>incident </em>to the powers expressly granted; third, those <em>essential </em>to the accomplishment of the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, \u2014 not simply convenient, but indispensable.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>In <em>Rossberg, </em>a Baltimore City ordinance prohibited the sale, furnishing or possession of cocaine. The ordinance provided a penalty of a fine and imprisonment, and in the event the offender was a licensed pharmacist or physician, the forfeiture of his license. At the time of the enactment of the Baltimore City ordinance, there was also in effect a state law prohibiting the sale and furnishing (but not the simple possession) of cocaine and prescribing a penalty of a fine and imprisonment (but not a forfeiture of the license of a convicted pharmacist or physician). Dr. Rossberg, a licensed pharmacist, was convicted for the sale of cocaine in violation of the Baltimore City ordinance. This Court first upheld the validity of those parts of the local ordinance that provided for a fine and imprisonment of a different amount than the state statute. The Court then addressed the license-forfeiture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>issue. The trial court had held that the forfeiture provision was so oppressive that it was an unreasonable exercise of the police power, 111 Md. at 419, 74 A. at 585. This Court, however, after noting that forfeiture of the license might be the only fully adequate penalty, nevertheless held <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201cOur examination of the matter leads us to the conclusion that under its charter the City of Baltimore has no power to declare any forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cIn a note to <em>Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, </em>page 249, 5th Ed., the author says: \u2018Municipal by-laws may impose penalties on parties guilty of a violation thereof, but they cannot impose forfeiture of <em>property or rights </em>without express legislative authority,\u2019 citing <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>33 N.H. 424, and <em>Phillips v. Allen, </em>41 Pa. St. 481. JUDGE DILLON states the law in the same way, in his work on <em>Municipal Corporations, </em>Vol. 1, sec. 336. And <em>McQuillan on Ordinances, </em>sec. 170, says the general rule is that an ordinance cannot create a forfeiture in the absence of express power so to do, citing <em>Kirk v. Nowell, </em>1 Term. Rep. 118; and he adds in the same section: \u2018The American Courts have generally followed the early English rule, and have held that in the absence of express power given an ordinance cannot be enforced by forfeiture.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\"><em>See also Mayor and Aldermen of Mobile v. Yuille, </em>3 Ala. 137, 144 (1841); <em>White v. Tallman, </em>26 N.J.L. 67 (2 Dutcher) (1856); <em>Coonley v. City of Albany, </em>132 N.Y. 145, 153, 30 N.E. 382 (1892); <em>Hart v. Mayor, &amp;c. of Albany, </em>9 Wend. 571, 588 (Ct. for Correction of Errors, N.Y., opinion of Sutherland, J.) (1832); <em>Phillips v. Allen, </em>41 Pa. 481 (1862); <em>Heise v. Town Council, </em>6 Rich. 404 (S.C. 1853); II J.Dillon, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 611, 618; 5 E.McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 17.08 (3d ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The above-quoted language from <em>Rossberg, </em>on which the plaintiffs here place much reliance, was set forth in a totally different context. <em>Rossberg </em>dealt with a license to generally engage in one\u2019s profession. It was treated by the Court as a property right, unlike many other types of licenses which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>not deemed to create property or contract rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The license involved in <em>Rossberg </em>was not granted by the City under a municipal ordinance but was issued by a state agency pursuant to a state statute, Code (1904), Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 141-154. It was under these circumstances that the Court in <em>Rossberg </em>applied the principle that a municipal corporation may not enact a forfeiture absent express authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We need not in the instant case explore the extent to which this principle set forth in <em>Rossberg </em>might be equally applicable to \u201cforfeitures\u201d under dissimilar circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our view, the challenged City of Rockville ordinance does not at all involve a \u201cforfeiture\u201d as that term was used in the <em>Rossberg </em>case. In the case at bar, the City is not attempting to infringe upon, alter or destroy any pre-existing property or contractual right. Section 12-1.18A did not authorize the City of Rockville to acquire the contract right of either party or the seller\u2019s profits from the sale or the parcel of real property involved. The ordinance did not revoke the real estate agent\u2019s license. If that were the case, the plaintiffs might have a stronger argument that a forfeiture had been created. Instead, \u00a7 12-1.18A simply attempted to require prospectively a mode of conduct and provide a sanction for the breach thereof by returning the parties to the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">An ordinance, operating prospectively, providing for the rescission of a contract entered into after the enactment of the ordinance, is not a forfeiture. It has been frequently recognized by this Court that the laws subsisting at the time of the making of a contract enter into and form a part thereof as if expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms, and the principle embraces alike those provisions which affect the validity, construction, discharge and enforcement of the contract. <em>Beca v. City of Baltimore, </em>279 Md. 177, 182, 367 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>A.2d 478 (1977); <em>Federal Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>275 Md. 460, 473-474, 341 A.2d 399 (1975); <em>Downing Dev. Corp. v. Brazelton, </em>253 Md. 390, 252 A.2d 849 (1969); <em>Holmes v. Sharretts, </em>228 Md. 358, 180 A.2d 302, 98 A.L.R.2d 363 (1962); <em>Whitworth, Adm\u2019r v. Department, </em>222 Md. 98, 158 A.2d 765 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">For example, in <em>Denice v. Spotswood I. Quinby, Inc., </em>248 Md. 428, 237 A.2d 4 (1968), this Court held that a provision of the county building code became a substantive term of the sale contract, and that a breach of the code provision, if substantial, would permit the buyer to terminate the contract. <em>Accord, Griffith v. Scheungrab, </em>219 Md. 27, 146 A.2d 864 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Similarly, in <em>Prince George\u2019s Club v. Carr, </em>235 Md. 591, 202 A.2d 354 (1964), a corporation entered into a contract to sell its real property. Its real estate broker also signed the contract and agreed that his commission would come out of the settlement proceeds. At the time the contract was made, Code (1957), Art. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 65, 66, required that the sale be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders. Because shareholder approval was not obtained, the sale was not consummated. After holding that consummation of the sale was a condition to the broker\u2019s entitlement to his commission, the Court stated (235 Md. at 607-608):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cThis Court, in various decisions over a long span of years, has cited and applied \u2018the general rule that subsisting laws enter into and form part of a contract as if expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms, and the rule embraces alike those provisions which affect its validity, construction, discharge, and enforcement.\u2019...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cThe surrounding circumstances, including the limitation by reason of Code (1957), Art. 23, Secs. 65 and 66, that the Club could not make the sale that Mr. Coates, the vice-president of the broker, had arranged without the approval of two-thirds of its stockholders, make it appear to us that the condition of no commission without a settlement and payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of the purchase price was applicable if the stockholders did not approve the sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cMr. Coates was a realtor of twenty-six years experience.... We think he cannot have failed to know that the Club intended to sell substantially all of its assets, and that the stockholders were the persons who, as a group, had the final say when a chance to do so was presented, (he himself had told the second stockholders meeting he attended that one of the terms of the contract he proposed was the deposit was subject to \u2018ratification of agreement\u2019) and that he was chargeable with knowledge that two-thirds of the stockholders must approve if such a sale were to go through. Under these circumstances, when Edw. R. Carr, Inc., by Mr. Coates, signed the contract which embodied the condition that its commission was to be paid at settlement and from the purchase price then payable, <em>it agreed that it would get no commission unless the stockholders o\u00ed the Club approved the sale as effectively as if that proviso had been written in the contract in so many </em>words....\" (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Accordingly, this Court concluded that the broker was not entitled to his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, it is apparent that at the time a contract subject to \u00a7 12-1.18A would be made, the parties would have \u201cagreed ... as effectively as if that proviso had been written in the contract\u201d (235 Md. at 608) that the failure to provide the purchaser with the opportunity to examine the Master Plan authorized the purchaser to terminate the contract. By this incorporation, the purchaser\u2019s power to terminate the contract becomes an implied condition to the other side\u2019s contractual rights, just as effectively as if it had been expressly written into the contract. <em>Prince George's Club v. Carr, supra, </em>235 Md. at 608; <em>Griffith v. Scheungrab, supra. </em>Consequently, the termination of the contract permitted by \u00a7 12-1.18A results from the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>itself, by virtue of its incorporation of the ordinance. Unlike the situation in <em>Rossberg, </em>it is not the forfeiture of a pre-existing property or contract right.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">As previously mentioned, the plaintiffs do not in this Court challenge the City\u2019s authority to impose a duty upon the seller or his agent to provide a purchaser with the opportunity to examine the Master Plan, and thus we assume arguendo that the City is authorized by its charter or by state law to impose such duty. In light of our conclusion that the contract termination provision of \u00a7 12-1.18A does not effect a forfeiture, we believe that this particular remedy is, in the language of Dillon, <em>\u201cfairly implied </em>in or <em>incident </em>to\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the power to impose the duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The purpose of \u00a7 12-1.18A is to provide certain information about the future planned course of development in the area surrounding the real estate to be purchased. The City Council of Rockville could reasonably conclude that the imposition of only fines and imprisonment, leaving the purchaser subject to the sales contract, would neither deter violations nor achieve the purpose intended by the ordinance, and that the most reasonable and effective sanction would be to permit the termination of the contract. Moreover, a grant to the purchaser of the right to cancel a contract is a frequently utilized remedy in consumer protection legislation. <em>See, e.g, </em>Code (1975) \u00a7\u00a7 14-302 to 14-303 of the Commercial Law Article; <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 12-605; Code (1974), \u00a7 10-102 of the Real Property Article. Under the circumstances of this case, we believe that the sanction in \u00a7 12-1.18A is an appropriate remedy that is reasonably designed to effect the concededly valid obligation and duties that the ordinance imposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>Appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">.
