The Circuit Court for Baltimore County reversed on the ground that the Board had violated Md. Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.), Art. 75V2, \u00a7 17(c) by failing to schedule hearings within six months of the date on which the charges against the appellees were filed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals dismissed the Board\u2019s appeal on the ground that the Board lacked standing. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 1035 b 1. We issued a writ of certiorari and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">The question here is whether the Board has standing to appeal from a trial court\u2019s reversal of the Board\u2019s decision on a procedural matter. The resolution of this issue depends upon the Board\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Typically, administrative agencies perform quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative functions. <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 220, 334 A.2d 514, 521 (1974). <em>See </em>1 Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 1.09 at 65 (1958). Generally, an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>agency acting in a quasi-judicial capacity cannot appeal when one of its decisions is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction unless the authority to appeal to a higher court is provided by law. When an administrative agency functions in this capacity, it is immaterial whether the issue involved relates to a matter of procedure or substance. In either event, absent statutory authority, it has no standing to appeal. <em>Employment Security Admin. v. Smith, </em>282 Md. 267, 269-70, 383 A.2d 1108, 1110 (1978); <em>Board of Examiners of Landscape Architects v. McWilliams, </em>270 Md. 383, 385-87, 311 A.2d 792, 794-95 (1973); <em>Maryland Bd. of Pharmacy v. Peco, Inc., </em>234 Md. 200, 202-03, 198 A.2d 273, 274 (1964); <em>Board of Zoning Appeals v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 561-62, 199 A. 540, 544-45 (1938). <em>Ct., Board of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs v. Leone, </em>249 Md. 263, 265-68, 271, 239 A.2d 82, 84-87 (1968).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Like many other administrative agencies, the Board in this case performs a variety of functions. When the Board, in a disciplinary action, suspends a license,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it performs a quasi-judicial function because it makes factual determinations and decides contested issues. <em>Peco, </em>234 Md. at 202, 198 A.2d at 274. When it makes rules and adopts a code of ethics governing the practice of engineering and land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>surveying,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or exercises its limited powers of enforcement,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it performs quasi-legislative functions. <em>Leone, </em>249 Md. at 270-71, 239 A.2d at 87. When functioning in its quasi-judicial capacity, however, the Board can appeal only if authorized by statute. There is nothing in the nature of the functions performed by this Board which would justify a departure from the rule that it is the Legislature which determines when an agency should have a right to appeal in order to protect the public interest. <em>McKinney, </em>174 Md. at 561, 199 A. at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Article 75%, which established the Board, does not expressly provide it with a right of appeal. Nor does that Article authorize the Board to be a party to any and all legal proceedings. <em>Compare Smith, </em>282 Md. at 271-72, 383 A.2d at 1111; <em>State Tax Comm'n v. Western Md. Ry. Co., </em>188 Md. 240, 245, 52 A.2d 615, 617 (1947). The limited enforcement powers set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 8(d) and (e) cannot be construed to provide a right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Article 75%, \u00a7 17(g), however, does provide that \"any person aggrieved\u201d by a final decision of the Board in denying, suspending, or refusing to renew a license may appeal. Similarly, the Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code (1957, 1978 Repl. Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 255(a), provides that \u201cany party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>aggrieved\u201d by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review. Article 41, \u00a7 256 provides that under that subtitle \u201can aggrieved party\u201d may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from a final judgment of a circuit court. None of these provisions authorizes any one other than an \u201caggrieved party\u201d to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Here, because the Board was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when it suspended the appellees\u2019 licenses in a disciplinary action, it is not an aggrieved party entitled to appeal under Art. 75\u00bd, \u00a7 17(g), or under Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 255(a) or 256. <em>Peco, </em>234 Md. at 203, 198 A.2d at 274; <em>McKinney, </em>174 Md. at 562-64, 199 A. at 545-46. The fact that the issue determined by the Board, which became the subject matter of this appeal, involved a question of procedure rather than substance, does not alter the Board\u2019s status. <em>Leone, </em>249 Md. at 271, 239 A.2d at 87.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Under the present circumstances, the Board has no standing to appeal. Accordingly, we shall affirm. Md. Rule 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals aff\u00edrmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-12\">. Art. 75\u00bd, \u00a7 17(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">\u201cAll charges, unless dismissed ... shall be set down for hearing ... within a reasonable time, but not to exceed six months, after they shall have been preferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">. The Board\u2019s reliance on cases decided by this Court in which an administrative agency brought an appeal from a trial court\u2019s reversal of one of the agency\u2019s decisions is misplaced. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maryland Bd. of Pharmacy v. Sav-a-Lot, Inc., 270 Md. 103, 311 A.2d 242 (1973); Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals v. Walker, 228 Md. 574, 180 A.2d 865 (1962); State Bd. of Registration for Professional Eng\u2019rs &amp; Land Surveyors v. Ruth, 223 Md. 428, 165 A.2d 145 (1960). In none of those cases, other than <em>Walker, </em>did the Court expressly decide the question of the agency\u2019s standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">In <em>Walker, </em>a Board of Appeals was held to have standing to appeal a trial court\u2019s adverse decision on procedural questions. This case is unique, however, in that the procedural issues which became the subject matter of that appeal involved \"the very integrity of the Board itself.\u201d (Walker, 228 Md. at 579, 180 A.2d at 867-68.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">.
