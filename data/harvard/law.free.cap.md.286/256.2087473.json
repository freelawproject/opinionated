J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Pursuant to the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, Maryland Code (1974), \u00a7\u00a7 12-601 to 12-609 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland has certified for our consideration two questions of state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u201c(1) May an insurance company, under Maryland law, include a provision in an automobile insurance policy which would prohibit the recovery of uninsured motorist benefits under that policy where the insured\u2019s claim admittedly exceeds $40,000 and where the insured has already recovered the sum of $40,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage provided by another insurance policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(2) Does \u00a7 543(a) of Art. 48A, Ann. Code of Md., prohibit the recovery by an insured of uninsured motorist benefits under one policy where the insured\u2019s claim admittedly exceeds $40,000 and where the insured has already recovered the sum of $40,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage of another insurance policy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The statement of relevant facts, as set forth by the certifying court, discloses that on January 24,1976, a tractor trailer operated by Fred Kile collided with an automobile driven by Albert Starr. The collision resulted in the deaths of Albert Starr, his wife, Elizabeth, and their son, Jay. Hillary Starr; a minor, was the only member of the Starr family who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>survived the accident. At the time of the collision, Kile was an uninsured motorist and he was driving an uninsured tractor trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The automobile operated by Starr was owned and insured by his employer, Motorola, Inc. A policy covering this vehicle was issued by the Zurich Group insurance companies (Zurich); it provided uninsured motorist benefits up to $20,000 per person to a maximum of $40,000 per accident. At the time of the accident, Starr owned a Maryland registered 1971 Dodge automobile which was insured under a policy issued by Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). This policy also provided uninsured motorist benefits up to $20,000 per person to a maximum of $40,000 per accident, as required by Maryland Code (1957,1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c). That section requires that \u201cevery policy of motor vehicle liability insurance issued, sold, or delivered in this State after July 1, 1975 shall contain coverage, in at least the amounts required under Title 17 of the Transportation Article [up to $20,000 for any one person and up to $40,000 for any two or more persons], for damages which the insured is entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The appellants, the personal representatives of the decedents\u2019 estates and the guardian of Hillary Starr, sued Motorola, Zurich and GEICO for damages in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. A settlement agreement was reached between all the parties except GEICO whereby Zurich agreed to pay $40,000 to the appellants. This figure represented the maximum uninsured motorist benefits under the primary policy covering the Motorola car in which the Starrs were killed. Although no agreement was reached with GEICO, the appellants dismissed the action as to all other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On July 3,1978, the appellants filed an amended complaint against GEICO, seeking a declaratory judgment that, upon proper proof of damages, GEICO would be obligated to pay an additional $40,000 in uninsured motorist benefits under its policy insuring Albert Starr\u2019s 1971 Dodge vehicle. Answering the suit, GEICO claimed that the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>contained in its policy insuring Starr barred any recovery of uninsured motorist benefits by the appellants. That clause provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">\u201cOTHER INSURANCE. With respect to bodily injury to an insured while occupying a motor vehicle not owned by the named insured, the insurance under this amendment shall apply only as excess insurance over any other similar insurance available to such automobiles as primary insurance, and this insurance shall then apply only in the amount by which the limit of liability for this coverage exceeds the applicable limits of liability for such other insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">GEICO claimed that \u00a7 543(a) of Article 48A also barred recovery. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, no person shall recover benefits under the coverages required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 [personal injury protection or PIP] and 541 [uninsured motorist coverage] of this article from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In opposition to a motion for summary judgment filed by GEICO, the appellants contended that the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause in GEICO\u2019s policy was void because it conflicted with the requirement of \u00a7 541(c) of Article 48A that every policy of motor vehicle liability insurance contain uninsured motorist coverage in at least the minimum statutory amounts. Appellants also claimed that \u00a7 543(a) of Article 48A, prohibiting recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis, was not applicable under the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Concluding that there was no controlling state law precedent under which the case could be decided, the District Court certified the two questions previously set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Appellants contend that where, as here, two insurance carriers issue automobile liability insurance policies containing separate uninsured motorist coverages, both companies are liable to the insured for the total coverage for which premiums were paid, or the full amount of his damages, whichever is less. The \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause contravenes the plain meaning of \u00a7 541(c), the appellants argue, because every policy must contain uninsured motorist coverage and to interpret the statute so as not to require that that coverage be honored would undermine its purpose. In other words, appellants say that to give effect to the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause is to reduce the required minimum coverage of the GEICO policy from $40,000 to zero. They find support for this argument in cases from other jurisdictions invalidating \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clauses and permitting interpolicy stacking of uninsured motorist coverage to the extent that such stacking does not exceed the full indemnification to which the insured is entitled for his injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants contend that this interpretation is required by public policy considerations because the uninsured motorist coverage mandated by the legislature was intended to benefit the innocent victims of financially irresponsible motorists. Appellants rely on cases from other jurisdictions in support of this conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Appellants contend that the prohibition against duplicative or supplemental recovery of uninsured motorist benefits in \u00a7 543(a) does not bar their claim under GEIGO\u2019s policy since they do not seek to recover more than the full indemnification for the injuries sustained. They rely on <em>Langston v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>40 Md. App. 414, 392 A.2d 561 (1978), a case involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>a claim for uninsured motorist benefits, where the court interpreted \u201cduplicative\u201d benefits, in the context of \u00a7 543(a), to mean \u201cpayment in full twice or more for the same claim\u201d and construed \u201csupplemental\u201d to mean \u201csecuring remuneration over and above the recovery from an uninsured motorist of all that the claimant is legally entitled to recover.\u201d 40 Md. App. at 429-30. This definition, according to appellants, permits interpolicy stacking of uninsured motorist coverage and is consistent with the authority cited from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">That the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision in GEICO\u2019s policy, if effective, would bar recovery by appellants is clear. First, the named insured under the policy, Albert Starr, was killed while occupying a motor vehicle that he did not own. Second, the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause provides that the GEICO coverage applies only as excess insurance over the primary insurance \u2014 in this instance over that afforded by Zurich\u2019s policy. Because the limit on the uninsured motorist coverage of both the GEICO and Zurich policies is $40,000, the final clause in the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision ensures that the GEICO policy does not apply as excess insurance. Therefore, the policy limits of GEICO\u2019s liability does not exceed that of Zurich\u2019s liability. Absent contrary authority, the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause would plainly preclude appellants\u2019 recovery under the GEICO policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">While a number of jurisdictions regard \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clauses as ineffective to prevent the interpolicy stacking of uninsured motorist coverage <em>(see </em>footnotes 1 and 2), other jurisdictions have held that a statutory provision like \u00a7 541(c), requiring every automobile liability insurance policy to contain uninsured motorist coverage in specified minimum amounts, does not prohibit an insurance company from limiting its liability through an \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause, provided total coverage is not reduced below the statutory \u2022minimum. <em>See, e.g., Pettid v. Edwards, </em>195 Neb. 713, 240 N.W.2d 344 (1976); <em>Weemhoff v. Cincinnati Insurance Co., </em>41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Ohio St. 2d 231, 325 N.E.2d 239 (1975); <em>Cunningham v. Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>243 N.W.2d 172 (S.D. 1976); <em>Lyon v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity </em>Company, 25 Utah 2d 311, 480 P.2d 739 (1971); <em>Nelson v. Employers Mutual Casualty </em>Company, 68 Wis.2d 558, 217 N.W.2d 670 (1974). Neither line of cases, however, involved a statute like \u00a7 543(a) which prohibits the recovery of benefits under uninsured motorist coverage \u201cfrom more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d Statutory provisions similar to \u00a7 548(a) have been enacted in other jurisdictions. Such provisions, which authorize limitations on recovery of uninsured motorist benefits, are similarly designed to prevent duplication of insurance. In these jurisdictions, \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clauses have been viewed as valid. <em>See Westhoff v. American Interinsurance Exchange, </em>250 N.W.2d 404 (Iowa 1977); <em>State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co. v. Cummings, </em>519 S.W.2d 773 (Tenn. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">We considered the construction of \u00a7 543(a) in <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Benton, </em>278 Md. 542, 365 A.2d 1000 (1976). In that case, Benton was injured in an accident while riding as a passenger in an automobile insured by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF). Section 539 of Art. 48A of the Code provided that no motor vehicle liability policy could be issued unless it afforded personal injury protection (PIP) benefits in the minimum amount of $2,500. Benton claimed and was awarded PIP benefits by MAIF in the amount of $2,500. Because her total medical expenses and lost wages exceeded $5,000, Benton made a PIP claim against her own insurer, Travelers, for an additional $2,500. The Travelers\u2019 policy contained an exclusion of PIP coverage for the named insured while occupying a nonowned vehicle on which PIP coverage existed under another policy, and also expressly provided that a claimant could not recover PIP benefits from more than one motor vehicle liability insurance policy. We noted that the statutory plan making PIP coverage mandatory created a situation in which PIP coverage potentially existed under more than one policy, whenever a person qualifying as an insured under his own motor vehicle liability policy was injured while a passenger in a motor vehicle registered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Maryland. We observed that the coordination of benefits provisions contained in \u00a7 543(a) specified that recovery shall be under one, but not both policies; that the statute said in no uncertain terms that no person shall recover PIP benefits from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis. Finding no ambiguity in \u00a7 543(a), or in the words of the policy exclusion, we held that Benton could not recover the additional $2,500 in PIP benefits claimed from Travelers. In so concluding, we did not expressly elaborate on the meaning of the \u201cduplicative or supplemental\u201d language contained in \u00a7 543(a). It is nevertheless clear from the opinion that we did not view \u00a7 543(a) as simply a device to prevent recovery on a second policy that would thereby result in a claim in excess of total damages. On the contrary, Benton had not received one full recovery of her total medical expenses and lost wages, so that if she had been permitted to recover PIP benefits from her own insurer, she would not have received double recovery for her loss. The purpose of \u00a7 543(a) is thus not, as appellants contend, to prevent more than one full recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The principles of <em>Benton </em>are applicable in this case because \u00a7 543(a) expressly governs the recovery of both PIP and uninsured motorist benefits. In light of <em>Benton, </em>therefore, \u00a7 541(c) must be read to have the purpose of providing minimum protection to individuals injured by uninsured motorists. But such benefits may be obtained under \u00a7 543(a) in the circumstances here involved only through the primary policy. In prohibiting recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from more than one policy or insurer on a duplicative or supplemental basis, \u201cduplicative\u201d means payment in full twice or more for the same claim. The term \u201csupplemental\u201d is, we think, more encompassing, and refers to attempts to fill the deficiencies in the uninsured motorist coverage of the primary policy by claiming under a second policy. Under either term, after a claim for policy limits has been paid under the primary policy, recovery under a second policy is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In enacting \u00a7 541(c) and \u00a7 543(a), the General Assembly has legislated a public policy consistent with the \u201cOther <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Insurance\u201d clause in the GEICO policy. Contrary to the appellants\u2019 position, this clause does not conflict with \u00a7 541(c), as it does not operate to reduce the insured\u2019s coverage below the statutory minimum. The interpretation of \u00a7 543(a), as urged by appellants, would result in an unwarranted judicial enactment of an amount of uninsured motorist coverage that is greater than the minimum statutory limits as specified by the General Assembly. This would give a victim of an uninsured motorist greater insurance protection than would be available if he had been injured by an insured motorist having only the minimum required liability insurance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">We, therefore, answer both certified questions in the affirmative. Under \u00a7 543(a) an insurance company may include a provision in an automobile insurance policy which prohibits recovery of uninsured motorist benefits under that policy where the insured\u2019s claim exceeds $40,000, and where the insured has already recovered $40,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage provided by another insurance policy. In response to the second certified question, \u00a7 543(a) prohibits recovery by an insured of uninsured motorist benefits under one policy where the insured's claim exceeds $40,000 and where the insured has already recovered $40,000 under the uninsured motorist coverage of another insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>Questions of law answered as herein set forth; costs to be equally divided between the parties in accordance with the certification order.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Patton v.
