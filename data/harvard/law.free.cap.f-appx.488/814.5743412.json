Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009). The court determines: (1) whether, and to what extent, a sentence modification is authorized; and (2) whether any reduction is warranted in the light of any applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-26\">The district court implicitly determined Westbrook was eligible for a reduction, but concluded it was not warranted in the light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances of his case. <em>E.g., United States v. Larry, </em>632 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.2011). The court was under no obligation to reduce his sentence. <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673. It properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the motion and other papers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Westbrook\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, positive and negative, in making its decision. <em>Id. </em>at 672-78; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i)-(iii) (discussing factors to consider when determining whether reduction is warranted). Accordingly, it did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Westbrook contends, for the first time on appeal, that the court had the authority and discretion to apply retroactively the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) to correct the inequalities, clear error, and manifest injustice arising from the Guidelines in crack-cocaine cases. If a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) movant raises an issue for the first time on appeal, review is only for plain error: \u201c[T]he appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights\u201d (reversible plain error). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir.2010). Even for reversible plain error, we retain discretion whether to correct it and generally will do so only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Because Westbrook was sentenced in 2005, long before the FSA\u2019s 3 August 2010 effective date, the new lower statutory m\u00ednimums are inapplicable to his sentence, and his contention is without merit. <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2335, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). Accordingly, the district court did not commit reversible plain error in not applying the FSA retroactively. <em>Jones, </em>596 F.3d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <em>the </em>limited circumstances set forth in 5th C\u00edr. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
