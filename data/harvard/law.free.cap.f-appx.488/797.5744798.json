To obtain cancellation of removal, the alien must not have been convicted of any aggravated felony. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). The Immigration Judge found that Tapia\u2019s two New York convictions for the sale of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, <em>see </em>New York Penal Law \u00a7 220.34, were for aggravated felonies. The BIA dismissed Tapia\u2019s appeal because he failed to carry his burden of proving that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4. Tapia argues that the record fails to establish that his New York drug convictions are aggravated felonies; therefore, he argues, he is eligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-25\">\u201cThe BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is ineligible for discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal is a question of law that we review de novo, deferring to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 715 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\">Tapia was ordered removed on two bases: (1) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae as an alien convicted of violating \u201cany law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance,\u201d and (2) under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) as an aggravated felon. Tapia conceded removability on the first charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Once Tapia\u2019s removability was established, he had the burden of establishing that he was eligible for cancellation of removal. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i); <em>see Vasquez-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 715-16. Since \u201cthe evidence indicate[d] that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply\u201d (i.e., conviction of an aggravated felony), he had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds did not apply. \u00a7 1240.8(d); <em>see Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>662 F.3d 387, 392 (5th Cir.2011) cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1857, 182 L.Ed.2d 642 (2012); <em>Vasquez-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 715-16. Tapia presented no evidence before the IJ or the BIA to show that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony, and he points to no such evidence here. The BIA did not err in dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b821-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
