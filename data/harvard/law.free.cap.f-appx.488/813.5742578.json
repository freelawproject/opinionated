Espinoza previously received a reduction under the prior crack-cocaine amendment from 364 months of imprisonment to 294 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-22\">A district court may reduce a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We review a decision on whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>F.3d 575, 577 (5th Cir.2010). However, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines and sentencing statutes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In 2008, Espinoza\u2019s sentence was reduced when his total offense level was reduced from 41 to 39 and his guideline range was reduced from 324-405 months of imprisonment to 262-327 months. Applying the most recent amendment, the marijuana equivalent of the amount of crack cocaine for which Espinoza would be held accountable is decreased substantially, but the total marijuana equivalency of all of the drugs places him at offense level 36. With three levels added for Espinoza\u2019s role in the offense, his offense level remains 39, and his range of imprisonment remains 262-327 months. Because Espinoza\u2019s Guideline sentencing range remains unchanged, he is not eligible for a reduction in sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
