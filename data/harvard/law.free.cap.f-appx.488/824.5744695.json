For the reasons provided below, we DISMISS Muhammed\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Muhammed was a graduate student at UH, and was employed as a tutor at nearby Lone Star College (\u201cLSC\u201d). She was convicted in Texas state court of a misdemeanor breach of computer security, under Section 33.02 of the Texas Penal Code, for the unauthorized access of the electronic records of fellow UH students from a public computer terminal in an LSC computer lab. <em>See Muhammed v. State, </em>331 S.W.3d 187 (Tex.Crim.App.2011) (affirming Muhammed\u2019s criminal conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">On November 1, 2011, Muhammed filed suit, pro se, against Barlow. Besides the instant litigation, Muhammed has initiated four other pro se civil lawsuits pertaining to the cooperation of UH and LSC officials in her criminal prosecution. We briefly describe each of these lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">A. <em>Muhammed v. University of Houston</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-19\">In <em>Muhammed v. University of Houston (\u201cMuhammed Civ I\u201d), </em>No. 4:10-cv-2382 (S.D.Tex.), Muhammed alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that UH and its officials discriminated against her as a Muslim of Pakistani origin, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(2006). She also asserted that UH officials, including Barlow, violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (2006), and perjured themselves at her criminal trial, but provided minimal elaboration for these allegations. On November 4, 2010, the district court stayed <em>Muhammed Civ I </em>pending the exhaustion of Muhammed\u2019s appeals of her criminal conviction. The litigation remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-20\">B. <em>Muhammed v. Office of Registration and Academic Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-21\">In <em>Muhammed v. Office of Registration and Academic Records (\u201cMuhammed Civ II\u201d), </em>No. 4:11-cv-0015 (S.D.Tex.), Muhammed elaborated on the UH officials\u2019 alleged FERPA violations. However, on February 16, 2011, the district court dismissed the litigation as duplicative of <em>Muhammed Civ I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-22\">C. <em>Muhammed v. Texas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">In <em>Muhammed v. Texas (\u201cMuhammed Civ III\u201d), </em>No. 4:11-cv-1709 (S.D.Tex.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Muhammed alleged that the Open Records Division of the Texas Office of the Attorney General had failed to act on an administrative request she had made concerning UH\u2019s alleged FERPA violations. On August 1, 2011, the district court dismissed the litigation for failure to state a claim. This court affirmed <em>Muhammed Civ III </em>on June 26, 2012. <em>See </em>479 Fed.Appx. 621 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">D. <em>Muhammed v. Lone Star College System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In <em>Muhammed v. Lone Star College System (\u201cMuhammed Civ IV\u201d), </em>No. 4:10-cv-2381 (S.D.Tex.), Muhammed raised similar allegations to those in <em>Muhammed Civ I, </em>but this time against LSC and its officials. She also elaborated on her perjury allegations, specifically alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1622 and 1623 (2006). Finally, Muhammed alleged that LSC officials had violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (2006), which governs the interception and disclosure of electronic communications. On August 10, 2011, the district court dismissed <em>Muhammed Civ IV </em>for failure to state a claim. Muhammed appealed on August 23, 2011, but this court dismissed her appeal for failure to prosecute on February 8, 2012. <em>See Muhammed v. Lone Star College System, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 341 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">E. <em>Muhammed v. Barlow</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">In the instant litigation, <em>Muhammed v. Barlow (\u201cMuhammed Civ V\u201d), </em>No. 4:11-cv-3852 (S.D.Tex.), Muhammed repeats her various allegations from the earlier lawsuits, but specifically names Barlow as the captioned defendant. On December 28, 2011, the district court dismissed Mu-hammed\u2019s claims as duplicative of her earlier lawsuits. The district court dismissed those claims that overlap with <em>Muhammed Civ I </em>without prejudice because that litigation remains pending, but dismissed the remaining claims with prejudice as res ju-dicata. In a separate order, issued on the same date, the district court barred Mu-hammed from filing further suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas without the court\u2019s written consent. Muhammed timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">\u201cIn all instances of failure to prosecute an appeal to hearing as required, the court may take such other action as it deems appropriate.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.3.3. An \u201cappellant\u2019s brief must contain ... [an] argument, which must contain [the] appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them ... for each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review ... [and] a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). \u201c[W]hen [an] appellant fails ... to comply with the rules of the court, the clerk must dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution.\u201d 5th Cir. R. 42.3.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Muhammed\u2019s present appeal is comparable to her appeal in <em>Muhammed Civ IV, </em>which this court dismissed for failure to prosecute. In our February 8, 2012 opinion, we explained that \u201c[a]lthough we \u2018liberally construe\u2019 the filings of pro se litigants and \u2018apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than to parties represented by counsel,\u2019 pro se appellants must still comply with the principles of appellate procedure.\u201d <em>Muhammed, </em>460 Fed.Appx. at 342 (quoting <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam)). We summarized the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9), which govern the argument section of an appellate brief, and cautioned that \u201c[g]eneral arguments without citations to any error are insufficient to preserve issues for appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Brinkmann v. Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">Here, Muhammed\u2019s appellate brief sets out four arguments. Muhammed\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>three arguments expressly \u201crepeat and re-allege[ ]\u201d the various allegations contained in Muhammed\u2019s trial-level pleadings. <em>See </em>Pl.-Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12-14. Her fourth and final argument submits that the trial court\u2019s dismissal was \u201cnot acceptable due to the seriousness and magnitude of the ease,\u201d but provides no further elaboration. <em>See id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">As we observed in <em>Muhammed Civ IV, </em>an appellate brief that does not identify a single specific district court error is, in practical effect, the same as no appellate brief at all. 460 Fed.Appx. at 342 (citing <em>Grant, </em>59 F.3d at 525; <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748). Accordingly, Muhammed\u2019s appellate brief is insufficient for her to maintain her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS Muhammed\u2019s appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
