Lemus did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s underlying order of dismissal itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">A denial of a motion to reconsider is assessed under a \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>this standard, even an erroneous decision will stand if \u201cit is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Lemus, who is represented by counsel, fails to present legal authority to support the proposition that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reconsider, and we will not search for the legal basis for his claims. <em>See United </em>States. <em>v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986). Moreover, given that Le-mus\u2019s arguments before the BIA on the reconsideration issue pivoted largely on conclusory assertions, the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider cannot be said to be arbitrary, capricious, or irrational. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Lemus\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying the motion to reconsider did not bring up for review the underlying BIA order dismissing Lemus\u2019s appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s removal order. <em>See Kane v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 231, 238 n. 14 (5th Cir.2009). The period for filing a petition for review of a final order of depo-ration, such as the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Le-mus\u2019s appeal, is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 390, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>see also Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 213, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Because Lemus failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal, we have no authority to entertain his arguments pertaining to that order. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537; <em>Kane, </em>581 F.3d at 238 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
