Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">Following a bench trial, the District Court found Defendant guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), the District Court sentenced Defendant to 180 months of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">Defendant contends, for the first time on appeal, that the sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. According to Defendant, the District Court violated the Eighth Amendment by classifying Defendant as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d because two of Defendant\u2019s predicate state convictions were for conduct that occurred when Defendant was 17 years old (and because one conviction stemmed from conduct shortly after Defendant turned 18 years old).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 689 (11th Cir.1998). But we review a constitutional issue raised for the first time on appeal only for plain error. <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u2018Where a defendant raises a sentencing argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">The ACCA subjects a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment if the defendant has three prior convictions for serious drug offenses, committed on different occasions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">We have written that a prior conviction where the defendant was a juvenile at the time of the offense conduct \u201ccounts towards ACCA enhancement\u201d where the government prosecutes the defendant as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>an adult. <em>United States v. Spears, </em>448 F.3d 1358, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We have also interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), a decision Defendant cites for support. <em>Roper </em>decided \u201conly that the Eighth Amendment prohibits sentencing capital offenders to death if the offender was under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). <em>Roper </em>did not decide sentence enhancement under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>And in <em>Wilks </em>we again concluded that offenses committed while the defendant was a juvenile can qualify as predicate offenses for sentence enhancement under the ACCA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Here, Defendant acknowledges \u201cthat the state of the law in this circuit, as reflected above, is adverse to his position.\u201d But Defendant urges us to reconsider our precedent. We decline to do so. A directly on-point decision of a prior panel binds us unless the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>overrules the prior panel\u2019s decision. <em>E.g., United States v. Smith, </em>122 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Under the already-existing law, the District Court committed no plain error by relying in part on Defendant\u2019s two Florida state convictions \u2014 stemming from offenses committed while Defendant was a juvenile \u2014 to classify Defendant as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. Defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge fails. We AFFIRM Defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
