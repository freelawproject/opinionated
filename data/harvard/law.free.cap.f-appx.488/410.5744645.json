The defendant was on supervised release at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Defendant, Steven Melton Kivett, appeals his conviction and 39-month sentence, imposed within the guideline range, after being found guilty by a jury for one count of failure to heave to, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2287(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">Briefly stated, Kivett presents these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-19\">(1) Whether the evidence, including Ki-vett\u2019s own testimony and Border Protection\u2019s use of flashing blue lights, sirens, two red flares, and disabling shots were sufficient to support Kivett\u2019s conviction although no oral order to heave to was delivered from the marked patrol boat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-20\">(2) Whether the district court properly admitted Kivett\u2019s judgment and commitment order (J &amp; C) from a prior alien-smuggling conviction under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) to show motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-21\">(3) Whether the district court erred in permitting the introduction of the J &amp; C from Kivett\u2019s prior alien-smuggling conviction without requiring a witness to introduce the document; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-22\">(4) Whether Kivett\u2019s sentence is substantively unreasonable because it exceeded an amount necessary to fulfill the statutory goals of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-23\">The evidence at trial of the marked patrol boat\u2019s use of flashing blue lights, spotlights, siren flares, and disabling shots are sufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Especially given the limiting instructions, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Kivett\u2019s prior J &amp; C because it went to his motive and served as an integral and natural account of the circumstances surrounding the charged offense. Again given the limiting instructions on use, there are no meritorious Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause issues because Kivett\u2019s proposed cross-examination of his J &amp; C were not relevant to resolution of the ultimate issues of the case. For background, see <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2005). Finally, Kivett has not shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>his guideline-range sentence was unreasonable, given his demonstrated and dangerous disregard for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We affirm Kivett\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
