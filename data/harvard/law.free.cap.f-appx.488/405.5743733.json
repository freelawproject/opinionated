Barksdale, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Jacksonville, FL, Karin Bethany Hoppmann Us Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, Scott H. Park, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Orlando, FL, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b430-9\">Before HULL, EDMONDSON and BLACK, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b430-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Melissa Hammett, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the denial of her Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">Hammett filed a civil complaint against her former employer, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), alleging that DHS retaliated against her, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a) and 2000e-3(a), after she filed a claim of gender discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In particular, Hammett contended that DHS placed her on leave restriction, issued two letters of reprimand, and terminated her in retaliation for her protected conduct. Construed liberally, Hammett\u2019s complaint asserted retaliation claims under both a traditional approach (where the decisionmaker is motivated by a retaliatory animus) and under a \u201ccat\u2019s paw\u201d approach (where the deci-sionmaker is not motivated by a retaliatory animus but is influenced by a non-decision-maker who is so motivated).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of DHS. The district court first assumed <em>arguendo </em>that Hammett established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII. But the court then concluded that Hammett failed to show that DHS\u2019s legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for disciplining her-including that Hammett left work several times without authorization, refused to follow supervisory instructions, and acted in an unprofessional and disrespectful manner towards her immediate supervisors \u2014 were a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Hammett sought relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), alleging that the recent United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Staub v. Proctor Hospital, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1186, 179 L.Ed.2d 144 (2011), constituted an intervening change in the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied relief without an evidentiary hearing, concluding that nothing in <em>Staub </em>affected its original decision to grant summary judgment. Hammett now challenges the denial of her Rule 60(b)(6) motion on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We review the denial of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, </em>242 F.3d 1017, 1019 (11th Cir.2001). The grant or denial of Rule 60(b) relief is a matter for the district court\u2019s sound discretion and a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion will not be overturned unless the appellant \u201cdemonstrate[s] a justification so compelling that the [district] court was required to vacate its order.\u201d <em>See Cano v. Baker, </em>435 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Hammett fails to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying her relief. In <em>Staub, </em>the Supreme Court addressed an employer\u2019s liability under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301 (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), based on a cat\u2019s paw theory of discrimination. The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis focused on the causal connection between the non-deci-sionmaker\u2019s discriminatory animus and the ultimate employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Although <em>Staub </em>involved a cat\u2019s paw theory of discrimination \u2014 as does Hammett\u2019s <em>case </em>\u2014 Staub has no bearing on the district court\u2019s decision here, where the district court assumed <em>arguendo </em>that Hammett had satisfied the causal element of her <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s analysis then hinged on a determination that Hammett had failed to show that DHS\u2019s legitimate, nondiserimi-natory reasons were pretextual. Thus, even to the extent that <em>Staub </em>constituted an intervening change in the law \u2014 and assuming, without deciding, that <em>Staub </em>applies to Title VII <em>cases </em>\u2014 Staub had no impact on the outcome of Hammett\u2019s case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court committed no abuse of discretion in denying Hammett\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">. We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-15\">. On appeal, Hammett abandons expressly her retaliation claim under the traditional approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">. Hammett also sought relief under Rule 60(b)(1) based on alleged mistakes of fact and law. Because she does not raise that issue on appeal, she has abandoned it. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp. v. Axiom Worldwide, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1211, 1217 n. 4 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that \"issues not raised on appeal are abandoned\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">. In her notice of appeal, Hammett also indicated that she was appealing from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the district court\u2019s denial of her Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 motion to alter or amend the district court's judgment. Because Hammett has not offered any argument on these issues, however, they are abandoned. <em>See N. Am. Med. Corp., </em>522 F.3d at 1217 n. 4. Moreover, in her appellate brief, Hammett states expressly that, pre-<em>Staub, </em>the district court's grant of summary judgment was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b431-16\">. Because of this assumption, the district court did not distinguish between Hammett\u2019s traditional and cat's paw claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b431-17\">. Because <em>Staub </em>was not pertinent to the outcome in this case, we need not address Hammett's arguments that the district court erred in stating that she lacked the causal evidence that was dispositive in <em>Staub </em>or in denying Hammett an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
