Sentenced as a career offender, Johnson does not dispute that, under <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), he would be ineligible for \u00a7 3582 relief, <em>see id. </em>at 1327-28. Nonetheless, he insists that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582 because the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), effectively \u201cundermined\u201d <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-28\">However, in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317 (11th Cir.2012), we rejected precisely the argument that Johnson advances here. In that case, we concluded that <em>Freeman </em>did not address defendants like Johnson, \u201cwho were assigned a base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1 [the career-offender enhancement].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321. Consequently, <em>\u201cFreeman </em>is not \u2018clearly on point\u2019 to the issue that arose in <em>Moore,\u201d id. </em>at 1321, thereby leaving <em>Moore </em>undisturbed as \u201cbinding precedent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Lawson </em>thus forecloses Johnson\u2019s argument. And since the rule set forth in <em>Moore </em>still applies, we conclude that Amendment 750 \u2014 which altered only Johnson\u2019s base offense level \u2014 does not affect the sentence that Johnson received pursuant to the career-offender guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1319-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The district court\u2019s denial of Johnson\u2019s motion for a reduction in his total sentence is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
