The magistrate judge, before whom Franklin consented to proceed, denied his IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Franklin is challenging the magistrate judge\u2019s certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>tion. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Aside from conclusional allegations that he cannot effectively proceed without a transcript of the <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), hearing and that he has not been given an opportunity to conduct discovery in order to identify the bus drivers, Franklin does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that the appeal was not taken in good faith. He also does not address the magistrate judge\u2019s reasons for the certification decision, which were set forth in the order to dismiss with prejudice as frivolous. Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Franklin has not shown that the magistrate judge\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Franklin\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Franklin\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel on appeal is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of Franklin\u2019s complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Franklin is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b910-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
