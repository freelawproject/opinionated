Harris pled guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, distributing and possessing with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), conspiring to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), and 9 counts of money laundering, in violation of \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(B)(i). His drug offenses involved at least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-24\">The district court calculated a guidelines range of life imprisonment because Harris was subject to a statutorily-mandated sentence of life imprisonment based upon his prior convictions for two felony drug offenses. After granting a downward departure for Harris\u2019s substantial assistance, the district court calculated a guidelines range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment, and sentenced Harris to a total sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harris subsequently filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based upon Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Because Harris\u2019s guidelines range of life imprisonment was based upon the statutorily-mandated sentence of life imprisonment to which he was subject, Amendment 750 did not affect his applicable guidelines range. Moreover, even assuming that the FSA applies to defendants who, like Harris, were sentenced before its enactment, Harris remains subject to a statutorily-mandated sentence of life imprisonment and an identical guidelines range. Harris was, therefore, ineligible for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
