By moving for IFP status in this court, Driggers is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Driggers\u2019s IFP motion lists, without explanation, four claims that he intends to raise on appeal: that the defendants failed to identify which documents contained information responsive to Driggers\u2019s FOIA requests, that the DOJ \u201cnever properly answered as a Defendant because they never submitted an affidavit,\u201d that the grand jury witnesses \u201cwaived privacy by testifying at trial,\u201d and that the defendants failed to produce documents responsive to Driggers\u2019s FOIA requests that were not protected by an exception for grand jury materials. \u201cAlthough pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, ... even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them.\u201d <em>Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008) (internal citation omitted). Driggers has failed to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith, nor has he briefed any challenge to the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, he has \u201ceffectively abandoned\u201d any challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision, <em>see Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584, and he has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, we DENY Driggers\u2019s motion for leave to appeal IFP, and we DISMISS the appeal as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">This dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Driggers that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
