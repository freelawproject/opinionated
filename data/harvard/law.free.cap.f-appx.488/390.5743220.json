The body of the motion stated that he was seeking a sentence reduction \u201cpursuant to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and statute [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3661.\u201d The District Court denied the motion in a written order containing this statement: The court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKg\">has no jurisdiction to modify a sentence other than (1) upon a motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), to the extent expressly permitted by statute, or (2) upon a motion by the Government pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Defendant presents no basis under these provisions supporting a modification of his term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Alvarez-Mosquera now appeals the court\u2019s order, claiming that the court could have reduced his sentence based on his post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts and the recent availability of a fast-track program within the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">As the District Court stated, it has authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on motion by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons or on motion by the Government under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(2). Neither is present here. The court may also reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the Sentencing Commission has lowered the Guidelines sentencing range under which the defendant was sentenced. That has not shown to be the case here. The District Court\u2019s order is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"A0a\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-21\">.
