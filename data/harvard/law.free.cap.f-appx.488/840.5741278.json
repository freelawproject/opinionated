However, our review of the record confirms that the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Appellant Walter Copenhaver\u2019s claims against the Department of Veterans Affairs. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 511; <em>Zuspann v. Brovm, </em>60 F.3d 1156, 1158-60 (5th Cir.1995). The district court did err in one minor respect: its order states that Copenhaver\u2019s claims against the Department of Veterans Affairs are \u201cDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\u201d We modify this portion of the order to read \u201cDISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\u201d The district court\u2019s dismissal, as so modified, is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
