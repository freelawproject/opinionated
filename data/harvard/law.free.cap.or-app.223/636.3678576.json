J.</author>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Defendant appeals his conviction for assaulting a public safety officer, which includes, as pertinent here, a \u201ccorrections officer.\u201d ORS ldS^OSU).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant asserts that the person he assaulted \u2014 a uniformed guard at the Northern Oregon Correctional Facility (NORCOR) \u2014 was not a public safety officer because he was not a \u201ccorrections officer\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.208(1). According to defendant, that term is defined by ORS 181.610(5) as a \u201cmember of a law enforcement unit.\u201d Because the state did not prove that the entity operating the facility, NORCOR, was a \u201claw enforcement unit,\u201d defendant reasons, the victim was not a \u201ccorrections officer\u201d under the statute, and the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal to determine whether, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Defendant was outside his cell playing cards with other inmates while Officer Buchanan \u2014 a uniformed guard employed by NORCOR \u2014 was supervising a linen change. An inmate approached Buchanan and began complaining about conditions in the facility. Buchanan told the inmate that he could solve the problem by not coming back to prison. Defendant overheard the exchange and said that another way to solve the problem would be to \u201ckill the officers, kill the judges, kill the cops.\u201d Fearing for his safety, Buchanan ordered defendant to cell-in,\u201d a command known by inmates to require an immediate return to their cells. Defendant stood up quickly in front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>of Buchanan and began shaking his head; Buchanan placed bis hand on defendant\u2019s shoulder. Defendant grabbed Buchanan\u2019s shirt, Buchanan grabbed defendant\u2019s shirt, and both ended up underneath a table in the middle of the cell block. Defendant began kicking Buchanan in the face, but within seconds other officers arrived, and defendant was subdued. Buchanan suffered bruising to his face and a severe headache, but he was able to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">This prosecution ensued. The state\u2019s theory was that Buchanan was a \u201ccorrections officer\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.208(1). Before trial, defendant asked the trial court to instruct the jury on the meaning of the term \u201ccorrections officer.\u201d Defendant argued that \u201ccorrections officer\u201d is defined by ORS 181.610(5) as a \u201cmember of a law enforcement unit\u201d; that NORCOR, a private corporation, was not a \u2018law enforcement unit\u201d; and that Buchanan therefore was not a \u201ccorrections officer for purposes of ORS 163.208(1).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant relied on our decision in <em>Haynes v. State of Oregon, </em>121 Or App 395, 854 P2d 949 (1993). In accordance with his legal theory, defendant also proffered two documents to show the corporate status of NORCOR.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s request, reasoning that, because ORS 163.208(1) included both the terms \u201ccorrections officer\u201d and \u201cstaff member,\u201d and that only \u201cstaff member\u201d was defined with reference to ORS 181.610, the pertinent definition of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d was set out in <em>Haynes, </em>not in ORS 181.610(5). At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, reiterating his argument that, because NORCOR was not a \u201claw enforcement unit,\u201d Buchanan was not a \u201ccorrections officer.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">After resting, defendant again asked the trial court to instruct the jury in accordance with his interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ORS 163.208. The trial court declined to do so, and the jury convicted defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In three assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, its exclusion of his proffered evidence regarding NORCOR\u2019s corporate status, and its refusal to give his proposed jury instruction. Each assignment of error reduces to a single issue, namely, defendant\u2019s assertion that, in accordance with his interpretation of ORS 163.208(1) and ORS 181.610(5), he could not be guilty of assaulting a public safety officer, because Buchanan was not a member of a \u201claw enforcement unit\u201d and, thus, was not a \u201ccorrections officer.\u201d So framed, the question is one of statutory interpretation, which we review for errors of law. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">As discussed, ORS 163.208(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assaulting a public safety officer if the person intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to the other person, knowing the other person to be a peace officer, corrections officer, youth correction officer, parole and probation officer, animal control officer, firefighter or staff member, and while the other person is acting in the course of official duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">\u201cCorrections officer\u201d is not defined in ORS 163.208. However, ORS 163.208(4)(b) defines \u201cstaff member\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201c(A) A corrections officer as defined in ORS 181.610, a youth correction officer, a Department of Corrections or Oregon Youth Authority staff member or a person employed pursuant to a contract with the department or youth authority to work with, or in the vicinity of, inmates or youth offenders; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">\u201c(B) A volunteer authorized by the department, youth authority or other entity in charge of a corrections facility to work with, or in the vicinity of, inmates or youth offenders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">ORS 181.610(5), in turn, defines \u201ccorrections officer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">\u201c \u2018Corrections officer\u2019 means an officer or member of <em>a law enforcement unit </em>who is employed full-time thereby and is charged with and primarily performs the duty of custody, control or supervision of individuals convicted of or arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>for a criminal offense and confined in a place of incarceration or detention other than a place used exclusively for incarceration or detention of juveniles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">(Emphasis added.) Finally, ORS 181.610(12)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201c \u2018Law enforcement unit\u2019 means a police force or organization of the state, a city, port, school district, mass transit district, county, county service district authorized to provide law enforcement services under ORS 451.010, Indian reservation, Criminal Justice Division of the Department of Justice, the Department of Corrections, the Oregon State Lottery Commission or common carrier railroad whose primary duty, as prescribed by law, ordinance or directive, is any one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201c(A) Detecting crime and enforcing the criminal laws of this state or laws or ordinances relating to airport security;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201c(B) The custody, control or supervision of individuals convicted of or arrested for a criminal offense and confined to a place of incarceration or detention other than a place used exclusively for incarceration or detention of juveniles; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">\u201c(C) The control, supervision and reformation of adult offenders placed on parole or sentenced to probation and investigation of adult offenders on parole or probation or being considered for parole or probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">\u201c(b) \u2018Law enforcement unit\u2019 also means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201c(A) A police force or organization of a private entity with a population of more than 1,000 residents in an unincorporated area whose employees are commissioned by a county sheriff; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\u201c(B) A district attorney\u2019s office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">The term \u201ccorrections officer\u201d appears twice in ORS 163.208(1): first, in the text of the statute as a discrete category of victim, and second, indirectly, as a subcategory of the definition of another discrete victim category: \u201cstaff member.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 163.208(4)(b). Defendant asserts that the meaning of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d as a discrete victim category is identical to the definition in ORS 181.610(5) that applies to the \u201ccorrections officer\u201d subcategory of \u201cstaff member.\u201d Defendant argues that, in <em>Haynes, </em>we held that ORS 181.610 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>provided the definition of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.208(1) and that the legislature, through subsequent amendments to the latter statute, \u201cwould have provided another source for the definition of\u2018corrections officer\u2019 had it not intended for the definition of \u2018corrections officer\u2019 in ORS 181.610 to apply for purposes of ORS 163.208.\u201d Defendant misunderstands our holding in <em>Haynes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The petitioner in <em>Haynes </em>had been convicted of assaulting a public safety officer after he beat a Children\u2019s Services Division juvenile parole officer who had been visiting the petitioner\u2019s residence as part of supervising the petitioner\u2019s stepson\u2019s parole. The petitioner sought postonviction relief, arguing that a juvenile parole officer was not a \u201ccorrections officer\u201d under ORS 163.208 and, therefore, his trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise that issue had rendered his representation constitutionally inadequate. <em>Haynes, </em>121 Or App at 398. In order to determine whether the petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was inadequate, we were required to construe the term \u201ccorrections officer\u201d in ORS 163.208. We noted that \u201ccorrections officer\u201d was not legislatively defined, but that \u201c[v]arious statutes describe the functions of a corrections officer. The common characteristic of those statutes is the concept of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. We cited ORS 181.610, as well as other statutes containing the term \u201ccorrections officer,\u201d and concluded that \u201c \u2018corrections officer\u2019 means a person who primarily performs the duty of supervising or controlling an individual who is <em>confined </em>in a place of incarceration or detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 (emphasis in original). Thus, although we identified ORS 181.610 as <em>relevant </em>to the meaning of \u201ccorrections officer,\u201d just as we found three other statutes to be relevant, we did not hold that, as used in ORS 163.208(1), the term was <em>defined </em>by ORS 181.610. Indeed, if we had so held, the definition of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d that we enunciated in <em>Haynes </em>would have been superfluous. We reiterate here that \u201ccorrections officer,\u201d as a discrete victim category under ORS 163.208(1), has the meaning ascribed in <em>Haynes-, </em>that is, \u201ca person who primarily performs the duty of supervising or controlling an individual who is <em>confined </em>in a place of incarceration or detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Defendant correctly observes that the legislature has amended ORS 163.208 several times since we decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>Haynes. </em>Those amendments included the addition, in 2001, of the term \u201cstaff member.\u201d <em>See </em>Or Laws 2001, ch 828, \u00a7 1 (amending statute to include term \u201cstaff member\u201d and making assaulting a public safety officer a Class C felony). But that amendment is not pertinent here, because the state\u2019s theory was not that Buchanan was a \u201cstaff member\u201d but, rather, that he was a \u201ccorrections officer\u201d under ORS 163.208(1). Defendant\u2019s argument that the legislature \u201cacquiesced\u201d to our holding in <em>Haynes </em>that \u201ccorrections officer\u201d is defined by ORS 181.610 fails first because, as discussed, it mischaracterizes our holding, and, second, because none of the subsequent amendments to ORS 163.208 further defined or modified the victim category of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d in a way that is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Haynes. </em>Indeed, the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the legislature\u2019s failure to further define or modify \u201ccorrections officer\u201d in subsequent amendments is that it has approved the definition we gave that term in <em>Haynes. </em>In sum, <em>Haynes </em>enunciated the applicable meaning of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d as a discrete category of victim under ORS 163.208. Accordingly, the state was not required to show that NORCOR was a \u2018law enforcement unit\u201d in order to prove that defendant assaulted a \u201ccorrections officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Applying the pertinent definition of \u201ccorrections officer\u201d to the evidence in this case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. The state presented evidence that Buchanan was supervising individuals in a place of incarceration when defendant assaulted him. That evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant assaulted a \u201ccorrections officer\u201d under ORS 163.208(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\"> ORS 163.208(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">\u201cA person commits the crime of assaulting a public safety officer if the person intentionally or knowingly causes physical injury to the other person, knowing the other person to be a peace officer, corrections officer, youth correction officer, parole and probation officer, animal control officer, firefighter or staff member, and while the other person is acting in the course of official duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit into evidence exhibits regarding the corporate status of NORCOR and to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the definition of \u2018law enforcement unit.\u201d Because it is dispositive, we address only defendant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> As explained more fully below, we do not reach, the question of whether NORCOR is a \u2018law enforcement unit\u201d under ORS 181.610(12)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\"> Those documents were a certified copy of the assumed business name filed by NORCOR with the Secretary of State and a warranty deed transferring property from a private company to NORCOR, \u201can Oregon Intergovernmental Corrections Entity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
