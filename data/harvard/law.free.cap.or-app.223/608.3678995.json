Defendant later admitted violating the terms of her probation, and the trial court revoked her probation. The court then imposed a revocation sanction of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment and one year of post-prison supervision on the identity theft conviction and a concurrent jail term of six months on the forgery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing a sentence of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment for identity theft, over her objection that the maximum sentence allowable by law was six months. The state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard because grid block 2-F, under which defendant was originally sentenced, limits the available revocation sentence to a six-month prison sentence. <em>See State v. Bolf, </em>217 Or App 606, 176 P3d 1287 (2008) (the grid block stated in the judgment controls the sentence that can be imposed upon revocation). We agree and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
