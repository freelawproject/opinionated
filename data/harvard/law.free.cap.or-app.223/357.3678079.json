J.</author>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The plaintiff insured, as guardian ad litem for her minor son, appeals, challenging the allowance of summary judgment in favor of defendant, plaintiffs underinsured motorist (UIM) insurance carrier, as well as the trial court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment. The underlying accident occurred in January 2000, and this action for declaratory relief was filed in August 2005. The trial court agreed with defendant that the \u201cminority tolling\u201d provisions of ORS 12.160 did not operate to extend the time limitation provision, predicated on ORS 742.504(12)(a), that certain events occur within two years of the date of the accident. The court further determined that plaintiff, in opposing summary judgment, had failed to adduce evidence raising a disputed issue of material fact as to whether defendant had waived the two-year limitation. On appeal, plaintiff challenges both of those determinations. As amplified below, we conclude that (1) the trial court correctly determined that the time limitation provision was not tolled, but (2) the court erred in granting summary judgment because (a) the two-year limitation of ORS 742.504(12)(a) can be waived by the UIM insurer and (b) there is a material issue of disputed fact as to whether defendant waived its right to rely on that time limitation. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"> We review a grant of summary judgment \u201cto determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and whether defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Herman v. Valley Ins. Co., </em>145 Or App 124, 127-28, 928 P2d 985 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 438 (1997). <em>See also </em>ORCP 47 C. We view the evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Moore v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>317 Or 235, 237, 855 P2d 626 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Here, the historical facts are not disputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 18, 2000, plaintiff and her minor son, D, were involved in an auto accident involving another motorist, Watts, in which D was allegedly injured. Watts had liability insurance with limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>accident. At the time of the accident, defendant provided UIM coverage to plaintiff with limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Plaintiffs UIM policy with defendant, in general conformance with ORS 742.504(12)(a), which we address in detail below, included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">\u201cc. nor shall we have to make any payment under uninsured motor vehicle coverage <em>unless within two years from the date of the </em>accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201c(1) the insured and we agree to the amount due;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">\u201c(2) the insured or we have formally instituted arbitration proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\u201c(3) <em>the insured has filed an action against us in a court of competent jurisdiction-, </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">\u201c(4) a suit for bodily injury has been filed against the uninsured motorist in a court of competent jurisdiction and, within two years from the date of settlement or final judgment against the uninsured motorist, the insured has formally instituted arbitration proceedings or filed an action against us in a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">(Original emphasis omitted; emphasis added.) There were some preliminary communications between plaintiff and defendant regarding a potential claim, but plaintiff did not take any of the requisite actions within two years of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">On March 19, 2005, plaintiffs attorney contacted defendant, informing defendant that he had been retained to represent D\u2019s interests and requesting information pertaining to defendant\u2019s personal injury protection (PIP) coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant responded, by letter, on April 26, 2005. That letter, which was signed by one of defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim representatives,\u201d identified plaintiff as the insured and the \u201cdate of loss\u201d as January 18, 2000. After replying to plaintiffs attorney\u2019s request for PIP-related information, the letter then proceeded to address plaintiffs potential UIM claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cWe understand that your client is interested in pursuing an underinsured motorist claim regarding [the] motor vehicle accident. We have determined that our insured, [plaintiff], does have coverage under her policy for such a claim and <em>we will make every attempt, once we have adequate information supporting [D\u2019s] claim, to reach an agreement with you as to the amount of benefits due under the policy. The only remaining issues are liability and damages due to your client. </em>If for some reason we are not able to reach an agreement as to the amount of benefits due under [plaintiffs] coverage, then please be advised that [we do] hereby consent to submit your client\u2019s underinsured motorist claim to arbitration as provided by the policy and that the arbitration be binding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On April 28, 2005, plaintiff filed a personal injury action on D\u2019s behalf against Watts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">On July 22, 2005, defendant notified plaintiff that it was withdrawing its offer of UIM arbitration because it had determined that none of the requisite events had occurred within the two-year period allowed in the policy. Plaintiff then brought this action, seeking a declaration of UIM coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with their dispute centering on two issues: (1) Did the \u201cminority tolling\u201d provisions of ORS 12.160 apply to and, thus, extend the UIM policy\u2019s two-year limitation period, as specified in ORS 742.504(12)(a)? (2) Even if ORS 12.160 did not apply, was the two-year limitation waivable, and, if so, had plaintiff adduced evidence raising a disputed issue of material fact as to whether defendant had waived that limitation? The trial court resolved both of those questions adversely to plaintiff and, consequently, allowed defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">On appeal, the parties essentially reprise their arguments to the trial court. We address the tolling and waiver arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Under ORS 742.504, insurance policies that include uninsured motorist benefits must provide coverage that is no less favorable to the insured or any beneficiary than the sample policy provisions set forth in ORS 742.504(1) to (12).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 742.504(12)(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201cThe parties to this coverage agree that <em>no cause of action shall accrue </em>to the insured under this coverage unless within two years from the date of the accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201c(A) Agreement as to the amount due under the policy has been concluded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201c(B) The insured or the insurer has formally instituted arbitration proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">\u201c(C) The insured has filed an action against the insurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201c(D) Suit for bodily injury has been filed against the uninsured motorist and, within two years from the date of settlement or final judgment against the uninsured motorist, the insured has formally instituted arbitration proceedings or filed an action against the insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">(Emphasis added.) Plaintiff concedes that none of the four requisites, (A) - (D), was satisfied within two years of the date of the accident. She argues, however, that defendant was obligated to provide UIM benefits because the two-year period was tolled by ORS 12.160.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">ORS 12.160 (2005) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-11\">\u201cIf, <em>at the time the cause of action accrues, </em>any person entitled to bring an action mentioned in ORS 12.010 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>12.050, 12.070 to 12.250 and 12.276 is within the age of 18 years * * * the time of such disability shall not be a part of <em>the time limited for the commencement of the action </em>* * *.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">(Emphasis added.) With certain exceptions not applicable here, ORS 12.080 establishes the time for commencing contract actions. Claims for UIM benefits arise from contract. As a result, ORS 12.160 is potentially applicable in the context of an action concerning UIM coverage. We conclude, however, that ORS 12.160 does not apply to toll the two-year period set forth in ORS 742.504(12)(a) for two related reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">First, ORS 12.160, by its plain terms, applies only \u201cat the time the cause of action accrues.\u201d A cause of action \u201caccrues\u201d when it \u201ccome[s] into existence as an enforceable claim[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>13 (unabridged ed 2002). However, under ORS 742.504(12)(a), \u201cno cause of action shall accrue to the insured\u201d for UIM coverage unless one of the four events specified in the statute occurs within two years from the accident date. If none of the events occurs in the permitted time period, the cause of action never accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In this case, plaintiffs cause of action against defendant <em>never accrued </em>because none of the events specified in ORS 742.504(12)(a)(A) to (D) occurred within two years from the date of the accident. Because the cause of action did not accrue, the disability tolling provision set forth in ORS 12.160 cannot apply. <em>See also </em>ORS 12.170 (\u201cNo person shall make use of a disability unless it existed when the right of action of the person <em>accrued.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Second, ORS 12.160 provides that the time of the applicable disability \u201cshall not be a part of the time limited for the <em>commencement </em>of the action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ORS 742.504(12)(a) establishes a time limitation for accrual of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cause of action, not for commencement of an action. Therefore, ORS 12.160 has no application.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>\u201c(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, if a person is entitled to bring an action that is subject to the statutes of limitation prescribed by ORS 12.010 to 12.050, 12.070 to 12.250 or 12.276, and at the time the cause of action accrues the person is a child who is younger than 18 years of age, the statute of limitation for commencing the action is tolled for so long as the person is younger than 18 years of age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The context of ORS 742.504(12)(a) corroborates our construction. In interpreting a statute, our task is to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). At the first level of that analysis, we examine the text and context of the statute. <em>Id. </em>ORS 742.504(12)(a), which was enacted in Oregon in 1967, was modeled on a California statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Minutes, Subcommittee on Reserve, Surplus and Capital Requirements of Insurance Companies Engaged in the Business of Casualty or Disability Insurance, Feb 15, 1964, 4. \u2018When one state borrows a statute from another state, the interpretation of the borrowed statute by the courts of the earlier enacting state ordinarily is persuasive.\u201d <em>State ex rel Western Seed v. Campbell, </em>250 Or 262, 270-71, 442 P2d 215 (1968), <em>cert den, </em>393 US 1093 (1969). At the time Oregon enacted ORS 742.504(12)(a), California courts had held that the time limitation described in its version of that statute was not tolled during an insured\u2019s minority. <em>See Pacific Indemnity Company v. Superior Court, </em>246 Cal App 2d 63, 72, 54 Cal Rptr 470 (1966); <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>232 Cal App 2d 808, 810, 43 Cal Rptr 209 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Plaintiff invokes <em>Bradford v. Davis, </em>290 Or 855, 626 P2d 1376 (1981), and <em>Kearney v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>55 Or App 641, 639 P2d 682 (1982), as supporting her position. However, neither case assists her. In <em>Bradford, </em>the Supreme Court held that ORS 12.160 tolled a two-year statute of limitation found in ORS 30.275 for commencing a cause of action under the Tort Claims Act during the plaintiffs minority. 290 Or at 861. In <em>Kearney, </em>we followed the reasoning of <em>Bradford </em>and held that the statute of limitations for commencing a product liability action under ORS 30.905 was tolled during the plaintiffs minority by ORS 12.160. 55 Or App at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>The facts of <em>Bradford </em>and <em>Kearney </em>are distinguishable from those of this case because both of those cases involve statutes of limitations for commencing actions. The time limit established by ORS 742.504(12)(a) is not a statute of limitation that establishes the time for commencing an action. Instead, it specifies how and when a UIM cause of action may <em>accrue </em>\u2014 and, as noted, ORS 12.160 only applies to toll the time for commencing an action if the cause of action has accrued. In both <em>Bradford </em>and <em>Kearney, </em>the cause of action had accrued and, thus, ORS 12.160 could apply to toll the pertinent statutes of limitation. Conversely, in this case, ORS 12.160 has no application because plaintiffs cause of action never accrued given that none of the requisite events occurred within the two-year period allowed under ORS 742.504(12)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Finally, plaintiff argues that ORS 12.160 must toll the two-year period set forth in ORS 742.504(12)(a) because, if it does not, there will be a temporal disconnect between the time during which a minor insured can commence a personal injury action against an at-fault motorist and the time during which he or she must act to secure UIM benefits. ORS 12.110 establishes a two-year statute of limitations for most personal injury actions. In certain circumstances, such as when the injured insured is a minor at the time of the accident, ORS 12.160 will apply to extend the statute of limitations for commencing the personal injury action while, under our holding, it does not apply to extend the period for seeking UIM benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The fundamental problem with plaintiffs argument is that we have previously indicated that, given the express language of ORS 742.504(12)(a), the requirements for prosecuting a personal injury action against the at-fault uninsured motorist (UM) or underinsured motorist and an action against the UM/UIM insurer are not congruent. <em>See Lindsey v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>170 Or App 458, 12 P3d 571 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In <em>Lindsey, </em>the plaintiff filed a personal injury action against the tortfeasor uninsured motorist within the two-year period permitted under ORS 742.504(12)(a)(D). 170 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>App at 460. The plaintiff did not, however, effect proper service of process and, consequently, her action against the uninsured motorist was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff subsequently requested arbitration of her UM claim against the defendant UM insurer, which refused to arbitrate on the ground that the request was untimely. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff then brought an action against the defendant UM insurer, which moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the requisites of ORS 742.504(12). <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted that motion, concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the time limitation of ORS 742.504(12)(a)(D). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">On appeal, we reversed. We concluded that ORS 742.504(12)(a)(D) requires only that the action against the uninsured or underinsured motorist be <em>\u201cfiled\u201d </em>within two years of the accident and not also that service of process be timely effected. <em>Id. </em>at 467. In so holding, we emphasized the distinction between the term \u201cfiled\u201d and the term \u201ccommenced\u201d employed in other statutes, including those pertaining to statutes of limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 463-65. We also rejected the defendant insurer\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs construction of the statute could yield practically incongruous results because, if the third-party liability action was merely filed without timely service, the effect would be that UM (or UIM) insureds would be able to maintain claims under UM (or UIM) coverage even when there was no viable claim (and, thus, no potential reimbursement) against the tortfeasor uninsured (or underinsured) driver. In rejecting that contention, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u201cRegardless of the merit of defendant\u2019s argument about how an insurer has little protection from stale claims under plaintiffs interpretations of ORS 742.504(12)(a)(D), our task is to discern the intention of the legislature from the language of the statute. Only if that language is unclear, are we authorized to go beyond the first level of text and context to discern legislative intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">So too here. Although the circumstances here are, in many ways, the obverse of those in <em>Lindsey </em>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we fully appreciate that the temporal disconnect that can obtain under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>12.110, as extended pursuant to ORS 12.160, and ORS 742.504(12)(a)(D), can yield incongruous results. Most obviously, as a practical matter, the determination of the amount recovered from the underinsured tortfeasor might well, logically, precede ultimate recovery against the UIM insurer. It may be that a more rational statutory approach could be constructed. But that is not our constitutional role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cIf the legislature has chosen language that creates unexpected and unintended results, the legislature can amend the statute to express its actual intent. It is not the function of a court to insert language that should have been added and ignore language that should have been omitted. ORS 174.010.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><em>Cole v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em>108 Or App 277, 280, 814 P2d 188 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial court correctly concluded that ORS 12.160 does not apply to, extend, or toll the two-year limitation of ORS 742.504(12)(a). We turn, then, to plaintiffs alternative, waiver-based argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u201cWaiver is \u2018the intentional relinquishment of a known right, either in terms or by such conduct as clearly indicates an intention to renounce a known privilege or power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Day-Towne v. Progressive Halcyon Ins. Co., </em>214 Or App 372, 382, 164 P3d 1205 (2007) (quoting <em>Great American Ins. v. General Ins., </em>257 Or 62, 72, 475 P2d 415 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">As noted, in 2005, plaintiffs attorney sent a letter to defendant informing defendant that he had \u201cbeen retained to represent the interests of [D], a minor\u201d with regard to the accident. Further, as noted, defendant responded by letter, on April 26, 2005, expressly acknowledging a \u201cdate of loss\u201d of January 18, 2000, and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cWe understand that your client is interested in pursuing an underinsured motorist claim regarding [the] motor vehicle accident. We have determined that our insured, [plaintiff], does have coverage under her policy for such a claim and <em>we will make every attempt, once we have adequate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>information supporting [D\u2019s] claim, to reach an agreement with you as to the amount of benefits due under the policy. The only remaining issues are liability and damages due to your client. </em>If for some reason we are not able to reach an agreement as to the amount of benefits due under [plaintiffs] coverage, then please be advised that [we do] hereby consent to submit your client\u2019s underinsured motorist claim to arbitration as provided by the policy and that the arbitration be binding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">(Emphasis added.) Roughly three months later, on July 22, 2005, defendant first asserted that ORS 742.504(12)(a) precluded recovery under the UIM policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Plaintiff contends that defendant\u2019s conduct antedating July 22, 2005 \u2014 and, particularly, the language of the April 26, 2005, letter \u2014 effected a waiver of any reliance on ORS 742.504(12)(a). In that regard, plaintiff emphasizes that that letter explicitly cross-referenced a \u201cdate of loss\u201d more than two years before the letter and then, without any reference to ORS 742.504(12)(a) or any other temporal limitation, proceeded to acknowledge that \u201c[t]he <em>only </em>remaining issues are liability and damages due to your client.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff contends that, from those circumstances and reasonably related inferences, a trier of fact could properly find waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Defendant counters with two arguments. First, as a matter of law, the limitation described in ORS 742.504(12)(a) is not subject to waiver.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, in all events, defendant\u2019s conduct before July 22, 2005, including the language of the April 26, 2005, letter, does not raise a triable issue of material fact as to waiver. We begin by addressing the first assertion \u2014 which, logically, precedes the second \u2014 and reject both.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Defendant argues that the two-year limitation of ORS 742.504(12)(a) \u201cis not the type of policy provision that can be waived.\u201d We disagree. The doctrine of waiver applies broadly to any contract term. <em>Bennett v. Farmers Ins. </em>Co., 332 Or 138, 156, 26 P3d 785 (2001). As a general rule, \u201c[a] party to a contract may waive performance of any provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>contract that is for its benefit.\u201d <em>South Lake Center v. Waker Associates, Inc., </em>129 Or App 581, 589, 879 P2d 1342 (1994). In the context of an insurance contract specifically, \u201c[c]onduct of an insurer after a loss has occurred that is inconsistent with a particular defense, especially where the insured has been * * * led to believe there is coverage, will constitute a waiver of the defense.\u201d Richard A. Lord, 14 <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 41:26 (4th ed 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Defendant cites no case law supporting its assertion that the UIM policy's two-year limitation, predicated on ORS 742.504(12)(a), is not waivable. However, defendant contends generally that the limitation is not waivable because it is not a \u201ccondition of forfeiture.\u201d As support for that general proposition, defendant invokes <em>Farmers Ins. Co. v. Munson, </em>127 Or App 413, 418, 873 P2d 370, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 109 (1994), where we stated that \u201c[w]aiver may be available to prevent an insurer from asserting a policy defense if the defense is a condition of forfeiture, but not if it is a condition of coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Defendant is correct that the two-year limitation of ORS 742.504(12)(a) is not a condition of forfeiture.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But defendant is wrong in its reading, and application, of <em>Munson. </em>In <em>Munson </em>we did not say that the universe of insurance-related limitations is bifurcated, exclusively, into \u201cconditions of coverage\u201d or \u201cconditions of forfeiture.\u201d Nor did we say that an insurer can waive <em>only </em>conditions of forfeiture. Rather, an insurer can waive limitations, other than conditions of forfeiture, so long as they are not conditions of coverage<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 and, here, there is no suggestion that the two-year limitation is a condition of coverage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"><em>Herman v. Valley Ins. Co., </em>145 Or App 124, 928 P2d 985 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 438 (1997), highlights the flaws in defendant\u2019s reasoning. <em>Herman </em>involved a provision analogous to ORS 742.504(12)(a), ORS 742.240, which requires that a fire insurance policy contain the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201cNo suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with, and unless commenced within 24 months next after inception of the loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">There, the insured filed a complaint within 24 months of the loss but failed to properly name the insurer as a defendant\u2014 and her amended complaint that did properly name the defendant did not relate back to the original filing. 145 Or App at 127-29. The trial court granted summary judgment, based on the plaintiffs noncompliance with the policy provision incorporating the requirements of ORS 742.240. <em>Id. </em>at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On appeal, we affirmed. In so doing, we held that the provision required under ORS 742.240 \u201cis a contract condition rather than a statute of limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 145 Or App at 130. At the same time, we rejected the plaintiffs argument that that limitation was a condition of forfeiture,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> concluding that it was, instead, a \u201csuit limitation provision\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201cA condition of forfeiture exists when \u2018there is insurance coverage for the loss in the first place, but acts of the insured nullify the coverage * * <em>ABCD...Vision v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies, </em>304 Or 301, 307, 744 P2d 998 (1987). A condition of forfeiture disallows claims that otherwise are covered under a policy. A suit limitation provision, by contrast, does not nullify insurance coverage. Rather, it precludes an insured from starting an action against its insurer once the limitation period has passed, regardless of the extent of coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Because the \u201csuit limitation provision\u201d in <em>Herman </em>was a contract condition, but neither a condition of forfeiture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>nor a condition of coverage, <em>Herman </em>illustrates that the universe of contract conditions is composed of more than just conditions of coverage and forfeiture. In addition, we held in <em>Herman </em>that \u201can insurer may be estopped from asserting a suit limitation provision as a defense to liability on an insurance policy, whether or not the provision is characterized as a condition of forfeiture.\u201d id. at 133. We perceive no principled distinction as to why, if a \u201csuit limitation provision\u201d is susceptible to estoppel, it is not similarly susceptible to waiver. Thus, by close analogy, <em>Herman </em>demonstrates that the two-year limitation at issue here can be waived by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Given that conclusion, we address, finally, whether plaintiff has raised disputed issues of material fact as to defendant\u2019s purported waiver, precluding summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201cThere is no genuine issue as to any material fact if, based upon the record before the court viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party on the matter that is the subject of the motion for summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\"><em>Schaff v. Ray\u2019s Land &amp; Sea Food Co., Inc., </em>334 Or 94, 99, 45 P3d 936 (2002) (quoting ORCP 47 C). Applying that standard, we conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could find that defendant intentionally relinquished its right to rely on the two-year limitation of ORS 742.504(12)(a), as incorporated into the UIM policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">On April 26, 2005 \u2014 over five years after the accident and three years after expiration of the two-year limitation\u2014 defendant sent plaintiffs attorney a letter that explicitly identified the accident date. In that letter, defendant acknowledged that plaintiff sought UIM benefits for her son and stated that it had \u201cdetermined that [plaintiff] <em>does have coverage under her policy for such a claim </em>* * (Emphasis added.) The letter went on to state that \u201c[t]he <em>only </em>remaining issues are liability and damages due to\u201d plaintiff. (Emphasis added.) That letter was signed by a \u201cclaim representative\u201d\u2014 and we do not understand defendant to dispute, for purposes of our review, that the representations in the letter were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>within that agent\u2019s authority and, thus, potentially were binding on defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">It may be, as defendant contended in oral argument on appeal, that, in the totality of the UIM insurance claim processing context, defendant\u2019s statements in the letter were not intended to effect a waiver and were made for other reasons. But that is a matter to be resolved by a trier of fact, and not by an appellate court. On this record, a trier of fact could find that defendant, with full knowledge, voluntarily waived its ability to assert the defense afforded by ORS 742.504(12)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> However, as noted below, with respect to the question of defendant\u2019s purported waiver, the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from defendant\u2019s statements and conduct <em>are </em>disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\"> Defendant provided PIP coverage, as well as UIM coverage, to plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> That claim was subsequently settled for Watts\u2019s liability policy limits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\"> UIM policies are subject to the same requirement by virtue of ORS 742.502(4) (\u201cUnderinsurance coverage is subject to ORS 742.504[.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-13\"> As relevant to the issues raised in this appeal, there is no substantive difference between the version of ORS 742.504(12)(a) in effect at the time of the accident and the current version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b390-14\"> At oral argument, for the first time, plaintiff suggested that there was a substantive difference between the statutory and policy language.

Plaintiff stated in her memorandum in support of her motion for summary judgment that the policy provision set out above is consistent with ORS 742.504(12)(a).

Conversely, in <em>Lindsey, </em>the plaintiffs filing of the personal injury action within two years of the accident, coupled with failure to effect timely service, did not comport with ORS 12.110 \u2014 but did satisfy ORS 742.504(12)(a)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> Defendant, at times in its brief, refers only to ORS 742.504(12)(a)(C).
