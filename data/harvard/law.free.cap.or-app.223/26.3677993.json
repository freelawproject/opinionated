Because defendant had a previous residential burglary conviction in Washington, the state sought a repeat property offender sentence of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment under ORS 137.717(l)(b) for the unauthorized use of a vehicle conviction. Defendant objected to the sentence on the ground that Washington\u2019s residential burglary statute was not comparable to ORS 164.225, because Washington law defines \u201cdwelling\u201d more broadly than does Oregon law. Defendant argued that the meaning of \u201ccomparable offenses\u201d in ORS 137.717(4)(b) \u201cequated to the definition outlined in OAR 213-004-0011(3), which includes out-of-state convictions if the elements of the offense would have constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>offense under Oregon law.\u201d The trial court nonetheless imposed the presumptive sentence after concluding that defendant\u2019s Washington conviction for residential burglary was for an offense \u201ccomparable\u201d to first-degree burglary under ORS 164.225.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">On appeal, the parties reiterate their arguments before the trial court. Those arguments present a question of statutory interpretation. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We begin with a review of the pertinent statutory framework. ORS 137.717(l)(b) authorizes the imposition of a presumptive sentence of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment where a defendant is convicted of, among other things, unauthorized use of a vehicle, ORS 164.135, and the defendant has a \u201cprevious conviction\u201d for a crime listed in ORS 137.717(l)(b)(A). Among the crimes listed in ORS 137.717(l)(b)(A) is first-degree burglary. ORS 137.717(4)(b) provides that \u201cprevious conviction\u201d includes \u201cconvictions entered in any other state or federal court for comparable offenses.\u201d ORS 137.717(6) provides that under ORS 137.717, \u201cprevious convictions must be proven pursuant to ORS 137.079.\u201d ORS 137.079(1), in turn, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">\u201cA copy of the presentence report and all other written information concerning the defendant that the court considers in the imposition of sentence shall be made available to the district attorney, the defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel at least five judicial days before the sentencing of the defendant. All other written information, when received by the court outside the presence of counsel, shall either be summarized by the court in a memorandum available for inspection or summarized by the court on the record before sentence is imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Thus, where a defendant has a previous out-of-state conviction and is convicted of one of the crimes listed in ORS 137.717(l)(b), a sentencing court must determine whether that out-of-state conviction was for an offense comparable to one of the offenses listed in ORS 137.717(l)(b)(A). In doing so, the sentencing court is obliged to follow the timelines and disclosure requirements set out in ORS 137.079.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">With that background in mind, we turn to the issue at hand, the meaning of \u201ccomparable offenses\u201d under ORS 137.717(4)(b). \u201c[0]ffenses\u201d is defined by ORS 161.505 as \u201cconduct for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment or to a fine is provided by any law of this state or by any law or ordinance of a political subdivision of this state.\u201d \u201cComparable\u201d is not statutorily defined. However, its ordinary meaning is \u201c[cjapable of being compared: a: having enough like characteristics or qualities to make comparison appropriate.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Third Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>461 (unabridged ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>2002). Read together, \u201ccomparable offenses\u201d refers to offenses that are capable of being compared with one another; that is, offenses having enough like characteristics or qualities to make comparison between them appropriate. Thus, the inquiry under ORS 137.717(4)(b) is directed to the text of both the foreign statute and the Oregon statute and asks whether the conduct criminalized by the Oregon statute shares enough like characteristics or qualities with the conduct criminalized by the foreign statute to make comparison between them appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Defendant\u2019s Washington conviction was for residential burglary. \u201cA person is guilty of residential burglary if, with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein, the person enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling other than a vehicle.\u201d RCW 9A.52.025. ORS 164.225, in turn, provides that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree if the person violates ORS 164.215 and the building is a dwelling.\u201d ORS 164.215 provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in ORS 164.255, a person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Preliminarily, defendant argues that the trial court could not properly determine whether his Washington conviction was for a \u201ccomparable offense,\u201d because the charging instrument relating to that offense did not contain sufficient factual detail regarding the circumstances of the offense. However, in concluding that the Washington offense was comparable, the court explicitly disclaimed reliance on the charging instrument. In doing so, the court correctly framed its inquiry. The determination of comparability under ORS 137.717(4)(b) presents a legal question to be resolved by an examination of the text of the statutes under which a defendant has been convicted, not the charging instrument underlying the out-of-state conviction. <em>See generally State v. Rawleigh, </em>222 Or App 121, 125, 192 P3d 292 (2008) (determination of whether foreign statute was a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d resolved by examining the wording of each statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Defendant\u2019s principal argument is that, because \u201cdwelling\u201d has, in his view, been given a broader interpretation under Washington law than under Oregon law, RCW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>9A.52.025 is not comparable to ORS 164.225.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s argument misses the mark. If the legislature had intended for the fit between the Oregon and foreign statutes to be identical, it could have said so; it did not, and we do not lightly discount its choice of a broad term such as \u201ccomparable.\u201d <em>See, e g., State v. Mersman, </em>216 Or App 194, 203, 172 P3d 654 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 390 (2008) (\u201cWhere the legislature intends to require element matching or criminal equivalence * * * it knows how to explicitly say so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In that regard, the inquiry under ORS 137.717(4)(b) is similar to the inquiry required by ORS 813.010 for determining whether a foreign conviction was entered under a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d of Oregon\u2019s DUII statute. <em>Cf Rawleigh, </em>222 Or App at 128 (concluding that, for purposes of diversion eligibility under ORS 813.215, Washington\u2019s general DUII statute is a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to Oregon\u2019s general DUII statute notwithstanding possible differences in the scope of its application). As we explained in <em>Rawleigh </em>and <em>Mersman, </em>a foreign statute is a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d where the statute is \u201cremarkably similar or ha[s] the same use, role or characteristics.\u201d <em>Rawleigh, </em>222 Or App at 126; <em>Mersman, </em>216 Or App at 203-04. If anything, the term \u201ccomparable offenses\u201d is broader in scope than \u201cstatutory counterpart.\u201d Unlike the determination of whether statutes are \u201ccounterparts,\u201d comparability does not require that the foreign statute have the same use, role, or characteristics, but merely that it share enough like characteristics or qualities with an Oregon statute such that comparison between them is appropriate. ROW 9A.52.025, like ORS 164.225, is a felony burglary statute that criminalizes unlawful entry into a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein. That is sufficient, despite minor possible differences in scope, for the offenses to share enough like characteristics or qualities so as to make comparison between them appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Defendant remonstrates that ORS 137.717(6) requires that a previous conviction must be \u201cproven pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to ORS 137.079.\u201d According to defendant, the reference to ORS 137.079 demonstrates that the legislature intended the determination of whether out-of-state convictions are previous convictions under ORS 137.717(4)(b) to be governed by the sentencing guidelines, and, in particular, OAR 213-004-0011(1). That rule provides that, in calculating criminal history under the guidelines, \u201c[a]n out-of-state adult conviction shall be used to classify the offender\u2019s criminal history if the elements of the offense would have constituted a felony or Class A misdemeanor under current Oregon law.\u201d Defendant further reasons that, because the term \u201cdwelling\u201d has been construed more broadly under the Washington statute than under the Oregon statute, the two statutes have different elements. We need not decide whether the latter assertion is correct because, even if it is, the quoted rule does not govern the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">ORS 137.079 prescribes the procedure by which the fact of a previous conviction must be proved, including the procedure for setting out and challenging criminal history under the felony sentencing guidelines, and the state\u2019s burden of proof in a determination of criminal history. ORS 137.079(4), (5). Thus, the reference in ORS 137.717(6) to 137.079 is similarly procedural. Nothing in either of those provisions refers to OAR 213-004-0011(1) or the test for determining whether an out-of-state conviction is for a comparable offense to a qualifying previous offense under Oregon law. Moreover, ORS 137.717(4)(b) is concerned with the particular issue of sentence enhancement for repeat property offenders and requires only that the previous conviction be for a \u201ccomparable offense.\u201d OAR 213-004-0011(1) in contrast addresses the broader issue of calculating criminal history under the sentencing guidelines and requires that the <em>\u201celements </em>of the offense [constituting the prior conviction] * * * have constituted a felony or Class A misdemeanor under current Oregon law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, if the legislature had intended the inquiry under ORS 137.717(4)(b) to be the same as that required by OAR 213-004-0011, it could have expressly required element matching, not comparability. <em>Cf. Mersman, </em>216 Or App at 203; <em>State v. Young, </em>183 Or App 400, 407, 52 P3d 1102 (2002) (holding, in a different context, that, where there is a conflict between ORS 137.717 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>requirements of the sentencing guidelines, \u201cORS 137.717 must prevail\u201d). It is significant that it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Because the trial court correctly concluded that defendant\u2019s Washington residential burglary conviction was for a comparable offense to the offense of first-degree burglary in Oregon, the trial court did not err in imposing a presumptive repeat property offender sentence for defendant\u2019s current conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\"> ORS 137.717(l)(b) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">\u201cWhen a court sentences a person convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u2021 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">\u201c(b) * * * unauthorized use of a vehicle under ORS 164.135 * * * the presumptive sentence is 13 months of incarceration, unless the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission prescribe a longer presumptive sentence, if the person has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">\u201c(A) A previous conviction for * * * burglary in the first degree under ORS 164.225[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-11\"> ORS 137.717 also provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\">\u201c(4) As used in this section, \u2018previous conviction\u2019 includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-14\">\u201c(b) Convictions entered in any other state or federal court for comparable offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-15\">\u00absH :js sj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-16\">\u201c(6) For purposes of this section, previous convictions must be proven pursuant to ORS 137.079.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"> The remainder of ORS 137.079 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">\u201c(2) The court may except from disclosure parts of the presentence report or other written information described in subsection (1) of this section which are not relevant to a proper sentence, diagnostic opinions which might seriously disrupt a program of rehabilitation if known by the defendant, or sources of information which were obtainable with an expectation of confidentiality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201c(3) If parts of the presentence report or other written information described in subsection (1) of this section are not disclosed under subsection (2) of this section, the court shall inform the parties that information has not been disclosed and shall state for the record the reasons for the court\u2019s action.
