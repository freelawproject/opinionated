After a jury trial, he was convicted of first-degree rape, coercion, first-degree criminal mistreatment, fourth-degree assault, harassment, first-degree sodomy, and first- and third-degree sexual abuse of the victims. He appeals from those judgments of conviction and from the sentence imposed by the trial court, arguing that the court erred in admitting evidence obtained in an unlawful search; in admitting evidence of prior uncharged crimes; in refusing to use one of his requested jury instructions; and in imposing consecutive sentences based on facts that were not found by the jury or admitted by him. We remand for resentencing but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The Lake County Sheriffs Department received a report that H had been raped by defendant, her father. Deputy Sheriff Pore received the assignment to respond. He drove to the residence where H, her sister A, her mother, and defendant lived. He spoke with H privately and asked her if the report of rape was true. She indicated that it was. He then explained to her mother why he was there and informed her that he would be transporting H to the police station to conduct an interview. Pore and H departed together for the police station. H\u2019s mother followed shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">H\u2019s mother was present during the first part of the interview, but, at H\u2019s request, she was asked to leave part way through it. During the interview, H stated that she had been sexually abused by defendant and that the abuse had occurred in several locations, including the shop adjacent to the family residence. She stated that, prior to each incident of abuse in the shop, defendant would place a light-colored cloth on the floor for her to sit on and that, after the abuse had ended, he would leave the cloth on a nearby bench. H told Pore that she had last seen some of those cloths approximately two days before the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Based on that interview, Pore believed that he had probable cause that a crime had been committed and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>evidence of that crime, including the cloths described by H, could be found at the family residence. Instead of applying for a warrant, however, he alerted other officers and requested their assistance, then returned to the residence with those officers and knocked on the front door. Receiving no response, he contacted the police station and requested that H\u2019s mother, who was still there, return to the family property. When H\u2019s mother arrived, Pore asked for her consent to search the property, informing her that \u201che had probable cause to believe a crime had occurred, and that evidence of a crime was on the property and he wished to collect the evidence.\u201d She refused. He then told her that \u201che would be requesting a search warrant,\u201d and that, \u201cwhile it was up to a judge to decide if a warrant would be issued, * * * in his experience, he had sufficient probable cause and he had never been denied a request for a search warrant.\u201d He further stated that, \u201cduring his request for the warranty she would not have free roam of the property\u2019 and that \u201che would seal the property until he had obtained the warrant.\u201d That conversation lasted approximately 10 minutes and ended when H\u2019s mother consented to the search. Pore and another officer then found and seized the cloths that H had described inside the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In his first assignment of error, defendant advances three interrelated arguments to support the contention that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence, including the cloths, seized during the officers\u2019 search of the family residence. First, he argues that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent was invalid because it was derived from an unlawful seizure. Second, he argues that, even if the consent did not derive from a prior illegality, it was nonetheless involuntary because she merely acquiesced to the search. Third, he argues that her consent was involuntary because it was given in response to \u201ca threat to take unauthorized action,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a threat to seal the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number> The premise of defendant\u2019s first argument \u2014 that the seizure of the property led to H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent, and therefore occurred before it \u2014 cannot be reconciled with the court\u2019s findings of fact. Property is seized for purposes of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, when there is significant interference with a person\u2019s possessory or ownership interests in the property. <em>State v. Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or 1, 6, 942 P2d 772 (1997). Thus, in accordance with that principle, if Pore and the other officers had sealed the property, that sealing would have effected a seizure. In this case, however, the trial court found that interference was <em>threatened, </em>but never effected. Specifically, it found that Pore told H\u2019s mother that he <em>\u201cwould </em>be requesting a search warrant\u201d; that <em>\u201cduring [that] request </em>for the warranty she would not have free roam of the property\u2019; and that, \u201cin essence[,] he <em>would </em>seal the property until he [had] obtained a warrant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because those findings are supported by evidence in the record, we are bound by them. We agree with the state that no seizure of property occurred in this case; we therefore reject defendant\u2019s first argument that the consent derived from an unlawful seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"> In his remaining arguments, defendant contends that, even if the consent did not derive from a prior illegality, it was nonetheless invalid because it was not voluntary. It is axiomatic that, although a warrantless search is lawful if consented to, the consent must be voluntary, and the state bears the burden of proving voluntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>319 Or 212, 219, 874 P2d 1322 (1994); <em>State v. Stevens, </em>311 Or 119, 137, 806 P2d 92 (1991). The relevant inquiry guiding our analysis of that issue is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the consent was given by an act of free will, as opposed to resulting from coercion, express or implied. <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 20, 115 P3d 908 (2005). In making that determination, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact if they are supported by evidence. <em>State v. Charlesworth/Parks, </em>151 Or App 100, 113, 951 P2d 153 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 82 (1998). Whether those facts establish that the consent was voluntary, however, is a legal issue that we review independently. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Defendant advances two arguments in support of his contention that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent was involuntary. He first argues that she merely acquiesced to the search. We agree that \u201cmere acquiescence\u201d to police authority is not voluntary consent. <em>State v. Little, </em>249 Or 297, 302, 431 P2d 810 (1967), <em>cert den, </em>390 US 955 (1968); <em>State v. Davis, </em>133 Or App 467, 474, 891 P2d 1373, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 429 (1995). Such acquiescence occurs when an individual is not given a reasonable opportunity to choose to consent or when he or she is informed that a search will occur regardless of whether consent is given. <em>State v. Guzman, </em>164 Or App 90, 99, 990 P2d 370 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 191 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>State v. Freund, </em>102 Or App 647, 796 P2d 656 (1990), is illustrative. In that case, a police officer told the defendant that he was at her residence \u201cto pick up the marijuana plants that she was growing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649 (internal quotation marks omitted). When the defendant did not respond, the officer repeated that he was there to pick up the plants and that he \u201cwanted to do it as calmly [and] efficiently as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original). We held that the officer\u2019s statement could not be characterized as a request for consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201cThe officer stated that \u2018he was there\u2019 to pick up the marijuana and \u2018he wanted\u2019 to do it calmly. The words used in the first phrase are unconditional; they do not invite a response other than acquiescence. In contrast, the words in the second phrase are supplicatory and do invite a response. Read together, the officer\u2019s statement told defendant that she had no choice whether a search would occur; her only option was whether the search and seizure was to be \u2018calm and efficient.\u2019 Defendant merely chose the option favoring calmness and efficiency * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 652; <em>accord State v. Lowe, </em>144 Or App 313, 318, 926 P2d 332 (1996) (no voluntary consent to field sobriety tests where officer \u201c \u2018had\u2019 [the] defendant get out of the car\u201d because \u201c[t]hat is the language of a command\u201d); <em>State v. Will, </em>131 Or App 498, 506, 885 P2d 715 (1994) (the defendant\u2019s failure to object to officer\u2019s reentry into premises, after officer stated that \u201c \u2018he would be seizing the narcotic paraphernalia,\u2019 \u201d was mere acquiescence).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In contrast, in <em>State v. Ry</em>/<em>Guinto, </em>211 Or App 298, 305-07, 154 P3d 724, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007), we held that the defendant had voluntarily consented where an officer, over the course of approximately one minute, repeatedly, and with \u201cdogged persistence,\u201d expressed his desire to search the defendant\u2019s car for weapons and sought his consent to do so. During that period, the officer told the defendant seven times \u201ceither that he would like to\u2019 or \u2018want[ed] to\u2019 search the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. At one point, he explicitly asked for consent. At another, he directed the defendant to step out of the car\u2014 \u201c \u2018I\u2019d like you to step out if you would please and let me search your vehicle for a weapon\u2019 \u201d \u2014 but immediately thereafter returned to the former \u201c I\u2019d like to search\u2019 \u201d phrasing, expressing that desire twice more. <em>Id. </em>Considering the totality of the circumstances in that case, we concluded that the officer\u2019s phrasing expressed his desire to receive consent as well as his understanding that he could not search without it and that his isolated directive was not problematic because it was preceded and followed by nonimperative requests. <em>Id. </em>at 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"> In the present case, we disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion that H\u2019s mother\u2019s \u201csubmission to the search was mere acquiescence, and not consent.\u201d Pore testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cWhat I told [H\u2019s mother] was that again, she was free. She did not have to let me search, * * * that I was going to make application for a search warrant. I stressed that it did not mean that I was going to get it but that I was going to apply for a search warrant. * * * That I probably would get the warrant, but again, told her it did not guarantee that I would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question, \u201cDid you give her time to decide or did you tell [her] you were going [to] search no matter what?\u201d Pore responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cThere was no issue of I am going to search no matter what because if she had denied consent, then whether or not I was going to search was going to be up to the Court, not up to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The trial court evidently believed Pore; it found that he \u201casked\u201d H\u2019s mother for her consent. Pore expressed a desire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>to receive consent and conveyed to H\u2019s mother his understanding that he could not search without it. Pore\u2019s statements did not indicate that a search was to occur \u201cregardless of whether consent [was] given,\u201d <em>Guzman, </em>164 Or App at 99, but, rather, that a search would occur if and <em>when </em>a warrant was successfully obtained. An officer is free to inform a person that, in the event that consent is withheld, he will seek a search warrant. <em>State v. Hirsch, </em>267 Or 613, 622, 518 P2d 649 (1974). Pore\u2019s statement that he had previously been successful in obtaining search warrants, while meant to influence H\u2019s mother\u2019s decision, does not, under the circumstances, render her consent involuntary. The state has therefore met its burden to show that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent was not \u201cmere acquiescence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Finally, we consider defendant\u2019s argument that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent was involuntary because it resulted from Pore\u2019s threat to seal the property while he obtained a search warrant. That threat, defendant argues, constituted a material misrepresentation of what the law permitted because Pore \u201clacked authority to seize the property and oust [H\u2019s mother] from it.\u201d Such a misrepresentation, according to defendant, rendered the consent involuntary. In support of that argument, he cites Justice Carson\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>State v. Williamson, </em>307 Or 621, 772 P2d 404 (1989), for the proposition that police officers may not threaten to do what the law prohibits because such threats constitute constitutionally impermissible coercion. In that case, the officer told the defendant that, unless the defendant consented, he would detain the defendant\u2019s truck until he could obtain a warrant. Justice Carson concluded that the officer \u201ccould not lawfully assert that he would detain the [truck because] his statement that he would do so was a material misrepresentation of what the law permitted, consequently invalidating [the] defendant\u2019s consent to search.\u201d 307 Or at 627 (Carson, J., concurring); <em>accord Hall, </em>339 Or at 21 (recognizing and outlining \u201cmaterial misrepresentation\u201d argument). The state concedes that consent to search may be rendered involuntary if given in response to an officer\u2019s false claim of authority, but contends that defendant failed to preserve that argument for appeal. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>To preserve an argument for appeal, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Rules of preservation are meant to ensure that the parties\u2019 positions are presented clearly to the trial court and that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied opportunities to meet an argument. <em>State v. Olivar, </em>216 Or App 126, 135, 171 P3d 1006 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 110 (2008). The question of whether Pore materially misrepresented that he could lawfully seal defendant\u2019s property while attempting to obtain a search warrant was never presented to the trial court. Defendant argued only that the officers <em>had </em>unlawfully seized the property \u2014 an argument that we have rejected \u2014 and that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent was a product of that unlawful seizure. Had defendant argued \u201cmaterial misrepresentation,\u201d the trial court could have determined whether exigent circumstances had justified the <em>threatened </em>warrant-less seizure of the property \u2014 a determination that the trial court did not make and on which we express no opinion. The argument that was presented to the trial court, however\u2014 that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent derived from an unlawful seizure\u2014 required no such determination. Thus, because the trial court \u201cwas not alerted to the substance of defendant\u2019s [\u2018material misrepresentation\u2019] position on appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 136, we will not consider that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In sum, we reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error. The search that yielded the evidence that defendant sought to suppress was a valid consent search. It did not derive from a prior illegality, nor was it mere acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In his second assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court should have granted his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that he (a) sexually assaulted H and A in 1997, (b) physically assaulted H and A, and (c) physically assaulted their mother. At the pretrial hearing on that motion, defendant argued that the evidence was propensity evidence and thus inadmissible under OEC 404(3). Alternatively, he argued that, to the extent that the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>admissible under OEC 404(3), it was inadmissible under OEC 403 because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected both of those arguments. On appeal, defendant renews the arguments that he made at trial regarding the admissibility of the evidence under OEC 404(3) and OEC 403. He also contends that the evidence should have been excluded in accordance with the doctrine of issue preclusion. The state responds that the trial court properly admitted the evidence and that defendant\u2019s issue preclusion argument is not preserved. We agree with the state on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We begin with a brief discussion of the legal principles governing our analysis of defendant\u2019s arguments under the Oregon Evidence Code. OEC 404(3) \u2014 in accordance with the general prohibition in OEC 404(2) against the use of evidence of a person\u2019s character to prove that the person \u201cacted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion\u201d \u2014 prohibits the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that the person has acted in conformity with that character, but allows for the use of such evidence for any other relevant purpose. <em>See State v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 548, 725 P2d 312 (1986) (OEC 404(3) is inclusionary rather than exclusionary). Whether evidence of prior bad acts is relevant for a noncharacter purpose, and thus admissible under OEC 404(3), is a question of law. <em>State v. Westby, </em>117 Or App 14, 17-18, 843 P2d 973 (1992), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>124 Or App 265, 862 P2d 1318 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 351 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">However, OEC 404(3) does not <em>require </em>that the court admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts; it provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>only that such evidence \u201cmay * * * be admissible.\u201d Thus, even if evidence of prior bad acts qualifies for admission under OEC 404(3), it may nonetheless be excluded under OEC 403 if the probative value of the evidence is \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d Thus, in general, to be admitted under OEC 404(3),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">\u201c(1) [t]he evidence must be independently relevant for a noncharacter purpose; (2) the proponent of the evidence must offer sufficient proof that the uncharged misconduct was committed and that [the] defendant committed it; and (3) the probative value of the uncharged misconduct evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the dangers or considerations set forth in OEC 403.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>State v. Johnson, </em>313 Or 189, 195, 832 P2d 443 (1992) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In criminal actions, however, OEC 404(4) provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts by the defendant is admissible if relevant except as otherwise provided by the state or federal constitutions or certain statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Wyant, </em>217 Or App 199, 204, 175 P3d 988 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 558 (2008) (\u201cOEC 404(4) * * * does not permit * * * balancing under OEC 403, unless it is required by due process considerations.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Phillips, </em>217 Or App 93, 98, 174 P3d 1032 (2007) (OEC 404(4) does not permit balancing under OEC 403, except as required by state or federal constitution); <em>State v. Cavaner, </em>206 Or App 131, 135, 135 P3d 402 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 197 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We first address whether the evidence was relevant for a noncharacter purpose under OEC 404(3). We begin with the allegations that defendant sexually assaulted H and A in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>1997. The trial court admitted evidence of those allegations, as noted above, stating that the evidence was \u201crelevant * * * to show a pattern. As far as [defendant having allegedly-engaged in similar type of conduct over a long period of time.\u201d Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence on that basis \u201cconstituted admitting it to prove propensity.\u201d However, evidence of other sexual contacts between a defendant and a particular victim offered to show the sexual predisposition that the defendant had for that victim is relevant for a noncharacter purpose \u2014 that is, to show the sexual inclination of the defendant towards that victim. <em>State v. McKay, </em>309 Or 305, 308, 787 P2d 479 (1990). Thus, evidence of the 1997 allegations was admissible to show defendant\u2019s sexual predisposition toward H and A. Because the trial court correctly admitted the evidence, then, it is unnecessary to determine whether the trial court\u2019s stated basis for admitting it \u2014 \u201cto show a pattern\u201d \u2014 was the correct basis. <em>See State v. Nielsen, </em>316 Or 611, 629, 853 P2d 256 (1993) (\u201cWhere a trial judge makes a correct ruling admitting evidence but articulates an erroneous reason for it, there is no need to reverse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Regarding the evidence of defendant\u2019s past physical abuse of H, A, and their mother, defendant does not challenge on appeal the trial court\u2019s admission of that evidence as relevant for a noncharacter purpose under OEC 404(3)\u2014 namely, that the evidence was relevant to show why H and A may have delayed in disclosing the abuse. In any event, such an argument would be unavailing. <em>See State v. Zybach, </em>308 Or 96, 99-100, 775 P2d 318 (1989) (evidence offered to show why a victim delayed in reporting incidents of sexual abuse is relevant for a noncharacter purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Defendant argues, however, that, even if the trial court did not err in concluding that the contested evidence was relevant under OEC 404(3), under OEC 403, the evidence was nonetheless inadmissible because the danger of unfair prejudice resulting from its admission outweighed its probative value. The state responds that OEC 403 does not provide a basis for excluding the evidence because OEC 404(4) now provides that, in criminal actions, the admission of other relevant crimes, wrongs, or acts by a defendant is limited only by the state or federal constitution or statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>that do not apply in this case. Defendant, while \u201cacknowledging] that OEC 404(4) adds a complication to an OEC 403 analysis,\u201d nonetheless maintains that OEC 404(4)(a), by its plain terms, requires OEC 403 balancing because (1) OEC 403 \u201ccodifies a due process requirement\u201d; and (2), to the extent that OEC 404(4) would deprive criminal defendants of the use of OEC 403 while leaving it available to the prosecution, that rule \u201cviolate[s] the due process requirement that rules of criminal procedure be available to both parties equally.\u201d To the extent that defendant is arguing that OEC 403 requires balancing in every case as a matter of constitutional law, that argument cannot be squared with <em>Wyant, Phillips, </em>and <em>Cavaner, </em>cases in which we held that the constitution did not require balancing. Further, in the present case, the state did not avail itself of OEC 403 balancing; we therefore have no occasion to consider defendant\u2019s due process argument based on differential treatment. He presents no other argument in support of his contention that admitting the evidence without balancing in this particular case violates the Due Process Clause. Thus, in accordance with <em>Wyant, Phillips, </em>and <em>Cavaner, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of OEC 404(4) as applied here and conclude that the trial court properly admitted the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Defendant\u2019s final argument with respect to his second assignment of error is that the state was estopped from introducing evidence of the 1997 allegations of defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of H and A in defendant\u2019s criminal trial because it had previously, in a jurisdictional hearing before the juvenile court pursuant to ORS 419B.100, failed to prove, \u201cby a preponderance of competent evidence,\u201d that the acts underlying those allegations had occurred. ORS 419B.310(3);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see also Rugemer v. Rhea, </em>153 Or App 400, 410, 957 P2d 184 (1998) (proponent has burden to \u201cprove by a preponderance of the evidence * * * that the [uncharged misconduct] occurred and that the person against whom it is offered committed it\u201d). Thus, defendant contends, because the \u201cstate had to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>exactly what it tried but failed to do in the 1997 jurisdictional <em>hearing\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., prove by a preponderance of the \u00e9vidence that the allegations occurred \u2014 the doctrine of issue preclusion applies with respect to those allegations. The state responds that defendant failed to preserve that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In the pretrial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion <em>in lim-ine, </em>defense counsel informed the trial court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cWe believe that there are two issues. One, you have to make a determination that these acts occurred, that there was a likelihood these acts occurred * * *. You have to make a determination. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cMy understanding, particularly in the \u201997 case was there was a determination by the sitting Circuit Court Judge that these acts did not occur to the basis that he would not grant jurisdiction [to] the juvenile court. So, one you got sort of a <em>res judicata </em>issue or I guess it is a claim[ ] preclusion issue. Another judge has ruled there wasn\u2019t enough evidence. You have to go back and say well, I think there was and I guess that is an issue you will have to decide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Defendant asserts that the above statements constituted an argument to the trial court that \u201cpreclusion principles barred the state from using the [1997] allegations in [defendant\u2019s] criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred, defendant\u2019s statements to the trial court invited that error. An appellant who \u201cwas actively instrumental in bringing * * * about\u201d an error \u201ccannot be heard to complain, and the case ought not to be reversed because of it.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Oregon Railroad Co., </em>45 Or 211, 217, 77 P 119 (1904). The doctrine of \u201cinvited error\u201d is usually invoked when a party invites the trial court to rule in a certain way and the circumstances suggest that the party will be bound by the ruling or, at least, will not later seek a reversal on the basis of the ruling. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>201 Or App 261, 270, 119 P3d 794 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 34 (2006). The doctrine\u2019s purpose is \u201cto ensure that parties do not blame the court for their intentional or strategic trial choices that later prove unwise and then, to the trial court\u2019s surprise, use the error that they invited to obtain a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>omitted). Here, defendant expressly invited the trial court to decide whether there was enough evidence that defendant had committed the 1997 allegations to admit them under OEC 404(3). Defendant therefore cannot assert any such error as a basis for reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In his third assignment of error, defendant argues that, if we decide that the evidence of prior bad acts was admissible, we should nonetheless hold that the trial court erred in refusing to give defendant\u2019s proposed limiting instruction to the jury regarding that evidence. Defendant contends that the court\u2019s instruction was incomplete in two respects: It failed to inform the jurors that they could not consider the evidence of prior bad acts to conclude that defendant had acted in conformity with the allegations of that misconduct, and it did not describe the purposes for which the jury <em>could </em>consider that evidence. As explained below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The trial court gave the following instruction regarding the uncharged conduct evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cThe [dlefendant\u2019s character is not an issue in this case. By that I mean, whether the [dlefendant is a good person or a bad person. The issue is whether the [dlefendant is guilty of the crime charged. Now you have heard evidence of alleged crimes, wrongs or acts not charged in the indictment. While you may consider the evidence, such evidence is not to be considered to prove [dlefendant\u2019s character, because as I have told you, the [dlefendant\u2019s character is not an issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Defendant proposed the following supplemental instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">\u2018You have heard evidence of other acts and crimes that are not charged in the indictments. While you may consider such evidence in your deliberations, you may not consider such evidence to conclude that because the defendant may have engaged in those acts in the past, that he committed the crimes charged in the indictments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">The court refused to give defendant\u2019s instruction and defendant took exception, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t argue with what you read, but I don\u2019t believe it goes far enough in explaining the propensity evidence, and the propensity rule under [OEC 404(3)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number> Where evidence is admitted for a limited purpose\u2014 such as for a relevant noncharacter purpose under OEC 404(3), as in this case \u2014 it is error for the court to refuse to give a requested instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence to that noncharacter purpose. <em>State v. Reyes, </em>209 Or 595, 630-31, 308 P2d 182 (1957). However, such refusal is error only if the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction is clear and correct in all respects, both in form and in substance. <em>Beglau v. Albertus, </em>272 Or 170, 179, 536 P2d 1251 (1975). In this case, defendant\u2019s proposed instruction is neither clear nor correct. It states that the jury could not consider the prior bad acts evidence \u201cto conclude that because the defendant may have engaged in those acts in the past, that he committed the crimes charged in the indictments.\u201d That instruction suggests, or at least might be construed to suggest, that the jury could not consider the evidence at all in deciding whether defendant was or was not guilty of the acts charged. As explained above, however, evidence of the earlier acts was relevant to the determination of defendant\u2019s guilt because it showed defendant\u2019s sexual predisposition toward H and A, and it showed why H and A may have delayed in disclosing the abuse; the evidence, then, <em>could </em>properly be considered in determining whether defendant was guilty. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant\u2019s proposed instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In his fourth assignment of error, defendant maintains that, in imposing consecutive sentences based on facts not found by a jury, the trial court ran afoul of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), as construed in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), <em>cert </em>granted,_US_, 128 S Ct 1657 (2008) (facts supporting imposition of consecutive sentences must be admitted or found by a jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The law and facts involved in that assignment are procedural in nature and not in dispute. As relevant to this case, the court may impose consecutive sentences for offenses that \u201cdo not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct,\u201d ORS 137.123(2), and, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>offenses <em>do </em>arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, when they involve injury to different victims, ORS 137.123(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In Case Number A128652, defendant was charged with one count of first-degree rape, ORS 163.375 (Count 1), and three counts of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405 (Counts 2 through 4). As to each of those counts, the indictment alleged that the offense occurred \u201cbetween the 15th day of April, 2002 and the 20th day of March, 2004,\u201d and that the victim was H. Counts 2 through 4 also alleged where each offense occurred: Count 2 \u201cwhile on the couch,\u201d Count 3 \u201cwhile in the victim\u2019s bedroom,\u201d and Count 4 \u201cwhile in the defendant\u2019s shop.\u201d The jury instructions and jury verdict forms differentiated among Counts 2 through 4 on that basis, identifying the site of each offense (\u201con the couch,\u201d \u201cin victim\u2019s bedroom,\u201d and \u201cin the defendant\u2019s shop\u201d). A jury found defendant guilty of those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In Case Number A128654, defendant was charged with one count each of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405 (Count 1), and first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427 (Count 2). As to both counts, the indictment alleged that the victim was A. It further alleged that the offense in Count 1 occurred \u201cbetween the 1st day of January, 2004 and the 27th day of June, 2004,\u201d and that the offense in Count 2 occurred \u201cbetween the 27th day of June, 2003 and the 27th day of June, 2004\u201d and \u201cwhile in the defendant\u2019s bedroom.\u201d The jury instructions and jury verdict forms both contained the same detail regarding the location of the offense charged in Count 2. A jury found defendant guilty of both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objection that <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Ice </em>required jury findings in support of consecutive sentences, the trial court ordered that the sentences for Counts 1 through 4 in Case Number A128652 be served consecutively; that the sentence for Count 1 in Case Number A128654 be served consecutively to the sentence for Count 1 in Case Number A128652; and that the sentences for Counts 1 and 2 in Case Number A128654 be served consecutively to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">On appeal, defendant reasserts his Apprendi/ <em>Blakely </em>challenge. The state, while maintaining that <em>Ice </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>decided incorrectly, acknowledges that <em>Ice </em>is controlling in this case as to the legal principle, but urges this court to nonetheless affirm defendant\u2019s sentence on the ground that any error in failing to obtain a jury finding in support of consecutive sentences was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We first consider whether, on this record, the jury necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt the facts to support the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences, in which case there is no error; in some cases it may be possible to determine from a jury\u2019s guilty verdict that the jury actually and necessarily found those facts, albeit implicitly, <em>see State v. Hagberg, </em>345 Or 161,169,190 P3d 1209 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We cannot say that, by finding defendant guilty of Counts 1 through 4 in Case Number A128652, the jury necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt the facts necessary to support the imposition of consecutive sentences as to those counts. The indictment in that case alleged that each of the offenses occurred during the same time period \u2014 between April 15, 2002 and March 20, 2004 \u2014 and that each involved the same victim \u2014 H\u2014and there is nothing in the jury verdict forms to indicate that the offenses did not occur as part of one continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct. ORS 137.123(2). Similarly, we cannot say that the jury necessarily found that the offenses in Counts 1 and 2 in Case Number A128654 did not occur as part of one continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct because the time periods within which the indictment alleges that the offenses charged in those counts occurred overlap to some degree \u2014 that is, between January 1, 2004 and June 27, 2004 \u2014 and the jury instructions and verdict forms contain no further clarification. It follows that the trial court violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment jury trial rights when it ordered those sentences to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The question remains whether that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>State v. Bowen, </em>220 Or App 380, 383, 185 P3d 1129 (2008), we held that, where \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence at trial established that the multiple counts of which the defendant was convicted were distinct from another, we could say with \u201ccomplete confidence\u201d that, on remand, the jury would have found that the offenses did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>not occur as part of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct for purposes of ORS 137.123(2). Accordingly, we concluded in that case that the court\u2019s error in imposing consecutive sentences under that statute, and based on facts not found by a jury, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Bowen, </em>220 Or App at 383-84. We do not reach the same conclusion in this case. We are not persuaded by the scant record as to that issue that the jury would have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offenses charged in Counts 1 through 4 of Case Number A128652 and Counts 1 and 2 of Case Number A128654 did not occur as part of one continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing. ORS 138.222(5)(a) (if appellate court finds any sentencing error, the court \u201cshall remand the entire case for resentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\"> Defendant acknowledges that H\u2019s mother\u2019s consent, if valid, established the lawfulness of the officers\u2019 search of the family residence and the seizure of the cloths. <em>See, e.g., State v.
