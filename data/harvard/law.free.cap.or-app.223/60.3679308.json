J.</author>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Defendant appeals judgments of conviction in two consolidated criminal cases. In Case Number A129627, defendant was convicted of two counts of second-degree assault and one count of recklessly endangering another person. In Case Number A129268, defendant was convicted of one count each of reckless driving, felony fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, and misdemeanor fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer. Regarding Case Number A129627, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a unanimous verdict instruction to the jury and to the court\u2019s imposition of restitution without requiring the state to prove a causal connection between the damage incurred and an offense committed by defendant. The state concedes that the court erred in the latter regard. Defendant\u2019s last assignment of error relates to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the misdemeanor fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer charge in Case Number A129268. We agree with the parties and accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court erred with regard to its imposition of restitution. In the two other respects asserted by defendant as error, however, the trial court did not err. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing in Case Number A129267, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant rented out riding horses to campers near a lake that was a popular camping spot. One afternoon, defendant argued with one of the campers, Coyle. Later that evening, defendant rode a horse to several campsites looking for Coyle. Defendant found Coyle at a campsite with several other campers, including Pearce, Sanks, Sanks\u2019s niece and her friend, and Fergerson, Coyle\u2019s girlfriend. Defendant attempted to strike Pearce with an ax handle, which Pearce wrestled away from defendant. Defendant then rode away on the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Pearce and Fergerson left to call the police. Coyle and Sanks sat around the campfire, discussing what to do if defendant came back. Defendant returned some time later and rode the horse into them, knocking them both to the ground. Coyle suffered fractured ribs and abrasions; Sanks fractured his collar bone.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Coyle ran to the edge of the lake and jumped in the water to hide from defendant. When Coyle heard defendant move on to another campsite, Coyle came out of the water and hid under a tree. Meanwhile, Sanks left in his car with his niece and her friend. They drove to a house down the road from the lake and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Three police officers arrived in the area shortly thereafter. They first made contact with Sanks, who was still at the house down the road from the lake. Sanks told them that defendant was on horseback and was chasing people down by the lake. When the officers arrived at the lake, they saw defendant riding a horse toward them. They announced their presence, shined their flashlights on him, and told him to stop; defendant rode away. The officers searched for defendant, but did not find him. They also interviewed the campers who were still at the lake, including Pearce, Fergerson, and Coyle. At some point after the incident, Sanks discovered that the tires on his car had been slashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Two weeks later, a police officer saw defendant driving a vehicle while not wearing a seatbelt. The officer activated his overhead lights, but defendant did not pull over. Instead, defendant drove away, running a stop sign, exceeding posted speed limits, and crossing the lines of his lane. The officer turned on his siren and chased defendant. Other police officers joined the chase, including one who pulled in front of defendant. Defendant passed that officer. The chase continued for approximately five miles into a rural area. Once the road became gravel, the officers slowed down for safety reasons, and they soon lost sight of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Some time later, the officers located defendant\u2019s vehicle, which was now empty and parked on a \u201cspur road\u201d 30 to 40 yards off the gravel road. The officers set up a perimeter and enlisted a canine unit to search for defendant, but they were unable to locate him. Nearly six hours later, defendant turned himself in at the police station and admitted, \u2018Well, I eluded a whole batch of cops this afternoon. I figured I might be in trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On the basis of the events at the lake, defendant was charged with first-degree assault, second-degree assault, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>attempted second-degree assault, and recklessly endangering another person (Case Number A129627). On the basis of the vehicle chase, defendant was charged with reckless driving, fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer in a vehicle (a felony), and fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer on foot (a misdemeanor) (Case Number A129628).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The cases were consolidated for trial, and defendant was tried to a jury. Defendant testified at trial. On direct examination, he admitted that he eluded the police officers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201c[Defense Attorney:] Well, why don\u2019t you tell the jury, did you elude and take off from police officers that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201c[Defendant:] Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201c[Defense Attorney:] And did you know that they were police officers in pursuit and trying to pull you over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201c[Defendant:] Yes, sir, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">On cross-examination, he further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] * * * And you actually got away from the police, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">\u201c[Defendant:] Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] You knew the police were still after you? \u201c[Defendant:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] And you jumped out of the pickup truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-14\">\u201c[Defendant:] Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-15\">\u201c[Prosecutor:] And you ran on foot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-16\">\u201c[Defendant:] Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the misdemeanor fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer charge, arguing that he did not flee or attempt to elude on foot because he had successfully eluded the police while still in the vehicle. He couched his argument in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-18\">\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no testimony as to how this situation ended with [defendant] fleeing. They lost track of the car. They no longer were \u2014 he no longer was eluding. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>crime had been completed. We don\u2019t know how much time elapsed. He turned himself in five or six hours later. They never found him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\">\u201cThey found the vehicle awhile later and he wasn\u2019t there but we don\u2019t know if he pulled over eventually after the cops were out of sight, sat there for five, ten minutes, five minutes, what have you, simply got out of the car and walked away, but there is no evidence that at the time he got out of the vehicle and left on foot that he was still fleeing or attempted to elude the officers. The crime had been completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant also requested that the trial court instruct the jury that its verdicts must be unanimous. The court refused to give that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In Case Number A129627, the jury convicted defendant of two counts of second-degree assault \u2014 one as a lesser-included offense of first-degree assault \u2014 and one count of recklessly endangering another person. Regarding the assault convictions, the jury voted unanimously to convict on one, but voted 10-2 to convict on the other. Defendant was convicted as charged in Case Number A129628.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">As part of defendant\u2019s sentence in Case Number A129627, the state requested $250 in restitution to Sanks to replace his tires that had been damaged on the night of the events at the lake. Over defendant\u2019s objection that the state had not proved that defendant\u2019s criminal activity caused the tire damage, the court granted the restitution to Sanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">We begin with defendant\u2019s assignment of error relating to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the misdemeanor fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer charge. Defendant contends that, to commit that offense, a person must get out of a vehicle and nm from the \u201cpresence\u201d of the police. As a result, according to defendant, because there was no police officer present when he got out of the vehicle, defendant could not be convicted of misdemeanor fleeing or attempting to elude the police. Instead, defendant argues, by the time he got out of the vehicle, he was no longer fleeing or attempting to elude the police because he had already successfully done so. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>asserts that, if his conduct violates the statute, any person who commits the felony offense also commits the misdemeanor offense when he or she exits the vehicle, \u201ceven if that occurs 100 miles later when the person stops at a store to buy groceries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The state responds that defendant\u2019s proposed construction of the statute that a police officer must be present when a defendant gets out of the vehicle is unpreserved. In any event, the state argues that defendant\u2019s argument fails because the statute makes no reference to the location of the police officer. All that the statute requires, according to the state, is that the person exit the vehicle to flee or attempt to elude the police. The state contends that the evidence in this case is sufficient to establish the elements of the offense and that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We first address the state\u2019s preservation argument. According to the state, although defendant did argue that the state failed to prove the elements of the offense, he did not specify the particular statutory construction that he now advances on appeal, namely, that the officer must be \u201cpresent\u201d at the time that defendant commits the offense. As the quoted excerpt from the argument in support of defendant\u2019s motion makes clear, however, that is in effect what he argued at trial. He may not have used the words \u201cstatute\u201d or \u201cpresence,\u201d but defendant plainly argued that, once the police were out of sight, he had completed the offense. We reject the state\u2019s preservation argument without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We turn, then, to the parties\u2019 contentions on the merits of defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. ORS 811.540 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201c(a) The person is operating a motor vehicle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201c(b) A police officer who is in uniform and prominently displaying the police officer\u2019s badge of office or operating a vehicle appropriately marked showing it to be an official police vehicle gives a visual or audible signal to bring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>vehicle to a stop, including any signal by hand, voice, emergency light or siren, and either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\">\u201c(A) The person, while still in the vehicle, knowingly flees or attempts to elude a pursuing police officer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">\u201c(B) <em>The person gets out of the vehicle and knowingly flees or attempts to elude the police officer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201c(3) The offense described in this section, fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, is applicable upon any premises open to the public and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201c(a) Is a Class C felony if committed as described in subsection (l)(b)(A) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">\u201c(b) Is a Class A misdemeanor if committed as described in subsection (l)(b)(B) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">(Emphasis added.) Defendant does not dispute that he was operating a vehicle when he was signaled by a police officer to stop the vehicle. He also does not dispute that he knowingly fled or attempted to elude the police officers while in that vehicle, thereby violating ORS 811.540(l)(b)(A). His contention on appeal is that he did not violate ORS 811.540(l)(b)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">To decide whether the state proved that defendant violated ORS 811.540(l)(b)(B), we must determine the meaning of the statute intended by the legislature that enacted it by examining its text in context and, if necessary, its legislative history and other aids to construction. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). In examining the text of the statute, we presume that the legislature intended the statutory terms to have their ordinary meanings. <em>Haynes v. Tri-County Metro., </em>337 Or 659, 663,103 P3d 101 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Turning to the text of ORS 811.540(l)(b)(B), according to its terms, the statute is violated when, after being signaled by a police officer to stop a moving vehicle, a \u201cperson gets out of the vehicle and knowingly flees or attempts to elude the police officer.\u201d The terms \u201cflee\u201d and \u201celude\u201d are not statutorily defined. Accordingly, we presume that the legislature intended those terms to have their ordinary meanings. The verb \u201cflee,\u201d when used transitively, means \u201cto run away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>from : endeavor to avoid * * * or escape from\u201d or \u201cto leave abruptly : depart from suddenly or unexpectedly.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>868 (unabridged ed 2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The transitive verb \u201celude\u201d means \u201cto escape the notice or perception of.\u201d Id. at 738. As a result, the phrase \u201cattempts to elude\u201d means \u201cto attempt to escape the notice or perception of.\u201d Nothing in the wording of the statute suggests that the legislature intended the term to mean something other than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Based on the ordinary meanings of those words, we conclude that it is possible for a person to \u201cflee[ ] or attempt[ ] to elude the police officer\u201d even after he or she escapes the line of sight of the police officers. The focus of ORS 811.540(l)(b)(B) is on whether the person is \u201crun[ning] away from\u201d or attempting \u201cto escape the notice or perception of\u2019 the police officers when he or she gets out of the vehicle. If the pursuing police officers momentarily lose sight of the person, that does not mean that, at that moment, the person is no longer fleeing or attempting to elude the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In this case, defendant admitted that he attempted to elude the police as they engaged in their five-mile vehicle chase. He further admitted that, when the police apparently lost sight of him on the gravel road and he jumped out of his pickup truck, he knew that they were still after him. Viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to the state and giving the state the benefit of all reasonable inferences from that evidence, we conclude that a rational factfinder could find all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt in this case. <em>See State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995) (stating the standard for reviewing a denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that its verdicts must be unanimous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>According to defendant, his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated when he was found guilty by less than a unanimous jury on one of the charges. In a memorandum of additional authorities, the state contends that our decision in <em>State v. Bowen, </em>215 Or App 199, 168 P3d 1208 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>220 Or App 380, 185 P3d 1129 (2008), is controlling. We agree. In <em>Bowen, </em>we rejected an argument that is indistinguishable from defendant\u2019s argument in this case. <em>Id. </em>at 202. We reject defendant\u2019s assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error relates to the trial court\u2019s imposition of restitution on one of the second-degree assault convictions in Case Number A129267. The trial court ordered defendant to pay $250 in restitution for damage to the assault victim\u2019s tires. According to defendant, because the state failed to prove a causal connection between defendant\u2019s criminal activity \u2014 an assault on the victim\u2019s person \u2014 and damage to the victim\u2019s personal property, the trial court improperly awarded restitution. As we have noted, the state concedes that the trial court erred. Because the imposition of restitution requires that defendant\u2019s criminal activity be the cause of the damages, <em>State v. Dillon, </em>292 Or 172, 181, 637 P2d 602 (1981), we accept the state\u2019s concession and agree that the trial court erred in ordering defendant to pay restitution for damage to the victim\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Case Number A129267 remanded for resentencing; Case Number A129268 affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"> When <em>not </em>used transitively, \u201cflee\u201d means \u201cto run away from or as if from danger or evil: hasten off\u201d or \u201cto hurry toward a source of security or protection \u2014 used with <em>to </em>or <em>into.\u201d Webster\u2019s </em>at 868 (italicization in original). Because ORS 811.540(l)(b)(B) does not couple \u201cflees\u201d with either \u201cto\u201d or \u201cinto,\u201d it seems as if the legislature intended to use \u201cflee\u201d in its transitive form.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
