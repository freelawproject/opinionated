At issue is whether the board correctly characterized claimant\u2019s diabetes, a condition unrelated to employment, as the major contributing cause of the disease that required amputation of his toe, thereby rendering the amputation noncompensable. Claimant contends that the diabetes merely rendered him \u201cmore susceptible to\u201d the disease and was therefore not a contributing cause of it. ORS 656.005(24)(c). We conclude that the board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial reason; the facts do not lead logically to the board\u2019s legal conclusion. <em>See Drew v. PSRB, </em>322 Or 491, 500-01, 909 P2d 1211 (1996) (agency order must show reasoning that leads from facts to conclusion). We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The statutory provisions at the center of this case require that, in order to receive workers\u2019 compensation for medical treatment of a disease, a worker \u201cmust prove that employment conditions were the major contributing cause\u201d of the need for that treatment. ORS 656.802(2)(a). Thus, if the major contributing cause is a preexisting condition that is not related to employment, the treatment is not compensable. However \u2014 and here lies the dispute \u2014 if a preexisting condition \u201cmerely renders the worker <em>more </em>susceptible\u201d to the disease that needs treatment, as opposed to <em>causing </em>it, then that preexisting condition does not contribute to the need for treatment. ORS 656.005(24)(c) (emphasis added); <em>Multnomah County v. Obie, </em>207 Or App 482, 487-89, 142 P3d 496 (2006); <em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. v. Spurgeon, </em>109 Or App 566, 569, 820 P2d 851 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 210 (1992). In the present case, the parties agree that claimant\u2019s preexisting condition, diabetes, was not work related. Claimant argues that the diabetes merely rendered him <em>more susceptible </em>to the infection that ultimately caused the need for amputation. The board concluded that claimant\u2019s diabetes was the major contributing <em>cause </em>of the need for amputation and, for that reason, upheld the insurer\u2019s denial of compensation. For the reasons that follow, we agree with claimant. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The relevant facts are few and, on judicial review, undisputed. Claimant worked for Sherman Brothers Trucking as a lube technician and, for safety reasons, wore steel-toed boots while working. The boots caused him to develop a blister on his right great toe. The blister became infected, and the infection ultimately led to the need for amputation of the toe.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Claimant has diabetes. As one aspect of that condition, he had a progressive loss of sensory perception in his extremities, including his right foot. That loss of sensory perception is known as diabetic neuropathy. According to claimant\u2019s attending physician, Dr. Bourne, claimant\u2019s diabetic neuropathy \u201cmade it less likely that [claimant] would notice the progressive infection ulcer until it was quite advanced.\u201d That delay, in turn, resulted in the need for amputation. In Bourne\u2019s opinion, diabetic neuropathy \u201ccontributed to [the infection\u2019s] severity but did not cause the infection independently. Diabetes is not an infectious disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A different physician, Dr. Landry, whose opinion the board found to be more persuasive than Bourne\u2019s, reported that, in addition to the diabetic neuropathy, another aspect of diabetes, microvascular disease, was a factor in the infection and need for amputation. Landry acknowledged that one way that claimant\u2019s diabetic neuropathy contributed to the severity of the infection was because of the lack of sensation in his foot, which caused him not to notice the infection until it was fairly advanced. He explained that \u201c[t]his is something we see very frequently in people with diabetes and diabetic neu-ropathy, that they develop small foot lesions that lead to significantly bigger problems than in someone who didn\u2019t have diabetes\u201d because \u201cpeople with normal sensation in their foot are more aware of problems before and as they arise than people with diabetic neuropathy.\u201d He also explained that \u201cpeople with diabetes have what we call microvascular disease, so that oftentimes * * * they\u2019re not able to mount as strong of a response to these types of insults and these types of infections.\u201d Landry concluded that \u201cthe major contributing cause of [claimant\u2019s] condition was the diabetes and diabetic neuropathy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Claimant filed this petition for judicial review. On review, he argues that the board\u2019s determination that his diabetes was the major contributing cause of the infection in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>toe is not supported by substantial reason. Acknowledging that his diabetic neuropathy did make him less likely to recognize the seriousness of an infection and thus contributed to the eventual severity of the infection at issue in this case, he contends that the neuropathy did not in any way \u201ccause\u201d that infection. Rather, he submits that his neuropathy was no more than a predisposition to infection \u2014 a vulnerability\u2014 and, as such, cannot be said to have caused it. SAIF responds that claimant\u2019s diabetic condition was not merely a predisposition or susceptibility because, in addition to the loss of sensation that made it more difficult for claimant to detect the infection, claimant\u2019s \u201c \u2018microvascular disease\u2019 * * * contributed to the occurrence of the skin lesion in the foot that led to the infection and ultimately to the * * * amputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We note preliminarily that the different physicians\u2019 characterizations of the sequence of events leading to the need for amputation are of limited relevance. The medical facts on review are: first, claimant had diabetes and, along with it, microvascular disease and diabetic neuropathy; and second, without those conditions, claimant\u2019s blister would not have become so severely infected as to require amputation. Whether that factual sequence of events fits within the statutory exception to contributory causation in ORS 656.005(24)(c) \u2014 mere susceptibility \u2014 is a legal question involving statutory interpretation. <em>See Young v. Hermiston, </em>223 Or App 99, 105, 194 P3d 857 (2008) (meaning of \u201cmedical condition\u201d in workers\u2019 compensation statute is question of law, not medical fact); <em>Karjalainen v. Curtis Johnston &amp; Pennywise, Inc., </em>208 Or App 674, 681, 146 P3d 336 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 473 (2007) (meaning of statutory term \u201carthritis\u201d in workers\u2019 compensation is legal question of statutory interpretation, not medical fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We have already held, under similar medical facts, that diabetic neuropathy is a predisposition and not a contributing cause. In <em>Portland Adventist Medical Center v. Buckallew, </em>124 Or App 141, 861 P2d 380 (1993), the claimant had developed a joint condition as the result of repeated trauma caused by employment-related walking. We agreed with the insurer that the claimant\u2019s diabetic neuropathy caused loss of feeling and that such loss prevented the claimant from avoiding trauma. We nonetheless held that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>loss of feeling does not itself create trauma; it is trauma that causes the [joint condition]. All of the evidence shows that claimant\u2019s on-the-job walking caused trauma to his ankle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145. Although the claimant in <em>Portland Adventist Medical Center </em>sought compensation for an arthritic condition and not for an infection, that distinction is not relevant to our conclusion, i.e., when diabetic neuropathy leads to lack of sensation, and that lack of sensation prevents the diabetic from noticing trauma, and repeated trauma causes the need for treatment, the diabetic neuropathy is a mere predisposition and not a contributing cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">SAIF does not disagree. Rather, it argues that the aspect of claimant\u2019s diabetic condition that resulted in the amputation was not merely neuropathy, but also, as Landry asserted, microvascular disease. Even assuming that the evidence supports SAIF\u2019s argument that claimant had micro-vascular disease, the evidence shows that microvascular disease did not, as SAIF claims, \u201ccontribute[ ] to the occurrence of the skin lesion in the foot that led to the infection and ultimately to the * * * amputation.\u201d Rather, Landry\u2019s testimony indicates only that microvascular disease, in his words, renders a patient <em>\u201c[un\\able to mount as strong of a response </em>to these types of insults and these types of infections.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We cannot conceive of a more succinct example of \u201cmerely rendering]\u201d a person \u201cmore susceptible\u201d than rendering the person \u201c[un]able to mount as strong of a response.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2303 (unabridged ed 2002) (defining \u201csusceptible\u201d to mean, among other things, \u201chaving little resistence to a specific infectious disease\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Thus, the board\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s diabetes and diabetic neuropathy were the major contributing cause of his infection and resulting toe amputation is not supported by substantial reason; the board\u2019s conclusion does not follow from the facts in the record. There is no dispute as to the sequence of events: claimant repeatedly rubbed his toe against his steel-toed boot; the friction caused a blister; that blister became infected; and the infection led to a need for amputation. Claimant\u2019s diabetic condition therefore \u201cmerely render[ed] [him] more susceptible to\u201d the infection, ORS 656.005(24)(c), either as a result of a lack of sensation or decreased ability to \u201cmount as strong of a response\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>infection. Because this susceptibility cannot, in accordance with ORS 656.005(24)(c), be considered a \u201ccause\u201d for purposes of determining \u201cmajor contributing cause\u201d under ORS 656.802(2)(a), the board erred in its conclusion. Furthermore, because the only other evidence in the record supports claimant\u2019s position tbat the friction from his work boots caused the lesion in his toe that eventually became infected, we also conclude that claimant\u2019s amputation is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
