ORS 419C.478. She asserts that the court erred in its jurisdictional finding that she had committed acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute theft in the second degree. ORS 419C.005; ORS 164.045. Youth also contends that the court erred by committing her to OYA custody after a dispositional hearing at which she was not represented by counsel. The state concedes that the court erred by committing youth to OYA custody when she was not represented, but contends that youth\u2019s challenges to the court\u2019s finding of jurisdiction are not reviewable because she did not appeal from the earlier judgment in which that finding was made. We agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession, reverse the dispositional judgment, and remand for further proceedings. However, because we conclude that youth\u2019s challenges to the court\u2019s jurisdictional finding do not concern the judgment from which she appeals, we reject those challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In 2005, youth, in a proceeding in which she was represented by counsel, admitted to acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute burglary in the first degree. ORS 164.225. After accepting youth\u2019s admission, the court found her to be within its jurisdiction, imposed an eight-day suspended sentence, and placed her on probation. The court later held two review hearings to address potential probation violations. Shortly after the second review hearing, the state filed a new petition, alleging that youth had committed acts that, if committed by an adult, would constitute second-degree theft. In June 2006, the court held a hearing on that petition. Although youth was not represented by counsel, the state submitted, and the court accepted, an admission of jurisdiction signed by youth. The following statement appears immediately above youth\u2019s signature: \u201cI have the right to appeal the Court\u2019s final order by filing Notice of Appeal within 30 days of the date of disposition. * * *\u201d The court entered a jurisdictional judgment in which it found that youth was within the court\u2019s jurisdiction and had waived her right to counsel, and set over disposition to a later date. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Youth did not appeal that judgment. At the later disposition hearing, in which youth again was not represented by counsel, the court revoked youth\u2019s probation, committed her to OYA custody, and entered a dispositional judgment to that effect. Youth did not object to the court\u2019s decision to hold a hearing without providing her with counsel. Youth filed a timely appeal from the dispositional judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Youth asserts three assignments of error, the first two of which challenge the court\u2019s June 2006 jurisdictional judgment. She first assigns error to the finding that her admission to second-degree theft was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. Next, youth assigns error to the court\u2019s finding that she validly waived her right to counsel at the jurisdictional hearing. Although those challenges to the jurisdictional judgment appear to be untimely under ORS 419A.200 and ORS 419A.205, youth relies on case law predating those statutes to contend that her appeal is timely. Finally, youth contends that the court erred by revoking her probation without notifying her of its intent to do so and by not providing her with counsel. The state responds that youth\u2019s first two assignments of error are not reviewable because she did not appeal from the court\u2019s jurisdictional judgment as required by ORS 419A.200 and ORS 419A.205. The state concedes youth\u2019s third assignment of error, agreeing that youth was unlawfully deprived of her right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We begin with youth\u2019s first two assignments of error, both of which require us to determine whether, in light of recent amendments to the statutes governing the appealability of juvenile court judgments, our prior case law \u2014 which required a party challenging the findings in a jurisdictional order to do so by challenging the dispositional order, as youth did here \u2014 remains authoritative. Youth contends that those changes \u2014 specifically the amendment of ORS 419A.200 and the enactment of ORS 419A.205 \u2014 do not invalidate our case law. Employing the methodology described in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), which requires us to determine legislative intent by considering, as appropriate, a statute\u2019s text, legislative history, and other construction aids, we conclude that the case law on which youth relies is no longer controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number> Under ORS 419A.200(1), \u201ca party to a juvenile court proceeding * * * whose rights or duties are adversely affected by a judgment of the juvenile court may appeal therefrom.\u201d A party who chooses to appeal must file a notice of appeal \u201cnot later than 30 days after the entry of the court\u2019s judgment.\u201d ORS 419A.200(3)(c). ORS 419A.205 describes the various types of appealable judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">\u201c(1) For the purpose of being appealed, the following are judgments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\u201c(a) A judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201c(b) A judgment disposing of a petition including, but not limited to, a disposition under ORS 419B.325 or 419C.411U\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Thus, the text of ORS 419A.205(l)(a) and (b) demonstrate that jurisdictional and dispositional judgments are separately appealable. Those provisions, read together with ORS 419A.200(3)(c), establish that a party who seeks to challenge either type of judgment must file a notice of appeal within 30 days of that judgment\u2019s entry. <em>See Premier West Bank v. GSA Wholesale, LLC, </em>196 Or App 640, 650, 103 P3d 1169 (2004) (text of related provisions serves as context when construing a statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">That reading finds support in other subsections of ORS 419A.205 that describe the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction while a jurisdictional judgment is on appeal, how a party appeals a dispositional judgment that is entered while the party\u2019s appeal of a jurisdictional judgment is pending, and the effect on the dispositional judgment of an appellate court\u2019s reversal or modification of a jurisdictional judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">\u201c(2) An appeal from a judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court does not deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction to proceed with a disposition of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">\u201c(3) If an appeal is taken from a judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court before the juvenile court enters a judgment disposing of the matter under ORS 419B.325 or 419C.411, any necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>modification of the appeal must be made according to the rules of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">\u201c(4) When an appeal is taken from a judgment finding a child or youth to be within the jurisdiction of the court, if the appellate court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201c(a) Reverses the judgment, the judgment disposing of the matter is reversed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201c(b) Modifies the judgment, a party may move for relief as otherwise provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Those provisions demonstrate that the legislature anticipated a scenario where a party might challenge a jurisdictional judgment before the disposition has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">In contrast, the text of the prior statute governing appealability of juvenile court orders did not directly provide that a jurisdictional judgment could be appealed. <em>See Weber and Weber, </em>337 Or 55, 66-67, 91 P3d 706 (2004) (the preexisting common law and statutory framework within which a law is enacted serves as its context). <em>Former </em>ORS 419.561(1) (1991), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1993, chapter 33, section 373,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201c(1) [A]ny person whose rights or duties are adversely affected by a final order of the juvenile court may appeal therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">No provisions described what constituted a \u201cfinal order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">We relied on <em>former </em>ORS 419.561(1) \u2014 specifically, the statute\u2019s requirement of a \u201cfinal order\u201d \u2014 when we were first called on to consider the question whether a jurisdictional order was appealable. <em>See generally State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Reding, </em>23 Or App 413, 542 P2d 934 (1975). In <em>Reding, </em>we concluded that a jurisdictional order was not appealable because it was not a final order. <em>Id. </em>at 417. Having observed that the juvenile code contemplated multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>hearings to arrive at two determinations \u2014 whether jurisdiction existed and, if so, the proper disposition of the matter\u2014 and that the jurisdictional order at issue continued that matter for disposition, we reasoned that, because there had not yet been a disposition, there was no final order. <em>Id. </em>at 416-17. In later cases, relying on the rationale of <em>Reding, </em>we held that, where the juvenile court had entered a jurisdictional order but postponed making a disposition until a later date, the appeal must be taken from the dispositional order and the court\u2019s jurisdictional findings were reviewable on that appeal. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Gates, </em>96 Or App 365, 371-72, 774 P2d 484, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 315 (1989); <em>see also State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Pauli, </em>129 Or App 227, 229, 878 P2d 1135 (1994); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Cheney, </em>96 Or App 680, 683, 773 P2d 1351 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Contrary to youth\u2019s contention, <em>Reding </em>and its progeny have no bearing on the interpretation of either ORS 419A.200 or ORS 419A.205. Under the current statutory scheme, the question is not whether an order is \u201cfinal\u201d; instead, the appropriate question is whether an appealable judgment has been entered. If so, then a party may appeal the judgment if, barring extenuating circumstances, he or she does so within 30 days. ORS 419A.200(3)(c); <em>see also </em>ORS 419A.200(5)(a) (allowing a party, other than the state, to file a notice of appeal up to 90 days after a judgment is entered, if special showings are made). As noted, ORS 419A.205 separately describes the types of appealable judgments and specifically states that a jurisdictional judgment is an appealable judgment. In contrast, <em>Reding </em>and its progeny were based on a conclusion that, under the then-existing statutory scheme, jurisdictional orders were not \u201cfinal\u201d and, hence, were not appealable. Where, as here, the legislature has altered the material language on which we based prior decisions and has enacted a provision that is inconsistent with those prior decisions, those decisions no longer have precedential value. <em>See State v. Crotsley, </em>308 Or 272, 277-78, 779 P2d 600 (1989). <em>Reding </em>and its progeny have no bearing on the current statutory scheme and thus do not aid youth. Because youth did not appeal the jurisdictional judgment, we lack jurisdiction to consider youth\u2019s challenges to that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We turn now to youth\u2019s final assignment of error. She contends, and the state concedes, that the juvenile court committed plain error by revoking her earlier-established probation at a dispositional hearing in which she was not represented by counsel and without informing her of the court\u2019s intent to do so. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, reverse the dispositional judgment, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We explain briefly our decision to exercise our discretion to address the error. This court may exercise its discretion to address an unpreserved error of law that is \u201capparent on the face of the record.\u201d ORS 5.45(1). An error is plain if it is purely legal, obvious and not reasonably in dispute, and depends on irrefutable predicate facts, so that we are not required to go beyond the record and choose between competing inferences. <em>State v. Page, </em>197 Or App 72, 78, 104 P3d 616 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006). In deciding whether to exercise our discretion to address such an error, we consider various factors, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; * * * the ends of justice in the particular case; * * * and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way, i.e., whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\"><em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We also consider whether youth encouraged the judge\u2019s choice and the possibility that youth made a strategic choice not to object to the court\u2019s action. <em>See State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 522-23, 173 P3d 822 (2007) (describing additional factors for consideration in plain error cases); <em>see also State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 513, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 675 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The court\u2019s decision to revoke youth\u2019s probation at a dispositional hearing in which she was not represented is an error apparent on the face of the record. Because the hearing had the potential to result in a loss of youth\u2019s liberty, she was entitled, as a matter of due process, to representation by counsel. <em>See In re Gault, </em>387 US 1, 36, 87 S Ct 1428, 18 L Ed 2d 527 (1967) (\u201cA proceeding where the issue is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>[youth] will be found \u2018delinquent\u2019 and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution. * * * The [youth] \u2018requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d); <em>cf. State v. Busby, </em>107 Or App 368, 369, 812 P2d 14 (1991) (a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be represented by counsel at a probation revocation hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Here, the error was of constitutional magnitude, and the record does not indicate that youth encouraged the court\u2019s decision to conduct the hearing without providing for the assistance of counsel. Moreover, we perceive no strategic reason why youth might have chosen to proceed without the assistance of counsel. <em>See Fults, </em>343 Or at 522-23. Accordingly, we are persuaded to exercise our discretion to review the unpreserved error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Dispositional judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-12\"> Although repealed in the 1993 reorganization and recodification of the juvenile code, <em>former </em>ORS 419.561(1) was reenacted in substantially the same form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">\u201c(1) [A]ny person whose rights or duties are adversely affected by an order of the juvenile court may appeal therefrom. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">ORS 419A.200(1) (1993), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2001, ch 480, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
