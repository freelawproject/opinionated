He assigns as error the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his refusal to take a breath test. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence on the bases that he was not under arrest for DUII when asked to submit to the test and that, at the time he was arrested for DUII, the arresting officer lacked <em>subjective </em>probable cause to believe that defendant had, more likely than not, been driving under the influence of intoxicants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We dispense with the first issue summarily. Defendant was under arrest for DUII when he refused to take a breath test. Sergeant Chamberlain (the arresting officer) had informed defendant that he was being processed for DUII and told him, \u201cYou are under arrest for DUII.\u201d <em>See State v. Scott, </em>111 Or App 308, 311-12, 826 P2d 71 (1992) (holding that the defendant could have reasonably inferred under the circumstances that he was under arrest for DUII even though the arresting officer never explicitly told him that he was).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We next consider whether defendant\u2019s arrest was supported by probable cause. Defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusion that his arrest was supported by <em>objective </em>probable cause. We agree that, under the circumstances, there was enough information available to Chamberlain, at the time he arrested defendant for DUII, for him to have objectively and reasonably concluded that defendant was driving while under the influence of intoxicants. Turning to <em>subjective </em>probable cause, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Miller, </em>345 Or 176, 188-89, 191 P3d 651 (2008), issued after this case was submitted to this court, clarified what is sufficient to satisfy the subjective component of the probable cause inquiry. The Supreme Court held that the subjective probable cause requirement is satisfied if the officer \u201creasonably believes\u201d that his or her conduct is \u201clegally justified\u201d and the \u201cofficer act[s] on that belief in restraining a defendant\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In this case, when Chamberlain told defendant, \u201cYou are under arrest for DUII\u201d and asked if defendant would take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>a breath test, Chamberlain believed that he was simply processing defendant for a lawful DUII arrest executed by Officer Knudson. Knudson had arrested defendant for driving while suspended, observed substantial evidence of intoxication, given Chamberlain a summary of his observations, and turned defendant over to Chamberlain. Chamberlain\u2019s testimony establishes that he believed that he was \u201clegally justified\u201d and that he \u201cacted on that belief\u2019 when he restrained defendant\u2019s liberty by arresting him for DUII and asking him to take a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In sum, defendant\u2019s arrest for DUII was supported by both subjective and objective probable cause. The trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress and admitting evidence that defendant refused to take a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
