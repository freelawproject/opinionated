J.</author>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk, ORS 498.002,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a Class A misdemeanor, ORS 496.992(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The conviction arises from a 2005 second season coast bull elk hunt where defendant shot and killed one elk, found a second elk that was shot and killed by someone else, and took possession of both elk. The issue on appeal is whether, as a matter of law, a person who has killed and tagged a second season coast bull elk commits the crime of exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk by taking possession of an additional second season coast bull elk that was killed by someone else. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Defendant testified as follows. Just before daylight, defendant entered a field on his property to hunt a specific bull elk that had five-point antlers, which he had been observing for the previous three years. That elk and seven other bull elk were feeding in the field. Defendant shot the elk twice before it \u201ccollapsed and went down.\u201d Defendant waited approximately 15 minutes before he approached the elk, put his second season coast bull elk tag on it, and gutted it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As defendant was walking back across the field to obtain his four-wheeled utility vehicle in order to haul the elk out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the field, he saw a seven-point bull elk lying dead in a ditch. Although defendant did not have another second season coast bull elk tag, he gutted the second elk, hauled it back to his residence, and gave the carcass to an acquaintance. Defendant later testified that he did not call the authorities about the second elk because he wanted the meat to go to \u201csomebody that might enjoy it and utilize it.\u201d A few weeks later, the Oregon State Police began an investigation that led to the charge against defendant for exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">At trial, defendant requested that the trial court instruct the jury that, to exceed the bag limit on coast bull elk, a person must knowingly <em>kill </em>more than one elk in a single season:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of exceeding the bag limit of coast bull elk if that person knowingly kills more than one coast bull elk in one season!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cIn this case, to establish the crime of exceeding the bag limit of coast bull elk, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following three elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201ca. The act occurred in Lincoln County Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cb. The act occurred on or about November 22, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201cc. [Defendant] knowingly killed more than one coastal bull elk in the second season for coastal bull elk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">In a colloquy with the trial court, defense counsel asserted that a person exceeds the bag limit on coast bull elk only \u201cby killing more than one animal\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">\u201cThese regulations are * * * clearly defined in terms of living animals, exceeding your quota by killing more than one animal. That is what a bag limit is. Any hunter knows that. They will not say for an animal they found dead on the road or dead in their field that they bagged an animal. They will say they found an animal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">The trial court declined to give the requested instruction, \u201cbecause it used the word \u2018killed\u2019 as the operative verb.\u201d Instead, the trial court instructed the jury that a person exceeds the bag limit on coast bull elk by <em>taking </em>more than one elk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201c \u2018Take\u2019 means to kill or obtain possession or control of any wildlife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">Hi * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">\u201cThe second charge against [defendant] is Exceeding the Bag Limit on Coast Bull Elk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cOregon law provides that a person commits the crime of Exceeding the Bag Limit of Coast Bull Elk if that person knowingly <em>takes </em>more than one coast bull elk in one season.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cIn this case, to establish this charge beyond a reasonable doubt, the State must prove * * * that the Defendant knowingly took more than one Coast elk * * * in one season \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201cAnd again, the word \u2018took\u2019 * * * has the same * * * definition as the word \u2018take\u2019 that I\u2019ve already * * * read to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then took exception to the foregoing instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">\u201cI except on behalf of [defendant] * * * to the Court giving Special Instruction Number 1, Exceeding the Bag Limit on Coast Bull Elk as the State has presented it. In specifics, using the word \u2018take\u2019 and \u2018took\u2019 as it is put in that instruction on two occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\">\u201cAnd I\u2019ve already articulated my reasons for * * * this objection to the Court when we were arguing about instructions. And I want to incorporate those comments on my position on how the use of the word \u2018took\u2019 and \u2018take\u2019 redefines what it means to exceed the bag limit and is contrary to what the requirements are in Oregon law as to what that term means as taken by the regulations as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">On appeal, defendant asserts two assignments of error. First, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction. Second, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that, to prove the crime of exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk, the state must prove \u201cthat the Defendant knowingly took more than one Coast elk.\u201d Both assignments of error frame a single issue \u2014 whether, as a matter of law, a person who has killed and tagged one second season coast bull elk commits the crime of exceeding the bag limit on coast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>bull elk by taking possession of an additional second season coast bull elk that was killed by someone else. <em>See State v. Branch, </em>208 Or App 286, 288, 144 P3d 1010 (2006) (\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for error of law.\u201d); <em>State v. Woodman, </em>341 Or 105, 118, 138 P3d 1 (2006) (\u201cIn determining whether it was error to give a particular instruction, we read the instructions as a whole to determine whether they state the law accurately.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The elements of the crime of exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk are established by an interplay of statutes, administrative rules, and a document titled <em>Oregon Big Game Regulations </em>that is incorporated into those administrative rules. As stated above, ORS 498.002(1) prohibits a person from taking any wildlife in violation of the wildlife laws or administrative rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cWildlife is the property of the state. No person shall angle for, take, hunt, trap or possess, or assist another in angling for, taking, hunting, trapping or possessing any wildlife in violation of the wildlife laws or of any rule promulgated pursuant thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">ORS 496.004(16) defines \u201ctake\u201d to mean \u201cto kill or obtain possession or control of any wildlife.\u201d Also, the Oregon legislature in ORS 496.138(2) delegated to the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission (the commission) the authority to promulgate wildlife regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the authority granted in ORS 496.138, the commission adopted <em>former </em>OAR 635-065-0001 (Jan 1, 2005), which incorporates <em>Oregon Big Game Regulations </em>into the Oregon Administrative Rules.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 2005 version of <em>Oregon Big Game </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Regulations, </em>in turn, provides that the \u201cBag Limit\u201d for the \u201cGENERAL COAST 2nd SEASON\u201d is \u201c[o]ne bull elk with visible antler[.]\u201d <em>Oregon Big Game Regulations </em>75 (2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that, \u201cto exceed the \u2018bag limit\u2019 on coast bull elk, a hunter must knowingly shoot and kill a number of elk that exceeds the number of coast bull elk tags that he may possess during a single season, <em>i.e., </em>one.\u201d The state responds that \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s construction is not an accurate statement of the law because \u2018bag,\u2019 though not defined in the administrative rules or <em>Big Game Regulations, </em>is not ambiguous on its face and is used consistently throughout the administrative rules to denote the number of animals a person may <em>take.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) The parties\u2019 contentions frame a question of statutory and administrative rule interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">In construing an administrative rule, we apply the same analytical framework that applies to the construction of statutes. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 612 n 4, 859 P2d 1143 (1993); <em>Stanley v. DMV, </em>193 Or App 202, 205, 89 P3d 1186 (2004). At the first level of analysis, we examine the text and context of the statute or the rule to discern the legislature\u2019s intent or the intent of agency to whom regulation has been delegated by the legislature. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611-12. Terms of common usage within the text of a statute or a rule are to be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning unless specifically defined by statute or rule. <em>State v. Murray, </em>340 Or 599, 604, 136 P3d 10 (2006) (\u201cAbsent a special definition, we ordinarily would resort to dictionary definitions, assuming that the legislature meant to use a word of common usage in its ordinary sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In support of his contention that the crime of exceeding the bag limit requires that a person kill more than one elk, defendant cites a number of administrative rules that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>show that, to legally take a 2005 second season coast bull elk, a person must hunt it with a centerfire rifle while possessing a 2005 \u201cCoast Elk 2nd Season\u201d tag.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant posits, \u201cBecause a hunter\u2019s Taag limit\u2019 corresponds to the number of\u2018tags\u2019 he may validly possess, a hunter exceeds the bag limit [only] by killing a greater number of game than he has valid tags.\u201d The dissent agrees. It interprets the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation \u201cas a regulation of hunting live animals, and not as a limit on possession of a found dead animal.\u201d 223 Or App at 542 (Sercombe, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We are unpersuaded by defendant\u2019s reasoning because it ignores the import of the legislature\u2019s definition of the word \u201ctake\u201d for purposes of big game hunting regulations. To \u201ctake\u201d a game animal means \u201cto kill or obtain possession or control of any wildlife.\u201d ORS 496.004(16). The administrative regulations governing this case track that definition. <em>Former </em>OAR 635-045-0002(57) (Jan 1,2004) defines the word \u201cpossession\u201d for purposes of the statute as exercising \u201cphysical possession or to otherwise exercise dominion or control over any wildlife or parts thereof, and any person who counsels, aids or assists another person holding such wildlife is deemed equally in possession.\u201d In other words, the legislature intended that a person \u201ctakes\u201d a game animal under ORS 498.002(1) by either killing the animal, or by obtaining possession of it or parts of it, or by controlling the whole or parts of it through means other than by killing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The remainder of the regulations applicable to this case are not inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the word \u201ctake.\u201d The applicable administrative regulations do not define what is meant by the words \u201cbag limit.\u201d However, it is apparent from the context in which the words are used that \u201cbag limit\u201d refers to the number of animals that may be \u201ctaken\u201d pursuant to the definition in ORS 496.004(16), <em>i.e., </em>a number that corresponds to the number of tags purchased by the hunter. Thus, a \u201ctag\u201d is defined by the regulations as \u201ca document authorizing the taking of a designated kind of mammal at a specified time and place.\u201d <em>Former </em>OAR 635-045-0002(74) (Jan 1, 2004). It follows that the fact that, pursuant to administrative rule, a person must use a centerfire rifle to hunt and lawfully kill a bull elk does not prevent that person from violating ORS 498.002(1) by other means, such as exercising dominion or control over the animal or its parts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">In sum, the breadth of the legislature\u2019s definition of the word \u201ctake\u201d defeats defendant\u2019s interpretation that \u201cbag limits\u201d are restricted to animals that a hunter actually kills. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction that, to prove the crime of exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk, the state must prove that defendant killed more than one elk, or in giving the instruction that it gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em> </em>ORS 498.002(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cWildlife is the property of the state. <em>No person shall </em>angle for, <em>take, </em>hunt, trap or possess, or assist another in angling for, taking, hunting, trapping or possessing <em>any wildlife in violation of the wildlife laws or of any rule promulgated pursuant thereto.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\"> ORS 496.992(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by ORS 153.022 and other law, <em>violation of any provision of the wildlife laws, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, is a Class A misdemeanor </em>when the offense is committed with a culpable mental state as defined in ORS 161.085.

But it does not follow from the existence of potentially overlapping administrative rules that the agency intended to regulate only the hunting of live animals for purposes of a <em>\u201cbag </em>limit,\u201d particularly in light of the agency\u2019s definition of the word \u201cpossession\u201d in <em>former </em>OAR 635-045-0002(57) (Jan 1,2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b570-6\">SERCOMBE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Axi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The issue in this case is whether defendant was charged with a violation that could have been committed only by killing a second elk, so as to justify his submitted jury instruction to that effect and preclude the instruction that was given. Defendant was charged with a violation of <em>former </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>OAR 635-065-0001(2) (Jan 1, 2005),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a rule of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) that incorporated by reference the \u201crequirements for hunting game mammals set out in the document entitled \u20182005 Oregon Big Game Regulations.\u2019 \u201d Those requirements, in turn, stated a \u201cbag limit\u201d of \u201c[o]ne bull elk with visible antler\u201d in the restrictions applicable to the \u201cElk Centerfire Firearm Seasons\u201d for the \u201cGeneral Coast, 2nd Season.\u201d The wildlife citation and complaint charged defendant with the rule violation for \u201cexceeding the bag limit on Coast Bull elk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The majority concludes that a person may exceed that \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation by possessing a dead animal that was killed by someone else. 223 Or App at 533. Because it determines that a person does not have to kill an animal to exceed the bag limit, or even be engaged in hunting in any way, the majority rejects defendant\u2019s submitted jury instruction and sustains the instruction given to the jury. It reasons that OAR 635-065-0001(2) carries out ORS 498.002(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cWildlife is the property of the state. No person shall angle for, take, hunt, trap or possess, or assist another in angling for, taking, hunting, trapping or possessing any wildlife in violation of the wildlife laws or of any rule promulgated pursuant thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cTake\u201d is further defined to mean \u201cto kill or obtain possession or control of any wildlife.\u201d ORS 496.004(16). Given the breadth of ORS 498.002(1), the majority reads the \u201cbag limit\u201d regulation expansively to regulate the number of elk that can be \u201ctaken,\u201d either by killing, possessing or controlling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>animal, in any one season. Accordingly, it concludes that defendant could exceed the \u201cbag limit\u201d regulation for Coast Bull elk by killing a single elk and possessing the dead carcass of another elk. Thus, the majority sustains the jury instruction given by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">With respect, the majority\u2019s conclusion rests on an immaterial predicate. The interpretation of the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation rests on its own text and context. ORS 498.002(1) has little to do with the content and meaning of the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation. That statute broadly defines <em>all </em>violations of wildlife laws and rules, not the <em>particular </em>meaning of an individual regulation. Properly viewed in its context, the \u201cbag limit\u201d regulation restricts the number of elk that can be killed during a regulated centerfire firearm hunt. Other, more particular parts of the <em>2005 Oregon Big Game Regulations </em>(Regulations) limit possession of dead or live elk and other game mammals, as well as setting out \u201cbag limits\u201d for each described hunt. Reading the bag limit regulation to restrict <em>all manner of wildlife takings, </em>as the majority does, makes that regulation inconsistent with several other regulations affecting the possession of dead game mammals or the control of live game mammals. Because nothing in the text or context of the regulation supports the construction of the bag limit regulation as the super-regulation for all wildlife takings, because that construction makes the regulation inconsistent with several other regulations, and because the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cbag limit,\u201d is a restriction on the number of animals that may be killed and kept during a particular hunt, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The narrow question presented in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in failing to give defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction that \u201cto establish the crime of exceeding the bag limit on coast bull elk, the state must prove,\u201d among other things, that defendant \u201cknowingly killed more than one coastal bull elk in the second season for coastal bull elk.\u201d Instead, the court instructed the jury that it should convict defendant if it found that he \u201cknowingly took more than one Coast elk during one season,\u201d separately instructing that \u201ctake\u201d means \u201cto kill or obtain possession or control of any wildlife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for error as a matter of law. <em>State v. Moore, </em>324 Or 396, 927 P2d 1073 (1996). A party is entitled to have the jury instructed on the law that supports his or her theory of the case where there is evidence to support that theory and the instruction correctly states the law. <em>State v. Lowe, </em>130 Or App 370, 373, 881 P2d 837 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Defendant argued before the trial court that a \u201cbag limit\u201d regulates the number of live animals that are killed during a hunt. The trial court disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: They charged him with Exceeding the Bag Limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c[THE COURT]: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: They didn\u2019t charge him with Taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201c[THE COURT]: I understand. And Exceeding the Bag Limit, effectively, accuses him of possessing two elk, not one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No sir. Uh, that is not in, that is not in the Administrative Rules that bag limit is equal to taking. * * * These regulations are * * * clearly defined in terms of living animals, exceeding your quota by killing more than one animal. That\u2019s what a bag limit is. Any hunter knows that. They will not say, uh, for an animal they found dead on the road or dead in their field that they bagged an animal. They will say they found an animal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">^ * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\u201c[THE COURT]: What I\u2019m saying is, ultimately, is that this is a possession charge, not a killing charge. Exceeding the Bag Limit means you possess \u2014 there\u2019s a quota. One elk. If you possess two, you\u2019re over the quota. You\u2019ve exceeded the bag limit. How you came into possession of the two elk doesn\u2019t matter. You can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s what this charge is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">As noted above, defendant was charged with a violation of OAR 635-065-0001(2), making it illegal to fail to comply with \u201cthe requirements for hunting game mammals\u201d set out in the <em>Regulations. </em>The particular hunting requirement at issue, a \u201cbag limit\u201d of \u201cone bull elk with visible antler\u201d was contained in the restrictions in the <em>Regulations </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>applicable to the \u201cElk Centerfire Firearm Seasons\u201d for the \u201cGeneral Coast, 2nd Season.\u201d In construing the meaning of this limitation, we interpret administrative rules much like statutes, using the familiar maxims stated in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). <em>See Marshall\u2019s Towing v. Department of State Police, </em>339 Or 54, 62, 116 P3d 873 (2005). That is to say, we look to the text and context of the provision, using rules of construction that bear directly on textual interpretation, to determine its meaning. In this case, the context of the \u201cbag limit\u201d regulation would include other restrictions in the <em>Regulations </em>and other rules and statutes regulating wildlife takings.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">I begin with the text of the regulation, bearing in mind that \u201c[w]ords of common usage typically should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning,\u201d <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. The ordinary meaning of \u201cbag limit\u201d is a quota on the number of live animals taken during a hunting or fishing period. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>162 (unabridged ed 2002), defines \u201cbag limit\u201d as \u201cthe maximum number offish or game animals permitted by law to be taken by one person in a given period.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>also defines the word \u201cbag,\u201d which is instructive of how it is used in the term \u201cbag limit.\u201d As a noun, \u201cbag\u201d is defined, in part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\"><em>\u201c4: </em>something that is bagged: as * * * b: a quantity of game taken during a particular hunt or during a particular period usu. by one person &lt;the ~ included an elephant, and a magnificent male tiger&gt;; <em>often </em>: the amount of game permitted (as by law) to be taken by one hunter &lt;he got his ~ early and was home before lunch&gt; c: something likened to the bag taken by a hunter or fisherman esp. in being won, captured, seized or otherwise taken by personal effort[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\"><em>Id. </em>As a verb it means, \u201c3 a: to take (animals) as game: to kill or capture (game) &lt;he <em>bagged </em>a fine 10-point buck&gt;[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those definitions confirm that, as the word \u201cbag\u201d is used in the context of the term \u201cbag limit,\u201d it is meant to include those animals that the hunter has \u201cbagged\u201d that is, the live animals that have been successfully killed and captured by the hunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Other dictionaries confirm this understanding. For example, <em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>880 (second ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>1989) provides the following specific use of the word bag: \u201c9. <em>Sporting. = </em>Game-bag; <em>hence, </em>the contents of a game-bag, the quantity of fish or game however large (embracing <em>e.g. </em>elephants and buffaloes) killed at one time; the produce of a hunting, fishing, or shooting expedition.\u201d <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>155 (unabridged second 1987) defines bag as \u201cthe amount of game taken, esp. by one hunter in one hunting trip or over a specified period\u201d and to bag as \u201cto kill or catch, as in hunting: <em>I bagged my first deer when I was a teenager.\u201d </em>Similarly, E. Cobham Brewer and Ivor H. Evans, <em>Brewer\u2019s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable </em>68 (Centenary ed 1970), provides the following definition of \u201cto bag,\u201d \u201c[t]o secure for oneself, to purloin; probably from sporting or poaching use, to put into one\u2019s bag what one has shot or trapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Those sources of meaning imply that a \u201cbag limit\u201d establishes a quota on the number of live \u201canimals * * * taken\u201d during a hunting or fishing period. Although the meaning of \u201ctaken\u201d may be elastic, the ordinary understanding of \u201cbag limit\u201d is that it applies to live animals (as opposed to actions related to possession or trafficking in animal meat or parts). Moreover, a \u201cbag limit\u201d pertains to actions during a hunting or fishing trip or season.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Those same understandings of the meaning of \u201cbag limit\u201d arise from the context of the regulations here. Within the <em>Regulations, </em>\u201cbag limits\u201d are set only in reference to particular hunts, hunts defined by time, location, and animal species. The <em>Regulations </em>set out a number of \u201cgeneral hunting regulations\u201d that apply to all hunts, limitations on \u201clegal hunting methods\u201d in a table and text, and then several provisions on purchasing licenses, applications and tags, emergency hunts, landowner preference hunting, and special rules for youth and disabled hunters.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The bulk of the regulations, however, list hunting restrictions in table and rule formats for different species of game mammals. Those restrictions are first categorized by animal species, type of hunt, and hunting weapon, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cPronghorn Antelope - Controlled,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cCougar - General,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cBuck Deer Centerfire Firearm Seasons,\u201d and \u201cGeneral Elk Bow Seasons.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Beneath each category of hunt, the <em>Regulations </em>state written limitations on the general hunt, such as tag sale deadlines, and then set out a table listing hunt numbers (referencing a described area of land), the hunt names (the name of the hunting area), a \u201cbag limit\u201d for each hunt, the \u201copen season\u201d (the time of each hunt), and for controlled hunts, the number of issued and applied for tags from the previous season. Sometimes, the table describes a general season for an animal species by listing the hunt season, the open season, the required tag, the \u201cbag limit,\u201d and the \u201copen area\u201d (place that the restrictions apply). The \u201cbag limits\u201d throughout the <em>Regulations </em>describe the number and type of animal that can be hunted, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cone doe or fawn pronghorn,\u201d and \u201cone buck with visible antler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The regulations applicable to defendant\u2019s conduct were those for the \u201cElk Centerfire Firearm Seasons.\u201d The season of the hunt was \u201cGeneral Coast 2nd Season;\u201d the \u201copen season\u201d was November 19-25; the tag required was \u201cCoast Elk 2nd Season;\u201d the \u201cbag limit\u201d was \u201c[o]ne bull elk with visible antler;\u201d and the \u201copen area\u201d was \u201cAlsea, Applegate, Melrose, Scappoose, Siuslaw, Scott Mt. and Willamette units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The text and context of the \u201cbag limit\u201d regulation as applied to defendant suggest that the restriction pertains to hunting activities within the restricted area. OAR 635-065-0001(2) incorporates only the \u201crequirements for hunting game mammals\u201d that are stated in the <em>Regulations. </em>The <em>Regulations </em>in general set out each \u201cbag limit\u201d in the context of a particular hunt or hunting season. Given that the <em>Regulations </em>always describe \u201cbag limit\u201d in connection with hunting, it is reasonable to conclude that violating the \u201cbag limit\u201d would occur by hunting too many animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">A second relevant rule of construction obligates a court to construe rules to be consistent with one another, ORS 174.010 (\u201cwhere there are several provisions or particulars such construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>give effect to all\u201d). The majority\u2019s construction of \u201cbag limit\u201d regulations as the equivalent of ORS 498.002(1) and a limitation on all \u201ctakings\u201d of the particular species of animal, whether by killing, controlling, or possessing the animal, makes the bag limitation inconsistent with more particular regulations on possession of live or dead animals and redundant of other regulations. To begin with, the <em>Regulations </em>already contained a general proscription on illegal takings. One of the \u201cGeneral Hunting Regulations\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">\u201cNo Person Shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cTake or attempt to take any game mammals or any protected wildlife species of any size or sex or amount, by any method or weapon, during a time or in any area not prescribed in these rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">(Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">If the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation limits all \u201ctakings\u201d of whatever character, then that specific regulation of \u201ctakings\u201d is redundant. More importantly, the possession of dead animals is specifically regulated. The \u201cGeneral Hunting Regulations\u201d limit the possession of the meat or carcass of certain animals in the field without evidence of the animal\u2019s sex. Another of the \u201cGeneral Hunting Regulations\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201cNo person shall possess or transport any game mammal or part thereof, which has been illegally killed, found or killed for humane reasons, except shed antlers, unless they have notified and received permission from personnel of the Oregon State Police or [Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife] prior to transporting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Assuming that defendant found the second elk, that regulation is the one violated by defendant. But defendant was charged with violating <em>a different </em>regulation, the \u201cbag limit\u201d on coastal bull elk during the second elk centerfire firearm season. According to the majority, if defendant had notified the State Police and received permission to keep and dress the animal, he would still have violated the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation because he would have \u201ctaken\u201d a second animal by possession. 223 Or App at 534. Reading the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation as a regulation of hunting live animals, and not as a limit on possession of a found dead animal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>eliminates any inconsistency between the regulations and should be the construction of the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation that is preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Similarly, two or more live elk may be \u201ctaken,\u201d in the sense of possessed, by license from ODFW. OAR 635-049-0015(1) provides that cervids may be held \u201cas authorized by a cervid license issued by the Department.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> OAR 635-049-0135 provides the general requirements for holding cervids; OAR 635-049-0175 describes the license issuance procedure. Had a person possessed two or more live elk as authorized by license, according to the majority, that person still would have \u201ctaken\u201d a second animal by possession in violation of any applicable \u201cbag limit\u201d regulation. Construing the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation as limited to hunting violations removes that inconsistency between the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">For those reasons, I read the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation to apply to defendant\u2019s treatment of live animals during the regulated hunt. Because there was some question about whether defendant had killed the second elk, or merely encountered it in the field, defendant was entitled to a jury instruction defining the question to be whether defendant killed one or two elk. The trial court erred, in my view, in defining a violation of exceeding the \u201cbag limit\u201d hunting regulation differently and instructing the jury that a bag limit violation could occur merely by possessing more than one dead animal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> <em>Former </em>OAR 635-065-0001 (Jam 1, 2005) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201c(1) The purpose of these rules is to establish license and tag requirements, limits, areas, methods and other restrictions for hunting game mammals pursuant to ORS Chapter 496.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201c(2) OAR chapter 635, division 065 incorporates, by reference, the requirements for hunting game mammals set out in the document entitled \u20182005 Oregon Big Game Regulations,\u2019 into Oregon Administrative Rules.
