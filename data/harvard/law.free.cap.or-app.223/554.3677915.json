We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Because we must evaluate the quantity and quality of the evidence against defendant to consider defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, we recite the facts in some detail. Defendant\u2019s convictions stem from a brawl in the early morning hours of June 10, 2005, in which Phillip Gillins was punched in the head. Gillins died two days later from injuries sustained in that brawl.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">I. THE TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The evidence at trial was that defendant and his friends, Ryan Joyce and Brian (J.D.) Beall, confronted Gillins, Anthony Boulis, and Jeremiah Crider in an alley near the University of Oregon campus. All six men had been celebrating the end of the school year and had been drinking throughout the night. Defendant is African-American and Joyce, Beall, Gillins, Boulis, and Crider are Caucasian.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The confrontation occurred after Joyce ran into defendant and Beall at a convenience store. Joyce told defendant and Beall that someone in a group of three men had just directed a racial epithet at Joyce while he was walking down the street. Defendant, Joyce, and Beall left the convenience store to look for the men who had insulted Joyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Defendant, Joyce, and Beall caught up with Gillins, Boulis, and Crider in an alley. Joyce confirmed that they were the same men who had insulted him earlier. Defendant demanded to know who had verbally insulted Joyce. Gillins stepped forward and said, \u201cI did it,\u201d admitting that he had made the racial remark. By that time, defendant had taken \u201c[his] shirt off, because [he] was angry.\u201d The confrontation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>escalated into a physical altercation. During the brawl Gillins was struck in the head and fell to the ground, hitting his head on the concrete. Gillins died two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The evidence at trial was that the only people in the alley during the fight were defendant, Gillins (the victim), Joyce, Beall, Boulis, and Crider. Accordingly, the only people who could have (1) witnessed the assault on Gillins; (2) identified the assailant; and (3) testified as to those matters at defendant\u2019s trial were defendant, Joyce, Beall, Boulis, and Crider. Of those individuals, Crider and Boulis were witnesses for the prosecution. Defendant was the only eyewitness to the fight to testify for the defense. Beall, who was called by the state, asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and did not testify. Joyce did not appear at trial because he could not be located by either the state or defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">A. <em>The Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The state called Beall, Crider, and Boulis as witnesses. Crider testified that he was certain that defendant had hit Gillins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And how sure are you today that it was the black guy with no shirt on who was the person who hit Phillip Gillins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201c[CRIDER]: A hundred percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Is there any doubt in your mind that it could have been any other person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">\u201c[CRIDER]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Boulis also testified that defendant struck Gillins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And so the first hit that you remember is Phillip [Gillins]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">\u201c[BOULIS]: Yep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you see that punch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">\u201c[BOULIS]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Did you see the defendant throw it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-17\">TBOULIS]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: From what you saw, is there any possible way that [Joyce or Beall] could have thrown a punch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201c[BOULIS]: Noway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: From where [Joyce and Beall] are standing * * *, is there any way that they could have hit Phillip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201c[BOULIS]: No, not without me seeing it. They could have. They were close enough to. But they didn\u2019t. And I didn\u2019t see it. And I was standing right there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The state called four other witnesses. Each witness testified that they saw only one African-American man in the alley and that the African-American man was the only person who was not wearing a shirt. Additionally, the witnesses each testified that they did not see Gillins\u2019s assailant because they were not in the alley when Gillins was hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">B. <em>The Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The defense theory was that Beall, not defendant, had hit and killed Gillins and, therefore, defendant was not guilty of either manslaughter in the second degree or assault in the second degree. During the three-day trial, six witnesses, including one of the state\u2019s witnesses, testified in accordance with defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">First, the state offered the testimony of Jessica Bloomfeldt. Bloomfeldt testified that she had arrived at the alley after Gillins was hit. She saw Beall standing in the alley, and Gillins \u2014 whom she did not know \u2014 lying on the ground. Bloomfeldt testified, \u201cYeah, I asked [Beall] what happened. And he proceeded to tell me that he [Beall] just knocked the guy out.\u201d Bloomfeldt also said that she saw defendant running after someone on the street near the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">Second, Carrie Evans testified that Beall had told her that he had punched Gillins. On cross-examination, Evans clarified that she first heard that Beall \u2014 and not defendant \u2014 had hit Gillins from defendant, and that it was not until later that she heard Beall say that he had hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Gillins. Evans also testified that she did not tell the police that she had heard Beall admit to hitting Gillins. Evans knew both defendant and Beall; she was defendant\u2019s girlfriend and Beall\u2019s high school classmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Third, James Butler testified. Butler knew Beall from high school and was friends with both defendant and Beall. Butler testified that Beall had boasted that he (Beall) had \u201csocked [Gillins] * * * and [that] he didn\u2019t get back up.\u201d On cross-examination, Butler stated that the reason he did not tell the police that Beall had admitted hitting Gillins was \u201cto protect [his] friends[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Fourth, Elliot Spear, defendant\u2019s roommate, testified that he was asleep in his bedroom when he heard loud voices in the apartment at around 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m., a few hours after the fight. Spear went to investigate and saw defendant, Beall, and some other people in the apartment. Spear asked the group to quiet down and he returned to his bedroom. Spear continued, \u201cAnd later on, I heard [Beall]\u2019s voice, which is very distinct * * * say that he had knocked out a kid out at the bar. * * * [Beall] was proud that he just had hit this kid and knocked him on his butt.\u201d When asked by defense counsel if he told the police about what he had heard, Spear replied, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t tell them anything, actually.\u201d During cross-examination by the state, Spear admitted that, less than two weeks after Gillins died, he lied to police by saying that he was \u201cshocked to learn that [defendant and Beall] were involved[,]\u201d and that the reason he lied to the police was to protect his friends, defendant and Beall.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Fifth, Sydney Lighty testified and described a conversation between herself and Beall that took place approximately two weeks after Gillins died:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201c[T]here was a fight that happened at Taylor\u2019s [a bar near campus], actually outside of Taylor\u2019s. [Beall] said it started inside at the pool tables. Somebody made a racist remark to him and that \u2014 I didn\u2019t really get the details of how they got into the alley, but there was a fight. Somebody swung at [Beall]. [Beall] swung back. Landed a punch. The person fell. And then [Beall] told me that [Gillins] had died.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Later in her testimony, Lighty stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">\u201c[Beall] pretty much told me that he wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he was going to be around for my birthday * * *. [My birthday] was five days from when he told me. And that he couldn\u2019t really go out with me. [Beall] didn\u2019t really want to hang out with me that much because he didn\u2019t want me to be involved if something happened, like if the police came after him or something. [Beall] was convinced he was going to jail. It was just a matter of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Lighty was friends with defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Evans, and Lighty had dated Beall off and on for approximately six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Sixth, and finally, defendant testified in his own behalf. Defendant admitted pushing Crider to the ground, but steadfastly denied that he had ever hit Gillins. Rather, he described how Beall had hit Gillins just as defendant pushed Crider to the ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And tell us now exactly how [Beall] \u2014 did you actually see the punch being thrown by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014[ ] Beall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Definitely, because it happened exactly when [Gillins] goes, T did it.\u2019 And as soon as [Gillins] did that, [Beall] hit him. [Gillins] falls back after his hands go stiff like this, because I remember it exactly. His hands go stiff. He falls down. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">C. <em>The Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">After the case went to the jury, the jurors sent a note to the judge asking, \u201cRyan-where is Ryan Joyce?\u201d In response, the trial court explained in a written answer, \u201cRyan Joyce was not a witness in this case, and you may not speculate about the reason for that, or what his testimony might have been.\u201d The jury returned guilty verdicts on all three counts on April 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">II. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">Defendant was sentenced on May 9, 2006. The judgment of conviction was entered on May 17, 2006. Two days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>later, defendant filed a motion for a new trial on two grounds: (1) newly discovered evidence pursuant to ORCP 64 B(4), and (2) misconduct of the prevailing party pursuant to ORCP 64 B(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On June 8, 2006, the trial court held a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion. Joyce, who had not been subpoenaed for trial, had been located and subpoenaed for that hearing. He appeared and the trial court set over the hearing to allow Joyce to retain counsel. On June 16, defendant requested a continuance to file a petition for a writ of mandamus regarding the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling on Joyce\u2019s invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. The court granted the continuance, and defendant filed the petition for a writ of mandamus with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied the petition by order. The hearing on defendant\u2019s motion reconvened on June 30, 2006. At the end of the hearing, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">III. THE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"AA5\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">When the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial is based on an interpretation of law, we review for errors of law. <em>State v. Skillstad, </em>204 Or App 241, 245, 129 P3d 232 (2006). If the trial court made no predicate legal error, then we review its decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Acree, </em>205 Or App 328, 330, 134 P3d 1069 (2006). The trial court is the finder of fact at a hearing on a motion for a new trial. <em>State v. Disorbo, </em>54 Or App 877, 885, 636 P2d 986 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201cA former judgment may be set aside and a new trial granted in an action where there has been a trial by jury on the motion of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">s{c <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">\u201c(2) Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">\u201c(4) Newly discovered evidence, material for the party making the application, which such party could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>B. <em>The Assignments of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Defendant asserts two assignments of error: first, that \u201c[t]he trial court abused its discretion by not granting defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial\u201d; and second, that the court erred when it accepted Joyce\u2019s blanket claim of privilege against self-incrimination while refusing to inquire into the basis for that claim or compelling Joyce\u2019s testimony in the hearing on the motion for a new trial. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">C. <em>Motion for New Trial: Newly Discovered Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em> </em>To justify a new trial, newly discovered evidence must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c(1) It must be such as will probably change the result if a new trial is granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201c(2) It must be such as, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered before or during the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201c(3) It must be such that it cannot, with reasonable diligence, be used during trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">\u201c(4) It must be material to an issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">\u201c(5) It must not be merely cumulative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">\u201c(6) It must not be merely impeaching or contradicting of former evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-13\"><em>State v. Arnold, </em>320 Or 111, 120-21, 879 P2d 1272 (1994) (footnote omitted). Motions for a new trial are disfavored. <em>Disorbo, </em>54 Or App at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">We understand defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence to consist of (1) Joyce\u2019s testimony and (2) Jordan Holliday\u2019s and Melissa Sayer\u2019s affidavits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>1. <em>Ryan Joyce</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">As stated previously, Joyce did not testify at trial. Neither the state nor defendant could find him, despite the parties\u2019 reasonable efforts. After defendant\u2019s trial but before he was sentenced, defendant\u2019s private investigator, Yarbrough, found Joyce and tried to speak with him, but Joyce declined to speak with him. Yarbrough also told the police where he had found Joyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Pursuant to a subpoena, Joyce attended each hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial; each time, Joyce invoked his privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court accepted Joyce\u2019s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Defendant offered affidavits from Jordan Holliday and Melissa Sayer, arguing that those affidavits provided the substance of Joyce\u2019s \u201cexpected testimony.\u201d Defendant explained that obtaining an affidavit from Joyce was impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">2. <em>Jordan Holliday</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Jordan Holliday was Joyce\u2019s roommate at the time of the fight. He was also friends with defendant, Joyce, and Beall. In his affidavit, Holliday recited what had happened in his apartment immediately after the brawl:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">\u201cI am familiar with the incident involving * * * Beall, * * * Joyce and [defendant] that occurred on 6-10-05.1 was home watching T.V. About 2:40 a.m. [Joyce] and [Beall] arrived at my residence. Both were very loud, rowdy and very excited. [Beall] began talking loudly saying that he, [Joyce], and [defendant] had gotten into a fight with 3 other guys * * * [Beall] stated he confronted the three men * * * and when one guy stepped forward and raised his hand and as the guy started to say something [Beall] stated he punched the guy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>in the face and he went down like a log. * * * Jason Brooks arrived at my place at which point [Beall] repeated the same story several times, again bragging about his one shot \u2018K O \u2019 * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Holliday continued in his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cOn 5-5-06 I was at [a club in Eugene] with Ryan Joyce, James Butler, * * * and some other people. During the course of the evening the subject of [defendantl\u2019s conviction came up. [Joyce] volunteered that he felt bad about letting [defendant] \u2018take the rap\u2019 for [Beall]. I overheard [Joyce] tell James Butler that he was trying to get [Beall] to turn himself in but [Beall] \u2018wasn\u2019t having any of it.\u2019 I also heard [Joyce] state that the reason he didn\u2019t testify at [defendant]^ trial was that his attorney who was the same as [Beall]\u2019s told him not to. The above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I relayed this info about the fight to Det. Williams [Eugene Police Department] a short time after it occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">3. <em>Melissa Sayer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In her affidavit, Sayer states that she is \u201cfamiliar with Ryan Joyce, J.D. Beall, James Butler, Jason Brooks, Carrie Evans and [defendant].\u201d Sayer averred that, a couple of months after Gillins died, she had dinner with Joyce, during which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201cRyan [Joyce] began sobbing loudly stating that he felt very bad that the guy J.D. Beall hit had died. Ryan stated, T ruined J.D.\u2019s my best friend\u2019s life\u2019 because J.D. was going to jail for hitting the guy who died a few days later. Ryan explained that he was the cause of the fight by telling J.D. that the other three guys involved in the fight had made fun of Ryan. Ryan said he knew J.D. would react and stick up for him. Ryan stated over and over again that if he had not \u2018egged on\u2019 J.D., he would never have hit the guy and none of this would have ever happened. Ryan stated numerous times that J.D. hit the guy, not [defendant] and that he was very bothered by the man\u2019s death and the fact that J.D. Beall, his best friend, might go to jail for a long time. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">D. <em>Trial Court\u2019s Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">At the end of the hearing, the trial court concluded that defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence fell into three categories, and it made extensive oral findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u201c[TRIAL COURT]: The first is easily disposed of, and that is the witnesses who supplied affidavits to suggest that Mr. Beall either boasted of or admitted to striking the victim in this case. That evidence was clearly before the jury during the trial. A number of witnesses testified to the boasting. At least one witness said that a day or two later, when Mr. Beall was sober and had come to understand the gravity of what had occurred, that he was remorseful, afraid, talking about leaving town, that sort of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201cSo the jury clearly heard that testimony. And the evidence, any further evidence about those statements by Mr. Beall, the Court finds, would not have made a difference in this trial. It\u2019s not new evidence. It may be more evidence of the same kind, but it\u2019s not new. It\u2019s an issue that the jury considered. And for whatever reason, nevertheless, there\u2019s not a doubt concerning [defendant\u2019s] guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cThe second category, I guess, would be evidence concerning statements made by Mr. Joyce. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201cThe statement of Ms. Sayer (phonetic) is a different matter [the third category]. And, frankly, it\u2019s a rather difficult issue concerning admissibility, because where the rule gets \u2014 basically the rule is that if you make a statement against your penal interest and there are indications that it\u2019s otherwise reliable, it can come in. That\u2019s a paraphrase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201cWhere we get in trouble is where the statement is partly against interest and partly inculpatory towards somebody else. And [Laird C.] Kirkpatrick in his treatise <em>[Oregon </em>Evidence], I think suggests that we need to be cautious about those situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201cClearly, the statement \u2014 well, I\u2019m not so clear \u2014 but the State, I think, conceded that the statement that T egged him on\u2019 certainly can be considered against his interest. When she talks about Mr. Beall throwing the punch, that\u2019s another matter. I think, arguably, given the fact that the statement T egged him on\u2019 is not inculpatory, unless we know that the person who got egged on actually threw the punch, I think arguably the entire statement will have to come in, because one wouldn\u2019t make sense without the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\u201cSo let\u2019s assume for the moment that the statement made by Miss Sayer concerning \u2014 the affidavit by Miss Sayer concerning Mr. Joyce\u2019s statement is admissible. Then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>there are two issues there. One is, could this evidence have been discovered with due diligence? That\u2019s the defendant\u2019s burden, to show that it could not have been. Secondly, would it have changed the trial in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cThere is no showing at this point by the defendant that due diligence was exercised in trying to locate Miss Sayer. In fact, the evidence is actually to the contrary, where one of the defense witnesses, who was apparently helping the investigation in this matter, knew about Miss Sayer and her statement well before the trial, at the time \u2014 shortly after the time [defendant] was charged in this case. So if in fact Miss Sayer\u2019s testimony would have been admissible at trial, and defendant certainly could have made an effort to offer that, it would have to have shown that Mr. Joyce was unavailable. But I think we all agree that that was not going to be a difficult task at that point. It\u2019s apparent to me that Miss Sayer could have been called as a witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cSecondly, it seems to me that the Court should, just for the record, should also analyze whether Mr. Joyce\u2019s hearsay statement would have changed the outcome of the trial. And I can\u2019t make that finding. I think there\u2019s certainly that possibility. But the fact is, numerous witnesses testified that Mr. Beall admitted to throwing the punch. Mr. Beall\u2019s admission that he threw the punch is a whole lot more convincing than Mr. Joyce\u2019s hearsay statement that Mr. Beall threw the punch. I don\u2019t know that that statement by Mr. Joyce adds a whole lot. So while it may have changed the outcome, this Court certainly cannot make that finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cI\u2019ll go a step further. And I probably shouldn\u2019t do this. But because I think this case is going up on appeal and there are issues about Mr. Joyce\u2019s testimony, I think this case would be in a different posture if Mr. Joyce <em>did </em>testify and that he testified in accordance with the alleged hearsay statement that was made to Miss Sayer. Certainly, an eyewitness testifying in court may well have made a difference in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201cBut that simply is not before the Court. Mr. Joyce has not testified. Mr. Beall has not testified. And however we all feel about that, the fact is that those witnesses have a right not to testify. And they asserted that right. And that\u2019s the end of that discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cSo based upon those findings, the Court will deny the motion for [a] new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>E. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">As previously stated, to justify a new trial, newly discovered evidence must meet each of six requirements: It must (1) be such as will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (2) be such as, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered before or during the trial; (3) be such that it cannot, with reasonable diligence, be used during trial; (4) be material to an issue; (5) not be merely cumulative; and, (6) not be merely impeaching or contradicting of former evidence. <em>Arnold, </em>320 Or at 120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The trial court concluded that all of defendant\u2019s purported newly discovered evidence did not satisfy that test to warrant a new trial because it was merely cumulative; or it was such that, with reasonable diligence, could have been discovered before or during trial; or that it would not likely change the result if a new trial were granted. Here, defendant does not argue \u2014 nor do we conclude \u2014 that the trial court made any predicate legal error. Accordingly, our task is to determine whether \u201cthe trial court\u2019s decision was within the range of legally correct discretionary choices and produced a permissible, legally correct outcome[.]\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (explaining the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In this case, we agree with the trial court that each item of defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence offered in support of his motion for a new trial failed to meet at least one of those six requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">1. <em>Jordan Holliday\u2019s Affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We start with Holliday\u2019s affidavit, which can be broken into two parts. Part one concerns Beall\u2019s statement made shortly after the brawl: that Beall \u201cpunched [Gillins] in the face\u201d causing Gillins to fall \u201cdown like a log.\u201d The trial court determined that that statement was not newly discovered evidence. We agree. The substance of Holliday\u2019s expected testimony was cumulative of the testimony of at least five other witnesses who testified at trial that each had heard Beall say it was he who threw the punch that killed Gillins.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Part two concerns events that occurred on May 5, 2006, after defendant was found guilty, but before he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>sentenced. In Holliday\u2019s affidavit, he recites some of Joyce\u2019s statements that Joyce \u201cfelt bad about letting [defendant] \u2018take the rap\u2019 for [Beall,]\u201d and \u201cthat the reason [Joyce] didn\u2019t testify at [defendant\u2019s trial was that his attorney who was the same as [Beall]\u2019s told him not to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">As the trial court observed, that evidence is problematic because it includes Holliday\u2019s recitation of statements that Joyce made that do not inculpate Joyce, but rather, inculpate Beall. Additionally, Joyce\u2019s purported statement that he let defendant take the \u201crap\u201d for Beall is helpful to defendant only if the factfinder accepts defendant\u2019s underlying argument \u2014 that it was Beall and not defendant who hit Gillins. However, like the trial court, we conclude that any statements by Joyce that inculpate Beall are cumulative of evidence admitted at trial and considered by the jury. Therefore, we do not address the admissibility of Holliday\u2019s aver-ments concerning what he heard on May 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">2. <em>Melissa Sayer\u2019s Affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">We next consider Sayer\u2019s affidavit in which she reports that \u201cJoyce [said he] felt very bad that the guy J.D. Beall hit had died.\u201d Here, as with Holliday\u2019s affidavit, Sayer is repeating Joyce\u2019s statements that are more inculpatory toward Beall than toward Joyce himself. We agree with the trial court that the evidence from Sayer\u2019s affidavit was such that it would not likely change the result if a new trial were granted, or, in the alternative, it could have been discovered before or during trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In <em>State v. Farmer, </em>210 Or App 625, 152 P3d 904 (2007), this court considered the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence of the statement of an eyewitness who had called 9-1-1 to report a shooting, but who could not be located in time for trial. In an affidavit, the eyewitness averred that the defendant was not the shooter. <em>Id. </em>at 627. In affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201c[t]here * * * is tension in our case law regarding the extent to which the court determines whether new evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>would be believed by the jury. In some cases, we have determined that the new evidence is simply too unbelievable to change the result if a new trial were granted. * * * In other cases, where the proffered newly discovered evidence could be believed by a reasonable jury <em>and meets all of the other criteria, </em>we have concluded that the result at trial would probably be different. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201c* * * That assessment necessarily is based not on a prediction that the jury will believe the evidence but rather on an assessment that the evidence could be believed by a reasonable jury and, if so, would probably change the result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 643. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Here, the trial court could conclude that Sayer\u2019s testimony would not likely change the result, given the evidence offered at trial and considered by the jury. That evidence includes the testimony of five witnesses who each heard Beall admit that he punched Gillins, and defendant, who testified that he saw Beall punch Gillins.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The trial court determined, as a separate ground for denying defendant\u2019s motion, that, in the event that Sayer\u2019s testimony was admissible hearsay, defendant did not meet his burden of showing that, with reasonable diligence, the evidence could not have been discovered before or diming the trial. The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, defendant would have known about Sayer as a potential witness. Specifically, a different affidavit suggests that defendant, Beall, Joyce, and Brooks attended a party at Sayer\u2019s home the day after the fight, and that Joyce, Beall, and defendant repeatedly stated that Beall \u201chad thrown the \u2018knock out\u2019 punch.\u201d Based on that information, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant should have known that Sayer was a potential defense witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">What is more, Sayer provided a second affidavit at the request of the state. Sayer\u2019s second affidavit further supports the trial court\u2019s determination that defendant had not met his burden of reasonable diligence in identifying and locating Sayer as a potential witness because, prior to trial, at least two defense witnesses, Evans and Butler, knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>about Sayer\u2019s conversation with Joyce. <em>See State v. Fentress, </em>35 Or App 63, 67, 580 P2d 1044 (1978) (anticipated exculpatory testimony of a new witness \u2014 the defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence \u2014 could have been discovered by the defendant with the exercise of reasonable diligence where one of the defendant\u2019s witnesses who testified at trial knew about the purported new witness and knew that that witness had knowledge that could aid the defendant in his defense). Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">IV. JOYCE\u2019S CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error that the trial court erred when it accepted Joyce\u2019s blanket claim of privilege at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and refused to inquire into the basis for Joyce\u2019s claim or compel Joyce\u2019s testimony. At the hearing, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201c[TRIAL COURT]: * * * I believe that when we continued the hearing [on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial] from the earlier date that we had \u2014 Mr. Joyce had been called as a witness. He had indicated that he wished to speak with a lawyer. We had a lawyer available for him at that time, however, he wished to hire his own. And my understanding is that he\u2019s done that * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201cMr. Joyce, if you\u2019d come forward, please. You have had an opportunity to discuss this matter with your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201c[JOYCE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">\u201c[TRIAL COURT]: Are you willing to be a witness in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">\u201c[JOYCE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201c[TRIAL COURT]: Will you state the basis for that, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">\u201c[JOYCE]: I refuse to testify based on my privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">At the hearing for a new trial, defendant argued that, pursuant to ORS 136.617, the court had authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>inquire as to the basis of Joyce\u2019s asserted privilege and, depending upon the results of that inquiry, to order or compel Joyce to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: On behalf of the defendant, under the circumstances we\u2019d ask the Court, <em>pursuant to ORS 136.617, </em>to inquire as to the basis for the privilege, and depending upon that inquiry be prepared to order or compel the witness to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201c[TRIAL COURT]: What\u2019s the State\u2019s position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Well, I would object to the Court\u2019s doing so. I know no authority that allows the Court to do so. Specifically <em>that statute, 136.617, </em>does not state that the Court has authority to do so. And at this point, the State is not offering any type of immunity to Mr. Joyce, which is really what <em>that statute </em>is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\"><em>% </em>\u2021 iji \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, I\u2019d point out that <em>the statute, </em>in rebuttal to [the state\u2019s] comments, that <em>that statute </em>provides a procedure where the prosecuting attorney may move the Court for those sorts of orders. There\u2019s nothing in <em>that statute </em>that says the Court does not have the inherent power, either pursuant to <em>that statute </em>or independently, to do the same thing as contemplated by <em>the statute.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And just so the record is clear, the State is not so moving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u201c[TRIAL COURT]: The way I read <em>that statute </em>is that none of that procedure gets instigated until such time as the State moves the Court to make that inquiry. And so I will deny your motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On appeal, defendant abandons his statutory argument. Instead, defendant argues that the trial court violated his constitutional rights when it accepted Joyce\u2019s blanket assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination without inquiring into the basis for that assertion. Defendant concedes that his constitutional argument is not preserved. Nonetheless, he urges consideration of the error under ORAP 5.45(1) as error apparent on the face of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">ORAP 5.45(1) provides that \u201cthe appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d We may review a \u201cplain error\u201d under this rule when (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201capparent,\u201d that is, where the legal point is obvious, meaning not reasonably in dispute; and (3) the error appears \u201con the face of the record,\u201d meaning that the error does not require the court to go outside the record or select among competing inferences. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Even if defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is an error apparent on the face of the record, this court cannot address it unless we exercise our discretion to do so using such factors as those identified in <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The difficulty with defendant\u2019s argument, however, is that we cannot tell whether there was an error apparent on the face of the record. Only in his reply brief does defendant attempt to explain why his constitutional challenge is reviewable as error apparent on the face of the record. Defendant argues that an \u201cerror in the application of the constitutional privilege against self incrimination to a particular set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>of facts constitutes an error of law.\u201d Defendant continues, \u201c[a]s a result, the Trial Court\u2019s interpretation and application of these [constitutional] provisions were \u2018questions of law\u2019 resulting in \u2018legal error\u2019 if incorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Defendant did not alert the trial court to any constitutional \u201cerror in the application\u201d of Joyce\u2019s invocation of privilege. Had defendant done so, the trial court would have been able to consider defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge, and the state would have been able to develop a different record that addressed defendant\u2019s argument. Here, defendant did not alert the trial court that he was challenging Joyce\u2019s invocation of privilege on any ground aside from ORS 136.617, let alone rely on the federal constitutional argument that defendant now raises, for the first time, on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">It would not serve the policies underlying the general rule of requiring preservation to review defendant\u2019s assignment on a plain error basis, <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Accordingly, even if defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is plain error, an issue that we do not decide, we would decline to exercise our discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">To summarize, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence did not meet the requirements to justify a new trial: specifically, the trial court acted within its discretion when it concluded that defendant\u2019s new evidence (1) probably would not change the result if a new trial was granted; (2) could, with reasonable diligence, have been discovered before or during the trial; or (3) was merely cumulative. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. As to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, defendant did not preserve that claim of error, and we do not review it as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-10\"> Defendant does not challenge his conviction for assault in the fourth degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\"> ORCP 64 B provides, in part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-15\"> In his May 19,2006, motion for a new trial, defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence consisted solely of Holliday\u2019s expected testimony. By June 8, 2006, the date of the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, defendant had located and subpoenaed Joyce. On appeal, defendant relies on the expected testimony of both Holliday and Joyce, although, in defendant\u2019s reply brief, he states that \u201cRyan Joyce\u2019s testimony was the primary basis for the motion for new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">Defendant argues that Melissa Sayer\u2019s affidavit is relevant for two alternative reasons. First, because Joyce asserted his privilege against self-incrimination at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, Sayer\u2019s affidavit is proof of the substance of Joyce\u2019s expected testimony. Second, in the event that Joyce\u2019s assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>of the privilege against self-incrimination is valid, Sayer\u2019s affidavit, defendant argues, would be admissible hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-12\"> At the June 16, 2006, hearing, Joyce\u2019s counsel clarified that the bases of Joyce\u2019s invocation were the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution.

The court shall forthwith hold a summary hearing at which the prosecuting attorney shall show reasonable cause to believe the witness possesses knowledge relevant to the proceeding, or that no privilege protects the evidence sought to be produced. The witness may show cause why the witness should not be compelled to testify or produce evidence. The court shall order the witness to testify regarding the subject matter under inquiry upon such showing of reasonable cause or shall order the production of evidence upon a finding that no privilege protects the evidence sought, unless the court finds that to do so would be clearly contrary to the public interest. The court shall hold the summary hearing outside the presence of the jury and the public and may require the prosecuting attorney to disclose the purpose of the testimony or evidence.
