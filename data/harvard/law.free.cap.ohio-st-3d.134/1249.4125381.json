Dech Jr. and Mark C. Geudtner, counsel for defendant Cameo Pettaway, have filed a joint affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge James D. Bates from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. CR11-2645, a death-penalty case now pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">{\u00b6 2} Affiants allege that the disqualification of Judge Bates is necessary to assure their client\u2019s rights to due process and a fair and rehable trial under the United States and Ohio Constitutions. According to affiants, the judge\u2019s impartiality may reasonably be questioned because his spouse is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding. Affiants also argue that the judge\u2019s words and actions have had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on their ability to prepare for trial. Finally, they complain that Judge Bates barred the victim\u2019s mother from the courtroom during Pettaway\u2019s upcoming trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Bates has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavit of disqualification. He maintains that his wife has had no involvement in prosecuting the underlying case. The judge further notes that this court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>rejected similar arguments in other disqualification cases. Finally, Judge Bates argues that affiants\u2019 chilling-effect claim is a matter for appeal, not an affidavit of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">{\u00b6 4} For the following reasons, no basis has been established for ordering the disqualification of Judge Bates.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Relevant Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 5} Judge Bates\u2019s wife, Julia R. Bates, is the Lucas County prosecuting attorney. As a result, Judge Bates has used a form called a \u201cRemittal of Disqualification\u201d to notify criminal defendants of his relationship with the county prosecutor. By signing the remittal, a defendant agrees that any \u201cperceived conflict of interest\u201d stemming from the judge\u2019s marital relationship is \u201cimmaterial\u201d and Judge Bates may preside over the case. If a defendant does not sign the remittal, Judge Bates recuses himself from the case. On October 25, 2011, the affiants and defendant Pettaway signed a remittal of disqualification, allowing Judge Bates to preside over Pettaway\u2019s capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 6} In the course of preparing for trial, the defense mitigation specialist advised the affiants that Pettaway\u2019s IQ may be in the mentally retarded range. On April 27, 2012, affiants met with Pettaway, showed him the disqualification remittal he had signed on October 25, 2011, and asked him to read it. According to affiants, Pettaway was not able to read the remittal or understand what it meant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">{\u00b6 7} On May 8, 2012, affiants filed a notice in the trial court that Pettaway was withdrawing the remittal. Judge Bates denied the withdrawal the next day and refused to disqualify himself from the case. Affiants then filed the instant affidavit of disqualification with this court on May 14, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The Merits of the Affidavit of Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">\n<em>Disqualification under Jud.Cond.R. 2.11</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">{\u00b6 8} Affiants initially assert that Rule 2.11(A)(2)(b) of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires that Judge Bates be disqualified from the underlying case. Jud.Cond.R. 2.11(A)(2)(b) provides in part that a judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding where the judge\u2019s spouse, domestic partner, or a person within the third degree of relationship to the judge is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding. Affiants argue that Judge Bates should be disqualified because his spouse, the Lucas County prosecutor, is acting as a lawyer in the underlying proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>{\u00b6 9} A similar argument was rejected in <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>47 Ohio St.3d 602, 546 N.E.2d 925 (1989). In that case, the defendant sought to disqualify the trial judge because the judge\u2019s father was the Cuyahoga County prosecuting attorney. Chief Justice Moyer held that the judge\u2019s disqualification was not required solely because the judge is related to the prosecuting attorney of a large metropolitan area. <em>Id. </em>at 603. Similarly, in <em>In re Disqualification of Carr, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1233, 2004-Ohio-7357, 826 N.E.2d 294, the chief justice held that a judge\u2019s disqualification is not required where a government attorney who practices law with the judge\u2019s spouse appears before the judge, as long as the judge\u2019s spouse is not personally prosecuting the case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15, 17. Here, affiants have offered no evidence that Prosecutor Bates has participated in the preparation or presentation of the underlying case. Therefore, Judge Bates\u2019s disqualification is not required under Jud.Cond.R. 2.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>Alleged Conflict of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 10} Affiants also claim that several recent events compel the disqualification of Judge Bates. Affiants have admitted to signing the disqualification remittal along with Pettaway on October 25, but based on certain recent events, they are \u201cno longer of the opinion\u201d that the perceived conflict stemming from the judge\u2019s marriage to the prosecutor is immaterial. Each of their claims will be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">1. Adverse Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 11} First, affiants complain that Judge Bates denied Pettaway\u2019s notice to withdraw the remittal and refused to disqualify himself from the case. They also complain that the judge denied- \u2014 without holding a hearing \u2014 their \u201cMotion for Interim Fee Payment\u201d to the defense mitigation specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 12} It is well settled that an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. Indeed, a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal rulings, even if those rulings may be erroneous, is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b64. Likewise, a judge\u2019s alleged failure to hold a hearing on counsel\u2019s motions is not evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Eyster, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1246, 2004-Ohio-7350, 826 N.E.2d 304, \u00b6 4 (a judge\u2019s action \u2014 or inaction \u2014 on a motion is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion and is not evidence of bias or prejudice). In short, trial judges are entitled to exercise their discretion in ruling on many matters, and it is not the chief justice\u2019s role in deciding an affidavit of disqualification to second-guess each ruling. The remedy for these and other legal claims, if any, lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number><em>Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b66.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 13} Moreover, even if Judge Bates had allowed defendant Pettaway to withdraw his remittal, it does not automatically follow that Judge Bates will be removed from his case. Whether a judge should be disqualified from the ease is governed by R.C. 2701.03 and the Code of Judicial Conduct. Judge Bates\u2019s disqualification-remittal form is not required by any statute or rule, and Pettaway\u2019s acceptance or rejection of the remittal is not relevant in this disqualification proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">2. Judicial Comments</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 14} Second, affiants claim that Judge Bates used \u201cincendiary\u201d words in his judgment entry denying their motion for interim fee payment. Affiants refer specifically to the following comments: (1) \u201cThe bills and time expended [by the mitigation specialist] are outrageous\u201d and (2) \u201cThis is a form of extortion upon the Court.\u201d According to affiants, the judge\u2019s remarks have had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on their ability to prepare an adequate defense for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 15} Judges have a duty to ensure that services billed by an expert witness are reasonable and necessary, R.C. 2929.024, so they are certainly not prohibited from voicing concerns over the defense\u2019s expenditures of court-provided funds. Indeed, judges are entitled to express dissatisfaction with an attorney\u2019s conduct and tactics, <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1243, 2004-Ohio-7354, 826 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 10, and the same would hold true of the conduct and tactics of an expert witness hired by defense counsel. <em>See also In re Disqualification of Sutula, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1237, 2004-Ohio-7351, 826 N.E.2d 297, \u00b6 6 (\u201cA judge\u2019s use of forceful language inside or outside the courtroom does not prevent the judge from serving fairly and impartially * * * \u201d). The judge\u2019s dissatisfaction, however, \u201ccan and should be expressed in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity, dignity, and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Corrigan </em>at \u00b6 10. <em>See also </em>Jud.Cond.R. 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 16} The judge\u2019s statement describing the expert\u2019s bills and services as \u201coutrageous\u201d was not improper. His use of the word \u201cextortion\u201d in reference to the request for additional court funds was, however, unnecessary. As the Code of Judicial Conduct directs, judges should be \u201cpatient, dignified, and courteous\u201d to litigants, lawyers, and others in an official capacity and should refrain from using words or conduct that might manifest bias or prejudice. Jud.Cond.R. 2.8(B) and 2.3(B). While Judge Bates\u2019s remark was ill-advised, it does not convey the impression that he has reached a \u201cfixed anticipatory judgment\u201d that will prevent him from presiding over the case with an \u201copen state of mind * * * governed by the law and the facts.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt, </em>164 Ohio St. 463, 469, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Moreover, affiants have offered no evidence that the judge\u2019s comments have caused a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on their ability to mount a proper defense. The record before this court reflects that Judge Bates has approved three separate funding requests from the defense for the mitigation specialist, for a total of $21,000. Affiants, nevertheless, state that their expert is reluctant to perform any further services for fear that she will not be paid. But affiants have not submitted an affidavit from the expert attesting to that fact. <em>See In re Disqualification of Crow, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 1209, 741 N.E.2d 137 (2000) (denying disqualification when affiants failed to document claims of bias by providing supporting evidence). In addition, Judge Bates granted a recent defense request for funds for the mitigation specialist \u2014 in the amount of $7,000 \u2014 on April 12, 2012, so this fear appears to be unfounded and speculative. On this record, no reasonable and objective observer would harbor serious doubts about Judge Bates\u2019s impartiality. <em>See In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8 (setting forth the proper test for disqualifying a judge based on an appearance of impropriety).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">3. Barring Victim\u2019s Mother from Courtroom</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 18} Affiants\u2019 final allegation concerns the judge\u2019s April 24, 2012 order to ban the victim\u2019s mother, Maytee Clark, from the courtroom during Pettaway\u2019s trial. Sometime around April 17, 2012, the affiants subpoenaed Clark to testify, and they \u201care hopeful that Judge Bates does not interpret his April 24, 2012 order to prohibit the defense from calling Mrs. Clark as a witness.\u201d Affiants are also \u201cvery fearful that Mrs. Clark will interpret Judge Bates\u2019 order as a license to ignore the defendant\u2019s subpoena.\u201d Affiants do not articulate any reason why their hopes and fears would mandate the judge\u2019s disqualification from the underlying case. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1) (requiring affiant to include specific allegations of bias, prejudice, or disqualifying interest and the facts to support those allegations); <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 5 (rejecting allegation where chief justice is left to speculate as to what actions of judge affiant considers biased or prejudicial); <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988) (vague or unsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">{\u00b6 20} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Bates.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\">. Affiants do not indicate whether they had asked Pettaway to read the remittal in October 2011 or whether Pettaway understood what he was then signing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
