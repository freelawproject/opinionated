For the reasons that follow, we determine that the decision to change the child\u2019s surname was not supported by sufficient evidence as a matter of law. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court for entry of final judgment in favor of the appellant mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">{\u00b6 2} L.D.W.L. was born to his mother, T.L. (the appellant) and father, D.W. (the appellee), an unmarried couple, in June 2005. After the child\u2019s birth, the parents discussed the matter of naming the child in detail, and they ultimately agreed to have the child bear his mother\u2019s surname. As a part of this agreement, the couple decided to give the child two middle names, making the child\u2019s second and third names the same as his father\u2019s first and last names. Although the child\u2019s surname was apparently a contentious issue between the parents, they both signed the birth certificate, which listed the child\u2019s full name, prior to the child\u2019s leaving the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">{\u00b6 3} The child initially lived with his mother and half-sister in Cincinnati, while his father lived in Wilmington, Ohio. When the child was 18 months old, his mother purchased a home and his father moved in with the family. In April 2007, the father joined the military in order to better meet the needs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>household. He attended basic training and was deployed overseas for a time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, he was stationed in Columbus, Ohio, and commuted to be with the family about three days a week. Then, in August 2009, the parents ended their relationship. On September 28, 2009, the father filed in the Juvenile Division of the Clinton County Court of Common Pleas a \u201ccomplaint to determine paternity and establish parental rights and responsibilities\u201d involving the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 4} The parents eventually reached agreement on issues pertaining to paternity, the parenting plan, child support, and other parental rights and responsibilities. In particular, the father agreed that the mother should have sole legal and residential custody of the child with the father having visitation every other weekend and one day a week. The only issue remaining for determination was the father\u2019s request to change the child\u2019s surname to match the father\u2019s surname. Consequently, a magistrate held an oral hearing on the name-change question at which both the mother and father testified. The parties presented no other testimony, and the only documentary evidence submitted was a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 5} Testimony at the hearing established that the child, then five years old and in preschool, had since his birth been referred to by his given name and his surname, and he had always lived with his mother and his half-sister, both of whom shared his last name. The father was actively involved in the child\u2019s life and provided financial support for his care. The mother acknowledged that she wanted the child to continue to have a good relationship with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 6} The father testified regarding his reasons for pursuing the change of his child\u2019s surname. These reasons included wanting his son to have the same last name as his own, wanting his son to \u201chave something of mine\u201d while the father was deployed, and wanting his son to carry on the father\u2019s legacy through his surname should the father be killed in combat. The father opined that a change of his son\u2019s surname would not have a harmful effect on the child and that changing the child\u2019s name would \u201cbe meaningful\u201d to both of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">{\u00b6 7} The mother testified regarding her reasons for wanting the child\u2019s surname to remain the same. She stressed that the father\u2019s full name was already contained within the child\u2019s full name and that the child, who had developmental delays and was on an individualized education program, did not adjust well to change. The mother further testified that the child knew his last name (which was the same as his half-sister\u2019s surname), that the child was working on learning to write his existing last name, and that the child lived in the same household with the mother and half-sister. She believed that it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>detrimental for the child to start over and learn a new surname that would be different from the mother\u2019s and half-sister\u2019s surname, especially in view of the child\u2019s significant developmental disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">{\u00b6 8} The magistrate orally ruled in favor of the father\u2019s request at the conclusion of the hearing and ordered that the child\u2019s surname be changed to the same as the father\u2019s last name. The magistrate later signed an order stating that the name change \u201cwould be in the minor child\u2019s best interest.\u201d The mother filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s ruling. However, the juvenile-court judge overruled the objections, agreed with the magistrate that the child\u2019s surname should be changed, and ordered that the birth certificate be changed to reflect the new name. Upon appeal, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and affirmed. <em>D.W. v. T.L., </em>12th Dist. No. CA2011-03-004, 2011-Ohio-5228, 2011 WL 4790790.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 9} We accepted the mother\u2019s appeal under our discretionary jurisdiction for review of two propositions of law, which assert that the trial court\u2019s decision was improperly based on \u201cdiscriminatory tradition and gender-based assumptions\u201d and that the trial court failed to properly follow this court\u2019s precedents regarding the standards for deciding whether the change of a child\u2019s name is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 10} When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision determining that a child\u2019s name either should or should not be changed, a reviewing court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the trial court, but it must consider whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>See Jarrells v. Epperson, </em>115 Ohio App.3d 69, 71, 684 N.E.2d 718 (3d Dist.1996); <em>In re Dayton, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 407, 2003-Ohio-6397, 801 N.E.2d 531, \u00b6 9 (7th Dist.). When there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law that a name change is in the best interest of the child, a trial court\u2019s judgment changing a child\u2019s surname must be reversed. <em>Bobo v. Jewell, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 330, 335, 528 N.E.2d 180 (1988); <em>see In re Wolfe, </em>2d Dist. No. 19136, 2002-Ohio-3277, 2002 WL 1396318, \u00b6 11 (a trial court abuses its discretion when it orders a surname change upon insufficient evidence that the change is in the child\u2019s best interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 11} Our consideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling is framed by two of our precedents: <em>Bobo </em>and <em>In re Willhite, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 28, 706 N.E.2d 778 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cPursuant to R.C. 3111.13(C), a court of common pleas may determine the surname by which the child shall be known after establishment of the existence of the parent and child relationship, and a showing that the name determination is in the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Bobo, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. The appellate court in this case applied the first part of this holding from <em>Bobo </em>to determine that the juvenile court had statutory authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>consider the name change. The appellate court\u2019s conclusion on that issue has not been appealed and is not at issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Bobo, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">In determining the best interest of the child concerning the surname to be used when parents who have never been married contest a surname, the court should consider: the length of time that the child has used a surname, the effect of a name change on the father-child relationship and on the mother-child relationship, the identification of the child as part of a family unit, the embarrassment, discomfort or inconvenience that may result when a child bears a surname different from the custodial parent\u2019s, the preference of the child if the child is of an age and maturity to express a meaningful preference and any other factor relevant to the child\u2019s best interest. Courts should consider only those factors present in the particular circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>Bobo, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 330, 528 N.E.2d 180, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 14} We cautioned in <em>Bobo, </em>at 334, that courts in unmarried-parent situations should not give greater weight to a \u201cfather\u2019s interest in having the child bear the paternal surname,\u201d because this preference fails to consider that the mother in this situation has \u201cat least an equal interest in having the child bear the maternal surname\u201d and therefore is inherently discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 15} In the case of <em>In re Willhite, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 28, 706 N.E.2d 778, at paragraph one of the syllabus, we held that \u201c[w]hen deciding whether to permit a name change for a minor child pursuant to R.C. 2717.01(A), the trial court must consider the best interest of the child in determining whether reasonable and proper cause has been established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Willhite, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus, we reiterated the basic factors set forth in <em>Bobo </em>applicable to a trial court\u2019s consideration of whether to change a child\u2019s surname and added two other specific factors: \u201cwhether the child\u2019s surname is different from the surname of the child\u2019s residential parent\u201d and \u201cparental failure to maintain contact with and support of the child.\u201d We explained that in contemporary society, a preference that a child bear the father\u2019s surname as \u201ca sort of quid pro quo for the father\u2019s financial support\u201d is improper because this preference ignores the mother\u2019s parallel duty to support the child and focuses too narrowly on the father. <em>Id. </em>at 31. We further reinforced and strengthened the warning expressed in <em>Bobo </em>that trial courts should not commit the mistake of focusing the best-interest inquiry on the father\u2019s interest in having the child bear his surname, reiterating that this approach is fundamentally discriminatory. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. Finally, as relevant here, we took special note of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the confusion that frequently occurs when a mother and child in the same household bear different surnames. <em>Id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 17} Although <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Willhite </em>arose in differing contexts, they set out general guidelines that apply in any name-change determination involving a minor child. <em>See Willhite </em>at 32 (applying the \u201csame rationale\u201d to both a name-change action in probate court pursuant to R.C. 2717.01 and a name change in a juvenile-court paternity action pursuant to R.C. 3111.13(C)). Taken together, those two decisions require that a parent (in this case the father) who seeks to alter the status quo by changing the child\u2019s surname bears the burden of presenting sufficient evidence to affirmatively demonstrate that the change is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>See Willhite </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201creasonable and proper cause\u201d must be established for the name change to be permitted); <em>In re Change of Name of Holliday, </em>11th Dist. No. 2005-G-2629, 2006-Ohio-2646, 2006 WL 1459635, \u00b6 18 (burden is on the party who seeks the name change to establish that the change is in the child\u2019s best interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 18} Some of the.factors set forth in <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Willhite </em>are not relevant to the situation here. As to those factors that are relevant, and the other factors taken into account by the magistrate and the trial judge, the evidence presented did not tip the balance one way or the other. However, with our case precedents in mind, a review of the full record in light of the considerations enumerated in <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Willhite </em>compels us to conclude that the decision to change the child\u2019s surname was not supported by sufficient evidence probative of the child\u2019s best interest, and the decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 19} On this record, we must agree with the contention of the mother that the general import of the father\u2019s testimony was that the change of name should be granted on the basis of the father\u2019s own wishes and interests and not, as the law requires, on the best interests of the child. The father\u2019s testimony is replete with references to his own worries, wants, fears, preferences, beliefs, etc., including testimony of his own past experience growing up without a father figure. The father\u2019s testimony is exemplified by the statement that it was \u201chuge\u201d to the father that his son should bear his surname. Although we do not disagree that these concerns and considerations are of great significance to the father regarding his son, the father offered minimal support for his opinion that the name change would not be harmful to the child, and even the reasons that were offered did not bear upon the more relevant issue of whether the name change would affirmatively be in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 20} In contrast, the mother\u2019s testimony provided specific reasons why the name change would likely be detrimental to the best interest of the child, including that the child\u2019s developmental disabilities and his inability to adapt to change would make it very difficult for him to accept the new surname. The concern raised by the mother that, if changed, the child\u2019s surname would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>different from that of the others in the residential household was specifically recognized in <em>Willhite </em>as a prominent factor for consideration by a trial court. <em>See 85 </em>Ohio St.3d at 32, 706 N.E.2d 778; <em>In re Application for Change of Name of McGowan, </em>7th Dist. No. 04 HA 572, 2005-Ohio-2938, 2005 WL 1385734, \u00b628 (noting that <em>Willhite </em>recognized the \u201cimportant consideration\u201d that it is preferable to avoid changing a name that a child shares with the residential parent); <em>Wolfe, </em>2002-Ohio-3277, 2002 WL 1396318, at \u00b6 16 (finding error in a trial court\u2019s failure to consider, as a factor that \u201cclearly favored\u201d the child continuing to bear the mother\u2019s surname, that the mother was the residential parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 21} Moreover, based on the record that is before us, the mother\u2019s position that the trial court\u2019s decision was, at least in part, based on gender-based traditions and assumptions, contrary to this court\u2019s cautionary warnings in <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Willhite, </em>has merit. One of the reasons given by the trial court supporting the decision to allow the name change was that if either parent marries, \u201c[t]he father is far less likely to change his surname\u201d than the mother. We recognize that the trial court\u2019s comment that a woman who marries \u201coften takes her spouse\u2019s surname\u201d is not an inaccurate observation. However, this generic consideration \u2014 that a woman is more likely to change her surname if she should marry \u2014 cannot be a valid factor supporting a name change in a specific case like the one before us, and it runs counter to the explicit directives of <em>Bobo </em>and <em>Willhite. See McGowan, </em>2005-Ohio-2938, 2005 WL 1385734, at \u00b6 31 (it is improper to \u201cperpetuate the discrimination against mothers or against non-marital children by imposing different naming standards upon them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 22} In summary, the trial court in this case placed too much emphasis on the father\u2019s interest in having the child bear the paternal surname and did not conf\u00edne its consideration to the best interest of the child. <em>See Bobo, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 334, 528 N.E.2d 180; <em>Willhite, 85 </em>Ohio St.3d at 32, 706 N.E.2d 778. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s decision at least in part was improperly founded on gender-based conventions and stereotypes. <em>See Bobo </em>at 334; <em>Willhite </em>at 32. In this situation, where insufficient evidence supported the name change, the trial court\u2019s judgment was erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Bobo </em>at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b6 23} We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this cause to the trial court to enter final judgment denying the name-change request.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A1h6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Whitaker &amp; Shade, L.L.C., and Neal W.
