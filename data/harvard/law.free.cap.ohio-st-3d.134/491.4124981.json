Houdek to work in an aisle of a warehouse where he sustained injuries when a co-worker operating a sideloader struck him. We are asked to consider the impact of a recently enacted statute on our prior case decisions which held employers liable for intentional torts occurring in the workplace when injuries were substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. 2745.01(A), effective April 7, 2005, specifies that an employer is not liable for an intentional tort unless the employee proves that \u201cthe employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur,\u201d defined in Subdivision (B) as acting \u201cwith deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The Eighth District Court of Appeals ignored this statutory definition of \u201csubstantially certain,\u201d concluding it resulted from a scrivener\u2019s error, and held that ThyssenKrupp could be held liable for Houdek\u2019s injuries if it \u201cobjectively believed the injury to Houdek was substantially certain to occur,\u201d notwithstanding the lack of proof of a deliberate intent to injure. <em>Houdek v. ThyssenKrupp Materials N.A., Inc., </em>8th Dist. No. 95399, 2011-Ohio-1694, 2011 WL 1326374, \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">{\u00b6 4} Based upon our review of this record, no evidence exists that ThyssenKrupp deliberately intended to injure Houdek by directing him to work in the warehouse aisle. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court entered in favor of ThyssenKrupp is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 5} On October 10, 2008, Houdek injured his back putting pieces of copper on a pallet while working at ThyssenKrupp\u2019s Cleveland warehouse. He returned to work on October 14, 2008, with light-duty restrictions, and Joseph Matras, the plant manager, asked him to assist in relabeling inventory on warehouse storage racks as part of a transition to a new inventory management system.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 6} Replacing the labels on merchandise required Houdek to work in the same aisles where workers on sideloaders pulled goods from racks 25 feet high. A sideloader moves up and down the aisles with forks protruding toward the merchandise but has the operator facing the rack, rather than the direction of travel. At a shift meeting informing employees about the relabeling process, a sideloader operator, George Krajacic, asked Matras, the plant manager, whether he should rearrange his invoices to avoid pulling merchandise in aisles where relabeling had started, but Matras indicated that this would not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 7} The record further reveals that ThyssenKrupp did not provide reflective vests to employees working in dimly lit aisles, did not require the placement of orange safety cones at the end of aisles in which employees were working, and did not provide expandable gates to prevent machinery from entering aisles where employees were working. However, it did direct employees to alert sideloader operators before they began working in a specific aisle.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">{\u00b6 8} Houdek told Krajacic, the second-shift sideloader operator, that he would be working in the aisle between racks A and B. After working there for approximately five hours, Houdek heard the whirring sound of an approaching sideloader. Forgetting that Houdek had told him that he would be working in that aisle, Krajacic drove the sideloader down the aisle between racks A and B, a narrow aisle which dead ends at a wall; thus, Houdek had no means of escape, and the sideloader pinned him against a scissor lift he had been using, breaking his leg below the knee and shattering his ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Houdek sued ThyssenKrupp, asserting the company had deliberately intended to injure him by directing him to work in the aisle with knowledge that injury would be certain or substantially certain to occur. ThyssenKrupp moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion and entered summary judgment for ThyssenKrupp, concluding that Houdek failed to show that his employer had intended to injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 10} The Eighth District Court of Appeals reversed, stating that the terms used in R.C. 2745.01(A) are in \u201charmonic dissonance\u201d with the definition of \u201csubstantially certain\u201d in R.C. 2745.01(B) and that the court preferred to believe that \u201cparagraph (B) is a scrivener\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Houdek, </em>2011-Ohio-1694, 2011 WL 1326374, \u00b6 42. As a result, the appellate court held that an injured employee may prove an employer intentional tort by showing that the employer acted with an intent to injure the employee or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur. <em>Id. </em>The court applied an objective test as to what a reasonably prudent employer would believe and determined that \u201cthere are genuine issues of material fact, particularly given the specific supervisory directives to both Houdek and the sideloader operator and the sideloader operator\u2019s warning to the warehouse manager, that [ThyssenKrupp] objectively believed the injury to Houdek was substantially certain to occur.\u201d <em>Houdek </em>at \u00b6 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Arguments on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 11} ThyssenKrupp relies on this court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, and <em>Stetter v. R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, for the proposition that R.C. 2745.01 permits recovery for an employer intentional tort only when the employer acts with the specific intent to cause injury. It maintains that recognizing a scrivener\u2019s error in R.C. 2745.01 conflicts with our case law and ignores the intent of the General Assembly to curtail the common law cause of action. Although ThyssenKrupp concedes that intent may be proven by circumstantial evidence, it argues that the court of appeals deviated from the intent-to-injure standard by applying an objective test \u2014 what a reasonably prudent employer would believe \u2014 rather than a subjective test \u2014 what the employer actually believed. ThyssenKrupp maintains that there is no evidence of a specific intent to injure Houdek.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 12} Houdek notes that R.C. 2745.01(C) establishes a presumption that the employer intended to injure the worker if the employer deliberately removes a safety guard, and he asserts that this presumption should apply in this case, because ThyssenKrupp failed to install better lighting, to require the use of safety cones to alert sideloader operators that Houdek would be working in the aisle, or to provide other protective gear such as reflective vests or expandable gates. Houdek argues that because the subjective mental state is impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>prove absent a confession, intent to injure may be established through the employer\u2019s conduct. Thus, he maintains that there is sufficient evidence that ThyssenKrupp intended to injure him: the company had been warned of the danger posed to workers in the aisles only days before the accident, yet it took no action to safeguard Houdek before directing him to work there.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, we confront the question whether a claimant bringing an employer intentional tort claim is required to prove that the employer acted with a deliberate intent to injure.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Employer Intentional Tort</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc., </em>69 Ohio St.2d 608, 433 N.E.2d 572 (1982), this court recognized a cause of action for an employer\u2019s intentional tort against its employee, holding that because intentional tort claims do not arise out of the employment relationship, the workers\u2019 compensation laws do not provide immunity from suit. The court concluded that \u201cR.C. 4123.74 does not bestow upon employers immunity from civil liability for their intentional torts and an employee may resort to a civil suit for damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 15} Further, in <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co., </em>15 Ohio St.3d 90, 95, 472 N.E.2d 1046 (1984), the court rejected the proposition that an employer\u2019s \u201cspecific intent to injure is necessary to a finding of intentional misconduct.\u201d Relying on Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>Law of Torts, </em>Section 8, at 35-36 (5th Ed.1984) and 1 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, Section 8A, at 15 (1965), the court defined \u201cintent\u201d to include not only the specific consequences that an actor desires, but also those consequences that an actor believes are substantially certain to result from the conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 94-95. The court therefore held, at paragraph one of the syllabus: \u201cAn intentional tort is an act committed with the intent to injure another, or committed with the belief that such injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 16} In response to the court\u2019s holdings in <em>Blankenship </em>and <em>Jones, </em>the General Assembly enacted former R.C. 4121.80 in Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 718, 733-737, effective Aug. 22, 1986. Although former R.C. 4121.80(G)(1) defined \u201cintentional tort\u201d as an act committed with the intent to injure another or committed with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur, the statute defined \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to mean that the employer had acted \u201cwith deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer injury, disease, condition, or death.\u201d 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 736. Thus, the legislature attempted to limit the common law employer intentional tort by eliminating liability for injuries that were substantially certain to occur but were not intended by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp., </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722 (1991), however, we held: \u201cR.C. 4121.80 exceeds and conflicts with the legislative authority granted to the General Assembly pursuant to Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, and is unconstitutional <em>in toto.\u201d Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The common law cause of action therefore remained intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 18} We then further clarified the elements of the employer intentional tort in <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc., </em>59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">(1) knowledge by the employer of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition within its business operation; (2) knowledge by the employer that if the employee is subjected by his employment to such dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality or condition, then harm to the employee will be a substantial certainty; and (3) that the employer, under such circumstances, and with such knowledge, did act to require the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\"><em>Id., </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 19} In response, the General Assembly enacted former R.C. 2745.01, in Am.H.B. No. 103, 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 756, 760, effective Nov. 1, 1995, and declared in uncodified Section 3 of the act its intent to supersede the common law employer intentional tort with a more limited statutory cause of action. In the 1995 version of R.C. 2745.01, the legislature defined \u201cemployment intentional tort\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018an act committed by an employer in which the employer <em>deliberately and intentionally </em>injures, causes an occupational disease of, or causes the death of an employee.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Johnson v. BP Chems., Inc., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 298, 306, 707 N.E.2d 1107 (1999), quoting former R.C. 2745.01(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Johnson, </em>this court held the 1995 version of R.C. 2745.01 \u201cunconstitutional in its entirety,\u201d <em>id. </em>at the syllabus, and stated that \u201cany statute created to provide employers with immunity from liability for their intentional tortious conduct cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">R.C. 2745.01</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">{\u00b621} Following that history, the General Assembly enacted the current version of R.C. 2745.01, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>(A) In an action brought against an employer by an employee, or by the dependent survivors of a deceased employee, for damages resulting from an intentional tort committed by the employer during the course of employment, the employer shall not be liable unless the plaintiff proves that the employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another or with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">(B) As used in this section, \u201csubstantially certain\u201d means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">(C) Deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard or deliberate misrepresentation of a toxic or hazardous substance creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal or misrepresentation was committed with intent to injure another if an injury or an occupational disease or condition occurs as a direct result.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">(D) This section does not apply to claims arising during the course of employment involving discrimination, civil rights, retaliation, harassment in violation of Chapter 4112. of the Revised Code, intentional infliction of emotional distress not compensable under Chapters 4121. and 4123. of the Revised Code, contract, promissory estoppel, or defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 22} The constitutionality of this statute is not questioned in this case. We upheld R.C. 2745.01 against various constitutional challenges in <em>Kaminski v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066, and its companion case, <em>Stetter v. R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, explaining that \u201cthe General Assembly responded to this court\u2019s previous decisions by eliminating many of the features identified by this court as unreasonable, onerous, and excessive. Thus, in reviewing R.C. 2745.01, we find a more limited statute than those previously held to be unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Stetter </em>at \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">{\u00b6 23} Nor is there any question as to the intent of the General Assembly when it enacted this statute. In <em>Kaminski, </em>we emphasized that \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting R.C. 2745.01, as expressed particularly in 2745.01(B), is to permit recovery for employer intentional torts only when an employer acts with <em>specific intent </em>to cause an injury, subject to subsections (C) and (D).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 56. We further indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">R.C. 2745.01 appears to harmonize the law of this state with the law that governs a clear majority of jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201c[T]he common-law liability of the employer cannot, under the almost unanimous rule, be stretched to include accidental injuries caused by the gross, wanton, wilful, deliberate, intentional, reckless, culpable, or malicious negligence, breach of statute, or other misconduct of the employer short of a conscious and deliberate intent directed to the purpose of inflicting an injury.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 6 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (2008), Section 103.03.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">(Footnote omitted.) <em>Kaminski </em>at \u00b6 99-100. Moreover, in <em>Stetter, </em>we observed that \u201cR.C. 2745.01 embodies the General Assembly\u2019s intent to significantly curtail an employee\u2019s access to common-law damages for what we will call a \u2018substantially certain\u2019 employer intentional tort.\u201d <em>Stetter </em>at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 24} It is therefore manifest that R.C. 2745.01(B) is not the result of a scrivener\u2019s error. As we stated in both <em>Kaminski </em>and <em>Stetter, </em>the General Assembly intended to limit claims for employer intentional torts to situations in which an employer acts with the \u201cspecific intent\u201d to cause an injury to another. <em>Kaminski </em>at \u00b6 56; <em>Stetter </em>at \u00b6 26. <em>See also </em>6 <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>Section 103.03, 103-7 to 103-8 (2001) (explaining that an employer\u2019s \u201cknowingly permitting a hazardous work condition to exist [and] knowingly ordering employees to perform an extremely dangerous job * * * falls short of the kind of actual intention to injure that robs the injury of accidental character\u201d (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 25} In accord with this authority, absent a deliberate intent to injure another, an employer is not liable for a claim alleging an employer intentional tort, and the injured employee\u2019s exclusive remedy is within the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 26} Here, there is no evidence that ThyssenKrupp deliberately intended to injure Houdek when its management directed him to work in the aisle. In his deposition, Krajacie asserted that Matras had disregarded his suggestion that he not pull goods in an aisle while employees worked there and that after the accident, Matras had said he had known that \u201csomething like this could happen and * * * didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d However, Matras denied making this statement, and Krajacie further testified that neither he nor management at ThyssenKrupp intended to injure Houdek; rather, Krajacie explained that he had forgotten that Houdek was working in the aisle. Thus, although the evidence shows that ThyssenKrupp may have placed Houdek in a potentially dangerous situation, it does not demonstrate that either management or Krajacie deliberately intended to injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 27} Further, R.C. 2745.01(C) is not applicable here. That subdivision provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Deliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard * * * creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal * * * was committed with intent to injure another if an injury or an occupational disease or condition occurs as a direct result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The plain meaning of the word \u201cremove\u201d is \u201cto move by lifting, pushing aside, or taking away or off.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1921 (1986). There is no evidence that adequate lighting conditions and safety devices such as orange cones, reflective vests, and retractable gates can be considered \u201can equipment safety guard\u201d as that term is used in the statute. And even if such evidence existed, there is no evidence in the record that ThyssenKrupp deliberately <em>removed </em>any of these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 28} Here, Houdek\u2019s injuries are the result of a tragic <em>accident, </em>and at most, the evidence shows that this accident may have been avoided had certain precautions been taken. However, because this evidence does not show that ThyssenKrupp deliberately intended to injure Houdek, pursuant to R.C. 2745.01, ThyssenKrupp is not liable for damages resulting from an intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 29} The Ohio Constitution vests the General Assembly, not the courts, with the legislative powers of government. Our role, in exercise of the judicial power granted to us by the Constitution, is to interpret and apply the law enacted by the General Assembly, not to rewrite it. R.C. 2745.01 limits claims against employers for intentional torts to circumstances demonstrating a deliberate intent to cause injury to an employee, and because there is no evidence in this record of a tortious act committed by the employer with a deliberate intent to cause Houdek to suffer an injury, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b600-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b600-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b600-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b600-13\">{\u00b6 30} The majority opinion is wrong. The majority states that \u201cR.C. 2745.01 limits claims against employers for intentional torts to circumstances demonstrat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ing a deliberate intent to cause injury to an employee,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 29, and frames the issue in this case as whether ThyssenKrupp Materials N.A., Inc. (\u201cThyssenKrupp\u201d) <em>deliberately </em>intended to injure Bruce Houdek. But R.C. 2745.01 does not limit intentional-tort claims against employers to \u201ccircumstances demonstrating a deliberate intent to cause injury to an employee.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 2745.01(C), \u201c[djeliberate removal by an employer of an equipment safety guard * * * creates a rebuttable presumption that the removal * * * was committed with intent to injure another if an injury * * * occurs as a direct result.\u201d Only the <em>removal </em>of the safety equipment needs to be deliberate under the statute; if the injury flows from the removal of safety equipment, an injured worker needs to prove nothing further as to the employer\u2019s intent to successfully prosecute an intentional-tort claim against the employer. The worker need not prove that the employer was <em>trying </em>to hurt him \u2014 intent is presumed by the removal of safety equipment. That is, the safety equipment must be deliberately removed but the injury need not be deliberately caused for an injured worker to recover pursuant to R.C. 2745.01(C). The majority thus overstates the ruthlessness of R.C. 2745.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 2745.01(A) presents two ways for an injured worker to successfully prosecute a workplace intentional-tort claim. An employer can be held liable for damages if (1) \u201cthe plaintiff proves that the employer committed the tortious act with the intent to injure another\u201d <em>or </em>(2) \u201cthe plaintiff proves that the employer committed the tortious act * * * with the belief that the injury was substantially certain to occur.\u201d R.C. 2745.01(B) applies only to the \u201csubstantially certain\u201d portion of R.C. 2745.01(A); it uses the term \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d as part of the definition of \u201csubstantially certain.\u201d It reads: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018substantially certain\u2019 means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer an injury, a disease, a condition, or death.\u201d R.C. 2745.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 32} Thus, when adding the definition of \u201csubstantially certain\u201d to the mix, R.C. 2745.01(A) states that an employer can be held liable for an intentional tort if the employer acted with an \u201cintent to injure\u201d or with a \u201cdeliberate intent to cause * * * an injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 33} An intent to injure can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of a particular case; otherwise, an injured worker would be dependent on an employer\u2019s confession to make his case. Again, R.C. 2745.01(C) states that an intent to injure can be inferred from the \u201c[djeliberate removal * * * of an equipment safety guard.\u201d In this case, the employer\u2019s intent to injure could also be inferred from its behavior in sending an already injured Houdek into a dimly lit, narrow, dead-end aisle where a sideloader would be likely to enter, knowing that it was a dangerous situation. Houdek presented enough evidence that a trier of fact could determine that ThyssenKrupp intended to injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Also, the \u201c[deliberate removal * * * of an equipment safety guard\u201d in R.C. 2745.01(C) should include the failure to deploy safety equipment that the employer has on site. For example, in this case, the employer\u2019s failure to place a safety cone at the entrance to the aisle in which Houdek was working should satisfy R.C. 2745.01(C). \u201c \u2018[Equipment safety guard\u2019 has a simple meaning: equipment that is used as a safety guard.\u201d <em>Hewitt v. L.E. Myers Co., </em>134 Ohio St.3d 199, 2012-Ohio-5317, 981 N.E.2d 795, \u00b6 36 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). Safety cones fit within that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 35} Houdek raised several arguments that, if adopted by the majority, would go a long way toward demonstrating that injured workers still have a right to a remedy for workplace intentional torts. The majority does not, and workers, for the most part, do not. The appellate court below quoted at length from my dissent in <em>Stetter v. R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., L.L.C., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 280, 2010-Ohio-1029, 927 N.E.2d 1092, in which I lamented the extinguishment of injured workers\u2019 right to a remedy for workplace intentional torts. The court wrote, \u201cThe appellant * * * lost his leg, lost his job, and will lose his right to fan-recompense, if Justice [Pfeifer\u2019s] prediction about the most recent version of R.C. 2745.01 is the correct one.\u201d <em>Houdek v. ThyssenKrupp Materials N.A., Inc., </em>8th Dist. No. 95399, 2011-Ohio-1694, 2011 WL 1326374, \u00b6 1. The court below chose to believe that recovery could still exist for an injured worker like Houdek:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">Does [R.C. 2745.01] constrain common law employer tort as the <em>Kaminski [v. Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066,] majority holds, or does it, as Justice Pfeifer predicts, abolish it? Taking the majority at its written word, we find merit to Houdek\u2019s appeal and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment in favor of Krupp and against both Houdek and the BWC. If the facts and circumstances of this case do not present genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of an employer tort, then none shall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 36} I suppose that \u201cnone shall.\u201d The court below also wrote what the consequences would be if my dire evaluation of the law was indeed correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">As a cautionary note, if Justice Pfeifer is correct, Ohio employees who are sent in harm\u2019s way and conduct themselves in accordance with the specific directives of their employers, if injured, may be discarded as if they were broken machinery to then become wards of the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Compensation Fund. Such a policy would spread the risk of such employer conduct to all of Ohio\u2019s employers, those for whom worker safety is a paramount concern and those for whom it is not. So much for \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d in the brave, new world of corporations are real persons.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A_e\">Friedman, Domiano <em>&amp; </em>Smith Co., L.P.A., Stephen S.
