For the reasons set forth below, we hold that a private sanitary landfill is not a public utility and is therefore subject to township zoning regulations. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant Colerain Township is a governmental entity in Hamilton County, Ohio, with all the rights, privileges, and duties imposed upon it by R.C. Title 5. Appellant Colerain Township Board of Trustees, through the elected trustees Bernard A. Feideldey, Keith N. Corman, and Jeff Ritter, is the legislative administrative body responsible for governing Colerain Township under R.C. Title 5. Colerain Township and the Colerain Township Board of Trustees (collectively, \u201cColerain Township\u201d) adopted a set of zoning regulations for the township, which are embodied in the Colerain Township Zoning Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee Rumpke Sanitary Landfill, Inc., and its subsidiaries operate a sanitary landfill in Colerain Township. Rumpke, along with appellees Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>and John Stoeppel as trustees and Claire Stepaniak, are the owners of the disputed property, approximately 350 acres located between Hughes Road, Interstate 275, and Buell Road in Colerain Township.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">{\u00b6 4} The present action is not the parties\u2019 first dispute regarding zoning of Rumpke\u2019s property. Rumpke also owns adjacent property used for the disposal of household and commercial waste. In 1999, Rumpke and others who are not parties to the present litigation applied for a change in zoning of the adjacent property. The Colerain Township Board of Trustees rejected the recommendation of the Colerain Township Zoning Commission to approve the application. Rumpke filed a lawsuit against Colerain Township contesting the constitutionality of the zoning and claiming damages. The case was settled by an agreed judgment entry and consent decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">{\u00b6 5} In March 2006, Rumpke applied to change the existing zoning of the disputed property so that Rumpke could expand its landfill. The Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission recommended the rezoning requested by Rumpke, but the Colerain Township Zoning Commission recommended that the Colerain Township Board of Trustees deny the proposed rezoning. Following public hearings, Colerain Township denied Rumpke\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">{\u00b6 6} After Colerain Township denied the application, Rumpke filed a complaint against Colerain Township, the Colerain Township Board of Trustees, and the individual township trustees for a declaratory judgment, compensation for the unconstitutional taking of property, and mandamus. Rumpke later amended its complaint to request a declaratory judgment that it \u201cis a public utility and under R.C. 519.211, the operation of * * * [its] existing landfill and its proposed expansion * * * are not subject to Colerain Township\u2019s zoning authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">{\u00b6 7} Both Colerain Township and Rumpke filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether Rumpke is a public utility exempt from zoning. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Rumpke, holding that \u201cRumpke Sanitary Landfill is a public utility, not subject to the zoning restrictions of Colerain Township, Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">{\u00b6 8} On April 1, 2009, Colerain Township appealed to the First District Court of Appeals. Colerain Township argued on appeal that the trial court had improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Rumpke because a privately owned sanitary landfill is not a public utility under R.C. 519.211.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">{\u00b6 9} The First District held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">\u201cAs a general rule, Ohio law provides that townships have no power under the zoning laws to regulate the location, erection, or construction of any buildings or structures of any public utility.\u201d <em>[Symmes Twp. Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Trustees v. Smyth, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 549, 551, 721 N.E.2d 1057 (2000).] R.C. 519.211 was \u201cintended to exempt public utilities providers from regulation by township zoning boards and boards of zoning appeals.\u201d <em>[Campanelli v. AT &amp; T Wireless Servs., Inc., </em>85 Ohio St.3d 103, 107, 706 N.E.2d 1267 (1999).] The \u201cexemption ensures that public utilities will be able to construct the facilities required to serve the public interest across the state without undue interference from township zoning resolutions.\u201d <em>[Symmes </em>at 556.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><em>Rumpke Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Colerain Twp., </em>1st Dist. No. C-090223, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">{\u00b6 10} The First District then analyzed whether Rumpke was a public utility. In doing so, it held, \u201c \u2018To determine \u201cpublic utility\u201d status for purposes of the R.C. 519.211(A) exemption,\u2019 a court must consider the \u2018 \u201cfactors related to the \u2018public service\u2019 and \u2018public concern\u2019 characteristics of a public utility.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Trustees of Washington Twp. v. Davis, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 274, 2002-Ohio-2123, 767 N.E.2d 261, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, Inc. v. Ravenna Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 385, 596 N.E.2d 423 (1992), syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">{\u00b6 11} The appellate court then set forth the factors under both the \u201cpublic service\u201d and \u201cpublic concern\u201d prongs. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">The factors relating to the public-service requirement include a demonstration that the entity provides \u201can essential good or service to the general public which has a legal right to demand or receive this good or service.\u201d <em>[A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, Inc. v. Ravenna Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 387, 596 N.E.2d 423.] The entity must also demonstrate that it provides its service to the public \u201cindiscriminately and reasonably.\u201d <em>[Id.] </em>And the provider must have an obligation to provide the good or service that cannot be arbitrarily or unreasonably withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">Next the public utility must \u201cconduct its operations in such a manner as to be a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 388.] Factors considered in reaching this determination include the nature of the services provided, competition in the local marketplace, and regulation by a government authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">(Footnotes and citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">{\u00b6 12} The First District then analyzed whether Rumpke is a public utility under both prongs and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>[N]o genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether (1) Rumpke provides virtually all residents and businesses of Southwest Ohio a vital and essential service \u2014 the sanitary disposal of solid wastes in a facility licensed under R.C. Chapter 3734; (2) Rumpke operates in a monopolistic position with no other cost-effective alternative to its services; (3) Rumpke is legally required to dispose of all of the city of Cincinnati\u2019s solid waste; (4) Rumpke has pledged, in sworn statements to the Hamilton County Solid Waste Management District and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, that it will remain open and will accept any qualifying solid waste so long as it has the capacity to do so; and (5) the disposal of solid waste is an essential public necessity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 4. The court of appeals agreed with the trial court and held that \u201cRumpke was entitled to the trial court\u2019s declaration that it is a public utility for purposes of R.C. 519.211.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">{\u00b6 13} The First District also addressed Colerain Township\u2019s argument that \u201cthe trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment because the plain language of the amended public-utility statute prohibits a privately owned landfill like Rumpke from benefiting from the regulatory exemptions of a public utility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. \u201cAm.Sub.H.B. No. 562, the 2009-2010 biennial budget bill, * * * modified the statutory definition of \u2018public utility\u2019 to exclude \u2018a person that owns or operates a solid waste facility or a solid waste transfer facility, other than a publicly owned solid waste facility or a publicly owned solid waste transfer facility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, quoting R.C. 519.211(A). The appellate court noted that it had previously \u201cdeclared that the Am.Sub.H.B. No. 562 modifications to R.C. 519.211\u201d \u201cviolated the one-subject rule of Section 15(D), Article II, Ohio Constitution\u201d and therefore are \u201cunconstitutional and not enforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 and 5, citing <em>Rumpke Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. State, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 135, 2009-Ohio-4888, 919 N.E.2d 826, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">{\u00b6 14} (Colerain Township had appealed that decision to this court, and we accepted discretionary review only of the following proposition of law: \u201cA township is an interested and necessary party to a constitutional challenge brought by a property owner within the township\u2019s jurisdiction to a law passed by the General Assembly that directly affects the township\u2019s police powers over that owner\u2019s property and pending litigation.\u201d <em>Rumpke Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. State, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 41, 2010-Ohio-6037, 941 N.E.2d 1161, \u00b6 9. We ultimately held that Colerain Township was \u201cnot a necessary party to a constitutional challenge to the bill premised on a violation of the one-subject rule of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21. The issue before us was not whether the amendments to R.C. 519.211 violated the one-subject rule.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>{\u00b6 15} The First District affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying Colerain Township\u2019s motion for summary judgment by relying heavily upon the fact that this court had not reversed its holding that the amendments to R.C. 519.211 were unconstitutional and not enforceable. The court of appeals wrote, \u201cAbsent reversal by the Ohio Supreme Court, we will apply this decision in each case submitted for our review.\u201d But again, the appellate court\u2019s holding of procedural unconstitutionality based on the one-subject rule had not been presented to us, and we did not rule on that issue. Our decision in <em>Rumpke Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. State </em>is controlling authority on the issue of whether the township was a necessary party but not on the constitutional issues previously addressed by the First District.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">{\u00b6 16} We accepted the cause as a discretionary appeal. <em>Rumpke Sanitary Landfill v. Colerain Twp., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 1425, 2011-Ohio-3710, 951 N.E.2d 88. Two propositions of law are before us:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">(1) A private sanitary landfill is not exempt from township zoning regulations under the comprehensive statutory framework of solid waste disposal and township zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">(2) A privately owned sanitary landfill cannot be a common law \u201cpublic utility\u201d exempt from township zoning when there is no public regulation or oversight of its rates and charges, no statutory or regulatory requirement that all solid waste delivered to the landfill be accepted for disposal, and no right of the public to demand and receive its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\n<em>The Definition of \u201cPublic Utility\u201d Has Been Developed Through Case Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 519.211(A), which sets forth limitations on zoning powers, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">Except as otherwise provided in division (B) or (C) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any board of township trustees or board of zoning appeals in respect to the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, change, alteration, maintenance, removal, use, or enlargement of any buildings or structures of any public utility or railroad, whether publicly or privately owned, or the use of land by any public utility or railroad, for the operation of its business. As used in this division, \u201cpublic utility\u201d does not include a person that owns or operates a solid waste facility or a solid waste transfer facility, other than a publicly owned solid waste facility or a publicly owned solid waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>transfer facility, that has been issued a permit under Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code or a construction and demolition debris facility that has been issued a permit under Chapter 3714. of the Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 18} Although the General Assembly exempted public utilities from zoning restrictions, it did not define \u201cpublic utility\u201d insofar as it relates to R.C. 519.211. This court\u2019s jurisprudence, however, offers guidance as to what constitutes a public utility for purposes of R.C. 519.211. <em>Marano v. Gibbs, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 310, 544 N.E.2d 635 (1989); <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, Inc. v. Ravenna Twp. Bd. of Trustees, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 385, 596 N.E.2d 423 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Marano v. Gibbs, </em>we held that \u201cthe determination of entities as public utilities is a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>Mara\u00f1o v. Gibbs </em>at 311. \u201c[I]n determining public utility status\u201d courts must examine \u201cthe character of the business in which the entity is engaged.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Ohio Power Co. v. Attica, </em>23 Ohio St.2d 37, 41, 261 N.E.2d 123 (1970). \u201c \u2018To constitute a \u201cpublic utility,\u201d the devotion to public use must be of such character that the product and service is available to the public generally and indiscriminately or there must be the acceptance by the utility of public franchises or calling to its aid the police power of the state.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>S. Ohio Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>110 Ohio St. 246, 143 N.E. 700 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 20} We set forth two factors, i.e., public concern and public service, which must be taken into consideration to determine whether an entity is a public utility for purposes of R.C. 519.211. \u201c[A]n entity may be characterized as a public utility if the nature of its operation is a matter of public concern, and membership is indiscriminately and reasonably made available to the general public,\u201d otherwise known as public service. <em>Marano, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 311, 544 N.E.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 21} We further developed the definition of \u201cpublic utility\u201d in <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, Inc. v. Ravenna Twp. Bd. of Trustees. </em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, Inc. operated a landfill in Ravenna Township, Portage County. A &amp; B Refuse acquired a 66-acre parcel of land adjacent to the landfill intending to construct a truck terminal and offices. After discussing the proposed use with township officials, A &amp; B Refuse was advised that the proposed use would probably not be approved for rezoning. A &amp; B Refuse filed a declaratory-judgment action against the Ravenna Township Board of Trustees, asking for a determination of whether its landfill operation was subject to regulation under the township zoning code.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 22} We were faced with a similar issue to that before us today: \u201cwhether the definition of a \u2018public utility,\u2019 as expressed in case law, is applicable to [A &amp; B Refuse\u2019s] landfill operation for the purpose of exemption from township zoning restrictions.\u201d <em>A &amp; B Refuse, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 386, 596 N.E.2d 423. To resolve this question, we turned to <em>Mara\u00f1o </em>and affirmed the definition of \u201cpublic utility.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>We also significantly expanded upon the two factors identified in <em>Mara\u00f1o, </em>holding that \u201cthe determination of whether a particular entity is a public utility for the purpose of exemption from local zoning restrictions requires a consideration of several factors related to the \u2018public service\u2019 and \u2018public concern\u2019 characteristics of a public utility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 23} As for the public-service factor, we held that we must look at whether there</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH84\">is a devotion of an essential good or service to the general public which has a legal right to demand or receive this good or service. <em>S. Ohio Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 246, 252, 143 N.E. 700, 701, quoting <em>Allen v. RR. Comm. of California </em>(1918), 179 Cal. 68, 175 P. 466; <em>Freight, Inc. v.

Trustees </em>(1953), 67 Ohio Law Abs. 315, 318, 52 O.O. 257, 258, 117 N.E.2d 224, 226. See, generally, 2 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (3 Ed.1986) 568, Section 12.32. * * * [T]he entity must * * * provide its good or service to the public indiscriminately and reasonably. <em>Marano v. Gibbs, </em>[45 Ohio St.3d] at 311, 544 N.E.2d at 636. * * * Further, this attribute requires an obligation to provide the good or service which cannot be arbitrarily or unreasonably withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\"><em>A &amp; B Refuse, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 389, 596 N.E.2d 423. \u201cThe fact that a private business provides a good or service associated with the usual subject matter of a public utility does not give rise to a presumption that it is devoted to public service.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>S. Ohio Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>110 Ohio St. 246,143 N.E. 700 (1924), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">{\u00b6 24} As for the public-concern factor, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">Normally, a public utility occupies a monopolistic or ogopolistic [sic] position in the marketplace. <em>Greater Fremont, Inc. v. Fremont </em>(N.D.Ohio 1968), 302 F.Supp. 652, 664-665. See, also, <em>Mammina v. Cortlandt Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(1981), 110 Misc.2d 534, 442 N.Y.S.2d 689, 691. This position gives rise to a public concern for the indiscriminate treatment of that portion of the public which needs and pays for the vital good or service offered by the entity. Factors utilized in determining whether an enterprise conducts itself in such a way as to become a matter of public concern include the good or service provided, competition in the local marketplace, and regulation by governmental authority. * * * [N]one of these factors is controlling. Nevertheless, in a case where the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>enterprise serves such a substantial part of the public that its rates, charges and methods of operation become a public concern, it can be characterized as a public utility. <em>Indus. Gas Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., supra, </em>135 Ohio St. [408] at 414, 21 N.E.2d [166] at 168 [1939].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">(Citations and footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 25} We further held that \u201cthe determination of public utility status requires a flexible rule, a rule which often intertwines the factors considered in relation to the concepts of \u2018public service\u2019 and \u2018public concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a simple claim that a business\u2019s services are open to the public does not automatically categorize the business as a public utility. <em>Id. </em>at 389. Such a holding would incorrectly encompass as public utilities \u201ctraditional private business enterprises which are, in various degrees, regulated by diverse public authorities, <em>e.g., </em>dry cleaners, restaurants, and grocery stores.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 26} We also determined that the business claiming public-utility status bears the burden of offering sufficient evidence on these factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 27} Applying the principles set forth above, we held that A <em>&amp; </em>B Refuse \u201cfailed to present sufficient evidence on those factors essential to a determination of whether an entity can be classified as a public utility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. The only evidence that related to the public-utility factors was a single statement that \u201cthe landfill is \u2018open to the residents of Ravenna Township.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we never reached the question of whether a \u201cprivately operated solid waste disposal facility\u201d could be a public utility pursuant to R.C. 519.211. <em>Id. </em>We now turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\n<em>Rumpke, in Its Operation of a Private Sanitary Landfill, Is Not a Public Utility, Because There Is a Lack of Governmental Regulation over the Public-Service and Public-Concern Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">{\u00b6 28} The interesting question of whether a <em>private </em>sanitary landfill can be a <em>public </em>utility answers itself, especially in light of the fact that no governmental body regulates private sanitary landfills on those factors that make an entity a public utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, </em>we cautioned owners of sanitary landfills that although achieving public-utility status would exempt the sanitary landfills from local zoning restrictions, obtaining public-utility status also \u201cinvites even greater governmental regulation and control than is currently experienced in this industry.\u201d <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, Inc., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 390, 596 N.E.2d 423. Here, there is no such control, as there is with traditional public utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">{\u00b6 30} As a private sanitary-landfill operator, Rumpke is subject primarily to the regulations of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cOEPA\u201d) pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>to R.C. Chapter 3734 as well as the local solid-waste regulator, the Hamilton County Recycling and Solid Waste District (\u201cHCRSWD\u201d) pursuant to R.C. Chapters 3734 and 343. The concerns of the OEPA are related to the \u201cadverse environmental effects related to the collection and disposal of solid waste,\u201d and therefore \u201c[t]he rules and regulations promulgated and administered by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency arise from this public concern and are imposed for the protection of the environment and for human health and safety.\u201d <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 389, 596 N.E.2d 423, citing <em>Families Against Reily/Morgan Sites v.

Like the OEPA, the solid-waste-management districts have a major concern for the management of waste. The vision statement of the HCRSWD is as follows: \u201cThe District provides ethical environmental leadership to equitably promote the public good through innovative and responsible strategies leading to the management of all waste as a resource that leads to a society that generates zero waste.\u201d http:// www.hamiltoncountyrecycles.org/index.php?page=vision-statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 32} We have held that \u201cthe public concern with environmental regulation is separate and distinct from the public concern involved in the regulation of public utilities.\u201d <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 389, 596 N.E.2d 423. Therefore, the public concern of both OEPA and HCRSWD is not the same public concern that is relevant when determining whether an entity is a public utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 33} Still, Rumpke argues that the regulation of its landfill is not limited to environmental protection, but also includes regulations to enjoin, take over, or terminate landfill operations. Rumpke also argues that it is regulated for nuisance and operates under a requirement that the landfill be fully utilized. It asserts that \u201cthe General Assembly has provided for regulatory oversight of landfill location, design, operation, permitting, closure and post-closure handling.\u201d Although we do not dispute that the landfill is subject to each of the regulations mentioned by Rumpke, none of those are of consequence to our analysis here. Our review is limited to those factors set forth by this court in <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>Public-Service Factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 34} Turning to the public-service factor, the lack of governmental regulation means that Rumpke determines to whom it provides its service and how or when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>that service is provided. The general public has no legal right to demand or receive Rumpke\u2019s services. Therefore, there is no assurance or guarantee that Rumpke will provide its services to the public indiscriminately and reasonably, nor is there anything preventing Rumpke from arbitrarily or unreasonably withdrawing its services. Rumpke could lawfully close its doors to the public. Furthermore, as a private company, Rumpke has the ability to set its own rates without any governmental oversight. Thus, Rumpke fails to meet the public-service factor of the public-utility test.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANe\">Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp, P.L.L., Joseph L. Trauth Jr., Thomas M. Tepe Jr., Charles M. Miller, and Barrett P. Tullis, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\n<em>Public-Concern Factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 35} As for the public-concern factor, the parties do not dispute that Rumpke occupies a monopolistic position in the marketplace by collecting the majority of the solid waste generated within Hamilton County. Rumpke also provides an essential service by operating its sanitary landfill and collecting and disposing of solid waste. However, no governmental body, including the OEPA and HCRSWD, regulates the rates or methods of Rumpke. That means that Rumpke may treat discriminately and arbitrarily the portion of the public to whom it provides its services. Because Rumpke dominates such a large portion of the market and provides an essential service but does so without any government oversight or regulation, it is not a public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 36} The lack of governmental control over the public-service and public-concern factors in <em>A &amp; B Refuse Disposers </em>is critical in determining that Rumpke is not a public utility. Thus, we hold that a privately owned sanitary landfill cannot be a common-law public utility exempt from township zoning when there is no public regulation or oversight of its rates and charges, no statutory or regulatory requirement that all solid waste delivered to the landfill be accepted for disposal, and no right of the public to demand and receive its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 37} For these reasons, we reverse the appellate court\u2019s decision affirming the trial court\u2019s declaration that Rumpke is a public utility for purposes of R.C. 519.211. Therefore, we remand the cause to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-11\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aj8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Brahm &amp; Cunningham, L.L.C., Catherine A.
