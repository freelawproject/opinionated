On June 21, 2006, we suspended her license for six months, staying the suspension on a condition, and placed her on a one-year monitored probation for falsifying a document in an attempt to convince the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles that she had been properly insured at the time she received a traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>citation. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Stubbs, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 446, 2006-Ohio-2818, 848 N.E.2d 843. In December 2007, and then again in November 2009, we imposed attorney-registration suspensions on Stubbs for her failure to register for the 2007-2009 and 2009-2011 bienniums. <em>In re Attorney Registration Suspension of Stubbs, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1420, 2007-Ohio-6463, 877 N.E.2d 305; <em>In re Attorney Registration Suspension of Stubbs, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1475, 2009-Ohio-5786, 915 N.E.2d 1256. And on February 15, 2011, in a default proceeding, we indefinitely suspended Stubbs from the practice of law for failure to maintain accurate records of the funds held in her client trust account, failure to promptly deliver funds that a client was entitled to receive, and failure to cooperate in the disciplinary process. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Stubbs, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-553, 944 N.E.2d 225. That suspension remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 2} On February 14, 2011, relator, Columbus Bar Association, charged Stubbs in a ten-count complaint with numerous violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Although the complaint was served on Stubbs by certified mail, she did not file an answer, and relator moved for an entry of default. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline appointed a master commissioner, who found that Stubbs had committed some of the charged misconduct and recommended an indefinite suspension, to run consecutively to Stubbs\u2019s previous suspension. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct but, as a sanction, recommends permanent disbarment. Other than the one exception noted below, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, and we permanently disbar Stubbs from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Count I \u2014 Kacey R. Noel Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 3} Based on the sworn affidavit of grievant Kacey R. Noel, the board found that in early December 2007, Noel, who had been accused of writing bad checks, gave Stubbs a $500 retainer and a $100 gift card to represent her. At that time, Stubbs\u2019s first attorney-registration suspension was in effect, and she informed Noel that she needed the retainer to pay her reinstatement fee. Despite Stubbs\u2019s attempt to work out an agreement with Noel\u2019s creditors, Noel was indicted on December 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 4} Noel felt that Stubbs had failed to adequately represent her and requested the return of her money and gift card. Stubbs refused, and the two subsequently exchanged a number of increasingly uncivil voicemail messages. Stubbs then filed a criminal complaint against her client with the Columbus city attorney, and according to Noel, Stubbs provided the city attorney with recordings of Noel\u2019s voicemail messages containing client communications to corrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>rate the allegations. Noel claims that the city attorney initially charged her with telephone harassment, but the charges were later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">{\u00b6 5} The master commissioner and board found that Stubbs\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client), 1.5(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from making an agreement for, charging, or collecting an illegal or clearly excessive fee), 1.16(d) (requiring a lawyer withdrawing from representation to take steps reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interest, including returning all client property to which the client is entitled), 1.6(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from revealing confidential client information without informed consent), 5.5(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). We adopt these findings of fact and of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Count IV \u2014 Roland Pschibul Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">{\u00b6 6} Based on the sworn affidavit of grievant Roland Pschibul, the board found that in May 2009, Stubbs represented Pschibul\u2019s wife in a custody matter regarding his minor daughter. During that representation, Stubbs improperly notarized and filed a falsified affidavit. Specifically, Stubbs filed an affidavit purportedly signed by the minor child, but the child did not sign the document and was not in Stubbs\u2019s presence when she notarized it. The master commissioner and board found that Stubbs\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h), and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 7} Although relator\u2019s complaint alleged that Stubbs also violated Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from committing an illegal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), neither the master commissioner nor the board made any findings with respect to these allegations. Because the board did not address these violations, we dismiss the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Count VI \u2014 Patricia Hall Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 8} Based on the sworn affidavit of grievant Patricia Hall, the board found that on November 10, 2010, Hall paid Stubbs a $285 retainer to represent her in a divorce case. Stubbs, however, never filed the divorce case, and whenever Hall inquired as to the date on which the action would be filed, Stubbs either failed to return her phone calls or gave her a false date. Although Stubbs initially agreed to refund Hall\u2019s money, she never returned it. The master commissioner and board found that Stubbs\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1, 1.5(a), 1.16(d), and 8.4(h). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 9} We disagree, however, with the master commissioner and board\u2019s finding that sufficient evidence exists to conclude that Stubbs violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a) for representing Hall while her license was suspended. Stubbs was suspended from the practice of law between November 3, 2009, and March 5, 2010, for failure to register. The master commissioner and board found that Stubbs accepted Hall\u2019s retainer during this time period. While Hall\u2019s grievance states that she paid Stubbs on \u201cNovember 10, 2009,\u201d relator\u2019s complaint and Hall\u2019s sworn affidavit state that she hired Stubbs on \u201cNovember 10, 2010.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the sworn evidence in the record does not clearly and convincingly show that Stubbs committed the charged misconduct, and we therefore dismiss the violation. We also dismiss relator\u2019s charges for violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client) and 1.4 (requiring a lawyer to reasonably communicate with a client) because the master commissioner and board made no findings with respect to these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Count VII \u2014 Adoption Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 10} Based on the sworn affidavit of grievant Kelly C. Patton, the board found that in October 2009, Stubbs filed an adoption petition on behalf of a prospective parent in the Franklin County Probate Court. The matter was scheduled for a hearing before Magistrate Patton on December 8, 2009. As noted above, Stubbs\u2019s license was suspended at that time. Stubbs unsuccessfully attempted to continue the hearing, and on the day of the hearing, her client appeared in court alone. After questioning from the magistrate, the client stated that she was unaware of Stubbs\u2019s suspension. Stubbs then appeared and proceeded to counsel her client and a representative from Franklin County Children Services about the need for a continuance due to a factual matter. The magistrate continued the matter until January 2010, at which time the client appeared with new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 11} The master commissioner and board found, and we agree, that Stubbs\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter), 5.5(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Count VIII \u2014 Reana Allen Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 12} Based on the sworn affidavit of grievant Reana Allen, the board found that in September 2009, Allen paid Stubbs an initial retainer of $150 to represent her in a divorce action. Stubbs later informed Allen that she had made several court appearances in the case and that the trial was set for March 23, 2010. Stubbs, however, had not scheduled any hearings or otherwise appeared in the case after filing the complaint, and when Allen attempted to reach Stubbs, she did not respond. In addition, Stubbs never informed Allen of her license suspension, and Allen was ultimately forced to obtain new counsel. The master commissioner and board found, and we agree, that Stubbs\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.5(a), 1.16(d), 5.5(a), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Count X \u2014 Failure to Cooperate</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 13} Relator charged Stubbs with failure to cooperate in eight disciplinary investigations. For each investigation, relator submitted sworn testimony demonstrating that it had mailed to Stubbs a copy of each grievance, along with additional letters of inquiry for each grievance. Even though Stubbs signed for most of the letters, she never submitted a written response as requested. In addition, Stubbs signed a receipt accepting relator\u2019s notice of deposition and a subpoena requesting documents that were sent by certified mail, but she failed to appear for the deposition and did not respond to the request for production of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 14} Because Stubbs repeatedly ignored relator\u2019s investigative inquiries, we agree with the master commissioner and board that Stubbs\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to respond to a demand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring a lawyer to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Remaining Counts</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 15} Relator did not submit evidence to support Counts II, III, V, and IX of its complaint. We therefore dismiss the allegations in those counts under former Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F)(l)(b), 64 Ohio St.3d XCVII, which requires \u201c[s]worn or certified documentary prima facie evidence\u201d in support of a motion for default.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">{\u00b6 16} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 17} The board found no mitigating factors in this case but found eight of the nine aggravating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1), including prior disciplinary offenses, dishonest or selfish motive, a pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct, vulnerability of and resulting harm to the client, and failure to make restitution. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 18} Relator recommended permanent disbarment. The master commissioner found that because Stubbs\u2019s misconduct preceded or overlapped the misconduct for which she was indefinitely suspended in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Stubbs, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-553, 944 N.E.2d 225, the appropriate sanction was another indefinite suspension, to run consecutively to the previously imposed suspension. Based on the \u201cpervasiveness\u201d of Stubbs\u2019s misconduct, the board disagreed and recommends permanent disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 19} We have previously explained that \u201c \u2018[t]he normal penalty for continuing to practice law while under suspension is disbarment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Sabroff, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 182, 2009-Ohio-4205, 915 N.E.2d 307, \u00b6 21, quoting <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Allison, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 322, 2003-Ohio-776, 784 N.E.2d 695, \u00b6 12. Moreover, we have held that \u201caccepting legal fees and then failing to carry out the contract for employment is tantamount to theft of client funds and is also cause for disbarment, particularly when coupled with neglect, a history of misconduct, and other disciplinary infractions.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Frazier, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-4481, 853 N.E.2d 295, \u00b6 54, citing <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Moushey, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 427, 2004-Ohio-6897, 819 N.E.2d 1112, \u00b6 16; <em>see also Disciplinary Counsel v. Henry, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 398, 2010-Ohio-6206, 939 N.E.2d 1255, \u00b6 33 (\u201crespondent\u2019s pattern of neglect and failure to perform as promised, followed by his failure to return unearned fees and client documents and his complete disregard for the ensuing disciplinary proceedings, warrants his permanent disbarment\u201d); <em>Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Cicirella, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 448, 2012-Ohio-4300, 979 N.E.2d 244, \u00b6 12 (an attorney was permanently disbarred when she \u201cnot only continued to practice law while under suspension, but also took her client\u2019s money, failed to carry out the contract of employment, failed to return her client\u2019s money or records, and failed to cooperate in the resulting disciplinary investigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b620} Having considered Stubbs\u2019s conduct, the profusion of aggravating factors, the absence of any mitigating factors, and our precedent, we conclude that the appropriate sanction is permanent disbarment. Stubbs\u2019s neglect of entrusted client matters, her acceptance of client funds without performing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>work, her attempts to practice law while her license was suspended, her failure to inform clients of her license suspension, her dishonesty, her incompetence, and her failure to cooperate in the disciplinary process demonstrate that she is no longer fit to practice law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ae7\">Jeffrey C. Rogers; Yvonne L. Twiss; and Bruce A. Campbell, Bar Counsel, and A. Alysha Clous, Assistant Bar Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, SaKeya MonCheree Stubbs is hereby permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to Stubbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">. In count I of its complaint, as well as in counts VI and VII, relator charged Stubbs with a violation of \u201cRule 5.5(b) [unauthorized practice of law].\u201d For all three counts, the master commissioner and board determined that Stubbs had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law; however, they determined that her conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a), rather than 5.5(b). From the misconduct described, it is clear that relator meant to cite Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a). We agree with the master commissioner and board\u2019s determination that Stubbs\u2019s charged misconduct here \u2014 i.e., the unauthorized practice of law \u2014 violates Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a). <em>See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Meehan, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 51, 2012-Ohio-3894, 975 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 5 (attorney violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5(a) for practicing while under attorney-registration suspension).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
