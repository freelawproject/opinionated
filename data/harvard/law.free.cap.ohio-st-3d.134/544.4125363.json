Shimko was also charged with engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, in violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 3} Shimko answered the complaint. He admitted making the statements, but denied that the statements were false. He also denied that they impugned the qualifications or integrity of the judicial officer, Judge Richard Markus.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 4} The board adopted the panel\u2019s recommendation that Shimko be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, relying on <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Proctor, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 215, 2012-Ohio-684, 963 N.E.2d 806. Shimko objects to the board\u2019s findings and recommended sanction, and seeks instead dismissal or a stayed suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">{\u00b6 5} Upon consideration of the report of the board, the findings of the board, the briefs of the parties, and oral argument, we conclude that Shimko violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a) and 8.4(h). We suspend him from the practice of law for a period of one year with the entire suspension stayed on condition that he commit no further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">{\u00b6 6} The specific allegations involve events between visiting Judge Markus and Shimko, who was one of the attorneys for the parties in <em>First Fed. Bank of Ohio v. Angelini, </em>Crawford County Court of Common Pleas Case No. 03 CV 0098. The issues involve statements made during three separate periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">{\u00b6 7} The first time period involved an unrecorded telephone conference on October 9, 2008, between Judge Markus and the attorneys in the <em>First Fed. Bank </em>case. During the telephone conference, which was initiated primarily to address Shimko\u2019s request for a continuance of the trial, the conversation shifted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Shimko\u2019s alleged unwillingness to enter into stipulations, despite his having filed proposed stipulations before the telephone conference. The following day, Shimko filed a motion to recuse Judge Markus along with an affidavit of disqualification with the Supreme Court of Ohio, alleging that Judge Markus had exhibited bias and prejudice against Shimko during the telephone conference. In the affidavit of disqualification, Shimko alleged that Judge Markus had stated that he \u201chad lost all respect\u201d for Shimko, had stated that he thought that Shimko was \u201cincompetent for embarking upon such a trial strategy,\u201d and had \u201cimpliedly threatened to punish [Shimko\u2019s] client if [Shimko] further disappointed\u201d Judge Markus.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 8} Judge Markus denied making the comments attributed to him. The other attorneys involved in the conference filed affidavits that supported either Judge Markus\u2019s denial or Shimko\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 9} The second time period involved Judge Markus\u2019s presiding over the trial in the <em>First Fed. Bank </em>case. On February 6, 2009, after an eight-day trial, Judge Markus declared a mistrial based upon (1) inconsistencies between the jury\u2019s verdict and answers to interrogatories and (2) Shimko\u2019s misconduct during the trial, which, according to the judge, deprived the plaintiff of a fair trial. Examples of misconduct were offered by the board to show the mindset and motivation of Shimko in making allegations against Judge Markus in Shimko\u2019s later court filings. In the board\u2019s opinion, these incidents show that Shimko\u2019s later allegations were false. Shimko relied on these excerpts to the contrary: to show that his allegations concerning Judge Markus were justified and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 10} One. such incident occurred during voir dire, when Shimko challenged a juror for cause because the juror was a depositor of one of the banks involved in the case. In the ensuing discussion, which occurred outside the jury\u2019s hearing, Judge Markus denied the challenge and added, \u201cIf, in fact, we were to accept your view and to disqualify all of the jurors who are depositors in one of these two institutions, we may well have to seek a change of venue.\u201d This comment led to the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">Mr. Shimko: Wouldn\u2019t bother me, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-9\">The Court: Are you moving for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-10\">Mr. Shimko: No, I am not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-11\">The Court: Oh, all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">Mr. Shimko: Does it come with a change of judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-13\">The Court: I\u2019m interested in your comment. Is that something that you think is appropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Mr. Shimko: Well, Your Honor, I think we have all avoided speaking about the 400-pound gorilla elephant that\u2019s in the room. And I still must go on the record to say that the Angelini Defendants have no confidence that they can obtain a fair trial in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">The Court: I\u2019m sorry that you have that view. I can assure you, sir, that I have no favor or disfavor for you or any of the lawyers or any of the litigants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">I may disagree with your view on some legal issues or on some strategy that you choose to follow, but I can assure you that I will give you and every other litigant the best I can of a fair trial using the rules of law as I understand them and the evidence that I present \u2014 that I hear. I don\u2019t present evidence. I\u2019m really sorry that you have to make that statement, Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">Mr. Shimko: Indeed, I am too, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">{\u00b6 11} On several other occasions \u2014 including during cross-examination of a witness, during use of an exhibit, and before and during closing argument\u2014 Shimko interacted with Judge Markus in what the board referred to as \u201ca disrespectful and confrontational manner.\u201d For example, during the trial, opposing counsel called John Angelini in his case-in-chief. John Angelini was the father of Shimko\u2019s client and also one of Shimko\u2019s witnesses. During a recess, Judge Markus advised Shimko that he was not permitted to use leading questions when questioning John Angelini.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The Court: I have advised Counsel that my reading of Evidence Rule 611 indicates that a party questioning someone identified with an adverse party shall be permitted to use leading questions, and that is why I had no problem with the questions asked by counsel for the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">I suggested to other counsel that I view that this witness is identified with Jeffrey Angelini and, therefore, his counsel should avoid using leading questions; that counsel for Galion Bank can use leading questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Mr. Shimko: Unless they call them in their direct ease-in-chief, and that\u2019s what they did. And I\u2019m entitled to cross-examine in his case-in-chief, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The Court: I appreciate your position.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Mr. Shimko: Don\u2019t appreciate yours.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Mr. Shimko: Let me assert one more, then. I think this is further evidence of a bias and prejudice of the Court, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 12} Shimko cites other examples that occurred before, during, and after trial to demonstrate that Judge Markus was biased, that he appeared to be biased, and that he acted on his bias. For example, Judge Markus ruled that based on Shimko\u2019s lateness in paying an expert-witness fee, Shimko could not use the witness\u2019s deposition at trial. Although Shimko concedes that he could be sanctioned for the late payment to the expert witness, he argues that the sanction was unusually harsh, contrary to his experience in practice, and designed to influence the merits of the case. Shimko also argues that the reasons for Judge Markus\u2019s granting of a mistrial \u2014 particularly the allegation of Shimko\u2019s misconduct \u2014 were unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 13} In addition, Shimko points to a posttrial hearing and phone conference at which Judge Markus sua sponte held that because Shimko had not properly substituted parties, Shimko would be precluded from participating in the hearing. Judge Markus also required Shimko to pay for his own court reporter in the phone conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 14} The third series of events involved the filing of appellate briefs and additional posttrial affidavits of bias and prejudice. Shimko filed an appeal in the Third District Court of Appeals on September 1, 2009. In his brief, Shimko made several comments regarding Judge Markus\u2019s integrity, including the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\u2022 When the trial court realized that the Answers to the Interrogatories mandated a judgment in favor of Jeffrey Angelini and against First Federal, the trial court\u2019s bias once again surfaced and he contrived a means to find that the jury was now somehow confused, even though they had followed his instructions to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">\u2022 The court\u2019s ruling, motivated by its own agenda, was nothing but an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">\u2022 Throughout the trial, the trial judge was so vindictive in his attitude toward appellant\u2019s counsel that he became an advocate for First Federal. In short, the trial judge was trying First Federal\u2019s counsel\u2019s case for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">{\u00b6 15} Shimko also filed a brief in which he further discussed Judge Markus\u2019s integrity:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u2022 The absurdity of the trial court\u2019s conduct in this instance ought to underscore the whimsical lengths to which it was willing to go to deny Jeffrey Angelini his verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u2022 In fact, the trial court felt that its contention that the jury was confused was so thin that it had to resort to manufacturing allegations of attorney misconduct to obscure his own abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\u2022 When the trial court realized that the jury had returned a verdict for Jeffrey Angelini, he arbitrarily disregarded the protocol he had originally adopted, and fabricated allegations of attorney misconduct to camouflage his own unreasonable and injudicious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 16} While the case was pending on appeal, Shimko filed a second affidavit of disqualification, casting many of the same allegations contained in his appellate briefs. Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer dismissed Shimko\u2019s second affidavit of disqualification. On May 17, 2010, Shimko filed a third affidavit of disqualification against Judge Markus, in which he reiterated most of the allegations from his previous affidavits. On May 24, 2010, the court of appeals affirmed Judge Markus\u2019s grant of a mistrial. <em>First Fed. Bank of Ohio v. Angelini, </em>3d Dist. No. 3_09-03, 2010-Ohio-2300, 2010 WL 2026630. On May 26, 2010, Chief Justice Eric Brown dismissed Shimko\u2019s third affidavit of disqualification, stating, \u201cShimko is cautioned that the filing of any further frivolous, unsubstantiated, or repeated affidavits of disqualification involving the underlying case may result in an imposition of appropriate sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 17} Shimko does not deny writing any of the above comments in his briefs or affidavits. He indicates that he believed them to be true. He denies that he intended them to impugn Judge Markus\u2019s integrity and claims that to find a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a) and 8.4(h) would chill the right of future litigants to file affidavits of bias. Shimko argues that he had a \u201cfirmly held belief\u2019 that Judge Markus violated his duty as a judge and that Shimko had a right to complain about the conduct of Judge Markus. He refers to <em>Gardner, </em>which cited with approval the rationale from courts of other states that \u201can objective malice standard strikes a constitutionally permissible balance between an attorney\u2019s right to criticize the judiciary and the public\u2019s interest in preserving confidence in the judicial system: Lawyers may freely voice criticisms supported by a reasonable factual basis even if they turn out to be mistaken.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 30, citing <em>Standing Commt. on Discipline, United States Dist. Court, Cent. Dist. of California v. Yagman, </em>55 F.3d 1430, 1438 (9th Cir.1995). In his closing argument before the panel, Shimko asked rhetorically whether Ohio \u201cattorneys must sacrifice their client\u2019s constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial at the altar of judicial deference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>{\u00b6 18} The board found that Shimko\u2019s arguments missed the point of the complaint. Shimko has had and continues to have the right to allege violations by judicial officers in the proper forum and by using the proper method under the rules provided by this court. The board stressed that it found no violation in the filing or specific factual examples used to support these allegations. What it found as actionable violations was the use of ad hominem attacks and hyperbole in appellate briefs and posttrial affidavits, including the following: \u201cfabricating allegations,\u201d \u201ccompletely fabricating the basis for his decision,\u201d \u201cdeliberately misrepresenting,\u201d \u201ccontriving a reason,\u201d and \u201cpersonally invested in the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 19} Shimko concedes that attorneys do not have an unfettered right to say whatever they desire about a member of the judiciary during or after trial. He argues, however, that as long as the subjective belief appears reasonable to the attorney, all comments are permissible regardless of the reckless disregard of the truth. The board found such a subjective test unworkable as the test for falsity or reckless disregard of the truth. We note that the difference between acceptable fervent advocacy and misconduct is not always easily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 20} The board\u2019s finding was consistent with this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gardner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">{\u00b6 21} As the Court of Appeals of New York observed in <em>In re Holtzman, </em>78 N.Y.2d 184, 192, 573 N.Y.S.2d 39, 577 N.E.2d 30 (1991), adopting a subjective standard \u201cwould immunize all accusations, however reckless or irresponsible, from censure as long as the attorney uttering them did not actually entertain serious doubts as to their truth.\u201d The state\u2019s interest in protecting the public, the administration of justice, and the legal profession supports applying a different standard in disciplinary proceedings. <em>In re Chmura, </em>461 Mich. 517, 543, 608 N.W.2d 31 (2000), citing <em>United States Dist. Court, E. Dist. of Wash. v. Sandlin, </em>12 F.3d 861, 867 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>Gardner, </em>we imposed a six-month suspension from the practice of law upon an attorney who accused the court of appeals panel of being dishonest and of ignoring well-established law. <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 36. We concluded that that attorney had violated DR 8-102(B), the predecessor to Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a). <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Proctor, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 215, 2012-Ohio-684, 963 N.E.2d 806, at \u00b6 6-8, attorney Phillip Proctor falsely accused a judge in two separate pleadings of harboring a bias against him, engaging in an ex parte communication with the prosecutor, and attempting to cover up or deny his actions. Although Proctor had originally stipulated to a violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a), he reneged on his stipulation at the disciplinary hearing. He claimed that he had a reasonable belief that the statements were true. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. This court, citing <em>Gardner, </em>suspended Proctor for six months. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Shimko seeks to distinguish his misconduct from that of Gardner and Proctor by alleging that his genuinely held beliefs that Judge Markus\u2019s inappropriate actions adversely affected his client warrant a lesser sanction. Shimko claims that Gardner and Proctor did not honestly believe in the rightfulness of their positions, as evidenced by their stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 25} The board determined that the findings of Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer and Chief Justice Eric Brown as to the lack of claimed bias of Judge Markus are binding. <em>See State v. Getsy, 84 </em>Ohio St.3d 180, 702 N.E.2d 866 (1998), and <em>Haney v. Trout, </em>10th Dist. Nos. 00AP-1448 and 00AP-1457, 2002 WL 205997 (Feb. 12, 2002). The board concluded, in the alternative, that no objective, reasonable evidence exists to support the allegations in Shimko\u2019s briefs or affidavits as to the specific claimed impropriety or bias of Judge Markus. The fact that the trial court ruled against Shimko in matters of evidence or procedure does not equate to bias or show in and of itself improper conduct by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 26} The board considered numerous statements concerning Judge Markus that Shimko admits writing. The board concluded that these statements were proved by clear and convincing evidence to be unreasonable and objectively false with a mens rea of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 27} The board concluded that holding Shimko accountable for his conduct would not violate or chill his First Amendment rights under the United States Constitution or his rights under Article I, Section II of the Ohio Constitution. <em>See Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 14-16. Rules of conduct that prohibit impugning the integrity of judges are not designed to shield judges from criticism but are to preserve public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of our system of justice. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 28-29, citing <em>In re Terry, </em>271 Ind. 499, 502, 394 N.E.2d 94 (1979), and <em>In re Graham, </em>453 N.W.2d 313, 322 (Minn.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 28} The board concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Shimko had violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.2(a) (forbidding making statements known to be false or with reckless disregard to their truth or falsity concerning the qualification or integrity of a judicial officer) and 8.4(h) (forbidding conduct that adversely reflects on the fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">AGGRAVATION, MITIGATION, AND SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 29} Shimko made written statements accusing a judicial officer of dishonesty and improper motives in his rulings. These statements were deliberate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>calculated and made over a nine-month period. Some were part of an apparent strategy to convince the court of appeals to overturn Judge Markus\u2019s decision. Shimko was unapologetic and did not acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. He continues to maintain the reasonableness of his accusations of Judge Markus\u2019s bias and of his commitment to serve his client. Shimko received a public reprimand on June 23, 2009, from the Arizona Supreme Court, for which he was reciprocally disciplined in Ohio. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Shimko, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1201, 2009-Ohio-6879, 918 N.E.2d 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 30} Shimko was cooperative in the disciplinary process, and no apparent damage has been done to Judge Markus\u2019s reputation. Shimko has an excellent reputation with the bench and bar and is an intelligent, accomplished, and competent attorney who zealously represents his clients to the best of his ability. Based on his demeanor, the board determined that he subjectively, yet honestly, believes in the rightfulness of his position. Consequently, the board did not conclude that his motives were dishonest. Finally, his sanctionable statements were made in a forum in such a way that it is likely that only the bench and opposing counsel would see them; at no time was the sanctionable activity shown to the jury or general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 31} The board adopted the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation of the panel. It recommends that Timothy Andrew Shimko be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 32} We agree that Shimko should be sanctioned and suspended; nevertheless, we conclude that the suspension should be stayed. In reversing the suspension and fine of an attorney, a federal court of appeals stated, \u201cAttorneys should be free to challenge, in appropriate legal proceedings, a court\u2019s perceived partiality without the court misconstruing such a challenge as an assault on the integrity of the court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>72 F.3d 25, 29 (5th Cir.1995). That court has also stated that \u201cbecause attorney suspension is a quasi-criminal punishment in character, any disciplinary rules used to impose this sanction on attorneys must be strictly construed resolving ambiguities in favor of the person charged.\u201d <em>In re Thalheim, </em>853 F.2d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 33} Our conclusion is largely based upon the fact that the statements in this case, although made in \u201ca public document, would receive about as much scrutiny from the public if [they] were written on the wind.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 43 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). In <em>Gardner, </em>the offending statements were between the \u201cattorney and the bench, and were presented in such a way that only the bench and opposing counsel would see them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, Shimko\u2019s remarks and allegations were either made out of earshot of the jury or in filings to the chief justice of this court or to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>{\u00b6 34} There is, admittedly, a fine line between vigorous advocacy on behalf of one\u2019s client and improper conduct; identifying that line is an inexact science. Although Shimko\u2019s comments about Judge Markus were rough, unnecessary, and ultimately unproductive, they were less defamatory than Gardner\u2019s rant against three judges on the court of appeals. Moreover, as the panel noted, Shimko was cooperative in the disciplinary process. And there has been no apparent damage done to Judge Markus\u2019s reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 35} Shimko could have and should have presented his allegations one at a time, pointing to the record and using words that were powerful, but less heated. It is his choice of language, not his right to allege bias in his affidavits and in his appellate briefs, that brought him before the disciplinary counsel. In <em>Gardner, </em>we held that \u201c[ujnfounded attacks against the integrity of the judiciary require an actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 36, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. West, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 5, 706 N.E.2d 760 (1999). Here, we conclude that Shimko\u2019s comments are not equivalent to those in <em>Gardner, </em>even though his vigorous advocacy went too far. Such behavior by an attorney should not go without sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, Shimko is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with the entire suspension stayed on condition that he commit no further misconduct. Costs are taxed to Shimko.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-8\">Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ARC\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger and McGee Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b655-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ari\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 37} I dissent because the majority ignores a long-standing, bright-line rule: \u201cUnfounded attacks against the integrity of the judiciary require an actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, \u00b6 36, citing <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. West, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 5, 706 N.E.2d 760 (1999), and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Hartwell, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 258, 520 N.E.2d 226 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">{\u00b6 38} For that reason, I would impose six months\u2019 actual suspension, as recommended by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">\n<em>The relevance of the affidavits of disqualification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">{\u00b6 39} As a threshold issue, the majority should clarify that Shimko\u2019s affidavit-of-disqualification filings are relevant only for purposes of providing context. In those proceedings, it was determined that Shimko\u2019s allegations against Markus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>were \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d Even so, the content of Shimko\u2019s affidavits of disqualification is not a basis for his discipline. Rather, the board independently reviewed Shimko\u2019s allegations \u2014 made elsewhere \u2014 and concluded that his statements were unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">{\u00b6 40} Ohio\u2019s statutory affidavit-of-disqualification process authorizes the removal of a judge from a ease if a party or attorney can prove that the judge has (1) an interest in the litigation or (2) a bias or prejudice for or against a party or counsel. R.C. 2501.13 (appellate judges), 2701.03 (common pleas judges), 2101.39 (probate judges), and 2701.031 (municipal and county judges).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 41} Three times, Shimko availed himself of the affidavit-of-disqualification process, seeking Markus\u2019s removal from the case. Three times, Shimko was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 42} The board expressly held that Shimko\u2019s first filing did not constitute a violation of the disciplinary rules. Board report at \u00b6 33. It did not explicitly reach the issue of whether the second and third filings constituted violations, but it did make clear that its findings that Shimko violated the rules were not based on any of his affidavit-of-disqualification filings. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. In doing so, it emphasized that the affidavit-of-disqualification process is the \u201cproper forum\u201d \u201cto allege violations of judicial officers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 43} The majority purports to accept the board\u2019s findings but also concludes that an actual suspension is not required, in part because \u201c \u2018[attorneys should be free to challenge, <em>in appropriate legal proceedings, </em>a court\u2019s perceived partiality without the court misconstruing such a challenge as an assault on the integrity of the court.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 32, quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>72 F.3d 25, 29 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 44} I agree with the board that the affidavit-of-disqualification procedure is the appropriate legal proceeding through which attorneys may pursue claims of judicial bias. And Shimko was permitted considerable latitude in that context. Because Shimko is not being disciplined on that basis, the majority\u2019s reliance on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Brown </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">\n<em>Actual suspension is required</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">{\u00b6 45} The majority concedes that the board\u2019s recommendation for six months\u2019 actual suspension \u201cwas consistent with this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gardner.\u201d </em>Majority opinion at \u00b6 20. Yet it reaches a different result by relying primarily on Justice Pfeifer\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Gardner, </em>which attracted not a single vote other than Justice Pfeifer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Gardner, </em>we rejected the board\u2019s recommendation to impose a stayed suspension from the practice of law. <em>Gardner, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 416, 2003-Ohio-4048, 793 N.E.2d 425, at \u00b6 12. Gardner had been representing a criminal defendant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>appeal. The appellate court issued a decision in favor of the prosecution. Gardner filed a motion for reconsideration in which he accused the panel of being dishonest and ignoring well-established law. Among other things, he accused the panel of being \u201cresults driven.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">{\u00b6 47} Facing discipline, Gardner stipulated that by making the remarks, he engaged in undignified or discourteous conduct that was degrading to a tribunal, in violation of former DR T \u2014 106(C)(6). But he contested the allegation that he had knowingly made a false accusation about a judge in violation of former DR 8-102(B). The board disagreed and found that clear and convincing evidence proved that he had. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 48} We adopted those findings but held that Gardner\u2019s license had to be suspended because, as a matter of course, \u201c[ujnfounded attacks against the integrity of the judiciary require an actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 36, citing <em>West, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 5, 706 N.E.2d 760, and <em>Hartwell, </em>35 Ohio St.3d 258, 520 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 49} In so holding, we explained that false allegations about a judicial officer that are made in court filings are especially egregious. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. \u201cA courtroom is not a forum for personal or political grandstanding, and the attorneys who practice in it \u2018possess, and are perceived by the public as possessing, special knowledge of the workings of the judicial branch of government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Assn. v. Porter, </em>766 P.2d 958, 969 (Okla.1988). Therefore, \u201c[(lawyers\u2019 statements made during court proceedings are \u2018likely to be received as especially authoritative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Gentile v. Nevada State Bar, </em>501 U.S. 1030, 1074, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 50} Notably, Justice Pfeifer disagreed with that judgment. He concluded, singularly, that Gardner\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201cwhile a public document, would receive about as much scrutiny from the public if it were written on the wind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). He agreed with Gardner that a public reprimand would have been sufficient, \u201cespecially given the virtually nonpublic release of his comments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 51} Similarly here, the majority refuses to impose an actual suspension, as required by <em>Gardner, </em>and explains that its refusal \u201cis largely based upon the fact that the statements in this case, although made in \u2018a public document, would receive about as much scrutiny from the public if [they] were written on the wind.\u2019 \u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 33, quoting <em>Gardner </em>at \u00b6 43 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">{\u00b6 52} Moreover, the majority does damage to the bright-line <em>Gardner </em>rule by waxing poetic about the \u201cfine line between vigorous advocacy on behalf of one\u2019s client and improper conduct; identifying that line is an inexact science.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 34. I do not agree that the line is so fine.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aau\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Joseph M. Caligiuri, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A0v\">Richard C. Alkire Co., L.P.A., Richard C. Alkire, and Dean Nieding, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">{\u00b6 53} Attorneys must conform their behavior to what is reasonable, not what is perfect. <em>See Gardner </em>at \u00b6 30. \u201cLawyers may freely voice criticisms supported by a reasonable factual basis even if they turn out to be mistaken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>What we require of attorneys in this context is not unique: \u201cThe court room is not a place for groundless assertions, whatever their nature.\u201d <em>In re Cobb, </em>445 Mass. 452, 473, 838 N.E.2d 1197 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 54} Nor am I persuaded by the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Gardner. </em>Both Gardner and Shimko made false statements about a judicial officer. Both attorneys made the relevant statements in court filings. Both represented that they subjectively believed their statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 55} We imposed an actual suspension upon Gardner even though he had no history of discipline and even though he had apologized for the manner in which he expressed his frustration. He conceded that he had behaved neither appropriately nor professionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 56} In contrast, Shimko has a history of discipline. In 2009, we publicly reprimanded him. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Shimko, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 1201, 2009-Ohio-6879, 918 N.E.2d 1007. And before us now, he shows no contrition.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 57} Deference to an established majority opinion, despite an individual judge\u2019s disagreement with the opinion, is part of the court\u2019s rich tradition of adherence to stare decisis. <em>See, e.g., Shay v. Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, \u00b6 27, quoting <em>Taylor v. Natl. Group of Cos., Inc., </em>65 Ohio St.3d 482, 483, 605 N.E.2d 45 (1992) (Holmes, J., concurring). I am confounded by the majority\u2019s willingness to so readily disregard <em>Gardner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 58} As the majority conspicuously explained, \u201cThe board\u2019s finding was consistent with this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gardner.\u201d </em>Majority opinion at \u00b6 20. I wholeheartedly agree. For that reason, I would impose six months\u2019 actual suspension, as recommended by the board.</p>\n<judges id=\"b658-11\">Lanzinger and McGee Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
