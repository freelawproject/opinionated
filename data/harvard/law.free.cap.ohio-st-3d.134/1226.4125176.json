Spitz, counsel for plaintiffs, has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking to disqualify Judge Richard S. Sheward from acting on any further proceedings in case No. 11-CV-002074, now pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">{\u00b6 2} Attorney Spitz alleges that Judge Sheward has engaged in an improper ex parte communication with opposing counsel. Spitz states that as a result, his clients no longer trust Judge Sheward to impartially adjudicate their case. Spitz does not question the veracity or character of Judge Sheward, but he neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>less believes that the judge should be disqualified to avoid the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Sheward has responded in writing to the concerns raised in the affidavit of disqualification. The judge concedes that he did talk with defendants\u2019 counsel ex parte, but he avers that no discussion about the merits of the case occurred during that conversation. According to Judge Sheward, Spitz overheard only part of the conversation with defense counsel and has taken those parts out of context.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 4} Careful review of the evidence leads to the conclusion that attorney Spitz has met his burden of demonstrating that Judge Sheward engaged in an improper ex parte communication with defendants\u2019 counsel. Accordingly, it is ordered that Judge Sheward be disqualified from further proceedings in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Relevant Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 5} On November 2, 2011, Judge Sheward conducted a pretrial conference in the underlying case. Defense counsel Marion H. Little Jr. had filed a motion for protective order and a motion to stay all discovery, and Judge Sheward scheduled the conference in an attempt to resolve the ongoing discovery disputes between the parties. Spitz and his co-counsel, Fred Bean, participated in the conference via the Bluetooth speaker phone in Spitz\u2019s car. Ray C. Freudiger, counsel for another plaintiff, also participated in the conference by telephone. Little was the only attorney who was present with Judge Sheward in the judge\u2019s office. At the end of the conference, Judge Sheward denied Little\u2019s request to cut off discovery and granted Spitz an extension of time to respond to defendants\u2019 summary-judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">{\u00b6 6} Immediately after the conference had ended, Spitz took a telephone call on the same line from another client that lasted seven to eight minutes. When Spitz ended this phone call, he and co-counsel Bean heard voices on the line and realized that Spitz\u2019s phone had not disconnected from Judge Sheward\u2019s phone at the end of the conference. As a result, both Spitz and Bean were able to overhear Judge Sheward and attorney Little having an ex parte conversation. At some point, Spitz interjected and informed Judge Sheward and Little that he had rejoined the conversation and had overheard their discussion. There is no dispute that at least part of the conversation was overheard by attorneys Spitz and Bean. There is a dispute, however, about what Judge Sheward and attorney Little actually discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">{\u00b6 7} Spitz and Bean allege that Judge Sheward and Little discussed the merits of the case and what had transpired during the just-completed conference. Specifically, they claim that they overheard (1) the judge and Little discussing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>Little\u2019s previously raised motion for sanctions, (2) Little\u2019s comment that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed depositions would be worthless and that the taking of such depositions would be frivolous conduct by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, (3) Judge Sheward\u2019s response that he agreed with Little that the depositions would be worthless and would not affect his decision on any outstanding motions, and (4) Judge Sheward\u2019s remark that \u201ceven though I don\u2019t like them, I have to let them do discovery until the discovery cutoff,\u201d because he did not want to create an appellate issue for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 8} Judge Sheward does not respond specifically to each of these allegations. Rather, he responds generally, stating that \u201call of the discussions that occurred on November 2, 2011, had to do with discovery disputes between the parties, [and] nothing was ever mentioned about the merits of the case.\u201d (Underlining sic.) According to Judge Sheward, Spitz \u201coverheard part of a conversation and has taken those parts out of context.\u201d The judge maintains that he and Little exchanged only \u201cjoking jabs\u201d and that \u201cgood natured ribbing coupled with some complaining about court docket management comprised [their] banter.\u201d And Judge Sheward states that he \u201ctried to set the record straight\u201d once he realized that Spitz had overheard and was offended by the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 9} Attorney Little admits that he did \u201ckibitz\u201d with Judge Sheward as he was preparing to leave after the conference had ended. But Little denies engaging in any improper conversation with the judge. Rather, Little states that he and the judge exchanged \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d comments about Little\u2019s work and vacation schedules. In addition, Little avers that he and the judge engaged in an \u201cacademic\u201d discussion about how other common pleas court judges handle their dockets and about the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 10} Judge Sheward\u2019s staff attorney, Amy B. Koorn, has also submitted a response on behalf of the judge. Koorn was present during both the November 2 conference and the ex parte conversation between Judge Sheward and Little that followed. Koorn states that Judge Sheward and Little engaged in \u201clight conversation\u201d and \u201csuperfluous small talk,\u201d as Little gathered his case file at the conclusion of the conference, but that neither Judge Sheward nor Little spoke about the merits of the underlying case. Rather, according to Koorn, \u201cLittle spoke generally of his recent experience in moving for summary judgment in Common Pleas Court\u201d and made \u201ccollective observations based upon his motion practice experience.\u201d Koorn notes that Little explained that \u201che typically tries to file his motions well in advance of the motion deadline with the hope of avoiding the sort of situation that had prompted the [November 2] conference.\u201d According to Koorn, Little described a \u201cclient centered approach that consists of moving for judgment early in an effort to end the litigation sooner and save his clients unnecessary expense.\u201d In response to Little\u2019s remarks, according to Koorn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>Judge Sheward (1) acknowledged Little\u2019s \u201cnoble attempts,\u201d (2) noted that trial judges have wide discretion in discovery matters, and (3) commented that the court of appeals judges \u201cfrown upon decisions that shorten the discovery period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 11} There is no dispute that Judge Sheward engaged in an ex parte conversation with attorney Little following the November 2 conference. The only question is whether the ex parte communication was improper and would therefore compel the judge\u2019s disqualification from the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 12} Jud.Cond.R. 2.9 directs that judges \u201cshall not initiate, receive, permit, or consider <em>ex parte </em>communications.\u201d In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, however, the question is not whether the judge has violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, but whether the ex parte communication demonstrates bias or prejudice on the part of the judge. <em>See In re Disqualification of Saffold, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 1238, 1239, 763 N.E.2d 605 (2001). To satisfy this test, the communication must address a substantive matter in the case. <em>See In re Disqualification of Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1248, 1249-1250, 657 N.E.2d 1352 (1993), and <em>In re Disqualification of Aurelius, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 1254, 674 N.E.2d 362 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 13} Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and their motion to sanction plaintiffs for filing a frivolous complaint were still pending before the trial court following the November 2 conference. At the end of that conference, Judge Sheward granted Spitz an extension of time to respond to defendants\u2019 summary-judgment motions and denied Little\u2019s request to cut off discovery. Little stated during the November 2 conference that he intended to file a second motion for sanctions to recover fees and costs associated with further discovery conducted by plaintiffs. In addition, the parties continue to be involved in several ongoing discovery disputes, as evidenced by Little\u2019s motion for protective order, filed on November 9, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 14} Attorney Spitz contends that the ex parte conversation included discussions about the merits of the case and what had transpired during the November 2 conference. Specifically, Spitz claims that he overheard Judge Sheward and Little discuss the following topics: (1) Little\u2019s previously raised motion for sanctions, (2) plaintiffs\u2019 proposed depositions, including remarks by Little that the taking of those depositions would be \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201cfrivolous,\u201d and (3) the judge\u2019s decision to allow plaintiffs to take depositions, including the judge\u2019s explanation that he did not want to create an issue for appeal by cutting off discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">{\u00b6 15} For his part, Judge Sheward concedes that after he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs at the November 2 conference, attorney Little \u201ccontinue[d] to argue that all discovery should end.\u201d According to the judge, he stated to Little in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>response that \u201cthere was no reason to cut-off all discovery\u201d and that the court could address the discovery issue \u201cafter the[ ] Motions for Summary Judgment were ruled upon, [but] to cut-off all discovery now would create an unnecessary appellate issue.\u201d In addition to these express admissions, Judge Sheward does not deny or otherwise address Spitz\u2019s claim that this particular discussion occurred ex parte after the conference had ended. Judge Sheward\u2019s failure to deny or otherwise explain the discussion of these topics constitutes an admission that they were discussed ex parte after the conference had ended. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 6-7 (failure to address the occurrence or the substance of the ex parte communication constitutes an admission).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">{\u00b6 16} Moreover, the conclusion that Judge Sheward and Little discussed these same subjects after the conference had ended is bolstered by the responses of staff attorney Koorn and attorney Little. In her response, Koorn states that after the conference had ended, the judge and Little discussed motion practice (including a reference to summary-judgment motions), discovery-related matters, and Judge Sheward\u2019s view that the court of appeals \u201cfrown[s] upon [trial court] decisions that shorten the discovery period.\u201d Similarly, Little admits that after the conference concluded, he and the judge discussed docket-management practices and that Judge Sheward \u201cexpressed his views about the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 17} In sum, sufficient evidence exists in this case to conclude that Judge Sheward allowed Little to continue to argue issues that were still in controversy outside the presence of opposing counsel. Such conduct constitutes grounds for automatic disqualification. <em>See Williams, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 1249-1250, 657 N.E.2d 1352 (ex parte communication that addresses substantive issue warrants disqualification).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 18} But even if there were no discussion about a substantive matter in the case, Judge Sheward\u2019s disqualification would still be required because the ex parte conversation between him and Little creates an appearance of impropriety. <em>Id. </em>at 1250 (even -without evidence of bias, prejudice, or disqualifying interest, the ex parte communication may create an appearance of impropriety).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 19} Attorney Little averred that he and the judge had only an \u201cacademic\u201d discussion about the appellate court and \u201chow some of the other [common pleas] judges in the courthouse were handling their dockets.\u201d But according to the observations of Koorn, who overheard the entire ex parte conversation, their communication went well beyond the discussion that Little described. Koorn states that Little spoke generally to Judge Sheward about his \u201crecent experience in moving for summary judgment in Common Pleas Court\u201d and explained to the judge that \u201che typically tries to file his motions well in advance of the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>deadline with the hope of avoiding the sort of situation that had prompted the [November 2] conference.\u201d According to Koorn, \u201c[rjather than some extravagant plan to sabotage the case schedule, Mr. Little described what [Koorn] would call a client centered approach that consists of moving for judgment early in an effort to end the litigation sooner and save his clients unnecessary expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">{\u00b6 20} The subjects broached by Little, even accepting that he was not talking specifically about the underlying case, have a direct and substantial bearing on matters at issue before Judge Sheward, specifically (1) Little\u2019s requests for sanctions, (2) the ongoing discovery disputes, and (3) Little\u2019s motions for summary judgment. A reasonable person could justifiably infer that Little\u2019s \u201cacademic\u201d comments were an attempt to privately influence the judge in his favor as to matters pending before the court. In fact, according to Koorn, Judge Sheward \u201cacknowledged [Little\u2019s] noble attempts,\u201d suggesting that the judge may have indeed been swayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b621} Judge Sheward contends, however, that it should be evident by his decision in favor of the plaintiffs that he is impartial. But the test in this instance is not whether Judge Sheward is capable of treating the plaintiffs fairly and impartially, but whether a \u201creasonable and objective\u201d person who was aware of the ex parte discussion between Judge Sheward and attorney Little \u201cwould harbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1227, 2004-Ohio-7359, 884 N.E.2d 1082, \u00b6 8 (setting forth the proper test for disqualifying a judge based on an appearance of impropriety). The fact that Judge Sheward and Little discussed topics that were closely related to matters pending before the court has the potential of undermining the impartiality and integrity of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe law requires not only an impartial judge but also one who appears to the parties and the public to be impartial.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Corrigan, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2005-Ohio-7153, 850 N.E.2d 720, \u00b6 11. Therefore, to allay any concerns on that issue, it is ordered that Judge Sheward participate no further in these proceedings. The case is returned to the common pleas court for reassignment to another judge of that court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
