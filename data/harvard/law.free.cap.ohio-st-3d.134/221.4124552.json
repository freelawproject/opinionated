It further charges the board with the responsibility to draw the district boundaries, <em>id., </em>and vests the Ohio Supreme Court with \u201cexclusive, original jurisdiction in all cases arising under this Article,\u201d <em>id. </em>at Section 13. Apportionment is \u201cprimarily a political and legislative process,\u201d <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, </em>412 U.S. 735, 749, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973), and as a result, both courts and scholars have universally agreed that politics cannot be divorced from the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">{\u00b6 2} The issue we confront in this original action challenging the decennial apportionment of districts in the General Assembly is whether the plan adopted by the apportionment board complies with the Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Sections 7 and 11. Because relators failed to rebut the presumed constitutionality accorded the 2011 apportionment plan by establishing that the plan is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, we deny their request for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 3} The 2011 Ohio Apportionment Board consisted of respondents, Governor John Kasich, Auditor David Yost, Secretary of State Jon Husted, and Senate President Thomas Niehuas, who are members of the Republican Party, and House Minority Leader Armond Budish, a member of the Democratic Party. The board has the constitutional authority to apportion the districts for members of the General Assembly. Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 4} The board\u2019s joint secretaries prepared an apportionment plan and submitted it to the board. On September 28, 2011, the board voted four to one to approve an amended version of that plan, with the four Republican members of the board voting in favor and the lone Democratic member voting in opposition. On September 30, 2011, the board adopted another amendment to the secretaries\u2019 plan and approved the final plan with a four-to-zero vote, with respondents all voting in favor of the plan and the sole Democratic board member unable to attend the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 5} On January 4, 2012, relators, 36 electors living in various house districts as reapportioned by the Ohio Apportionment Board, filed this action under Article XI against respondents, four members of the apportionment board, but did not designate Armond Budish, the House Minority Leader, as a party. They primarily sought a declaration that the decennial apportionment plan adopted by respondents is invalid under Article XI and the Open Meetings Act and a prohibitory injunction preventing respondents from conducting elections using the state legislative districts set forth in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 6} Following the submission of responses, evidence, and briefs pursuant to a court-ordered accelerated schedule, on February 17, 2012, we dismissed relators\u2019 open-meetings claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and denied relators\u2019 Article XI claims based on laches insofar as they attempted to challenge the use of the apportionment plan for the 2012 election cycle. <em>Wilson v. Kasich, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 249, 2012-Ohio-612, 963 N.E.2d 1282, \u00b6 8 (O\u2019Donnell, J., dissenting in part) (urging that the court has an obligation to review apportionment matters expeditiously and asserting that a piecemeal resolution permitting electors to vote when the underlying apportionment is under constitutional attack is ill-advised precedent). Relators\u2019 remaining Article XI claims are still pending. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 7} On March 2, 2012, we ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the following questions and invited them to address any other issues they deemed necessary:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>1. Does the Supreme Court of Ohio have jurisdiction over this case when only four of the five members of the apportionment board have been named as respondents and the board has not been named as a party?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">2. Does the Ohio Constitution mandate political neutrality in the reapportionment of house and senate districts?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">3. What is relators\u2019 burden in showing that a reapportionment plan is unconstitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">4. Does tension exist among sections 3, 7, and 10 of Article XI of the Ohio Constitution, and if so, how are these sections to be harmonized?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The parties are further permitted to address any other issues they deem necessary to this court\u2019s review in the supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">131 Ohio St.3d 1468, 2012-Ohio-848, 962 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 8} After the parties filed their supplemental briefs, we denied relators\u2019 motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add Budish as a relator, 131 Ohio St.3d 1519, 2012-Ohio-1783, 965 N.E.2d 1002, and held oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before the court for its consideration of relators\u2019 remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">{\u00b6 10} As the parties now agree, neither the apportionment board nor board member Budish is a necessary and indispensable party to this action under Civ.R. 19. We do note, however, that it remains better practice in this type of action to name the board and all its members as parties. The Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 13 specifies that this court \u201cshall have exclusive, original jurisdiction in all cases arising under this Article\u201d and further notes that if any apportionment plan \u201cmade by the persons responsible for apportionment, by a majority of their number\u201d is determined to be invalid by either this court or the United States Supreme Court, \u201cthe persons responsible for apportionment by a majority of their number\u201d shall determine a new, constitutionally compliant plan; <em>see also Voinovich v. Ferguson, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 198, 586 N.E.2d 1020 (1992) (court resolved declaratory-judgment action involving the constitutionality of an apportionment plan in which the apportionment board was not one of the named parties), and <em>State ex rel. Lehman v. DiSalle, </em>173 Ohio St. 361, 182 N.E.2d 564 (1962) (court resolved mandamus action challenging state-senate apportionment plan although board was not named a party).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">{\u00b6 11} Thus, the merits of relators\u2019 remaining claims are properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\n<em>Political Neutrality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">{\u00b6 12} Pursuant to the Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 1, the five-member apportionment board is responsible for the apportionment of the state for members of the General Assembly. The board must establish the boundaries for each of the 99 house districts and 33 senate districts every ten years. The method of apportionment of the state for members of the General Assembly is determined by using a ratio of representation, which is calculated by dividing the whole population of the state, as determined by the federal decennial census, by 99 for the house and by 33 for the senate. Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 2. The population of each house and senate district must be substantially equal to the applicable ratio of representation, and in no event shall any district contain a population of less than 95 percent or more than 105 percent of the pertinent ratio. Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Sections 3 and 4. Each house district is entitled to a single representative, and each senate district is entitled to a single senator. Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 13} In assessing relators\u2019 Article XI claims, we must initially determine whether these provisions mandate political neutrality in the reapportionment process. \u201c \u2018Generally speaking, in construing the Constitution, we apply the same rules of construction that we apply in construing statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 309, 2005-Ohio-5125, 835 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 57, quoting <em>State v. Jackson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 380, 2004-Ohio-3206, 811 N.E.2d 68, \u00b6 14. The court\u2019s paramount concern in statutory construction is the legislative intent in the statute\u2019s enactment, and to discern this intent, we read words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage. <em>State ex rel. Mager v. State Teachers Retirement Sys. of Ohio, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 195, 2009-Ohio-4908, 915 N.E.2d 320, \u00b6 14. Consequently, our priniary concern in construing Article XI is to determine the intent of the electorate in adopting the article, and to discern that intent, we must examine its text.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 14} The words used in Article XI do not explicitly require political neutrality, or for that matter, politically competitive districts or representational fairness, in the apportionment board\u2019s creation of state legislative districts. Unlike Ohio, some states specify in either constitutional or statutory language that no apportionment plan shall be drawn with the intent of favoring or disfavoring a political party. <em>See In re Senate Joint Resolution of Legislative Apportionment 1176, </em>83 So.3d 597, 615 (Fla.2012) fn. 19, and the state constitutions and statutes cited therein. Therefore, Article XI does not prevent the board from considering partisan factors in its apportionment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 15} Nevertheless, as relators emphasize in their supplemental brief, and as respondents acknowledge in their supplemental response brief, political considerations cannot override the requirements of Article XI. Other states have reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>this same conclusion regarding redistricting in their states. <em>See Holt v. 2011 Legislative Reapportionment Comm., </em>38 A.3d 711, 745 (Pa.2012) (\u201cIt is true, of course, that redistricting has an inevitably legislative, and therefore an inevitably political, element; but, the constitutional commands and restrictions on the process exist precisely as a brake on the most overt of potential excesses and abuse\u201d); <em>In re Reapportionment of the Colorado Gen. Assembly, </em>\u2014 P.3d-, -, 2011 WL 5830123, *3 (Colo.2011) (\u201cOther nonconstitutional considerations, such as the competitiveness of a district, are not per se illegal or improper; however, such factors may be considered only after all constitutional criteria have been met\u201d); <em>In re Legislative Districting of the State, </em>370 Md. 312, 370, 805 A.2d 292 (2002) (\u201cThe constitution \u2018trumps\u2019 political considerations. Politics or non-constitutional considerations never \u2018trump\u2019 constitutional requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 16} Therefore, the Ohio Constitution does not mandate political neutrality in the reapportionment of house and senate districts, but partisan considerations cannot prevail over the requirements set forth in Article XI. As long as the 2011 apportionment plan satisfied the constitutional requirements set forth in Article XI, respondents were not precluded from considering political factors in drafting it. <em>See Davis v. Bandemer, </em>478 U.S. 109, 128, 106 S.Ct. 2797, 92 L.Ed.2d 85 (1986) (plurality opinion), quoting <em>Gaffney v. Cummings, </em>412 U.S. 735, 752-753, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973) (\u201c \u2018Politics and political considerations are inseparable from districting and apportionment\u2019 \u201d). And, here, political factors were considered only after the applicable constitutional and other legal requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\n<em>Presumption of Constitutionality and Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AU-\">{\u00b6 17} In assessing the merits of relators\u2019 claims, we defer to the apportionment board\u2019s reasonable construction of the principles expressed in Article XI. <em>Voinovich v. Ferguson, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 198, 586 N.E.2d 1020 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cHence, it is not sufficient in this proceeding that we might be of the opinion that we could make a better apportionment than has been made by the board: To authorize this court to interfere and command the board to make another apportionment, the apportionment made must so far violate the rules prescribed by the constitution, as to enable us to say, that what has been done is no apportionment at all, and should be wholly disregarded. If by any fair construction of the principles prescribed by the constitution for making an apportionment, the one made may be sustained, then it cannot be disregarded and a new one ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201c * =1= * The very \u00a3ac|. thg governor, auditor and secretary of state are consociated as a board to apportion the state for members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>general assembly, shows of itself, that, in the judgment of the framers of the constitution, in applying the rules prescribed, a discretion would have to be exercised, and those officers were selected to exercise it. Whether the discretion conferred on the board, has been wisely or unwisely exercised in this instance, is immaterial in this proceeding. It is sufficient that they had the power under the constitution to make the apportionment as they have made it. For the wisdom, or unwisdom, of what they have done, within the limits of the powers conferred, they are answerable to the electors of the state, and no one else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 204 (Holmes, J., concurring), quoting <em>State ex rel. Gallagher v. Campbell, </em>48 Ohio St. 435, 436-437 and 442, 27 N.E. 884 (1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 18} In resolving claims contesting the constitutionality of a statute, we presume the constitutionality of the legislation, and the party challenging the validity of the statute bears the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>See State ex rel. Zeigler v. Zumbar, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 240, 2011-Ohio-2939, 951 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 24; <em>Ohio Grocers Assn. v. Levin, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 303, 2009-Ohio-4872, 916 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 19} Although a board\u2019s apportionment plan is not a statute, the same general principle applies in resolving relators\u2019 attack on the constitutionality of the apportionment plan as that which is applied to attacks on the constitutionality of statutes for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 20} First, Article XI was enacted to permit the apportionment board to perform the duty previously conferred on the General Assembly to apportion seats in the General Assembly. In effect, the apportionment board is performing what was previously a legislative function. <em>See Ely v. Klahr, </em>403 U.S. 108, 114, 91 S.Ct. 1803, 29 L.Ed.2d 352 (1971) (\u201cdistricting and apportionment are legislative tasks in the first instance\u201d); <em>Arizona Minority Coalition for Fair Redistricting v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm., </em>220 Ariz. 587, 208 P.3d 676 (2009) \u00b6 19 (\u201cNot only do enactments that carry the force of law traditionally originate in the legislature, but the process of redistricting is itself traditionally viewed as a legislative task\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 21} Second, as with legislation, a presumption of validity attaches to the apportionment board\u2019s adopted apportionment plan. <em>See Gallagher, </em>48 Ohio St. at 437, 27 N.E. 884 (apportionment board is vested with discretion to adopt decennial apportionment plan, and \u201c[i]f by any fair construction of the principles prescribed by the constitution for making an apportionment, the one made may be sustained, then it cannot be disregarded and a new one ordered\u201d). \u201c \u2018[I]n the absence of evidence to the contrary, public officers, administrative officers and public authorities, within the limits of the jurisdiction conferred upon them by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>law, will be presumed to have properly performed their duties in a regular and lawful manner and not to have acted illegally or unlawfully.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Skaggs v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 506, 2008-Ohio-6333, 900 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 51, quoting <em>State ex rel. Speeth v. Carney, </em>163 Ohio St. 159, 186, 126 N.E.2d 449 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">{\u00b6 22} Third, because the people of Ohio placed apportionment authority in the hands of the board, the apportionment plan should be accorded the same, if not greater, consideration as a statute enacted by the General Assembly. It is logical, therefore, to require relators to rebut the plan\u2019s presumed constitutionality by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the apportionment plan is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, this standard comports with the standard applied by other state supreme courts in resolving constitutional challenges to a reapportionment plan. <em>See Parella v. Montalbano, </em>899 A.2d 1226, 1232-1233 (R.I.2006) (challengers to state legislative redistricting statute had the burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Logan v. O\u2019Neill, </em>187 Conn. 721, 729-730, 448 A.2d 1306 (1982) (applying the same burden of proof to a reapportionment plan even though it was not a statute \u2014 \u201cAlthough, here, the legislative action being challenged is not a statute because it is not subject to the approval of the governor, it is entitled to at least the same judicial respect as a statute\u201d); <em>McClure v. Secy, of the Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 614, 622, 766 N.E.2d 847 (2002) (plaintiffs challenging constitutionality of legislative redistricting plan could not prevail in the case unless they established beyond a reasonable doubt that it is impossible by any reasonable construction to interpret the redistricting statute in harmony with the state constitution); <em>In re Wolpoff </em>80 N.Y.2d 70, 78, 587 N.Y.S.2d 560, 600 N.E.2d 191 (1992) (\u201cA strong presumption of constitutionality attaches to the redistricting plan and we will upset the balance struck by the Legislature and declare the plan unconstitutional\u201d only when it is shown to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 24} Consequently, the burden of proof on one challenging the constitutionality of an apportionment plan is to establish that the plan is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that the apportionment board properly performed its duties in a lawful manner. With this burden of proof providing the framework for our analysis, we next address relators\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Sections 3, 7, and 10</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 25} Relators assert that the board\u2019s apportionment plan violates the Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Sections 7 and 11. To assist this court in resolving this claim, the parties provided supplemental briefs on whether tension exists among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Sections 3, 7, and 10 of Article XI, and if so, how these sections could be harmonized.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">{\u00b6 26} As noted previously, we apply the same rules of construction that we apply in construing statutes to interpret the meaning of constitutional provisions. <em>State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 43. We must first review the words and phrases used. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 27} The Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 3, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">The population of each house of representatives district shall be substantially equal to the ratio of representation in the house of representatives, as provided in section 2 of this Article, and in no event shall any house of representatives district contain a population of less than ninety-five per cent nor more than one hundred five per cent of the ratio of representation in the house of representatives, except in those instances where reasonable effort is made to avoid dividing a county in accordance with section 9 of this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">{\u00b6 28} The Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 7, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">(A) Every house of representatives district shall be compact and composed of contiguous territory, and the boundary of each district shall be a single nonintersecting continuous line. To the extent consistent with the requirements of section 3 of this Article, the boundary lines of districts shall be so drawn as to delineate an area containing one or more whole counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">(B) Where the requirements of section 3 of this Article cannot feasibly be attained by forming a district from a whole county or counties, such district shall be formed by combining the areas of governmental units giving preference in the order named to counties, townships, municipalities, and city wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">(C) Where the requirements of section 3 of this Article cannot feasibly be attained by combining the areas of governmental units as prescribed in division (B) of this section, only one such unit may be divided between two districts, giving preference in the selection of a unit for division to a township, a city ward, a city, and a village in the order named.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">(D) In making a new apportionment, district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment shall be adopted to the extent reasonably consistent with the requirements of section 3 of this Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 10, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The standards prescribed in sections 3, 7, 8, and 9 of this Article shall govern the establishment of house of representatives districts, which shall be created and numbered in the following order to the extent that such order is consistent with the foregoing standards:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">(A) Each county containing population substantially equal to one ratio of representation in the house of representatives, as provided in section 2 of this Article, but in no event less than ninety-five per cent of the ratio nor more than one hundred five per cent of the ratio shall be designated a representative district.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">(B) Each county containing population between ninety and ninety-five per cent of the ratio or between one hundred five and one hundred ten per cent of the ratio may be designated a representative district.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">(C) Proceeding in succession from the largest to the smallest, each remaining county containing more than one whole ratio of representation shall be divided into house of representatives districts. Any remaining territory within such county containing a fraction of one whole ratio of representation shall be included in one representative district by combining it with adjoining territory outside the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">(D) The remaining territory of the state shall be combined into representative districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">{\u00b6 30} In resolving the tension between these constitutional provisions, we note that Article XI of the Ohio Constitution vests the apportionment board with considerable discretion in formulating an appropriate plan. <em>See </em>Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 3 (requiring the population of each house district to be <em>\u201csubstantially </em>equal to the ratio of representation\u201d [emphasis added]); Article XI, Section 7(A) (requiring house district boundary lines to be drawn so as to delineate an area that contains one or more whole counties \u201c[t]o the <em>extent consistent </em>with the requirements of section 3\u201d [emphasis added]); Article XI, Section 7(B) (requiring that house districts be formed by combining the areas of governmental units in the order specified where Section 3 population requirements \u201ccannot <em>feasibly </em>be attained\u201d by forming a district from a whole county or counties [emphasis added]); Article XI, Section 7(C) (requiring the division of only one governmental unit in the order specified when the Section 3 population requirements \u201ccannot <em>feasibly </em>be attained\u201d by combining the areas of governmental units in accordance with Section 7(B) [emphasis added]); Article XI, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>7(D) (requiring the adoption of district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment \u201cto the <em>extent reasonably consistent </em>\u201d with the Section 3 population requirements [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">{\u00b6 31} This court does not sit as a super apportionment board to determine whether a plan presented by the relators is better than the plan adopted by the board. Instead, we determine whether the board acted within the broad discretion conferred upon it by the provisions of Article XI when it adopted its plan. As respondents observe, whether relators have presented a \u201cbetter\u201d apportionment plan is irrelevant in determining whether relators have met their burden to establish that the board\u2019s September 30, 2011 apportionment plan is unconstitutional. The role of a supreme court in considering constitutional challenges to an apportionment plan is restricted to determining whether relators have met their burden to prove that the plan adopted by the board is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State ex rel. Cooper v. Tennant, </em>229 W.Va. 585, 730 S.E.2d 368 (2012), paragraph twelve of the syllabus (\u201cThe only role of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in determining whether a state legislative redistricting plan is constitutional is to assess the validity of the particular plan adopted by the Legislature under both federal and state constitutional principles, rather than to ascertain whether a better plan could have been designed and adopted\u201d); <em>Wilson v. State ex rel. State Election Bd., </em>270 P.3d 155, \u00b6 1 (Okla. 2012) (litigant\u2019s mere statement that his redistricting plan is better than the plan passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor was insufficient to support claim that the plan was invalid); <em>Arizona Minority Coalition, </em>220 Ariz. 587, 208 P.3d 676, at \u00b6 46 (\u201cthe fact that a \u2018better\u2019 [redistricting] plan exists does not establish that this plan lacks a reasonable basis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">{\u00b6 32} In fulfilling our limited role, we read together the constitutional provisions that are in pari materia, and we attempt to give full application to every part of each of them unless they are irreconcilable and in hopeless conflict. <em>See Smith v. Leis, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 309, 2005-Ohio-5125, 835 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 57. If there is an irreconcilable conflict, the special provision prevails over the general provision, unless the general provision was adopted later and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail. <em>Summerville v. Forest Park, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 221, 2010-Ohio-6280, 943 N.E.2d 522, \u00b6 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">{\u00b6 33} But if the sections are coequal \u2014 that is, if neither is more specific and both were adopted at the same time \u2014 then the apportionment board is empowered to apply either one of them. <em>Voinovich, 63 </em>Ohio St.3d at 200, 586 N.E.2d 1020. Consequently, when coequal provisions of Article XI of the Ohio Constitution are irreconcilable, the apportionment board has the duty to choose the proper course, and this court will not order it to correct one constitutional violation by committing another. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 34} One of the main considerations of the joint secretaries in formulating their proposed plan was preserving the boundaries of existing legislative districts, which is consistent with the requirement of Section 7(D). Moreover, apportionment boards have historically treated the division of noncontiguous local governmental units as not constituting a violation of Sections 7(A), (B), or (C). In 1981, the apportionment board did not count 16 divisions of noncontiguous governmental units as divisions for purposes of Article XI; in 1991, the apportionment board did not count 25 such divisions; and in 2001, the apportionment board did not count 34 of these divisions. The board considered the division of noncontiguous governmental units as having been accomplished by local officials through annexation rather than by the board through apportionment. This practice of not counting divisions of noncontiguous governmental units has been followed by apportionment boards that have had both Democratic and Republican majorities. Additionally, comparison between the 2011 and 2001 apportionment plans indicates that the number of divisions of counties in both plans is comparable (74 for the 2011 apportionment plan and 73 for the 2001 apportionment plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">{\u00b6 35} In fact, by retaining district boundaries similar to those in the previous apportionment plan \u2014 -and thereby enhancing representational continuity for district residents \u2014 the board\u2019s plan is more compliant with Section 7(D) than the alternative plan that was timely submitted to the apportionment board by the Joint Democratic Caucuses or, for that matter, the alternative plans submitted by relators\u2019 expert, Professor Michael McDonald.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">{\u00b6 36} Relators argue that the board erred in relying on Section 7(D) to justify violations of Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) because Section 7(D) is subordinate to the other subsections. They claim that because Section 7(D) is the last subsection, it is also last in priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">{\u00b6 37} A review of the plain text of Section 7, however, dispels that contention. Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) are interconnected so that if the Section 3 population requirements cannot feasibly be attained by drawing the line according to Section 7(A), then Section 7(B) is followed, and if they cannot feasibly be attained by following Section 7(B), then Section 7(C) is followed. Section 7(D), however, is not phrased in a manner that subordinates it to Sections 7(A), (B), and (C). Instead, Section 7(D) is phrased to apply broadly to the board\u2019s \u201cnew apportionment\u201d and, like Sections 7(A), (B), and (C), is governed by the population requirements of Section 3. There is no language suggesting that Section 7(D) may be followed only if Sections (A), (B), and (C) are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, the Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 7(D) is coequal with Article XI, Sections 7(A), (B), and (C), and in accordance with <em>Voinovich, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 200, 586 N.E.2d 1020, the court will not order the apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>board to correct a violation of Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) by violating Section 7(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">{\u00b6 39} Relators next assert that even if Section 7(D) is coequal with Sections 7(A), (B), and (C), that fact does not justify respondents\u2019 alteration of previous district boundaries from the 2001 apportionment plan. That is, relators contend that pursuant to Section 7(D), \u201cif a prior district\u2019s population is \u2018reasonably consistent with the requirements of Section 3,\u2019 then the \u2018district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment shall be adopted.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">{\u00b6 40} But once again, relators ignore the plain text of Section 7(D), which provides, \u201cIn making a new apportionment, district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment shall be adopted <em>to the extent reasonably consistent </em>with the requirements of section 3 of this Article.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In essence, relators\u2019 interpretation replaces the phrase, \u201cto the extent\u201d \u2014 a phrase that vests the apportionment board with discretion \u2014 with the conditional term \u201cif.\u201d But this interpretation changes the meaning of Section 7(D), which we cannot do. <em>See State ex rel. Russo v. McDonnell, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 144, 2006-Ohio-3459, 852 N.E.2d 145, \u00b6 50 (in construing statutes, court cannot add or delete language); <em>State ex rel. LetOhioVote.org v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 322, 2009-Ohio-4900, 916 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 49 (courts are not authorized to add exceptions that are not contained within the express language of constitutional provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">{\u00b6 41} Therefore, the Ohio Constitution vests discretion in the apportionment board to adopt the prior district\u2019s boundaries \u201cto the extent reasonably consistent\u201d with the Section 3 population requirements, and this discretionary language confers the authority on the apportionment board to adopt district boundaries that are not identical to those used in the prior apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">{\u00b6 42} Relators\u2019 claims focus on the board\u2019s divisions of governmental units. Because those divisions were warranted by both the bipartisan historical practice of prior apportionment boards and the Section 7(D) requirement of keeping boundaries similar to those used in the prior apportionment, we will not order respondents to correct the alleged violations of Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) by committing a violation of Section 7(D). Similarly, given the discretion accorded respondents under Section 7(D) and the related provisions, relators have not established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that respondents\u2019 purported failure to use the exact same boundary lines as the 2001 apportionment plan for a few districts constituted a violation of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">\n<em>Relators\u2019 Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">{\u00b6 43} Relators primarily rely on the two alternative apportionment plans of their expert, Professor McDonald, to meet their heavy burden of proof in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>special proceeding. For the following reasons, however, these alternative plans are insufficient to carry that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">{\u00b6 44} First, they appear to be based on the same flawed interpretation of Section 7(D) advocated by relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">{\u00b6 45} Second, as previously discussed, whether a litigant has presented a \u201cbetter\u201d apportionment plan is irrelevant to the court\u2019s determination of whether the plan adopted by the apportionment board is constitutional. <em>See Cooper, </em>730 S.E.2d 368, at paragraph twelve of the syllabus; <em>Arizona Minority Coalition, </em>220 Ariz. 587, 208 P.3d 676, at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">{\u00b6 46} Third, Professor McDonald\u2019s affidavits are replete with conclusory statements that lack specific factual support. For example, he states that the apportionment board\u2019s plan \u201csplit over 250 political subdivisions,\u201d while each of his alternative plans \u201cdivides less than 100 subdivisions,\u201d but he offers no deta\u00f1ed explanation of what he counted as a split or division, and he does not enumerate each of the subdivisions split by the various plans. In the absence of more detailed factual support, we are left to wonder about the analytical choices made by relators\u2019 expert and the concomitant viability of his conclusions. And insofar as relators argue that Professor McDonald\u2019s plans contain many fewer divisions of governmental units than are contained in the board\u2019s plan and do not violate any other constitutional provisions, his affidavits simply contain insufficient evidence to establish the truth of their assertion. Indeed, from his affidavits, it is unclear whether Professor McDonald even considered all the applicable criteria, unlike respondents, who established that they had considered all the applicable criteria in formulating and adopting their plan. Notably, in an unrelated case, a federal district court recently held that Professor McDonald\u2019s expert opinion was unreliable because, among other reasons, he failed to consider all the applicable principles that guide redistricting. <em>Backus v. South Carolina, </em>857 F.Supp.2d 553, 562 (D.S.C.2012). His conclusory opinion here appears to be similarly defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">{\u00b6 47} Finally, relator claims that courts have regularly relied on a litigant\u2019s alternative plans in assessing the validity of an apportionment plan, citing <em>Holt, </em>38 A.3d 711, <em>Twin Falls Cty. v. Idaho Comm, on Redistricting, </em>152 Idaho 346, 271 P.3d 1202 (2012), and <em>In re Reapportionment of the Colorado Gen. Assembly, </em>\u2014 P.3d-, 2011 WL 5830123. But in each of these cases, the alternative plans reviewed by the courts were timely submitted to the state\u2019s apportionment body for its review in the process of adopting a plan. <em>Holt </em>at 753-754 and fn. 32; <em>Twin Falls </em>at 1206-1207; <em>Reapportionment of the Colorado Gen. Assembly </em>at *3-4. By contrast, both of Professor McDonald\u2019s alternate apportionment plans were not timely submitted to the apportionment board, but were instead submitted as evidence in a case filed more than three months after the board approved its 2011 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">{\u00b6 48} The role of this court in adjudicating challenges to apportionment is limited: we consider the plan against the requirements of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, as interpreted by federal and state decisional law. In making our determination, we accord the apportionment board the deference it is afforded by the constitution in attempting to take into account various federal and state requirements by placing the burden on one challenging an apportionment plan to establish its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. Relators have failed to adduce sufficient, credible proof to carry this heavy burden. Therefore, relators are not entitled to a declaration that the 2011 apportionment plan is unconstitutional or a prohibitory injunction to prevent elections from being conducted in accordance with that plan, and we accordingly deny the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Relief denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-6\">Willamowski, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b337-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer and McGee Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b337-8\">John R.

Ohio voters Charles Wilson and others have put the question of constitutionality in play by bringing this action. Article XI, Section 13 of the Ohio Constitution places on this court the duty to answer that question without deference to either party. There is no basis in the Ohio Constitution, in fairness, in justice, or in political reality for this court to cloak the apportionment board\u2019s actions with a presumption of constitutionality that can be overcome only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In doing so, the majority opinion is just plain wrong. It relegates this court to the status of a pawn in a high-stakes political chess match.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">{\u00b6 50} The drafters of Article XI fully understood that they were placing the difficult duty of map drawing in the hands of the state\u2019s top partisan office holders, knowing that they would draw the districts to their partisan advantage, limited only by federal law and the Ohio Constitution. Likewise, they understood that when the board\u2019s work was done, questions of constitutional compliance could arise and, if they did, they should be answered directly by this court. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>process for the board to correct any constitutional violations found by this court or the United States Supreme Court is also detailed in Article XI, Section 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">{\u00b6 51} As we review the adopted maps, the evidence of the process that resulted in the maps, and alternative map choices, it must be with an effort to be strictly neutral in assessing the finished product of the adopted apportionment plan while keeping in mind a fair and normal reading of the constraints found in Article XI of our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">{\u00b6 52} Article XI of the Ohio Constitution is well organized and comprehensive in setting out the rules and process for apportionment. The makeup of the apportionment board is set out in Section 1. Determination of the population parameters for each legislative district is to be achieved by following a precise succession of chronological steps found in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5. Section 6 establishes that the apportionment plan is to be revised after the completion of each federal decennial census.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">{\u00b6 53} Section 7 controls the process to be followed by the apportionment board in mapping the boundary lines of House of Representative districts. The steps are defined in four paragraphs that make sense when read in normal progression, top to bottom. Sections 8 and 9 address issues not being contested in this litigation. Section 10 provides instruction for numbering House of Representative districts when the mapping process is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">{\u00b6 54} The question before us is this: Does the apportionment plan adopted by the board comply with the mandates of the Ohio Constitution? Our determination should not be influenced by evidence that persons who were tasked with drawing the boundaries sent self-promoting e-mails proclaiming success in drawing legislative boundaries that favor the political party controlling the board. That such an effort was undertaken should be presumed and is no more shocking than gambling in Rick\u2019s Cafe. Nor is it our function to choose an alternative apportionment plan. Alternative plans are useful, however, in assessing whether the adopted plan was designed to achieve compactness and minimization of splits of governmental units, as required by Article XI, Section 7 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">{\u00b6 55} Having reviewed the adopted plan and compared it with the submitted evidence, I reluctantly conclude that the constitutional challenge has merit. The board should be directed to reconvene pursuant to Section 13 for the purpose of adopting a revised plan that more nearly optimizes the mandates of Section 7 with respect to compactness and minimization of splits of governmental units. In her dissent, Justice McGee Brown has well documented many of the splits that should have been avoided. In total, 39 counties (out of 88) have been split 74 times. The lack of compactness of the current map is self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>{\u00b6 56} The majority, having reviewed the same evidence, concludes that the plan is constitutional. I agree with the majority opinion\u2019s implicit rejection of the board\u2019s principal argument supporting constitutionality: that Section 10, which relates to numbering of districts, somehow can be used to guide mapping. In order to justify its finding of constitutionality, the majority opinion expresses two conclusions of questionable legitimacy; these anchors of the majority opinion fail the tests of logic and fairness. First the majority opinion erects a nearly insurmountable barrier to a successful constitutional challenge by assigning to the board\u2019s actions a blanket presumption of constitutionality and requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt to establish that the plan fails to meet all constitutional requirements. Majority opinion, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 57} The two cites given by the majority opinion as authority for that standard stand for the proposition that public officials are presumed to have acted lawfully, not that the constitutionality of their work product can be overcome only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State ex rel. Skaggs v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 506, 2008-Ohio-6333, 900 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 51, and <em>State ex rel. Speeth v. Carney, </em>163 Ohio St. 159, 186, 126 N.E.2d 449 (1955). Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is typically necessary only in criminal cases. Such a high burden of proof in the current constitutional matter turns this court into a rubber stamp, not the guardian of the constitution that it is designed to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">{\u00b6 58} Next, the majority adopts the board\u2019s secondary argument, concluding that Section 7(D) can subsume and override the express directives of Sections 7(A), 7(B), and 7(C) regarding the compactness of districts and the requirement to minimize splits. Section 7(D), properly interpreted, directs the board to follow the district lines of the prior apportionment where possible. But unless Section 7(D) is subservient to the paragraphs above it, a board could justify the adoption of an incumbent-protecting apportionment plan and forgo any effort to achieve compactness and minimize splits of governmental units. The majority\u2019s interpretation is illogical. Its reading of Section 7 undermines the long-accepted constitutional foundation of Ohio\u2019s apportionment process: legislative districts should be compact and respectful of the boundaries of governmental units.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 59} The majority opinion\u2019s conclusion could lead to an absurd result. Based on the majority opinion, provisions of a prior plan that are patently unconstitutional would be protected, possibly forever, by the dominion granted to Section 7(D) over the critically important Sections 7(A), 7(B), and 7(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 60} Remapping by the apportionment board would certainly bring no pleasure to the members of the General Assembly in either political party. All incoming House members and half of the incoming Senate members recently won elections in the newly drawn districts. Because of this plan\u2019s serial violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the Section 7 constitutional mandate for compactness of legislative districts and minimization of governmental-unit splits, however, remapping is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">{\u00b6 61} I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b340-6\">McGee Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cThe achieving of fair and effective representation for all citizens is * * * the basic aim of legislative apportionment.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 565-566, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964). In 1967, the people of this state amended Article XI of the Ohio Constitution to provide exacting detail on how legislative districts are to be drawn. Article XI outlines at length the priority to be given to keeping counties and local-government units whole and keeping existing district lines. However, today the majority upholds a redistricting scheme that Article XI was specifically designed to prevent. By elevating Section 10 (prescribing procedure for creating house districts) over the clear mandates of Sections 3 (population mandates) and 7 (retaining whole counties and governmental units), the majority permits respondents to elevate political considerations over Article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 63} In a Maryland case involving a redistricting plan, the highest court in that state noted that \u201c[bjecause it involves redrawing the lines of legislative districts, the process of reapportionment is an intensely political process. But it is also a legal one, for there are constitutional standards that govern both the process and the redistricting plan that results from it.\u201d <em>In re Legislative Redistricting of the State, </em>370 Md. 312, 320, 805 A.2d 292 (2002). The statement applies equally to Ohio\u2019s reapportionment process. Although political considerations may affect the determination, they cannot control it in contravention of the specific standards set forth by the people of the state in Article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\n<em>The Recurring Apportionment Problem</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 64} Relators claim that the apportionment plan adopted by respondents violates Article XI, Sections 7 and 11. These sections were adopted in 1967, and since their adoption, this court and federal courts have regularly addressed challenges concerning the apportionment plans adopted by the Ohio Apportionment Board following the decennial federal census. <em>See, e.g., Parker v. State, </em>263 F.Supp.2d 1100 (S.D.Ohio 2003) (2001 apportionment plan); <em>Voinovich v. Ferguson, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 198, 586 N.E.2d 1020 (1992) (1991 apportionment plan); <em>Quitter v.

At the September 26, 2011 apportionment-board hearing, Auditor Dave Yost submitted for the record a portion of <em>A Columnist\u2019s View of Capitol Square, </em>written by Lee Leonard, which observes that in 1971, when Democrats controlled the apportionment board, they created legislative districts that resulted in their party\u2019s gaining control of both houses of the General Assembly, and that in 1991, when Republicans controlled the board, they created legislative districts that eventually resulted in their controlling both houses of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">{\u00b6 66} Consequently, neither party stands before this court with clean hands or intellectual purity. Each party has used the apportionment process for political gain with almost utter disregard for the dictates of Article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>General Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 67} Before turning to those matters upon which I disagree with the majority, I first note those matters with which I agree. I agree that we have jurisdiction over the merits of this case even though neither the apportionment board nor all of the board members are named as respondents. Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 13. I also agree with the general propositions specified in the syllabus concerning political neutrality; the initial burden of proof; the principle that when coequal Article XI provisions are irreconcilable, we will not order the apportionment board and its members to correct one constitutional violation by committing another; and the holding that Article XI, Section 7(D) is coequal with Article XI, Sections 7(A), (B), and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 68} However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s implicit determination that the subordinate procedure set forth in Section 10 takes priority over Sections 7(A) through (D). In other words, I disagree that Section 10\u2019s procedure for creating house districts takes priority over Section 7\u2019s requirements for keeping whole counties'and governmental units together.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 69} The 1967 amendment set forth a specific process for apportionment that would protect the integrity of governmental units by minimizing their division. By allowing respondents to elevate Section 10 over Section 7, the majority ensures that the apportionment process will become more political with each decennial plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\n<em>Political Neutrality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">{\u00b6 70} Although the text of Article XI does not specifically prohibit the use of political considerations in apportioning state legislative districts, the historical context of the constitutional apportionment provisions indicates that they were adopted to limit the importance of politics. As this court previously explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Prior to the Constitution of 1851, the apportionments of legislative districts had been made by the General Assembly with the result that oftentimes political advantage was sought to be gained by the party in power.

By creating a board of <em>ex officio </em>members and adopting self-acting provisions it was sought to place the function of apportionment in impartial hands and at the same time mark the way so that in the main at least the provisions of the Constitution would work automatically and the apportioning process ordinarily would be a mere matter of calculation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\"><em>State ex rel.

Sims, </em>377 U.S. at 568, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, and <em>Nolan v. Rhodes, </em>378 U.S. 556, 84 S.Ct. 1906, 12 L.Ed.2d 1034 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">{\u00b6 72} It is true that the 1967 amendment to Article XI eliminated many of the automatic and self-acting provisions that characterized the version contained in the 1851 Constitution and its 1903 amendment so that General Assembly districts could be apportioned on a substantially equal-population basis. But by no means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>did the new provisions harken a return to the old days of political gerrymandering that the Article was originally adopted to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">{\u00b6 73} Instead, the 1967 amendment set forth mandatory, nonpartisan criteria to be used by the apportionment board in reapportioning state legislative districts. <em>See, e.g., </em>Article XI, Sections 3 (population of house districts), 4 (population of senate districts), 5 (single member for each district), and 7 (boundary lines for house districts).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">{\u00b6 74} Furthermore, contrary to respondents\u2019 assertion, the 1967 amendment\u2019s inclusion of \u201cpartisanly-elected political officials]\u201d on the apportionment board did not contemplate a \u201cpolitical process by design\u201d any more than did the 1851 version\u2019s inclusion of the governor, auditor, and secretary of state on the apportionment board.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 75} The 1967 amendment simply did not change the objective of Article XI \u2014 to prevent the political gerrymandering engendered by leaving the apportionment process entirely to the political party controlling the General Assembly. And to determine the soundness of the challenged apportionment plan, we \u201clook not only to the letter of the constitutional provisions but to their spirit and purpose.\u201d <em>Herbert, </em>139 Ohio St. at 508, 41 N.E.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 76} In sum, then, while Article XI does not require political neutrality in the apportionment process, partisan considerations cannot prevail over the nonpartisan requirements set forth in Article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\n<em>Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 77} I agree with the majority that the initial burden of proof is on the party challenging the constitutionality of an apportionment plan to establish that the plan is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. And I agree that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that the apportionment board and its members performed their duties in a lawful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">{\u00b6 78} However, as the United States Supreme Court recently observed in a case upholding the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \u201c[o]ur deference in matters of policy cannot * * * become abdication in matters of law.\u201d <em>Natl. Fedn. of Independent Business v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 2579, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012). I would hold that any presumed validity of the apportionment plan is rebutted when relators establish that the plan violates the provisions of Article XI of the Ohio Constitution. Under these circumstances, we must review the applicable constitutional provisions without deference to the apportionment board.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">{\u00b6 79} Respondents claim that after proving that the plan is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, relators must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the apportionment board also acted without a rational basis. This contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>lacks merit. As relators note, if a plan is unconstitutional, it cannot be resuscitated by reliance on a nonconstitutional criterion, e.g., retention of an incumbent or political composition. Acting on such a factor would not be rational. <em>See In re Reapportionment of the Colorado Gen. Assembly, </em>\u2014 P.3d -, 2011 WL 5830123 (Colo.2011) at *3 (\u201cOther nonconstitutional considerations, such as the competitiveness of a district, are not per se illegal or improper; however, such factors may be considered only after all constitutional criteria have been met\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 80} Moreover, one of the cases respondents cite for this proposition is <em>In re Reapportionment of Towns of Hartland, Windsor, &amp; W. Windsor, </em>160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993), but the Vermont Supreme Court noted in that case that \u201conce petitioners have shown that the State has failed to meet constitutional or statutory standards or policies with regard to a specific part of the plan, the State then has the burden to show that satisfying those requirements was impossible because of the impermissible effect it would have had on other districts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Other states have also shifted the burden of proof to the parties responsible for the apportionment plan to justify their departure from certain constitutional provisions once relators established that the plan is unconstitutional in some respect. <em>See In re Legislative Districting of the State, </em>370 Md. at 368, 805 A.2d 292 (when apportionment plan raised sufficient issues with respect to its compliance with state constitutional requirements, court placed burden of proof on the state to justify the plan); <em>In re Reapportionment of Colorado Gen. Assembly, </em>45 P.3d 1237, 1241 (Colo.2002) (court held that if an apportionment plan does not comply with the county-boundary requirement of the Colorado Constitution, the reapportionment commission must make an adequate factual showing that less drastic alternatives could not have satisfied the equal-population constitutional requirement); <em>In re Legislative Districting of Gen. Assembly of Iowa, </em>193 N.W.2d 784, 791 (Iowa 1972) (state failed to sustain burden of proof to show why state legislative reapportionment plan could not comply with state constitution\u2019s compactness requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 81} This approach is logical. The respondents who crafted and approved the apportionment plan are in the best position to know the basis for any noncompliance with Article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 82} Therefore, I would hold that once relators make a prima facie showing beyond a reasonable doubt that respondents have violated a provision of Article XI of the Ohio Constitution, the burden of proof shifts to respondents to justify that violation based on the avoidance of a violation of another superior or coequal legal requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\n<em>Article XI, Sections 3, 7, and 10</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">{\u00b6 83} In our briefing order, we asked whether tension existed among Sections 3, 7, and 10 of Article XI of the Ohio Constitution, and if so, how these sections should be harmonized. 131 Ohio St.3d 1468, 2012-Ohio-848, 962 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>{\u00b6 84} The plain language of the subsections in Section 7 establishes that Section 7 is subordinate to the population requirements of Section 3: Section 7(A) directs the apportionment board to draw the boundary lines of house districts to delineate an area \u201ccontaining one or more whole counties\u201d \u201c[t]o the extent consistent with the requirements of section 3\u201d; Section 7(B) directs the apportionment board to create districts by combining the areas of governmental units in the order specified \u201c[w]here the requirements of section 3 of this Article cannot feasibly be attained by forming a district from a whole county or counties [as prescribed in division (A)]\u201d; Section 7(C) directs the apportionment board to divide only one governmental unit between two house districts in the order specified \u201c[w]here the requirements of section 3 of this Article cannot feasibly be attained by combining the areas of governmental units as prescribed in division (B) of this section\u201d; and finally, Section 7(D) directs the apportionment board to adopt the house-district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment \u201cto the extent reasonably consistent with the requirements of section 3 of this Article.\u201d Consequently, there is no conflict \u2014 inherent or otherwise \u2014 -between the requirements of Sections 3 and 7 because, by its very terms, Section 7 is subordinate to the population requirements of Section 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 85} Similarly, there is no conflict between Section 10 and Sections 3 and 7. The introductory language in Section 10 makes clear that the <em>substantive </em>standards set forth in Sections 3, 7, 8, and 9 govern the creation of house districts and that the <em>procedure </em>specified in Section 10 applies only insofar as it is consistent with those standards: \u201cThe standards prescribed in sections 3, 7, 8, and 9 of this Article shall govern the establishment of house of representatives districts, which shall be created and numbered in the following order <em>to the extent that suck order is consistent with the foregoing standards.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Ohio Constitution, Article XI, Section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 86} Therefore, under the plain language of these sections, if there is a conflict, Section 3 prevails over Sections 7 and 10 and Section 7 prevails over Section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 87} I agree with the majority that Sections 7(A) through (C) are coequal with Section 7(D). Sections 7(A) through (C) require that every house district be compact and contiguous and, to the extent it can do so and still meet the requirements of Section 3, that it contain one or more whole counties; and if the district cannot be made out of a whole county or counties and still meet the requirements of Section 3, then it must be formed by combining the areas of local governmental units in the order specified in Section 7(B), and if the requirements of Section 3 cannot feasibly be attained by combining the areas of local governmental units, then they must be divided, giving preference for division as specified in Section 7(C), and only one local governmental unit may be divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>between two districts. Section 7(D) requires that district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment be used to the extent reasonably consistent with the requirements of Section 3. Because Sections 7(A) through (C) are coequal with Section 7(D), when the sections cannot simultaneously be satisfied, the apportionment board may determine which of the provisions to follow. <em>See Voinovich, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 200, 586 N.E.2d 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\n<em>Respondents\u2019 Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 88} Respondents contend that their apportionment plan should not be analyzed on the district-by-district basis set forth in relators\u2019 complaint and briefs. According to respondents, with whom the majority implicitly agrees, \u201cthe boundaries of districts created at the end of the [apportionment] process are greatly affected by decisions made in districts created earlier,\u201d so that any constitutional violations in the latter districts are within the board\u2019s discretionary authority to make. This claim \u2014 which equates to \u201cbecause we have already violated the constitution, we can continue to violate the constitution\u201d \u2014 lacks merit. The procedure in Section 10 is subordinate to the substantive constitutional requirements in Sections 3 and 7(A), (B), (C), and (D) of Article XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 89} Nor is there any merit in respondents\u2019 claim that the court should not consider Professor Michael McDonald\u2019s alternative plans because they were not presented to the board. The court is not determining whether respondents should have adopted one of the alternative plans. Instead, we are determining whether respondents complied with the applicable requirements of Article XI. Nothing in the Ohio Constitution or other applicable law prevents this court from considering all relevant evidence in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 90} Respondents also raise a host of justifications for their violations of various provisions of Article XI, including that they had no duty to minimize divisions of governmental units in adopting their apportionment plan. Their argument completely ignores the plain language of Sections 7(A), (B), and (C), which require minimal divisions to the extent possible without violating the population requirements of Section 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">{\u00b6 91} Respondents further contend that they were justified in violating Article XI where they attempted to comply with Sections 3, 7(D), and 10. However, there is nothing in Section 3 that permits respondents to violate Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) to make the populations of districts more \u201csubstantially equal.\u201d Instead, if the board can make districts that comply with both Section 3 and Sections 7(A) through (C), they have a duty to do so. That is, respondents can violate Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) based on Section 3 only when complying with both sections is not feasibly attainable. Respondents\u2019 focus on Sections 7(D) and 10 completely ignores the requirements of Sections 7(A) through (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>{\u00b6 92} Section 7(D) does not \u2014 as respondents claim \u2014 give them license to change district borders any way they see fit in purported compliance with a requirement to keep a district\u2019s boundaries substantially similar to the district\u2019s previous boundary lines. Instead, as relators note, as long as the Section 3 requirements are met, Section 7(D) specifies that the district boundaries \u201cshall be adopted.\u201d And if the Section 3 requirements are not met by the prior district, Section 7(D) does not require that the board adopt substantially similar boundary lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 93} The majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 7(D) authorizes innumerable violations of Sections 7(A), (B), and (C) by allowing unnecessary divisions of governmental units based on a nonexistent requirement that the boundaries of new districts be substantially similar to those in the preceding apportionment districts. By applying a malleable standard of substantial adherence to previous district lines, an apportionment board could condone a myriad of violations of Article XI to achieve partisan gain. The citizens of Ohio could not have intended this absurd result when they adopted Section 7(D). <em>State ex rel. LetOhioVote.org v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 322, 2009-Ohio-4900, 916 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 50 (court has duty to construe constitutional provision to avoid unreasonable or absurd result).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>Article XI, Section 7(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 94} Article XI, Section 7(A) specifies that \u201c[t]o the extent consistent with the requirements of section 3 of this Article [requiring that the population of each house district be substantially equal to the house\u2019s ratio of representation and in no event less than 95 percent nor more than 105 percent of the ratio], the boundary lines of districts shall be so drawn as to delineate an area containing one or more whole counties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">{\u00b6 95} Notwithstanding the clear language of this provision, relators have established that for several house districts in the apportionment plan adopted by the board, respondents divided counties when it appears it was unnecessary to do so to meet the population requirements of Article XI, Section 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In violation of Section 7(A), House Districts 70, 78, 84, 91, 94, and 95 were created by dividing certain counties when such divisions were not necessary to satisfy Section 3 population requirements. As the apportionment board\u2019s joint secretaries\u2019 own analysis of the board\u2019s plan establishes, the division of Holmes County for House District 70, Athens, Pickaway, and Muskingum Counties for House District 78, Auglaize and Shelby Counties for House District 84, Ross County for House District 91, Athens, Vinton, and Washington Counties for House District 94, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Washington County for House District 95 are not required by the applicable provisions of Article XI. And the alternative apportionment plans submitted by relators\u2019 expert, Professor McDonald, prove that an apportionment plan need not violate Section 7(A) by splitting these counties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 96} Respondents attempt to justify their division of these counties and concomitant violation of Section 7(A) by relying on Sections 10(C) and (D). But Sections 10(C) and (D) should not be applied if they conflict with Section 7(A). The introductory language in Section 10 makes clear that the substantive standards set forth in Sections 3, 7, 8, and 9 govern the creation of house districts and that the procedure provided in Section 10 applies only insofar as it is consistent with those standards. <em>See also The Ohio State Constitution: A Reference Guide </em>286 (\u201csection 10 prescribes the method for creating house districts <em>subject to </em>the population requirement of section 3 and <em>the preference for creating districts out of whole counties in sections 7-9 </em>\u201d [emphasis added]). Because Sections 10(C) and (D) \u2014 in the manner that respondents applied them here \u2014 are inconsistent with the application of Section 7(A) regarding House Districts 70, 78, 84, 91, 94, and 95, respondents cannot rely on Sections 10(C) and (D) to justify their violation of Section 7(A) in dividing the specified counties. Unlike the provisions at issue in <em>Voinovich, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 200, 586 N.E.2d 1020, Section 10 is not coequal with Section 7, and thus, respondents were not permitted to remedy the conflict by ignoring Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">{\u00b6 97} For example, with regard to House District 70, respondents attempt to justify their plan\u2019s violation of Section 7(A) based on Section 7(D), citing paragraph 88 of Heather Mann\u2019s affidavit in support of this argument. But this paragraph from Mann\u2019s affidavit cites only Sections 10(C) and 10(D) and does not support respondents\u2019 claim that Section 7(D) required their split of Holmes County in creating the house district.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">{\u00b6 98} On the record before this court, relators have established beyond a reasonable doubt that respondents violated Article XI, Section 7(A) by unnecessarily dividing the specified counties in House Districts 70, 78, 84, 91, 94, and 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\n<em>Article XI, Sections 7(B) and (C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">{\u00b6 99} Article XI, Section 7(B) provides, \u201cWhere the requirements of section 3 of this Article cannot feasibly be attained by forming a district from a whole county or counties, such district shall be formed by combining the areas of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>governmental units giving preference in the order named to counties, townships, municipalities, and city wards.\u201d And under Article XI, Section 7(C), \u201cWhere the requirements of section 3 of this Article cannot feasibly be attained by combining the areas of governmental units as prescribed in division (B) of this section, only one such unit may be divided between two districts, giving preference in the selection of a unit for division to a township, a city ward, a city, and a village in the order named.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">{\u00b6 100} Respondents contend that their apportionment plan does not violate Sections 7(B) and 7(C), because Article XI does not require the apportionment board to put all noncontiguous portions of a governmental unit into one district. Thus, they claim that their plan divides only 15 governmental units. The board\u2019s plan defines a noncontiguous area as an area that is \u201clegally or technically a portion of a geographic unit,\u201d but is \u201csurrounded by other land-based geographic units.\u201d In formulating their plan, respondents determined that if a governmental unit was noncontiguous, the board could put its separate portions into different districts and not count this as a division of the governmental unit because the governmental unit had been divided by local officials through annexation. Respondents are correct in pointing out that previous apportionment boards followed this same logic, but they admit that this issue has never been resolved in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 101} For the following reasons, I disagree with respondents\u2019 contention that these divisions of governmental units do not count as divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 102} First, the plain language of Sections 7(B) and (C) does not authorize differing treatment of contiguous and noncontiguous governmental units. These sections do not distinguish between contiguous and noncontiguous governmental units, including counties, townships, municipalities, cities, city wards, or villages, so the plain, broad language of these constitutional provisions must apply to both. <em>See State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041, 896 N.E.2d 979, \u00b6 49 (\u201cR.C. 3503.06 makes no distinction between entitlement to vote in person or by absentee ballot at an election, so its plain, broad language must apply to both\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 246, 2006-Ohio-5202, 855 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Consumer Electronics Assn, v. Fed. Communications Comm., </em>347 F.3d 291, 298 (D.C.Cir.2003) (\u201cAs United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. previously observed in a unanimous opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \u2018the Supreme Court has consistently instructed that statutes written in broad, sweeping language should be given broad, sweeping application\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 103} Second, notwithstanding respondents\u2019 argument, \u201c[c]ourts are not authorized to add exceptions that are not contained in the express language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>these constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. LetOhioVote.org v. Brunner, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 322, 2009-Ohio-4900, 916 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 49. Therefore, we cannot except noncontiguous governmental units from the application of Article XI, Sections 7(B) and (C) when the express language of those provisions does not contain such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">{\u00b6 104} Third, although Section 7(A) requires that every house district be \u201ccomposed of contiguous territory\u201d with the boundary of each district being a \u201csingle nonintersecting continuous line,\u201d there is no evidence \u2014 or argument by respondents \u2014 that applying the plain language of \u201cgovernmental units\u201d in Sections 7(B) and (C) to include both contiguous and noncontiguous would result in a violation of Section 7(A) for the creation of house districts. <em>See Parella v. Montalbano, </em>899 A.2d 1226, 1253 (R.I.2006) (\u201cContiguity generally means that districts are bordering, adjoining, or touching\u201d). To the contrary, relators\u2019 reapportionment and redistricting expert, Professor McDonald, created two apportionment plans that each split less than half the number of political subdivisions split by respondents\u2019 apportionment plan, without violating Section 7(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 105} Fourth, this plain-language construction of Sections 7(B) and (C) to prefer the inclusion of whole governmental units and to avoid the splitting of even noncontiguous governmental units in apportioning state legislative districts is logical. As relators note, although noncontiguous political subdivisions may be separated geographically, \u201cthey share common issues, services, and political concerns.\u201d And they are generally represented by the same officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 106} Fifth, we need not approve an erroneous construction of a constitutional provision simply because it has always been construed erroneously, particularly when it has not previously been litigated. Doing so would protect an unconstitutional practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 107} Sixth, respondents\u2019 claim that invalidating their apportionment plan in this case \u201cwould wreak havoc on the apportionment process now and in the future\u201d by jeopardizing the state\u2019s compliance with the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.1973, is simply not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 108} Relators have met their burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\n<em>Article XI, Section 7(D)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">{\u00b6 109} Section 7(D) provides that \u201c[i]n making a new apportionment, district boundaries established by the preceding apportionment <em>shall be adopted to the extent reasonably consistent with the requirements of section 3 of this </em>Article.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">{\u00b6 110} Relators have established that respondents violated Section 7(D) in creating new House Districts 60, 61, 84, and 91 by altering the boundaries for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>house districts established by the 2001 apportionment.
