We hold that when the custodian of an individual retirement account files an interpleader action against the parties claiming to be the beneficiaries of the account, the custodian waives its contractual change-of-beneficiary procedures, and a person who proves that the owner of the account clearly intended to designate him or her as the beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>does not also need to prove that the owner substantially complied with the change-of-beneficiary procedures in order to recover. Instead, the account owner\u2019s clearly expressed intent controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 2} Because our holding rejects the analysis adopted by the Second District Court of Appeals in this case and because there exists a genuine issue of. fact as to the intent of the account owner, John F. Burchfield, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment and remand this case to the common pleas court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\n<em>The disputed accounts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 3} This is a dispute over money that Wells Fargo Advisors, L.L.C., was holding in two IRAs for John F. Burchfield when he committed suicide on December 16, 2009. In 2002, John designated his mother, appellant Gloria Welch, and his stepfather, Bruce Leland, as beneficiaries, 75 percent and 25 percent respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 4} On May 5, 2007, John married appellee Cynthia Burchfield. Shortly before the marriage, John designated Cynthia as the sole beneficiary on both accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\n<em>The disputed intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">{\u00b6 5} On October 28, 2009, John sent an e-mail to his Wells Fargo advisor, Aaron Michael, stating that he and Cynthia were getting divorced and requesting paperwork to remove Cynthia as the beneficiary on his IRAs. Thereafter, by telephone, John gave Michael specifics regarding a change in the beneficiary designation for the IRAs. Michael prepared change-of-beneficiary forms that again designated Welch and Leland as the beneficiaries, 75 percent and 25 percent respectively. In addition, John\u2019s sister, appellant Lori LeBlanc, was listed as the contingent beneficiary. Michael predated the forms \u201cNovember 2, 2009\u201d and mailed them to John, along with a self-addressed, stamped envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">{\u00b6 6} On November 2, 2009, Cynthia filed a divorce complaint against John. Around the same time, John spoke with Michael and informed him that the change-of-beneficiary forms were \u201calready taken care of.\u201d Approximately six weeks later, John committed suicide. He left a note that contained a postscript in which he expressed his love for Cynthia.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">{\u00b6 7} After John\u2019s death, Leland and LeBlanc asked Michael to look through John\u2019s financial documents to wind up John\u2019s affairs. Around January 25, 2010, Michael and one of John\u2019s co-workers discovered the signed change-of-beneficiary forms in an envelope among John\u2019s papers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That same morning, Michael gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the forms to his manager at Wells Fargo. Cynthia, LeBlanc, and Welch made conflicting demands of Wells Fargo for the IRA proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 8} In March 2010, LeBlanc<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Welch filed a complaint against Wells Fargo and Cynthia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking a declaratory judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that Cynthia was not entitled to the proceeds of John\u2019s IRAs. In turn, Cynthia sought a contrary declaration that she, as the beneficiary named on the form in Wells Fargo\u2019s possession at John\u2019s death, was solely entitled to the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 9} In response, Wells Fargo filed an action in interpleader against LeBlanc, Welch, and Cynthia, in which it represented that it was \u201cunable to determine the validity of the conflicting demands.\u201d Wells Fargo disclaimed any interest in the proceeds of John\u2019s IRA accounts and offered to deposit the funds with the court\u2019s clerk or to maintain the account until the dispute was resolved. The trial court granted summary judgment to Cynthia, the beneficiary designated on the form in Wells Fargo\u2019s possession at the time of John\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 10} The Second District Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>LeBlanc v. Wells Fargo Advisors, L.L.C., </em>196 Ohio App.3d 213, 2011-Ohio-5553, 962 N.E.2d 872. In doing so, it emphasized that John had not complied with the Wells Fargo policy, which required that change-of-beneficiary forms be returned to the company. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12. And it concluded that Wells Fargo had not waived compliance with its change-of-beneficiary procedure by filing an action in inter-pleader against the claimants. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 11} In reaching that conclusion, the Second District rejected the Ninth District Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Kelly v. May Assoc. Fed. Credit Union, </em>9th Dist. No. 23423, 2008-Ohio-1507, 2008 WL 836014, which held that an IRA custodian waives compliance with its change-of-beneficiary procedures when it interpleads disputed funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 12} The Second District further held that even if Kelly\u2019s holding on this narrow legal point was correct and the custodian\u2019s filing of an interpleader action waived its right to enforce the change-of-beneficiary procedure, the parties claiming to be the \u201cclearly intended\u201d beneficiaries must still prove that the decedent had substantially complied with the change-of-beneficiary procedure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>LeBlanc </em>at \u00b6 13. In doing so, it again rejected yet another <em>Kelly </em>holding \u2014 that the account holder\u2019s clearly expressed intent controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, the Second District concluded that John\u2019s failure to return the forms to Wells Fargo before his death constituted a failure to substantially comply with Wells Fargo\u2019s procedure and that that failure was fatal to Welch and LeBlane\u2019s claims, without regard to John\u2019s actual intent. It affirmed summary judgment in favor of Cynthia.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 14} We granted LeBlanc and Welch\u2019s discretionary appeal, 131 Ohio St.3d 1456, 2012-Ohio-648, 961 N.E.2d 1135, and certified that a conflict exists between the Second District\u2019s decision in this case and the Ninth District\u2019s decision in <em>LeBlanc, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 1455, 2012-Ohio-648, 961 N.E.2d 1134. We consolidated the actions, which present the same legal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 15} The question certified by the Second District is: \u201cIn a dispute between (1) a specifically designated and (2) a clearly intended beneficiary of an individual retirement account (IRA), where the account custodian files an interpleader action and purportedly waives compliance with its change of beneficiary procedure, is the \u2018clearly intended\u2019 beneficiary required to show that the owner of the IRA account substantially complied with the change of beneficiary procedure in order to recover?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 16} We answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">{\u00b6 17} Resolution of the issues before us requires that we answer two unsettled questions. First, when an IRA custodian files an interpleader action against competing claimants, does it waive its contractual change-of-beneficiary procedures? And if so, what is the test for determining who is entitled to the disputed funds?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">{\u00b6 18} Because we agree with the Ninth District\u2019s analysis and holding, we first turn our discussion to its opinion in <em>Kelly, </em>which squarely dealt with both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">\n<em>The Ninth District Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">{\u00b6 19} Barbara Kelly opened an IRA at May Associates Federal Credit Union in 1992 and named her nephew, Richard Wachter, as the beneficiary. <em>Kelly, </em>2008-Ohio-1507, 2008 WL 836014, at \u00b6 4. She also granted Richard a general power of attorney and named him co-owner of a number of certificates of deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">{\u00b6 20} Barbara later granted a power of attorney to her daughter, Janice Kelly, and revoked the one she had given Richard. Barbara also made Janice the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>co-owner of her certificates of deposit and told Richard that she was going to make Janice the beneficiary of her IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">{\u00b6 21} On November 19, 1998, Barbara telephoned May Associates to name Janice the beneficiary of her IRA. Even though May Associates required that a beneficiary could be changed only by the member completing and signing an IRA beneficiary-designation form, the teller with whom Barbara spoke completed the change-of-beneficiary form and wrote \u201cper member\u201d on the signature line. The teller mailed a copy of the form she had completed to Barbara, placed a copy in the credit union\u2019s file, and sent a copy to the third-party administrator handling the IRA. Barbara was not told that she needed to sign the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 22} Barbara died in 2003. By that time, May Associates was using a different third-party administrator for the IRA. The new company had the designation of Richard on file that Barbara made when she opened the account but had no information about the form the teller filled out in 1998. The administrator told Richard that he was the beneficiary. Janice and Richard made competing claims for the IRA proceeds. No money was paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 23} Janice filed a complaint against Richard and May Associates, seeking a declaratory judgment that she was entitled to the IRA proceeds. May Associates filed an interpleader action against Janice and Richard. The trial court granted summary judgment to Janice on the ground that Barbara had clearly expressed her intent that Janice be the beneficiary of the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 24} The Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Kelly, </em>2008-Ohio-1507, 2008 WL 836014, at \u00b6 2. In doing so, it acknowledged that Barbara had not complied with the May Associates procedures, which required that changes to beneficiaries \u201cbe made by completing and signing an IRA beneficiary designation form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. But it concluded that May Associates waived the signature requirement when it filed the interpleader action. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">{\u00b6 25} To reach that conclusion, the <em>Kelly </em>court applied our holdings in cases dealing with life-insurance-policy proceeds and justified doing so because life-insurance policies and individual retirement accounts share a salient feature\u2014 they both \u201ctypically include a procedure for designating and changing beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then explained that \u201c[i]t has long been the rule in Ohio that those procedures are intended to protect the insurer from duplicate liability and the insurer is free to waive them.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Rindlaub v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>175 Ohio St. 303, 305, 194 N.E.2d 577 (1963), and <em>Atkinson v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>114 Ohio St. 109, 150 N.E. 748 (1926), paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 26} Indeed, \u201cif, in the face of conflicting claims to insurance proceeds, the insurer interpleads those proceeds, it has waived any interest in the resolution of the claims, including enforcement of the procedure set forth in its policy for designating and changing beneficiaries.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Rindlaub </em>and <em>Atkinson. </em>\u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>such a case, if the insured communicated to the insurer her \u2018clearly expressed intent\u2019 to change beneficiaries, the proceeds will be paid to the newly designated beneficiary rather than the originally designated beneficiary * * *.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Rindlaub </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 27} There was no question that Barbara had telephoned May Associates and told a teller to change her beneficiary designation. \u201cBased on [the teller\u2019s] testimony, coupled with the change of beneficiary form completed by the teller,\u201d the Ninth District concluded that there was no genuine issue of fact whether Barbara had clearly expressed to May Associates her intent to change her beneficiary. <em>Kelly, </em>2008-Ohio-1507, 2008 WL 836014, at \u00b6 27. Accordingly, it affirmed summary judgment in favor of Janice. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>The Second District opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">{\u00b6 28} The Second District refused to apply our holdings in the life-insurance cases to the dispute over John\u2019s IRA proceeds, and it therefore concluded that Wells Fargo did not waive its change-of-beneficiary procedures by interpleading the disputed funds. <em>See LeBlanc, </em>196 Ohio App.3d 213, 2011-Ohio-5553, 962 N.E.2d 872, \u00b6 23. In its view, an IRA is fundamentally different from a life-insurance policy because an IRA is a present asset of the account holder during her life, but a life-insurance policy \u2014 in one form \u2014 has no value to the insured during the insured\u2019s life. But in so holding, the Second District conceded that \u201cthere are many and varied financial products that come under the heading of \u2018life insurance\u2019 * * * some of which have a cash value that the owner of the policy can withdraw or borrow against.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 29} The appellate court concluded that IRAs are more akin to joint and survivorship accounts. <em>Id. </em>It reasoned that both are present assets of an account holder and both transfer outside of probate upon the death of the account holder. <em>Id. </em>For that reason, the Second District applied our holding in <em>Wright v. Bloom, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 596, 635 N.E.2d 31 (1994), which is the leading case law applicable to disputes over joint bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Wright, </em>we held that in the absence of fraud, duress, undue influence, or lack of capacity, the opening of a joint and survivorship account was conclusive evidence of an intent to transfer the balance of the account upon the death of an account holder. <em>Id. </em>at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. And there is \u201cno need to go beyond the account contract to ascertain the creator\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. Instead, the dispositive question is simply whether the signature card or account documents specify that the joint account holders have survivorship rights. <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 31} In deciding <em>LeBlanc, </em>the Second District conceded that joint and survivorship accounts transfer purely by virtue of contract, while IRA proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>transfer by virtue of the Uniform Transfer-On-Death Security Registration Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">\u201cAny transfer-on-death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form is effective by reason of the contract regarding the registration between the owner of the security and the registering entity and by reason of sections 1709.01 to 1709.11 of the Revised Code and is not testamentary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><em>LeBlanc, </em>196 Ohio App.3d 213, 2011-Ohio-5553, 962 N.E.2d 872, \u00b6 16, quoting R.C. 1709.09(A). It therefore justified applying the contracts rule developed in the joint-and-survivorship-account cases by emphasizing that the transfer of IRA proceeds \u201cderives its effectiveness from the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Second District concluded that Wells Fargo\u2019s requirements for a change of beneficiary controlled, and \u201cbecause John did not comply with them, he did not change the beneficiary before his death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 32} The Second District also held, in the alternative, that even if insurance law applies and an IRA custodian waives its change-of-beneficiary procedures when it interpleads disputed funds, a party claiming that the account holder clearly intended to designate him or her as beneficiary is nonetheless required to prove that the account holder substantially complied with the custodian\u2019s change-of-beneficiary procedures in order to recover. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. The appellate court concluded that John\u2019s failure to return the forms naming LeBlanc and Welch as beneficiaries was also a failure to substantially comply with the policy, even if John had otherwise clearly expressed his intent to change his beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 33} The Second District\u2019s holding applied the substantial-compliance test often used in disputes between life-insurance companies and claimants. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. <em>See State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Am. v. Holmes, </em>10th Dist. No. 88AP-377, 1988 WL 92435 (Aug. 30, 1988) (holding that in a dispute between an insurance company and a life-insurance claimant, the insured, before his death, substantially complied with the insurance company\u2019s procedures in converting a whole-life policy to a universal-life policy, and thus the insurance company was required to pay the insured\u2019s beneficiary and not the insurance company\u2019s beneficiary under the temporary insurance agreement); <em>see also Benton v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>110 Ohio App. 151, 159 N.E.2d 912 (1st Dist.1959) (holding that in a dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>between an insurance company and a life-insurance claimant, the insurance company was required to pay the party whom the account holder clearly intended to designate as his beneficiary because the insured had substantially complied with the insurance company\u2019s change-of-beneficiary procedures).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">{\u00b6 34} The Second District also claimed that its holding was not inconsistent with our decision in <em>Rindlaub, </em>because \u201csubstantial compliance with the rules for a change of beneficiary was a part of the <em>Rindlaub </em>result.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>LeBlanc, </em>196 Ohio App.3d 213, 2011-Ohio-5553, 962 N.E.2d 872, \u00b6 26. We do not agree with either assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>Rindlaub, </em>Bruce Rindlaub purchased two life-insurance policies from the Travelers Insurance Company. <em>Rindlaub, </em>175 Ohio St. at 304-305, 194 N.E.2d 577. Travelers\u2019 procedures provided that a change of beneficiary had to be made in writing and had to be approved in writing by Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 36} Initially, Bruce designated his wife, Alice Rindlaub, as his primary beneficiary and his daughter, Cornelia, as the contingent beneficiary. Thereafter, Bruce and Alice divorced and Bruce sent Travelers a witnessed statement \u201cclearly indicating his intention to cancel all previous designations of beneficiaries,\u201d to name Margaret Walker as the new primary beneficiary, and to rename Cornelia as the contingent beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 37} Travelers responded by letter inquiring as to the relationship between Bruce and his newly designated primary beneficiary. The letter stated that the contracts had been issued in a community-property state and therefore Alice had certain rights under the policies unless she had waived those rights or a court action had disposed of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 38} There was no proof that Bruce ever received the letter. Nothing further was done, either by Bruce or by Travelers. Six months later, Bruce and Margaret married. Thirteen years later, Bruce died. At the time of Bruce\u2019s death, the life-insurance policies listing Alice as the primary beneficiary were in his possession. Alice and Margaret made conflicting demands of Travelers for the IRA proceeds. No money was paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 39} Margaret sued Travelers for the proceeds, and Travelers responded by filing an interpleader action against Margaret and Alice. We rejected Alice\u2019s claim to the proceeds, which was based on the fact that she was the beneficiary named on the policies. In describing the <em>strength </em>of Margaret\u2019s claim that she was the clearly intended beneficiary, we noted that absent evidence that Bruce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>had received the insurer\u2019s letter, it was \u201centirely reasonable to infer that [Bruce] believed he had done all that was necessary to effectuate a change of beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. We explained, therefore, that there was \u201cno basis for inferring that [Bruce] abandoned his purpose * * * to change the beneficiary,\u201d as Alice had contended. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">{\u00b6 40} But we made clear that change-of-beneficiary procedures are for the benefit of the insurance company only. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Indeed, they are \u201ca means of establishing the fact that the insurer has received notice of the change of beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 41} We explained that such procedures may be determinative in litigation between an insurance company and the insured or a single beneficiary, but when \u201cthe insurer \u2018washes its hands\u2019 by interpleader,\u201d the controversy is between the parties who claim to be the rightful beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn such case the relative rights of the litigants should depend upon the expressed intention of the insured. If he has clearly indicated to the insurer his intention to change beneficiaries, his intention must be given effect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>We adopt the Ninth District\u2019s view</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 42} The Ninth District\u2019s rationale and holdings represent the better-reasoned view.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 43} We agree that it is material that life-insurance policies and IRAs both typically have a procedure for designating and changing beneficiaries. We recognize that the Uniform Transfer-On-Death Security Registration Act, which the parties agree governs distribution of IRA proceeds, establishes that a security may be registered in beneficiary form. R.C. 1709.03; <em>see </em>R.C. 1709.01(A) (defining \u201cbeneficiary form\u201d as \u201ca registration of a security that indicates the present owner of the security and the intention of the present owner regarding the person who will become the owner of the security upon the death of the present owner\u201d). And we recognize that the act establishes how a security registered in beneficiary form is transferred upon the death of the account holder. R.C. 1709.07 (upon the death of the account holder, ownership of a security registered in beneficiary form \u201cshall pass to the beneficiary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">{\u00b6 44} But the transfer of IRA proceeds derives its effectiveness from the contract, as the Second District emphasized, and \u201cfrom R.C. 1709.01 to 1709.11.\u201d R.C. 1709.09(A). And R.C. 1709.01 through 1709.11 provide protections to the custodian. R.C. 1709.08(A) (\u201cIf a registration in beneficiary form is offered by a registering entity, the owner requesting registration in beneficiary form assents to the protections given to the registering entity by sections 1709.01 to 1709.11 of the Revised Code\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Brannon &amp; Associates and David D. Brannon, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AhqR\">Dungan &amp; LeFevre Co., L.P.A., and James D. Brookshire, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">{\u00b6 45} For all these reasons, we conclude that IRA change-of-beneficiary procedures are intended to protect the IRA custodian, and the custodian alone. <em>Id.; see also Rindlaub, </em>175 Ohio St. at 305, 194 N.E.2d 577 (change-of-beneficiary procedures are \u201ca means of establishing the fact that the insurer has received notice of the change of beneficiary,\u201d thereby avoiding duplicate liability for the insurer). Therefore, a custodian is free to waive the procedures by filing an action in interpleader against the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">{\u00b6 46} We also adopt the \u201cclearly expressed intent\u201d test from our insurance cases. <em>See Rindlaub </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. Therefore, if an IRA custodian files an interpleader action, and the account owner\u2019s intent to change beneficiaries was clearly communicated to the custodian, the proceeds will be paid to the newly designated beneficiary rather than to the original beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>In such a case, proof of substantial compliance with the custodian\u2019s procedures for changing the beneficiary is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 47} We answer the certified question in the negative and, therefore, reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. Because there is a genuine issue of fact as to the clearly expressed intent of the account owner, this case is remanded to the trial court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-10\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-14\">. The parties dispute whether the signatures on the forms are John\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">. LeBlanc filed suit on behalf of John\u2019s estate and in her individual capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-12\">. Leland was also named as a defendant, but he disclaimed any interest in the IRAs, along with all of John\u2019s other probate and nonprobate assets. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Leland as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">.

On that point, the Second District warned: \u201c[I]f a transfer upon death is effective by reason of the \u2018clearly expressed intent\u2019 of the insured, * * * R.C. 1709.09(A) does not save it from being included in the estate, subject to the formalities of the statute of wills and subject to the statutory benefits and elections that a surviving spouse may choose to receive.\u201d <em>LeBlanc </em>at \u00b6 16. Our decision here makes clear' that that result would be improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">. The Second District also relied on <em>Magruder v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>512 F.2d 507 (6th Cir.1975), a federal court of appeals\u2019 decision applying Tennessee law. In <em>Magruder, </em>the insured completed a change-of-benefieiary form but did not mail it to the insurer before his death. We find its reliance on <em>Magruder </em>unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
