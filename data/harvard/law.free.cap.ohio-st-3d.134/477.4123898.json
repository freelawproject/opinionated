On November 25, 2008, he was adjudicated delinquent, and the juvenile court, applying Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10 (\u201cS.B. 10\u201d), classified him as a Tier III (the most serious) sex offender, subject to community-notification requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 3} He appealed his classification, and the First District Court of Appeals reversed. <em>In re Bruce S., </em>1st Dist. No. C-081300 (Dec. 16, 2009). It held that the juvenile court committed reversible error by failing to use its discretion to classify Bruce S. as a Tier I, Tier II, or Tier III sex offender. Accordingly, it vacated the classification and remanded the case to the juvenile court to conduct a new classification hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 4} On remand, the juvenile court magistrate held a classification hearing on May 19, 2010. The magistrate again classified Bruce S. as a Tier III sex offender. The juvenile court judge overruled Bruce\u2019s objections on December 20, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">{\u00b6 5} Bruce S. appealed his classification, asserting that he should not be classified as a Tier III sex offender under S.B. 10 because he committed his offense before the effective date of the applicable part of that statute. The First District Court of Appeals agreed that the juvenile court had erred in applying S.B. 10 to him and reversed. <em>In re Bruce S., </em>Hamilton App. No. C-110042, 2011-Ohio-6634, 2011 WL 6826422, \u00b6 6. But noting that its analysis was in conflict with the analysis of the Eighth District Court of Appeals, the First District certified the question to us. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. Upon review, we agreed that the question was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>properly before us and ordered briefing. <em>In re Bruce S., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 1482, 2012-Ohio-1143, 963 N.Ed.2d 823. We now resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 6} In <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108, this court held, at syllabus: \u201c2007 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10, as applied to defendants who committed sex offenses prior to its enactment, violates Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws.\u201d <em>Williams </em>noted, in passing, that S.B. 10 \u201cwas enacted in 2007, and is based on the federal Adam Walsh Act, Section 16901 et seq., Title 42, U.S. Code.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. But it never addressed the discrete issue presented here, i.e., whether an individual who committed a sex offense after S.B. 10\u2019s enactment date<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (June 27, 2007) but before the date on which S.B. 10\u2019s registration, classification and community-notification provisions became effective (January 1, 2008) is subject to S.B. 10\u2019s provisions, or whether he is subject to the provisions of the predecessor statute, Megan\u2019s Law, under which sex-offender registration requirements were less severe. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 7} In considering that question, we are presented with two reasonable answers. The First District in this case held that the critical date was January 1, 2008. <em>In re Bruce S., </em>2011-Ohio-6634, 2011 WL 6826422, \u00b6 5. But the Eighth District, in <em>State v. Scott, </em>8th Dist. No. 91890, 2011-Ohio-6255, 2011 WL 6150058, \u00b6 5, summarily held that S.B. 10\u2019s enactment date of June 27, 2007, controls. We adopt the reasoning of the First District, which applied <em>Cox v. Ohio Dept. of Transp., </em>67 Ohio St.2d 501, 508, 424 N.E.2d 597 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Cox, </em>this court adopted a \u201cwell-stated\u201d rule proffered by the Legislative Service Commission and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cWhere an act of the General Assembly amends an existing section of the Revised Code * * *, postpones the effective date of the amended section for one year after the effective date of the act, and repeals the \u2018existing\u2019 section in a standard form of repealing clause used for many years by the General Assembly for the purpose of complying with Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>15(D) of Article II of the Constitution of Ohio, the constitutionally mandated repealing clause must be construed to take effect upon the effective date of the amended section in order to prevent a hiatus in the statutory law, during which neither the repealed section nor the amended section is in effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">(Footnote omitted.) <em>Cox </em>at 508, quoting the Legislative Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 9} <em>Cox </em>reflects prudential principles that should be applied in all cases in which the General Assembly amends a statute and then repeals the preamendment version of the statute. In its arguments here, the state ignores <em>Cox. </em>The state asserts that S.B. 10 was an emergency law that necessarily became effective immediately. But while the state argues that S.B. 10 became effective immediately upon the governor\u2019s signature, it also concedes that \u201cthe enormity of this legislation required a period of transition to the new statutory scheme.\u201d We think that S.B. 10 presents exactly the situation that <em>Cox </em>was designed to control: to prevent a hiatus during the period in which the legislature amends a statute but directs that the amendments take place in the future, and orders the repeal of the preamendment version of the statute after amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 10} <em>Cox </em>remains an accurate statement of Ohio law and controls here. The rule in <em>Cox </em>was suggested by the Legislative Service Commission, <em>see Cox </em>at 508, which we recognize plays a vital role in assisting the General Assembly in drafting legislation. <em>See </em>http://www.lsc.state.oh.us/about/default.htm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 11} Moreover, we presume that if the General Assembly disagreed with the rule set forth in <em>Cox, </em>it would have responded to it at some point in the past 30 years. <em>See State v. Ferguson, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 7, 2008-Ohio-4824, 896 N.E.2d 110, \u00b6 22, citing <em>Clark v. Scarpelli, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 271, 278, 744 N.E.2d 719 (2001), citing <em>State ex rel. Huron Cty. Bd. of Edn. v. Howard, </em>167 Ohio St. 93, 96, 146 N.E.2d 604 (1957) (\u201cIt is presumed that the General Assembly is fully aware of any prior judicial interpretation of an existing statute when enacting an amendment\u201d). After all, \u201cthe General Assembly has shown no hesitation in acting promptly when it disagrees with appellate rulings involving statutory construction and interpretation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23, citing <em>Shay v. Shay, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 172, 2007-Ohio-1384, 863 N.E.2d 591, \u00b6 25. It has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 12} We thus adopt the First District\u2019s analysis and judgment and hold that Senate Bill 10\u2019s classification, registration, and community-notification provisions cannot be constitutionally applied to a sex offender who committed his sex offense between July 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007, the last day before January 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>2008, the effective date of S.B. 10\u2019s classification, registration, and community-notification provisions.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5Jdf\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Paula E. Adams, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant, the state of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A47\">Timothy Young, Ohio Public Defender, and Amanda S. Powell, Assistant Public Defender, for appellee, Bruce S.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AP6\">Ron O\u2019Brien, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney, and Steven L. Taylor, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, urging reversal on behalf of amicus curiae, Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b583-6\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\">. In this appeal, the state asserts that the enactment date is June 30, 2007, i.e., the date that the governor signed the bill. In the conflict ease, <em>State v. Scott, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 91890, 2011-Ohio-6255, 2011 WL 6150058, the court treated June 27, 2007, the date on which the bill was passed, as its enactment date. For purposes of this appeal, it is not necessary to resolve whether the enactment date is June 27 or June 30, 2007. We shall use the state\u2019s date, June 27, 2007, which is consistent with our prior opinion in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
