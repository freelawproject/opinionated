Donnelly from acting on any further proceedings in case No. CV-11-753481, now pending in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. 2701.03(A) requires that a party seeking to disqualify a judge must file an \u201caffidavit\u201d with the clerk of the Supreme Court. Under Ohio law, an affidavit \u201cis a written declaration under oath.\u201d R.C. 2319.02. To comply with R.C. 2701.03, an affidavit must be confirmed by oath or affirmation of the party making it and be made before a person having authority to administer the oath or affirmation. <em>In re Disqualification of Pokorny, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1238, 657 N.E.2d 1345 (1992), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 54 (5th Ed.1979). <em>See also </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(2) (requiring that the affidavit contain the \u201cjurat of a notary public or another person authorized to administer oaths or affirmations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 3} Lisboa\u2019s \u201caffidavit\u201d of disqualification, however, does not contain the \u201cjurat of a notary public or another person authorized to administer oaths or affirmations,\u201d as required by R.C. 2701.03(B)(2). Lisboa, who is currently in Brazil due to immigration issues, claims that the United States Consulate in Brazil could not provide him with notary service before the statutory seven-day filing requirement set forth in R.C. 2701.03(B) had passed. Thus, in lieu of a sworn affidavit, Lisboa submitted a signed, unsworn statement pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 (legitimizing certain unsworn declarations), declaring under penalty of perjury that the allegations against Judge Donnelly are \u201ctrue and correct.\u201d But under Ohio law, unsworn written statements that are signed under penalty of perjury cannot be substituted for affidavits. <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Neller, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1234, 2004-Ohio-2895, 809 N.E.2d 1152, \u00b6 22-24 (rejecting argument that statements made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 are valid in Ohio). Lisboa\u2019s failure to confirm his allegations against Judge Donnelly by oath or affirmation before a competent officer violates R.C. 2701.03. <em>Pokorny, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 1238, 657 N.E.2d 1345; <em>In re Disqualification of Suster, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1240, 2009-Ohio-7202, 937 N.E.2d 1026, \u00b6 19. Accordingly, Lisboa\u2019s \u201caffidavit\u201d of disqualification is stricken and is hereby dismissed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
