Anderson, appeals from a judgment denying her request for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, the city of Vermilion, Ohio, to provide copies of certain itemized billing statements for attorney services rendered to the city. Because the city did not establish that the entirety of the requested statements are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act, we reverse that portion of the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings. We affirm the portion of the judgment denying Anderson\u2019s request for an award of statutory damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 2} Anderson served as the mayor of Vermilion from January 2006 through December 2009. During her administration, the law firm of Marcie <em>&amp; </em>Butler, L.P.A. (\u201cMarcie &amp; Butler\u201d) provided legal services to the city, and the firm\u2019s provision of services extended into the next mayor\u2019s term. The new mayor, Eileen Bulan, appointed Kenneth Stumphauzer as the city\u2019s director of law. Stumphauzer\u2019s law firm, Stumphauzer, O\u2019Toole, McLaughlin, McGlamery &amp; Loughman Co., L.P.A. (\u201cStumphauzer &amp; O\u2019Toole\u201d), billed the city over $27,000 for legal services provided during the first six weeks of the new mayor\u2019s administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 3} Because she thought that the annual legal fees expended by the new administration would far exceed the fees incurred during her administration, Anderson made several records requests to permit public scrutiny of the city\u2019s expenditure of funds for legal services. On May 25, 2010, Anderson personally delivered a written public-records request to the city\u2019s finance director for copies of certain records, including \u201call itemized billing statements received from Kenneth Stumphauzer, Stumphauzer &amp; O\u2019Toole, [and] Marcie <em>&amp; </em>Butler, for January, February, March and April 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 4} The city acknowledged its receipt of Anderson\u2019s request but denied it on the basis that the requested legal bills are exempted from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">[T]he detailed billing statements, describing the specific work performed for and advice rendered to the City by Stumphauzer O\u2019Toole and any other lawyers rendering services to the City are covered by the attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>privilege. In particular, bills submitted by Stumphauzer O\u2019Toole to the City describe each matter with respect to which legal services were rendered, the dates on which such legal services were rendered and the specific tasks performed. As a result, we cannot agree to provide you with those detailed itemized billing statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 5} In September 2010, Anderson filed a petition in the court of appeals. Anderson sought a writ of mandamus to compel Vermilion to provide copies of the nonexempt portions of the requested itemized attorney-billing statements. Anderson also requested an award of statutory damages and attorney fees. The court granted an alternative writ, and the city submitted an answer to the petition. Anderson filed a motion for summary judgment, and the city filed a brief in opposition. The court of appeals granted Anderson\u2019s motion for an in camera review of the requested attorney-billing statements, and the city filed the statements under seal.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 6} On April 25, 2012, the court of appeals denied Anderson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted summary judgment in favor of Vermilion, and denied the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is now before the court on Anderson\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">{\u00b6 8} The court of appeals denied Anderson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and, in essence, granted summary judgment in favor of Vermilion by determining that \u201cthere remains no genuine issue of material fact and [the city] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d 6th Dist. No. E-10-040, 2012-Ohio-1868, 2012 WL 1493744, \u00b6 13. <em>See also Todd Dev. Co., Inc. v. Morgan, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 461, 2008-Ohio-87, 880 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 17 (\u201cWhen a party moves for summary judgment, the nonmovant has an opportunity to respond, and the court has considered all the relevant evidence, the court may enter summary judgment against the moving party, despite the nonmoving party\u2019s failure to file its own motion for summary judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when an examination of all relevant materials filed in the action reveals that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. McBride, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 51, 2011-Ohio-4674, 955 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 12, quoting Civ.R. 56(C). \u201cIn reviewing whether the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment was proper, we apply a de novo review.\u201d <em>Troyer v. Janis, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 229. 2012-Ohio-2406, 971 N.E.2d 862, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"AK3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals entered summary judgment in favor of Vermilion on Anderson\u2019s mandamus claim for itemized attorney-billing statements. \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6. \u201cWe construe the Public Records Act liberally in favor of broad access and resolve any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Rocker v. Guernsey Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 224, 2010-Ohio-3288, 932 N.E.2d 327, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">{\u00b6 11} Vermilion claims \u2014 and the court of appeals found \u2014 that the requested itemized attorney-billing statements are exempt from disclosure based on the attorney-client privilege. \u201cExceptions to disclosure under the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, are strictly construed against the public-records custodian, and the custodian has the burden to establish the applicability of an exception.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Jones-Kelley, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 81, 2008-Ohio-1770, 886 N.E.2d 206, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(v) excludes \u201c[rjecords the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law\u201d from the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d for purposes of the Public Records Act. \u201cThe attorney-client privilege, which covers records of communications between attorneys and their government clients pertaining to the attorneys\u2019 legal advice, is a state law prohibiting release of [those] records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Besser v. Ohio State Univ., </em>87 Ohio St.3d 535, 542, 721 N.E.2d 1044 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">{\u00b6 13} More specifically, we have held that the narrative portions of itemized attorney-billing statements containing descriptions of legal services performed by counsel for a client are protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>State ex rel. Dawson v. Bloom-Carroll Local School Dist., </em>131 Ohio St.3d 10, 2011-Ohio-6009, 959 N.E.2d 524, \u00b6 28-29; <em>see also State ex rel. McCaffrey v. Mahoning Cty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 139, 2012-Ohio-4246, 976 N.E.2d 877, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">{\u00b6 14} Anderson requested itemized attorney-billing statements for services provided to Vermilion by Stumphauzer, Stumphauzer &amp; O\u2019Toole, and Marcie &amp; Butler for January, February, March, and April 2010. The Stumphauzer &amp; O\u2019Toole billing statements include the title of the matter being handled, e.g., the case name or general subject, a narrative description of the legal services provided, the hours expended, and the amount due. The Marcie &amp; Butler statements include the dates the services were rendered, a narrative description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of the services rendered, the hours and fee rate for the services provided, and the amount of money billed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 15} Under the Public Records Act, insofar as these itemized attorney-billing statements contain nonexempt information, e.g., the general title of the matter being handled, the dates the services were performed, and the hours, rate, and money charged for the services, they should have been disclosed to Anderson. \u201cIf a public record contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or the person responsible for the public record shall make available all of the information within the public record that is not exempt.\u201d R.C. 149.43(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 16} The parties submitted the requested attorney-billing statements under seal for the court of appeals\u2019 review. As we have held, the nonexempt portions of the records submitted under seal in public-records mandamus cases must be disclosed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201c[W]hen a governmental body asserts that public records are excepted from disclosure and such assertion is challenged, the court must make an individualized scrutiny of the records in question. <em>If the court finds that these records contain excepted information, this information must be redacted and any remaining information must be released.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Master v. Cleveland, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 23, 31, 661 N.E.2d 180 (1996), quoting <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Cleveland, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 79, 526 N.E.2d 786 (1988), paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 17} Consequently, in <em>McCaffrey, </em>133 Ohio St.3d 139, 2012-Ohio-4246, 976 N.E.2d 877, at \u00b6 35-37, we held that the respondents in a public-records mandamus case had complied with a records request by providing copies of civil-case logs that had been redacted to exclude the narrative portions of the logs that were covered by attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 18} The city nevertheless makes three separate arguments to support the court of appeals\u2019 conclusion. Vermilion first claims that Anderson waived her right to the nonexempt portions of the requested attorney-billing statements because after the court of appeals\u2019 judgment, she requested summaries of the information in attorney bills excluding attorney-client information and the city satisfied that request. It is true that providing the requested records to a relator generally renders moot a public-records mandamus claim. <em>See State ex rel. Striker v. Smith, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 168, 2011-Ohio-2878, 950 N.E.2d 952, \u00b6 22. But Anderson\u2019s postjudgment records request was for records for a different period of time \u2014 June 2010 through May 2012 \u2014 than the period at issue in this case\u2014 January through April 2010. Therefore, Anderson did not waive her mandamus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>claim or appeal by seeking and receiving different records than those at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">{\u00b6 19} The city next claims that it need not provide copies of the nonexempt portions of the requested attorney-billing statements because after redacting the narrative portions that are covered by the attorney-client privilege, the remainder would be \u201cmeaningless.\u201d But there is no indication that the city\u2019s subjective belief concerning the value of this information is true. The provision of information concerning the hours expended and rate charged for attorney services may have some value to the requester. Nor is there any exception to the explicit duty in R.C. 149.43(B)(1) for public offices to make available all information that is not exempt after redacting the information that is exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 20} Finally, the city contends that the statements were either exempt from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege or so inextricably intertwined so as to also be privileged. The court of appeals agreed with that assertion based on our decision in <em>Dawson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 10, 2011-Ohio-6009, 959 N.E.2d 524, where we noted that attorney-billing statements withheld by a school district were \u201ceither covered by the attorney-client privilege or so inextricably intertwined with the privileged materials as to also be exempt from disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 21} Nevertheless, in the very same paragraph cited by the city and relied on by the court of appeals, we emphasized that the school district did not have to provide the nonexempt portions of the statements to the requester in that case because the district had already provided summaries containing the nonexempt information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">Therefore, the school district properly responded to Dawson\u2019s request for itemized invoices of law firms providing legal services to the district in matters involving Dawson and her children by providing her with summaries of the invoices including the attorney\u2019s name, the fee total, and the general matter involved. No further access to the detailed narratives contained in the itemized billing statements was warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">{\u00b6 22} In essence, the relator in <em>Dawson </em>was not entitled to the nonexempt portions of the requested itemized attorney-billing statements, because she had already been provided that information by the school district in the summaries. This rendered the relator\u2019s claim for that part of the records moot. <em>Striker, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 168. 2011-Ohio-2878. 950 N.E.2d 952. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>{\u00b6 23} This is the crucial fact that distinguishes this case from <em>Dawson. </em>Vermilion did not provide Anderson with alternate records that contain the nonexempt information from the requested attorney-billing statements for January 2010 through April 2010. Therefore, her claim for these records is not moot, and she is entitled to that portion of the statements after they have been redacted to prevent disclosure of the narrative portions that are covered by the attorney-client privilege. R.C. 149.43(B)(1); <em>Natl. Broadcasting Co., </em>38 Ohio St.3d 79, 526 N.E.2d 786, at paragraph four of the syllabus. By concluding otherwise, the court of appeals erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 24} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment in favor of the city on Anderson\u2019s public-records mandamus claim. Anderson established her entitlement to a writ of mandamus to compel Vermilion to provide her with copies of the nonexempt portions of the requested itemized attorney-billing statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\n<em>Statutory Damages and Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 25} Anderson claims that the court of appeals also erred in denying her request for statutory damages and attorney fees. In assessing this claim, we review whether the court of appeals abused its discretion in denying the request. <em>State ex rel. Patton v. Rhodes, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 182, 2011-Ohio-3093, 950 N.E.2d 965, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 26} The court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s request, because a large part of the requested statements are exempt from disclosure. <em>See State ex rel. Mahajan v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 497, 2010-Ohio-5995, 940 N.E.2d 1280, \u00b6 64 (denying request for statutory damages and attorney fees for reasons including that most of the public-records claims lacked merit). In addition, a well-informed public office could have reasonably believed, based on our decision in <em>Dawson, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 10, 2011-Ohio-6009, 959 N.E.2d 524, at \u00b6 29, that the nonexempt portions of the attorney-billing statements could be withheld from disclosure. <em>See </em>R.C. 149.43(C)(1) and (2); <em>see also State ex rel. Doe v. Smith, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 44, 2009-Ohio-4149, 914 N.E.2d 159, \u00b6 37 and 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">{\u00b6 27} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the city and denying Anderson\u2019s claim for a writ of mandamus. We reverse that portion of the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
