If their plan resulted in \u201csignificantly excessive earnings\u201d compared to similar companies, the utility must return the excess to its customers. R.C. 4928.143(F). In the case below, the Public Utilities Commission found that Columbus Southern Power\u2019s 2009 earnings were significantly excessive by over $42 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">{\u00b6 2} There are three appeals from the order. Columbus Southern Power (\u201cCSP\u201d) asserts that R.C. 4928.143(F) is unconstitutionally vague, and the Ohio Energy Group and the Office of the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel (collectively, \u201cOEG\u201d) and Industrial Energy Users-Ohio (\u201cIEU\u201d) raise different arguments that the commission erred in applying the statute. After careful review of these appeals, we find merit in none of the arguments, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">{\u00b6 3} Ohio requires electric distribution utilities to provide consumers with \u201ca standard service offer of all competitive retail electric services necessary to maintain essential electric service to consumers, including a firm supply of electric generation service.\u201d R.C. 4928.141(A). \u201cThe utility may provide the offer in one of two ways: through a \u2018market rate offer\u2019 under R.C. 4928.142 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>through an \u2018electric security plan\u2019 under R.C. 4928.143.\u201d <em>In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-1788, 947 N.E.2d 655, \u00b6 5. The American Electric Power operating companies, CSP and Ohio Power, chose to provide service under an ESP.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">{\u00b6 4} The statute does not provide a detailed mechanism for establishing rates under an ESP. Plans may contain any number of provisions within a variety of categories so long as the plan is \u201cmore favorable in the aggregate\u201d than the expected results of a market-rate offer. R.C. 4928.143(C)(1). But the statute does contain some limits, one of which is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 4928.143(F) requires the commission annually to consider whether the ESP resulted in \u201csignificantly excessive earnings\u201d compared to companies facing \u201ccomparable\u201d risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">With regard to the provisions that are included in an electric security plan under this section, the commission shall consider, following the end of each annual period of the plan, if any such adjustments resulted in excessive earnings as measured by whether the earned return on common equity of the electric distribution utility is significantly in excess of the return on common equity that was earned during the same period by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure as may be appropriate. Consideration also shall be given to the capital requirements of future committed investments in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 6} The utility bears the \u201cburden of proof for demonstrating that significantly excessive earnings did not occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the commission \u201cfinds that such adjustments, in the aggregate, did result in significantly excessive earnings, it shall require the electric distribution utility to return to consumers the amount of the excess by prospective adjustments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 7} In the case below, the commission reviewed the companies\u2019 2009 earnings. The companies had proposed to exclude from review certain revenue from \u201coff-system sales,\u201d that is, wholesale sales by the companies to nonretail customers. Several intervenors opposed the companies\u2019 analysis. OEG argued that the statute did not permit the commission to exclude any earnings from review. IEU, in contrast, argued that many more items of revenue should have been excluded. And CSP and Ohio Power argued that the statute requiring earnings review was unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 8} The commission rejected all of these challenges. On the merits, the commission eliminated the off-system-sales revenue from review. Pub. Util. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Comm. No. 10-1261-EL-UNC (Jan. 11, 2011) (the \u201corder\u201d) at 27-30. After making this adjustment, it found that Ohio Power \u201cdid not have significantly excessive earnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. CSP, on the other hand, was found to have had over $42 million in significantly excessive earnings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 9} IEU and OEG appealed, and CSP filed a cross-appeal. The Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy filed an amicus brief, as did the FirstEnergy operating companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 10} This case presents three separate appeals. CSP raises a constitutional, void-for-vagueness challenge; OEG and IEU raise different arguments, each asserting that the commission misapplied the statute. We consider CSP\u2019s constitutional argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">CSP\u2019s Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 11} CSP offers a single argument for overturning the order \u2014 that the statute requiring earnings review, R.C. 4928.143(F), is unconstitutionally vague. According to CSP, that section \u201cfails to provide electric distribution utilities with fair notice, or the commission with meaningful standards, as to what is meant by \u2018significantly excessive earnings.\u2019 \u201d CSP is incorrect, and we hold that the statute is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">I. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">{\u00b6 12} First, as a general matter, CSP bears a heavy burden of proof in challenging the constitutionality of an Ohio statute. CSP must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>Arnold v. Cleveland,, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 35, 38-39, 616 N.E.2d 163 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">{\u00b6 13} CSP\u2019s vagueness challenge faces an uphill climb for another reason. Tolerance for vagueness \u201cdepends in part on the nature of the enactment.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). Some statutes trigger relatively strict vagueness review, such as eminent-domain statutes, <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, \u00b6 88, statutes imposing criminal sanctions, <em>Roark &amp; Hardee L.P. v. Austin, </em>522 F.3d 533, 552 (5th Cir.2008), and statutes implicating constitutionally protected rights, <em>Columbia Gas Transm. Corp. v. Levin, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 122, 2008-Ohio-511, 882 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">{\u00b6 14} In contrast, \u201claws directed to economic matters are subject to a less strict vagueness test than laws interfering with the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>Id.; see also, e.g., Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 498 (\u201ceconomic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test * * * \u201d). That is, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cgreater degree of ambiguity will be tolerated in statutes which * * * merely impose civil, as opposed to criminal penalties\u201d and \u201cwhen the statute regulates the conduct of businesses.\u201d <em>Big Bear Super Market No. 8 v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>913 F.2d 754, 757 (9th Cir.1990). <em>Compare United States v. Dimitrov, </em>546 F.3d 409, 414 (7th Cir.2008) (upholding a statute imposing criminal sanctions when a defendant \u201coperated his business in a highly regulated industry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 4928.143(F) is a civil statute directed to economic matters in a highly regulated industry, and it does not implicate any constitutionally protected conduct. Therefore, we apply a less strict vagueness test.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 16} CSP rejoins that <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, requires heightened scrutiny here because this case involves \u201cthe taking of private property rights.\u201d We did not formulate our holding in <em>Norwood </em>so broadly, however. We held that heightened scrutiny applies \u201cwhen a court reviews an eminent-domain statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 88. CSP makes no express argument that R.C. 4928.143(F) qualifies as \u201can eminent-domain statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 17} <em>Norwood </em>does not require heightened scrutiny here. In that case, we analyzed a law providing for the physical appropriation of real estate for public use, not a law (like this one) that imposes a monetary assessment. Whether such a law causes a taking is a difficult question, and CSP does not address it. <em>See, e.g., McCarthy v. Cleveland, </em>626 F.3d 280, 285 (6th Cir.2010) (\u201call circuits that have addressed the issue have uniformly found that a taking does not occur when the statute in question imposes a monetary assessment that does not affect a specific interest in property\u201d); <em>see also Swisher Intematl., Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1057 (11th Cir.2008), citing <em>E. Ents. v. Apfel, </em>524 U.S. 498, 118 S.Ct. 2131, 141 L.Ed.2d 451 (1998) (\u201cFive Supreme Court Justices have expressed the view that the Takings Clause does not apply where there is a mere general liability * * * and where the challenge seeks to invalidate the statute rather than merely seeking compensation for an otherwise proper taking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 18} We did not address that question in <em>Norwood, </em>but we did address whether heightened scrutiny applied to civil penalties, and the answer was no: \u201c[Regulations that are directed to economic matters and impose only civil penalties are subject to a \u2018less strict vagueness test.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, at \u00b6 85, quoting <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362. This language describes R.C. 4928.143(F), so <em>Norwood </em>does not require stricter scrutiny here.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">II. R.C. 4928.143(F) is not unconstitutionally vague</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 19} Having established that a more lenient standard of review applies, we now address the merits of CSP\u2019s vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>{\u00b6 20} The void-for-vagueness doctrine is a component of the right to due process and is rooted in concerns that laws provide fair notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement. <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2933, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010). To prevail, a challenging party \u201cmust show that the statute is vague \u2018not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>57 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224 (1991), quoting <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971). \u201cMany statutes * * * require administrative and judicial construction to clarify specific language. Such statutes are not unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>Minnesota ex rel. Alexander v. Block, </em>660 F.2d 1240, 1255 (8th Cir.1981), fn. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\n<em>A. We consider CSP\u2019s constitutional challenge as applied to the facts of this case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 21} Litigants may challenge the constitutionality of a statute on its face or as applied. CSP claims that R.C. 4928.143(F) cannot withstand scrutiny, either on its face or as applied. Yet CSP does not make clear which type of challenge it brings. We need not determine, however, whether the challenge is facial or as applied, because the only challenge available to CSP in this case is an as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 22} Generally, a court examining a facial-vagueness challenge to a statute that implicates no constitutionally protected conduct will uphold that challenge only if the statute is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. <em>Columbia Gas Transm. Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 122, 2008-Ohio-511, 882 N.E.2d 400, \u00b6 43, citing <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 494-495, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362. CSP has not presented the arguments necessary to support a facial challenge. It does not argue that R.C. 4928.143(F) is \u201cimpermissibly vague in all of its applications.\u201d Nor does CSP offer any argument that the statute implicates any constitutionally protected conduct. Moreover, where, as in this case, a vagueness challenge does not involve the First Amendment, the analysis must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand. <em>United States v. Mazurie, </em>419 U.S. 544, 550, 95 S.Ct. 710, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975); <em>United States v. Wayerski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1347 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cWhere * * * a vagueness challenge does not involve the First Amendment, the analysis must be as applied to the facts of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 23} That being the case, we \u201cconsider whether [the] statute is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue.\u201d <em>Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2705, 2718-2719, 177 L.Ed.2d 355 (2010); <em>see also Hoffman Estates </em>at 495 (a party \u201cwho engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of others\u201d); <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 608, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973) (\u201ceven if the outermost boundaries of [a statute are] imprecise, any such uncertainty has little relevance * * * where appellants\u2019 conduct falls squarely within the \u2018hard core\u2019 of the statute\u2019s proscriptions and appellants concede as much\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\n<em>B. CSP has not shown that R.C. 4928.143(F) is vague as applied to the facts of this case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 24} CSP has not shown that the \u201cstatute is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue.\u201d <em>Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. at 2718-2719, 177 L.Ed.2d 355. The company has not challenged any of the commission\u2019s determinations under R.C. 4928.143(F): not the calculation of CSP\u2019s return on equity, not the selection of the peer group, and not whether its return significantly exceeded that of the peer group. The commission in fact adopted CSP\u2019s proposed return on equity and proposed peer group. And CSP does not even assert, much less demonstrate, that the commission erred in finding that CSP\u2019s return on equity significantly exceeded that of comparable companies. CSP\u2019s silence on these points is significant. CSP cannot prevail on an as-applied challenge when it does not argue that the statute was erroneously applied to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\n<em>C. R.C. 4928.143(F) provides substantial guidance to the commission</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">{\u00b6 25} And even leaving aside the lack of an as-applied argument, we find that the statute provides considerable guidance to the commission. The company asserts that R.C. 4928.143(F) gives \u201cno notice or guidance as to what is meant by \u2018significantly excessive earning\u2019 and how that determination is to be made.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">{\u00b6 26} Whether a plan \u201cresulted in excessive earnings\u201d must be \u201cmeasured by whether the earned return on common equity of the electric distribution utility is significantly in excess of the return on common equity that was earned during the same period by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure as may be appropriate.\u201d R.C. 4928.143(F). These are not meaningless words, and they provide a substantial amount of guidance on how to determine significantly excessive earnings. The commission must calculate CSP\u2019s \u201cearned return on common equity,\u201d determine a comparable group of publicly traded companies (which itself would require numerous other analyses), and then compare their earned returns on equity over the same period of time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">{\u00b6 27} Having done all that, it must then determine whether CSP\u2019s earnings are \u201csignificantly excessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The term \u201csignificantly\u201d also provides guidance. In context, \u201csignificant\u201d denotes \u201cweighty\u201d or \u201cnotable,\u201d which tells the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>commission to look for more than a mere arithmetical excess before returning funds to customers. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2116 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 28} Despite fixing its argument on the term \u201csignificantly,\u201d CSP cites no case law evaluating its use. But many courts have upheld the term against vagueness challenges. <em>E.g., VIP of Berlin, L.L.C. v. Berlin, </em>593 F.3d 179, 186-191 (2d Cir.2010) (rejecting claim that \u201csignificant portion\u201d is unconstitutionally vague); <em>Williams v. Astrue, </em>D.Kansas No. 09-1341-SAC, 2010 WL 4291918, at *4 (Oct. 26, 2010) (holding in review of benefits order that \u201cthe word \u2018significant\u2019 is not unduly vague\u201d); <em>PrimeCo Personal Communications, L.P. v. Illinois Commerce Comm., </em>Ill.Cir.Ct., Cook Cty. No. 98 CH 05500, 2000 WL 34016430, at *17 (Jan. 11, 2000) (the phrase \u201cno significant impact on the net income\u201d is not vague); <em>Pennsylvania v. Fahy, </em>512 Pa. 298, 315, 516 A.2d 689 (1986) (rejecting claim that the term \u201csignificant history\u201d is vague and overbroad); <em>F. Ronci Co., Inc. v. Narragansett Bay Water Quality Mgt. Dist. Comm., </em>R.I. Sup.Ct. No. C.A. NO. 87-0428, 1988 WL 1016804, at *4 (Feb. 9, 1988) (\u201cThe Court concludes that the use of the term \u2018significant quantities\u2019 does not render the statutory language unconstitutionally vague\u201d); <em>but see, e.g., Knoxville v. Entertainment Resources, L.L.C., </em>166 S.W.3d 650, 652, 658 (Tenn.2005) (holding in case involving First Amendment concerns that \u201cthe phrase \u2018substantial or significant portion of its stock and [sic] trade\u2019 is impermissibly vague\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 29} All of these required determinations limit the scope of the commission\u2019s analysis. Further, they provide numerous points that may be litigated below and challenged on appeal to provide a check on arbitrary enforcement by the commission. <em>See Skilling, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 2933, 177 L.Ed.2d 619. In making its argument, CSP repeatedly quotes only two or three words of the statute (\u201csignificantly excessive earnings\u201d) as though it provided none of the foregoing guidance. But the statute says much more, and we cannot say that \u201c \u2018no standard of conduct is specified at all.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson, </em>57 Ohio St.3d at 171, 566 N.E.2d 1224, quoting <em>Coates, </em>402 U.S. at 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"AR1h\">\n<em>D. There are no \u201cfair notice\u201d concerns in this case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 30} We also hold that this case presents no concerns about fair notice. A primary concern underpinning the vagueness doctrine is that \u201c \u2018[v]ague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoffman Estates, </em>455 U.S. at 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, quoting <em>Grayned v. Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.E.2d 222 (1972). CSP cannot credibly complain that it lacked notice; it not only had notice of R.C. 4928.143(F), but <em>chose </em>to be subject to it. Under R.C. 4928.141, CSP was required to provide a standard service offer \u201cin accordance with section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code.\u201d Only the latter section requires excessive-earnings review; the former establishes market-based rates. The law has contained the earnings-review provision from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>beginning, so CSP was on notice that it faced such review if it opted for an ESP. Presumably, the potential reward outweighed the risk. Thus, CSP\u2019s choice to subject itself to earnings review undermines any argument that it lacked fair notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">III. CSP\u2019s counterarguments</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 31} CSP raises several counterarguments, but we find them unpersuasive. First, it cites no cases reviewing public-utility-regulatory statutes, but depends entirely on cases that involved relatively strict scrutiny and thus are not on point. Most of the cited cases reviewed statutes imposing criminal penalties, and all required a stricter standard of review than applicable here. <em>See Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., </em>274 U.S. 445, 453-454, 47 S.Ct. 681, 71 L.Ed. 1146 (1927); <em>Belle Maer Harbor v. Charter Twp. of Harrison, </em>170 F.3d 553, 557 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Carter v. Welles-Bowen Realty, Inc., </em>719 F.Supp.2d 846, 852 (N.D.Ohio, 2010); <em>Norwood v.

But this point is unavailing. Courts have often recognized that a \u201cprocess of interpretation\u201d should be allowed to flesh out statutory standards. <em>E.g., Bauer v. Shepard, </em>620 F.3d 704, 717 (7th Cir.2010) (the Supreme Court is \u201cchary of holding laws unconstitutional \u2018on their face\u2019 precisely because they have recognized that vagueness will be reduced through a process of interpretation\u201d); <em>Minnesota ex rel. Alexander v. Block, </em>660 F.2d at 1254, fn. 35 (\u201cMany statutes * * * require administrative and judicial construction to clarify specific language. Such statutes are not unconstitutionally vague\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 33} Finally, CSP concludes its argument by asserting that several features of R.C. 4928.143(F) compound the vagueness of the statute. But CSP provides no legal authority or argument suggesting that any of these features are unlawful or otherwise relevant to the void-for-vagueness analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 34} In sum, we reject CSP\u2019s argument that R.C. 4928.143(F) is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">IEU\u2019s and OEG\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">{\u00b6 35} We turn to the remaining two appeals from OEG and IEU. Both concern the commission\u2019s ability to adjust the utility\u2019s earnings before considering whether those earnings are significantly excessive. The commission removed certain revenue from off-system sales from CSP\u2019s earnings. Although OEG and IEU raise different (and in some ways opposite) arguments, we must reject both of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>I. We defer to the commission\u2019s reasonable interpretation of R.C. 4928.143(F)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 36} While we generally review questions of law de novo, we will defer to the commission\u2019s interpretation of a statute \u201cwhere there exists disparate competence between the respective tribunals in dealing with highly specialized issues.\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 388 N.E.2d 1370 (1979). One area in which we have \u201cconsistently deferred to the expertise of the commission\u201d is in determining rate-of-return matters. <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>63 Ohio St.3d 555, 561, 589 N.E.2d 1292 (1992), fn. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cLimited judicial review of a rate of return determination is sound\u201d because \u201c \u2018cost of capital analyses * * * are fraught with judgments and assumptions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>64 Ohio St.2d 71, 79, 413 N.E.2d 799 (1980), quoting <em>In re Dayton Power &amp; Light Co., </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 78-92-EL-AIR, at 26, 29 P.U.R.4th 145 (Mar. 9, 1979). Thus, if a related determination is \u201cfraught with similar judgments and assumptions,\u201d it is \u201cappropriate to apply a similar limited standard of review.\u201d <em>Id.; see also, e.g., Ohio Fuel Gas Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>174 Ohio St. 585, 602, 191 N.E.2d 347 (1963) (\u201cIn the end, the increase in earnings and rate of return allowed is a judgment figure established by the Public Utilities Commission in the exercise of its administrative <em>expertise </em>\u201d [emphasis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 38} The statute under review is essentially a rate-of-return statute, and it requires numerous judgments regarding rate-of-return issues, so we review the commission\u2019s interpretations deferentially. Although R.C. 4928.143(F) does not require the commission to actually set the utility\u2019s rate of return, it does require the commission to make numerous related determinations, and the statute as a whole entrusts the commission with regulating \u201cthe increase in earnings and rate of return [to be] allowed.\u201d <em>Ohio Fuel Gas Co., </em>174 Ohio St. at 602. Thus, in accordance with the cases cited above, we will defer to the commission\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4928.143(F) if it is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 39} We hold that it was. The commission explains in its brief that it understands R.C. 4928.143(F) as requiring it to \u201cdo three things.\u201d \u201cFirst it needs to determine what level of earnings is \u2018excessive.\u2019 \u201d Second, \u201cit must decide how high the excessive earnings must be to be considered \u2018significantly excessive.\u2019 \u201d Finally, it \u201cmust eliminate\u201d from earnings any portion that the utility \u201chas shown not to be tied to the ESP that is being reviewed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 40} This is a reasonable interpretation of R.C. 4928.143(F). The statute expressly requires the first two determinations. And the third point (eliminating earnings not shown \u201cto be tied to the ESP\u201d) finds support in the statutory language. The statute requires the commission to find whether \u201csuch adjustments\u201d \u2014 referring to \u201cthe provisions that are included in an electric security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>plan\u201d </em>\u2014 \u201cresulted <em>in </em>excessive earnings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4928.143(F). This implies that earnings <em>not caused by </em>the plan may be excluded from consideration. This statutory language supports the commission\u2019s reading, and no other part of the statute expressly contradicts it.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">II. OEG\u2019s alternative interpretation of R.C. 4928.143(F) does not compel reversal</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 41} In its appeal, OEG argues that contrary to the commission\u2019s interpretation, the commission cannot eliminate any earnings before conducting the earnings review. As noted above, the commission eliminated from CSP\u2019s earnings certain revenue from \u201coff-system sales,\u201d that is, wholesale sales by CSP to nonretail customers. Order at 27-30. According to OEG, this lowered CSP\u2019s excess earnings by $22.24 million.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> OEG argues that \u201cR.C. 4928.143(F) requires the [commission] to compare <em>all </em>of a utility\u2019s earnings to <em>all </em>of the earnings of companies with comparable risk.\u201d (Emphases sic.) In its view, \u201cthe statutory language does not permit the [commission] to selectively exclude certain utility earnings for purposes of the [excessive-earnings] comparison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 42} But as just discussed, the statutory language does allow such an inference and does not definitively prohibit it. It does not expressly forbid adjustments for non-ESP earnings, nor does it use the phrase \u201call earnings\u201d or some equivalent. OEG\u2019s interpretation is not necessarily unreasonable, but unlike the commission\u2019s, OEG\u2019s is not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 43} We must reject OEG\u2019s challenge to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">III. lEU\u2019s counterarguments also lack merit</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 44} IEU raises two basic arguments, but neither compels reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">A. In its first argument, IEU fails to show prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">{\u00b6 45} Whereas OEG argues that the commission should not have excluded any earnings from review, IEU argues that the commission should have excluded more. As IEU sees it, the commission may consider the companies\u2019 earned return on equity only \u201cfrom the ESP\u201d and not \u201cfor all lines of regulated and unregulated businesses that reside within [the companies].\u201d Therefore, IEU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>argues, CSP should have prepared \u201ca comprehensive jurisdictional allocation study\u201d showing what earnings resulted from the ESP and what did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 46} IEU has failed to show prejudice, as it must to warrant reversal. <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 362, 2009-Ohio-604, 904 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 12 (\u201cthis court will not reverse a commission order absent a showing by the appellant that it has been or will be harmed or prejudiced by the order\u201d). In this proposition, IEU neither explains nor provides evidence of which adjustments the commission should have made but did not. This lack of evidence and explanation makes it impossible to know whether IEU was prejudiced by the alleged failure to \u201cjurisdictionalize\u201d CSP\u2019s earnings. Consequently, we must reject IEU\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">B. IEU\u2019s second argument \u2014 that the commission should have eliminated CSP\u2019s transmission assets from review \u2014 also fails to demonstrate error</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 47} IEU\u2019s second argument alleges that the commission should have excluded transmission assets when it excluded CSP\u2019s revenue from off-system sales. For any revenue excluded from review, it would be necessary to exclude the related portion of equity (i.e., the assets that earned the excluded return). Failing to do so would skew the rate of return too low. The commission did exclude some of CSP\u2019s equity to reflect the exclusion of off-system sales, order at 30, but IEU asserts that the commission did not remove enough equity \u2014 that it did not \u201cinclude[ ] an adjustment to equity to transmission plant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 48} Because this argument is also speculative, we must reject it. IEU\u2019s argument turns on two questions of fact, both demanding substantial expertise in utility operations, accounting, and finance to answer: Should any of CSP\u2019s transmission assets have been excluded to reflect the exclusion of earnings from off-system sales? And if so, how much? Yet IEU does not point to any testimony or other evidence suggesting that such an exclusion would have been appropriate. Without this factual support, its argument cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 49} In fact, the testimony that IEU does cite cuts <em>against </em>its argument on both points. As to the first point \u2014 whether there should even be any exclusion of transmission assets \u2014 the witness cited by IEU stated on cross-examination, \u201c[TJhere\u2019s no way I could even begin to imagine how I would say that [transmission] is a component of off-system sales,\u201d and also stated that he suspected that \u201ctransmission costs are * * * netted out of the profits from off-system sales.\u201d As to the second point \u2014 what specific exclusion would be appropriate- \u2014 the same witness suggested that calculating an adjustment would not be workable: he \u201ccould not figure out a way of cleanly * * * utilizing other aspects of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>company\u2019s assets,\u201d such as transmission assets, in excluding the assets from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">{\u00b6 50} IEU also cites the testimony of an American Electric Power witness who acknowledged that the company had not \u201cexclude[d] the earnings associated with the transmission business.\u201d This says nothing about whether such an exclusion should have been made and, if so, the amount. Thus, it provides no support for IEU\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6 51} To overturn the commission on a question of fact, IEU must show that the order is \u201cso clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>88 Ohio St.3d 549, 555, 728 N.E.2d 371 (2000). IEU has not shown that the order lacked record support; indeed, the only evidence IEU cites contradicts its own argument. Therefore, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 52} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order. Contrary to CSP\u2019s assertion, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. And neither OEG nor IEU has shown that the commission unreasonably interpreted or applied R.C. 4928.143(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b505-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-13\">. In agreeing to eliminate the off-system sales, the commission also noted, but did not resolve, arguments raised by CSP that federal law prohibited the commission from counting the off-system sales.

Through the SEET, the commission is to determine how much is too much for electric utilities to charge Ohio consumers pursuant to an electric security plan (\u201cESP\u201d). It is a determination made after the fact, after consumers have paid their bills, in seeming adherence to the aphorism \u201cIt is better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.\u201d But the return on investment that the commission allows in this case is not forgivable. It should not be ratified by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-14\">{\u00b6 54} This case tests whether the commission\u2019s discretion on SEET matters is truly susceptible of meaningful judicial review. This court cannot allow its deference to the commission\u2019s discretion to become an abdication of our duty to provide appellate review of the commission\u2019s orders. The commission\u2019s outra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>geous order in this case indicates that the commission believes that its orders have no requirement of reasonableness and that it has carte blanche to interpret statutes as it sees fit. But it is answerable to this court in applying laws passed by the General Assembly and is ultimately statutorily responsible to consumers to provide electric service for reasonable rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">{\u00b6 55} Columbus Southern Power (\u201cCSP\u201d) requests that this court overturn the commission\u2019s order in this case because, it argues, R.C. 4928.143(F) is unconstitutionally vague. We should overturn the commission\u2019s entire order, but not for the reason CSP suggests. Instead, we should hold that the commission abused its discretion in establishing a SEET threshold of 17.6 percent and, further, misapplied R.C. 4928.143(F) by removing off-system sales from its calculation of CSP\u2019s income. The commission should start from scratch in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The Reasonableness of 17.6 Percent</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 56} In this case, the commission determined CSP\u2019s SEET threshold to be 17.6 percent. That is, only a return on investment of more than 17.6 percent in 2009, a year when the United States\u2019 economy was in a recession, would be considered significantly excessive in comparison to other similarly situated entities. Only at that number would CSP\u2019s profit be enough to trigger a refund to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 57} How did the commission get to 17.6 percent? By employing the highly complex statistical analysis known as \u201csplitting the baby.\u201d As the commission points out in its order, AEP-Ohio argued for a SEET threshold of 22.51 percent. The customer parties in the case put forth a proposed SEET threshold in the range of 11.58 percent to 13.58 percent, an average of 12.58 percent. With those numbers to work with, the commission apparently raced to the middle: the halfway point between the proposed SEETs of the customer parties and AEP-Ohio is 17.545 percent. AEP-Ohio got the .055 percent round-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 58} This might be all well and good were the numbers reflective of equally valid methodologies. But the commission\u2019s judgments before and after the case at issue support the number put forth by the customer parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 59} After the passage of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 221, the commission sought input from stakeholders to determine the methodology for determining what constitutes significantly excessive earnings. After a long process from October 2009 through April 2010 that included a workshop, a comment period, a period to reply to comments, and a question-and-answer period before the commission, the commission produced <em>In re Investigation into the Development of the Significantly Excessive Earnings Test Pursuant to Amended Substitute Senate Bill for Electric Utilities, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 09-786-EL-UNC, a finding and order intended to provide guidance on the interpretation and application of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>4928.142(D)(4), 4928.143(E), and 4928.143(F). After reviewing the input from interested parties, the commission came to the following conclusion regarding how to determine whether a utility\u2019s earnings are significantly excessive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Having fully considered all the comments regarding establishing the threshold and in consideration of the discretion afforded the Commission in SB 221, the Commission concludes that \u201csignificantly excessive earnings\u201d should be determined based on the reasonable judgment of the Commission on a case-by-case basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">09-786-EL-UNC Finding and Order, 28-29. So much for predictability.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 60} Despite leaving the matter up to itself and its own judgment, the commission did set one important marker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">[T]he Commission is willing to recognize a \u201csafe harbor\u201d of 200 basis points above the mean in the comparable group. To that end, any electric utility earning less than 200 basis points above the mean of the comparable group will be found to not have significantly excessive earnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 61} It was that 200 basis points \u201csafe harbor\u201d that the customer parties based their excessive-earnings conclusion upon. Taking their calculation of a relevant return on investment of 9.58 percent for a comparable group of companies, they argued that significantly excessive earnings should run from the safe-harbor amount of 200 basis points up to 400 basis points. This would mean that significantly excessive earnings would fall somewhere between 11.58 and 13.58 percent. Instead, the commission established a figure 800 basis points above the figure that the customer parties determined as the mean of the comparable group of companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">{\u00b6 62} Even accepting the commission\u2019s return-on-investment figure of 11 percent for comparable companies, the commission\u2019s 17.6 percent figure is over 600 basis points above the mean in the comparable group. The commission blew its safe harbor out of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">{\u00b6 63} And in a case announced in August of this year, <em>In re Columbus S. Power Co., </em>Pub. Util. Comm. Nos. 11-346-EL-SSO, 11-348-EL-SSO, 11-349-EL-AAM, and 11-350-EL-AAM, 2012 WL 3542177, *30 (Aug. 8, 2012), the commission prospectively set a SEET threshold at 12 percent for AEP-Ohio, finding it \u201cappropriate to establish a significantly excessive earnings test (SEET) threshold to ensure that the Company does not reap disproportionate benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>from the ESP. The evidence in the record demonstrates that a 12 percent [return on equity] would be at the high end of a reasonable range for return on equity * * *. Accordingly, for purposes of this ESP, the Commission will establish a SEET threshold for AEP-Ohio of 12 percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 64} That lower rate of return is appropriate for an industry with minimal risk, with built-in methods to recover costs from their customers. In <em>In re Columbus S. Power Co. </em>(Aug. 8, 2012), for instance, built-in protections for the utility include an alternative-energy rider, a generation-resource rider, a retail-stability rider, a distribution-investment rider, a pool-modification rider, a phase-in recovery rider, a transmission-cost-recovery rider, an enhanced-service reliability rider, an energy-efficiency and peak-demand reduction rider, an economic-development rider, and a storm-damage-recovery mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 65} Most importantly, the lower SEET is consistent with the policy of this state to \u201c[e]nsure the availability to consumers of adequate, reliable, safe, efficient, nondiscriminatory, and reasonably priced retail electric service.\u201d R.C. 4928.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Off-System Sales</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">{\u00b6 66} The commission also erred in excluding CSP\u2019s off-system sales from the calculation of its return on investment, without any statutory authority. This court has \u201ccomplete and independent power of review as to all questions of law\u201d in appeals from the commission. <em>Ohio Edison Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 78 </em>Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922 (1997). We should not forget that. This court has held that in matters of statutory interpretation, \u201cwe may rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where \u2018highly specialized issues\u2019 are involved and \u2018where agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 300, 2006-Ohio-5789, 856 N.E.2d 213, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 388 N.E.2d 1370 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">{\u00b6 67} This is not a case in which this court needs to rely on the commission\u2019s interpretation of a statute. Indeed, we should not simply assume that any statute involving public utilities concerns \u201chighly specialized issues.\u201d Here, the General Assembly spells out in plain English what it means by \u201cexcessive earnings.\u201d Excessive earnings are \u201cmeasured by whether the earned return on common equity of the electric distribution utility is significantly in excess of the return on common equity that was earned during the same period by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure as may be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AX7p\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>McNees, Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Nurick, L.L.C., Samuel C.

They were, after all, earnings. The statute does not allow for removing any amount of income \u2014 either from the utility at issue or from the comparable publicly traded companies \u2014 from the assessment. The statute seeks an \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison; taking a few slices out of the Ohio utility\u2019s apples skews the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">{\u00b6 69} Our deference to \u2014 or, too often, our reliance on \u2014 the commission\u2019s interpretation of statutes diminishes this court\u2019s role in reviewing the commission\u2019s determinations and shifts the balance too far in favor of the executive branch in the separation of powers. Ultimately, Ohio consumers pay the price for that deference.
