On December 1, 2011, the court granted a writ of mandamus \u201cto compel respondents to commence appropriation proceedings to determine the amount of their taking of the property.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Doner v. Zody, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 446, 2011-Ohio-6117, 958 N.E.2d 1235, \u00b6 86. In a writ issued by the court that same day, respondents were ordered to comply with the court\u2019s order \u201cimmediately upon receipt of the writ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 2} Following failed settlement negotiations, the state filed appropriation cases for the property of relators the Doners and the Ebbings. On September 6, 2012, all of the relators with the exception of the Doners and the Ebbings filed a motion for an order for respondents to show cause why they should not be held in contempt of the court\u2019s December 1, 2011 writ of mandamus. We granted the motion and scheduled a show-cause hearing for December 4, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 3} Upon considering the parties\u2019 evidence and arguments, we hold that relators have established by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that respondents are in contempt of the court\u2019s December 1, 2011 writ. <em>See Pugh v. Pugh, 15 </em>Ohio St.3d 136, 139, 472 N.E.2d 1085 (1984). We order respondents <em>to </em>complete all appraisals on relators\u2019 parcels for the 2003-flood-level cases within 90 days and to file all appropriation cases for these parcels within 120 days. For the remaining 20 parcels that respondents claim they have not yet surveyed because they involve flooding above the 2003 flood level, respondents are ordered to institute declaratory-judgment actions in the Mercer County Common Pleas Court within 30 days to determine the legal rights of the parties for those parcels. We deny relators\u2019 request for attorney fees and for a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b429-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Belfance, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b429-13\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b429-14\">Eve V.

Executive 200, Inc., </em>64 Ohio St.2d 250, 253, 416 N.E.2d 610 (1980). I would find that relators have failed to meet their burden of proof. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 5} While respondents may be proceeding at a pace that is unacceptable to relators, our only mandate to respondents was to proceed \u201cimmediately.\u201d We did not set forth any guidelines, let alone a deadline, as to when the appropriations must be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 6} Respondents have hired surveyors and property appraisers. The surveyors have begun surveying the properties at issue, and the appraisers have begun appraising the properties as the surveys are completed. Both are necessary for appropriation proceedings. Further, respondents attempted to negotiate a global settlement with relators, albeit without success. This hardly constitutes clear and convincing evidence that respondents are in contempt of the writ merely because they are proceeding at a pace that is slower than relators and the court desire. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-7\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
