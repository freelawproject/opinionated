CEI and Ohio Edison (collectively, the \u201ccompanies\u201d) are wholly owned subsidiaries of appellant First-Energy Corporation, which is not a public utility. The appellees are residential customers of CEI and Ohio Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">{\u00b6 2} The customers filed a class-action complaint against FirstEnergy and the companies in the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint raised four causes of action: (1) declaratory judgment, (2) breach of contract, (3) fraud, and (4) injunctive relief. The customers alleged that the companies promised to charge them a discounted rate for electricity if they purchased all-electric homes or equipped their homes with electrical heating systems and appliances. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>customers further alleged that the companies guaranteed the discounted rate for as long as the customers maintained their all-electric status. The customers contend that the companies unilaterally terminated the discount rates in May 2009 and that they now pay a higher rate for electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 3} The sole issue before this court is whether the customers properly filed their fraud claim in the common pleas court or whether that claim should have been filed with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (the \u201cCommission\u201d or \u201cPUCO\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we find that the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the allegations of fraud set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 4} In 1974, the companies implemented commission-approved special discount rates for certain of their customers. Residential customers who used electricity as their main source of energy were charged rates lower than those paid by the companies\u2019 standard-service residential customers. The companies\u2019 all-electric rate schedules used a \u201cdeclining block rate structure,\u201d a rate design that encouraged customers to use more electricity because the customer\u2019s rate declined with greater energy usage. <em>See In re Application of Ohio Edison et al. for Approval of a New Rider &amp; Revision of an Existing Rider, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 10-176-EL-ATA, at 2 (May 25, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 5} In 2006, the commission approved FirstEnergy\u2019s rate-certainty plan. The approved plan included a provision that certain all-electric rate discounts would no longer be available to new customers or new premises beginning in January 2007. Existing all-electric customers were, however, allowed to continue to receive discounted rates. The commission stated that the purpose of discontinuing the all-electric rate schedules for new customers and premises was to promote energy conservation by eliminating rate discounts to customers who use large amounts of electricity. <em>In re FirstEnergy, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 05-1125-EL-ATA, Rehearing Entry, at 7-9 (Mar. 1, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 6} In January 2009, the commission issued an order in FirstEnergy\u2019s most recent distribution rate case. <em>In re FirstEnergy, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 07-551-EL-AIR (Jan. 21, 2009). At that time, CEI had 12 residential distribution rate schedules and Ohio Edison had 7. The commission approved the consolidation of these different rate schedules into one residential distribution rate for each company. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. The consolidation, however, harmed some all-electric customers because it removed the substantial discounts they were receiving on their winter heating rates. To mitigate the rate increase, the commission approved a rate credit (Rider RDC) for these customers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">{\u00b6 7} In March 2009, the commission issued its second order in FirstEnergy\u2019s first electric-security-plan case. <em>In re FirstEnergy, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 08-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>935-EL-SSO (Mar. 25, 2009). In order to create a generation rate structure similar to the consolidated distribution rate structure approved in January, the commission consolidated the companies\u2019 various residential generation rate schedules into a single generation rate schedule for each company. Like the consolidation of the distribution rate schedules, this consolidation increased the rate for a number of customers receiving discounted service under the all-electric residential rate schedules. The commission therefore approved another residential rate credit (Rider EDR) to mitigate the effect. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10; No. 10-176-EL-ATA, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">{\u00b6 8} In addition, in FirstEnergy\u2019s second electric-security-plan case, the commission ordered that Rider EDR be extended until May 31, 2014. <em>In re FirstEnergy, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 10-388-EL-SSO (Aug. 25, 2010); No. 10-176-EL-ATA, at 3. In sum, the distribution and generation credit riders amounted to a total rate discount of approximately 3.6 cents per kilowatt hour. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 9} Despite these discounts, there was substantial public concern during the 2009-2010 winter heating season regarding the bills of all-electric residential customers. In order to provide rate relief to residential customers who were harmed by the rate-schedule consolidations, FirstEnergy filed an application with the commission on February 12, 2010, to revise its current tariffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 10} Four days later, on February 16, 2010, the customers filed the underlying complaint against FirstEnergy and the companies in the common pleas court. The customers alleged that the companies had offered to charge them a discounted rate for electricity if they purchased all-electric homes or equipped their homes with electrical heating systems and appliances. According to the customers, the companies guaranteed that the discounted rate would not end as long as they maintained their all-electric status, even if the companies removed the rate from their tariff schedules on file at the PUCO. The customers maintained that they relied on the promised discount and purchased all-electric homes or electrical heating systems and appliances instead of those powered by natural gas or other sources of energy. The customers contend that despite the guaranteed discount, the companies eliminated the discount rate in May 2009, and the customers are now paying a higher rate (four cents or more per kilowatt hour) for electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 11} The complaint raised four causes of action: (1) declaratory judgment, based on an alleged contractual obligation by the companies to permanently provide the discounted rates, (2) breach of contract, based on the companies\u2019 termination of the discounted rates, (3) fraud, for inducing customers to purchase all-electric homes, electrical heating systems, and appliances by falsely representing that reduced rates would be permanent, and (4) injunctive relief, based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>contract and fraud claims, to enjoin the companies from charging customers more than the discounted rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 12} On March 3, 20\u00cd0, the commission issued an order in No. 10-176-EL-ATA approving FirstEnergy\u2019s application with modifications. As it relates to this appeal, the order provided interim rate relief for the companies\u2019 all-electric customers until the commission could determine the best long-term solution to the electricity rate increase brought about by the commission\u2019s orders in First-Energy\u2019s distribution and electric-security-plan eases. Specifically, the commission ordered FirstEnergy to file tariffs for all-electric residential customers that would return their electric rates to December 31, 2008 levels. <em>Id. </em>at 3. First-Energy filed Rider RGC \u2014 which provides another rate credit to electric-heating customers in addition to Riders RDC and EDR \u2014 to comply with the commission\u2019s directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 13} On March 18, 2010, FirstEnergy filed a motion to dismiss the customers\u2019 complaint in the common pleas court under Civ.R. 12(B)(1). The motion asserted that the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims. On September 7, 2010, the trial court granted the motion, finding that the PUCO has exclusive jurisdiction over the allegations in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 14} The customers appealed the trial court\u2019s order on September 29, 2010. While the case was pending before the court of appeals, the commission issued a decision in No. 10-176-EL-ATA that addressed the appropriate long-term rates to be charged to all-electric residential customers of FirstEnergy. The commission ordered that Rider RGC- \u2014 which provided a credit for electric-heating customers to return their rates to 2008 levels \u2014 -would be frozen for two years and then phased out over the following six years. The commission also ordered that the rate credits being provided to FirstEnergy\u2019s electric-heating customers through Riders RDC and EDR would remain unchanged. <em>See </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 10-176-EL-ATA, at 8, 20 (May 25, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 15} On October 21, 2011, the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the customers\u2019 claims for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, and injunctive relief. The court of appeals found that each of these claims stemmed from the companies\u2019 alleged breach of promise to charge a discounted rate and that challenges to rates and rate-related matters are within the exclusive purview of the PUCO. 2011-Ohio-5434, 969 N.E.2d 1241, \u00b6 54-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 16} The appellate court, however, reversed the trial court\u2019s decision that the PUCO had jurisdiction over the customers\u2019 fraud claim. The court of appeals first determined that the trial court had jurisdiction because fraud is a civil action that existed at common law in Ohio. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 55, citing <em>Milligan v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., </em>56 Ohio St.2d 191, 195, 383 N.E.2d 575 (1978). The court also determined that the PUCO\u2019s expertise was not necessary to resolve the fraud claim and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the act complained of was not a practice normally authorized by the utility. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 58-59, citing <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 301, 2008-Ohio-3917, 893 N.E.2d 824. Having determined on two separate grounds that the trial court had jurisdiction over the fraud claim, the court of appeals remanded that claim to the trial court for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">{\u00b6 17} FirstEnergy appealed to this court. We accepted discretionary jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Subject-matter jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 18} The sole question for our consideration is whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the trial court \u2014 instead of the PUCO \u2014 has jurisdiction over the customers\u2019 fraud claim. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 19} The General Assembly enacted R.C. Title 49 to regulate the business activities of public utilities, including the regulation of utility service and the fixing of rates. <em>Kazmaier Supermarket, Inc. v. Toledo Edison Co., </em>61 Ohio St.3d 147, 573 N.E.2d 655 (1991). R.C. 4905.26 confers exclusive jurisdiction on the PUCO to adjudicate complaints filed against public utilities challenging any rate or charge as \u201cunjust, unreasonable, * * * or in violation of law.\u201d <em>See also State ex rel. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 16; <em>State ex rel. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 20} The court of common pleas, however, retains limited subject-matter jurisdiction over pure tort and contract actions involving utilities regulated by the commission. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Edison Co. v. Shaker, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 209, 211, 625 N.E.2d 608 (1994). <em>See Kazmaier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 154, 573 N.E.2d 655 (\u201cpure common-law tort claims may be brought against utilities in the common pleas court\u201d); <em>Milligan v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., </em>56 Ohio St.2d 191, 195, 383 N.E.2d 575 (1978) (claim that telephone company invaded customer\u2019s privacy was actionable in common pleas court); <em>State ex rel. Illum. Co., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 32 (the commission has no jurisdiction over pure contract claims that do not require consideration of R.C. Title 49 or commission regulations). The PUCO is not a court and has no power to ascertain and determine legal rights and liabilities. <em>State ex rel. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. v. Riley, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 168, 170, 373 N.E.2d 385 (1978); <em>New Bremen v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>103 Ohio St. 23, 30-31, 132 N.E. 162 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 21} The question, therefore, is whether the customers\u2019 fraud claim relates to utility rates or service, or whether it is a pure tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The court of appeals\u2019 reliance on <em>Milligan </em>was misplaced</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 22} We first address the court of appeals\u2019 reliance on <em>Milligan v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co., </em>56 Ohio St.2d 191, 383 N.E.2d 575. The court of appeals first held that, pursuant to <em>Milligan, </em>the court of common pleas has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the fraud claim \u201cbecause fraud is a civil action that existed at common law in Ohio.\u201d 2011-Ohio-5434, 969 N.E.2d 1241, at \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 23} This court held in <em>Milligan </em>that a court of common pleas lacks jurisdiction to hear a complaint regarding a utility\u2019s rates and services. <em>Milligan, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. The <em>Milligan </em>court also held that a common pleas court has jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2305.01 to hear a properly stated invasion-of-privacy claim against a public utility. <em>Milligan, </em>paragraph three of the syllabus. Thus, <em>Milligan </em>recognized that \u201cpure common-law tort claims may be brought against utilities in the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Kazmaier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 154, 573 N.E.2d 655. This court did not hold in <em>Milligan, </em>contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 assertion, that the common pleas court has jurisdiction over an action against a utility so long as the action existed at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals relied on the following language from <em>Milligan, </em>56 Ohio St.2d at 195, 383 N.E.2d 575, to support its holding: \u201cWhereas the right of privacy has been recognized as a legal right existing at common law in this state, * * * it follows that the Court of Common Pleas has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2305.01 to hear a complaint alleging a violation of this right by a utility.\u201d 2011-Ohio-5434, 969 N.E.2d 1241, at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 25} Despite this language, the dispute over jurisdiction in <em>Milligan </em>did not turn on the status of the claim as a common-law tort. Rather, jurisdiction over the privacy claim turned on the fact that nothing in the record indicated that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. This court was \u201cnot convinced\u201d that the trial court properly dismissed the privacy claim for lack of jurisdiction because the plaintiff in <em>Milligan </em>had set forth no operative facts regarding his privacy claim. <em>Id. </em>at 195-196. Ohio Bell had likewise provided no evidence to support its Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. In short, the record was silent as to whether the privacy claim involved utility rates or services or whether it was a pure common-law tort. This court, therefore, had no basis to uphold the trial court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">{\u00b6 26} Furthermore, the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of <em>Milligan </em>finds no support in our more recent decisions. We have held in cases involving public utilities that merely casting the allegations in the complaint to sound in tort \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the common pleas court.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 19. <em>See also Hull v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 96, 2006-Ohio-3666, 850 N.E.2d 1190, \u00b6 34 (easting allegations to sound in tort or contract is insufficient to confer jurisdiction on trial court); <em>State ex rel. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 21 (same). Moreover, in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 301, 2008-Ohio-3917, 893 N.E.2d 824, \u00b6 8, we rejected the notion that alleging a common-law tort is sufficient, by itself, to confer jurisdiction upon the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 27} In sum, jurisdiction is not conferred in cases involving public utilities based solely on the form of action. <em>Allstate </em>at \u00b6 8; <em>State ex rel. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 19. Instead, courts must look to the substance of the allegations in the complaint to determine the proper jurisdiction. <em>State ex rel. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Kazmaier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 154, 573 N.E.2d 655. <em>See, e.g., Allstate </em>at \u00b6 14; <em>Henson </em>at \u00b6 20. We therefore find that the court of appeals erred when it held that pursuant to <em>Milligan, </em>the common pleas court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The <em>Allstate </em>test</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals also held that the common pleas court had jurisdiction over the fraud claim pursuant to <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 301, 2008-Ohio-3917, 893 N.E.2d 824. In <em>Allstate, </em>we adopted a two-part test to determine whether the common pleas court or the PUCO has jurisdiction over a tort action against a public utility. Under this test, we ask (1) whether the PUCO\u2019s administrative expertise is required to resolve the issue in dispute and (2) whether the act complained of constitutes a practice normally authorized by the utility. If the answer to either question is \u201cNo,\u201d the claim is not within the PUCO\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The court of appeals erred in applying the <em>Allstate </em>test</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 29} FirstEnergy contends that the court of appeals erred in applying the <em>Allstate </em>test. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Is the commission\u2019s expertise necessary to resolve the issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals determined that the PUCO\u2019s expertise was not necessary to resolve the fraud claim. The court, however, did not explain how it reached that conclusion. 2011-Ohio-5434, 969 N.E.2d 1241, at \u00b6 58. This was error because many of the same determinations that the court of appeals said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>would be necessary to resolve the contract claims \u2014 which the court of appeals determined did require PUCO expertise to resolve \u2014 would be equally necessary to resolve the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 31} Before discussing the fraud claim, the court of appeals determined that the PUCO\u2019s expertise was required to resolve the contract claim because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">decisions would have to be made concerning: (1) whether [the customers] were promised rates that were in violation of the PUCO-approved tariffs or were not authorized by the PUCO; and (2) the amount of the rate overcharge, if any, based on an analysis of the difference between the charges imposed using the former discounted rates and the amounts charged based on the rates, discounts, and credits subsequently imposed after the discount program was eliminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">2011-Ohio-5434, 969 N.E.2d 1241, \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 32} In their fraud claim, the customers allege that the companies (1) deceptively induced them to purchase all-electric homes and appliances by promising them a discounted rate as long as they used electricity as their sole source of energy and (2) eliminated the discounted rate in May 2009 and are charging them a higher rate, even though customers continue to maintain their all-electric status. To prevail, the customers would have to prove, among other things, that the companies guaranteed them a specific discounted rate and that since May 2009, the companies have charged them more than the promised rate. To determine whether the customers are being overcharged will require comparing the discounted rate to the rate charged after May 2009. Such comparisons will in turn require a review of the companies\u2019 various residential rate schedules and customer billing records. And given the PUCO\u2019s authority to set rates and approve tariff schedules, any review will also require analysis of various orders entered by the commission. <em>See generally </em>R.C. 4905.22, 4905.30, and 4905.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 33} Such a review could prove particularly difficult in this case. According to the customers\u2019 complaint, the companies\u2019 fraudulent conduct allegedly lasted nearly 40 years and involved over 60 named plaintiffs. And before the commission consolidated the companies\u2019 residential rate schedules into one schedule in 2009, CEI had 12 residential rate schedules and Ohio Edison had 7. <em>See In re FirstEnergy, </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 07-551-EL-AIR, at 23, fn. 1 (Jan. 21, 2009). Another complicating factor is that the discount rate charged to all-electric customers was not a fixed charge. Under the companies\u2019 rate design for all-electric customers, the rate charged to customers varied depending on the amount of electricity the customer used. <em>See </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 10-176-EL-ATA, at 2 (May 25, 2011) (describing the declining block rate structure). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>any comparison of the discount rate and the postdiscount rate would require a review of charges that varied from month to month based on the amount of electricity a customer used. In addition, beginning in 2009, the commission issued a series of orders that approved rate credits (Riders RDC, EDR, and RGC) for all-electric customers that were designed to mitigate the elimination of the rate discounts. <em>See </em>Pub. Util. Comm. No. 07-551-EL-AIR, at 23-24 (Jan. 21, 2009); No. 08-935-EL-SSO, at 9-10 (Mar. 25, 2009); No. 10-388-EL-SSO (Aug. 25, 2010); and No. 10-176-EL-ATA, at 8, 20 (May 25, 2011). Consideration of these credits would be necessary to decide whether the customers are being overcharged, as they allege, and if so, by how much.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Kazmaier, </em>this court held that the commission\u2019s expertise was required to determine the existence and amount of a rate overcharge, which \u201cwould require an analysis of the rate structure and various charges that were in effect under each of the tariff schedules during the period.\u201d 61 Ohio St.3d at 153, 573 N.E.2d 655. Likewise, the customers\u2019 fraud claim requires a determination whether the companies are overcharging all-electric customers by eliminating the discounted rate. Thus, resolution of the fraud claim in this case requires the same kind of analysis that <em>Kazmaier </em>stated was best accomplished by the PUCO. In short, the commission is the fact-finder best suited to review and analyze various charged rates, rate designs, tariff schedules, and commission orders. We therefore conclude that the commission\u2019s expertise is required to resolve the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Does the act complained of constitute a practice normally authorized by the utility?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 35} As to the second part of the <em>Allstate </em>test, the court of appeals determined that with respect to the fraud claim, the act complained of did not constitute a practice normally authorized by the utility. The court of appeals, however, failed to clearly identify the act of the companies that the customers were complaining of. Nor did the appellate court clearly articulate why that act was not a practice normally engaged in by the companies. 2011-Ohio-5434, 969 N.E.2d 1241, \u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 36} After review of the customers\u2019 complaint, we find that the act complained of here was the companies\u2019 offer to charge a discount rate to customers who used electricity as their main source of energy. Offering special or discounted tariff rates to certain customers is a practice normally engaged in by the utility. In fact, the practice is specifically authorized by statute. R.C. 4905.31, which allows for \u201creasonable arrangement^]\u201d between utilities and customers, permits a public utility to classify its customers for rate-making purposes. R.C. 4905.31 also gives the commission the authority to approve rates tailored to govern a specific customer\u2019s service. <em>See In re Application of Ormet Primary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Aluminum Corp., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 9, 2011-Ohio-2377, 949 N.E.2d 991, \u00b6 1. Likewise, R.C. 4905.33 allows the charging of different or special rates unless the utility is performing \u201ca like and contemporaneous service under substantially the same circumstances and conditions.\u201d And R.C. 4905.35 allows utilities to make or give preferences and advantages to customers, so long as they are not \u201cundue or unreasonable.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Weiss v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>90 Ohio St.3d 15, 734 N.E.2d 775 (2000) (rejecting the argument that the utility\u2019s program \u2014 which charged discount rates only to certain customers located within the utility\u2019s service territory \u2014 violated R.C. 4905.33 and 4905.35).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJe\">Jones Day, David A. Kutik, Jeffrey Saks, and Chad Readier, for appellants, FirstEnergy Corporation, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, and Ohio Edison Company.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">{\u00b6 37} In sum, the statutes and case law do not require absolute uniformity in rates and prices; they allow utilities to charge different and unequal rates so long as there is some actual and measurable difference in the furnishing of services. <em>See Mahoning Cty. Twps. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>58 Ohio St.2d 40, 43-44, 388 N.E.2d 739 (1979). Thus, because the offering of special or discount rates is a practice normally engaged in by public utilities and authorized by the commission, it follows that the commission is best suited to adjudicate any claims regarding the reasonableness and lawfulness of the companies\u2019 offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 38} Based on the foregoing, we find that the customers\u2019 fraud claim is not a pure tort action. The fraud claim is, in essence, a claim that the companies are overcharging the customers for electric service. No matter how their claim is labeled, the customers are challenging the propriety of the rates that the companies are charging for all-electric service. Complaints challenging the rates charged for utility service fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the PUCO. R.C. 4905.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 39} Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the order of the trial court dismissing the fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b255-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b255-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A_H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Michael E.
