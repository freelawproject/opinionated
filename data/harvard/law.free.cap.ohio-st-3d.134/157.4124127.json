On June 17, 2010, we determined that Noel had committed professional misconduct for neglecting entrusted client matters, failing to promptly deliver a client\u2019s file upon request, and failing to cooperate in the disciplinary process. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Noel, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 56, 2010-Ohio-2714, 930 N.E.2d 312. We suspended Noel from the practice of law for two years, with six months stayed, on the conditions that he commit no further misconduct and complete a law-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>office-management course. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. Noel\u2019s term of suspension has expired, but he has not applied for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">{\u00b6 2} On June 13, 2011, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Noel in a two-count complaint with failing to maintain client funds in a separate, interest-bearing trust account; engaging in conduct that reflects adversely on his fitness to practice law and involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; and failing to cooperate in the disciplinary process. Noel did not initially answer, and relator therefore moved for an entry of default. On October 11, 2011, after requesting an extension of time to respond, Noel answered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 3} On January 20, 2011, a three-member panel of the board conducted a hearing at which Noel and one of the grievants testified. The parties also submitted stipulated facts, exhibits, and violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Relator recommended a sanction of indefinite suspension, while Noel recommended that he serve another two-year suspension, with the entire term stayed on the condition of monitored probation. The panel accepted the parties\u2019 stipulations, made additional findings of fact, and recommended that Noel be indefinitely suspended, with the suspension to commence on the expiration of the previously imposed two-year suspension. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction. No objections have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 4} We, in turn, accept the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct and indefinitely suspend Noel from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Count One \u2014 The Zubaidah Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 5} During the summer of 2010, King Ayettey Zubaidah contacted Noel to file a motion for judicial release on behalf of Zubaidah\u2019s son, KC Del McGee, who was a former client of Noel\u2019s. Noel agreed to file the motion on McGee\u2019s behalf, and in early September 2010, Zubaidah sent a $350 money order to Noel\u2019s former office address. On September 16, 2010, Noel deposited the money into his business checking account, even though he also maintained a client trust account at the same bank. In early October 2010, Zubaidah sent Noel a second $350 money order, which Noel also deposited into his business checking account. After delivery of the second money order, Zubaidah attempted to contact Noel several times about the status of the judicial-release motion, but Noel did not return any of Zubaidah\u2019s phone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>{\u00b6 6} In November 2010, Zubaidah filed a grievance against Noel. In December 2010 and January 2011, relator sent Noel three separate letters of inquiry by certified mail regarding Zubaidah\u2019s grievance. Although Noel signed for each letter, he failed to respond to any of them. Relator ultimately subpoenaed Noel for a deposition, and he appeared on February 16, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 7} At his deposition, Noel testified that he had picked up Zubaidah\u2019s money orders from his former office in December 2010. Noel further testified that he did not return Zubaidah\u2019s money because he believed he could not have any contact with Zubaidah after the filing of the grievance. Instead, Noel felt he was \u201cprotecting\u201d the money by depositing it into his own business checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 8} After the deposition, relator sent Noel two separate follow-up letters, each requesting a response. Noel, however, failed to respond to either letter. Noel responded only after relator filed a complaint and motion for entry of default, at which time Noel answered and stipulated to most of the allegations and all the charged misconduct. By that time, November 2011, Noel was unable to refund Zubaidah\u2019s money because of his personal financial situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 9} At the January 2012 panel hearing, Noel retracted portions of his deposition testimony. Specifically, he acknowledged that he had received and deposited Zubaidah\u2019s money orders in September and October 2010 before Zubaidah filed the grievance against him. Noel further acknowledged that despite his having accepted Zubaidah\u2019s money in September and October, the motion for judicial release could not have been filed until May 2011, at the earliest. Finally, Noel could not give a reasonable justification for failing to refund Zubaidah\u2019s money before his own finances had depleted, although, at the hearing, he handed a cashier\u2019s check to Zubaidah for $777.76, which was meant as a refund, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 10} The parties stipulated, the board found, and we agree that Noel\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client trust account, separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property), 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to respond to a demand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law) and Gov. Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring a lawyer to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Count Two \u2014 The Riley Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">{\u00b6 11} On the day before Noel\u2019s deposition in the Zubaidah matter, relator received a grievance filed against Noel by Crystal Riley. In her grievance, Riley claimed that Noel had represented her in a criminal matter and that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>been trying to obtain a copy of the discovery filed in her case for the past three years. Relator and Noel briefly discussed Riley\u2019s grievance at the Zubaidah deposition, and relator advised Noel that he would be receiving a formal letter of inquiry about the new grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 12} As promised, in February and again in March 2011, relator sent Noel two separate letters of inquiry. Each letter was sent by certified mail and requested that Noel respond in writing to Riley\u2019s allegations. Although Noel signed for the letters, he failed to respond. Relator ultimately determined that there was insufficient evidence of an ethical violation relating to the merits of Riley\u2019s grievance, but the parties stipulated, the board found, and we agree that Noel violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) for failing to respond to relator\u2019s letters of inquiry or to otherwise cooperate in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 13} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 14} We have already identified Noel\u2019s breaches of duties to his clients and the legal profession. By failing to deposit Zubaidah\u2019s money orders into a client trust account, Noel violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a). He violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) and 8.4(h) by accepting and spending Zubaidah\u2019s money, failing to do the requested work, and giving contradictory testimony in his deposition and at the hearing regarding when he had accepted the money orders or why he had not returned the money. Finally, Noel violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.1(b) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) for repeatedly failing to respond to relator\u2019s letters in the Zubaidah and Riley matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 15} The board did not find any mitigating factors. The board acknowledged that Noel attributed most of his misconduct to grief over his younger brother\u2019s death, which had occurred weeks before his acceptance of Zubaidah\u2019s first money order. At the panel hearing, Noel testified that he had discovered his brother\u2019s body, an experience that later caused him stress and nightmares. Noel blamed his failure to respond to relator\u2019s letters of inquiry on that stress, and Noel believed that the stress continued to affect him at the time of his February 2011 deposition. The board found, however, that because Noel had not sought professional help for his emotional condition' \u2014 and therefore had not been diagnosed with a mental disability by a qualified health-care professional \u2014 the stress did not qualify as a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g). Simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>larly, the board found that because Noel did not tender restitution to Zubaidah until the date of the panel hearing, January 20, 2012, more than a year after Noel had accepted Zubaidah\u2019s money, he did not make a \u201ctimely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct\u201d under BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">{\u00b6 16} As to aggravating factors, the parties stipulated that Noel had been previously disciplined, had engaged in multiple offenses, had failed to cooperate in the disciplinary proceedings that led to his two-year suspension and to the instant disciplinary proceedings, and had failed to make restitution to Zubaidah. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), (d), (e), and (i). The board accepted the stipulations but acknowledged that Noel ultimately refunded Zubaidah\u2019s money, thereby making the final aggravating factor no longer applicable. However, because Noel was unable to justify why he spent the money after having accepted it, the board accorded \u201clittle weight\u201d to Noel\u2019s eventual refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 17} For precedent, the board cited <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Davis, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 440, 2011-Ohio-6016, 958 N.E.2d 1230, to support its recommendation of an indefinite suspension. In <em>Davis, </em>we indefinitely suspended a lawyer for accepting client money and not performing the work, failing to return clients\u2019 documents and money while under suspension, and failing to cooperate in the disciplinary process. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3-16. We held that these violations, combined with a profusion of aggravating factors \u2014 including previous discipline for comparable conduct\u2014 and the lack of any mitigating factors, warranted an indefinite suspension. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 22. The board also considered four analogous cases in which the same penalty had been levied. <em>See, e.g., Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Gottehrer, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 519, 2010-Ohio-929, 924 N.E.2d 825 (indefinite suspension for accepting client retainers in matters in which the respondent did not do the work, failing to respond to client communications, failing to return client retainers, and failing to cooperate in disciplinary proceedings); <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Clovis, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 434, 2010-Ohio-1859, 928 N.E.2d 1078 (indefinite suspension for accepting a client\u2019s money for a matter in which the respondent did not do the work, failing to return a client\u2019s documents and money, and failing to cooperate in the disciplinary proceeding); <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Van Sickle, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 376, 2011-Ohio-774, 944 N.E.2d 677 (indefinite suspension for practicing while under license suspension, failing to complete the work, and failing to respond to requests for return of funds and documentation); and <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wagner, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 158, 2007-Ohio-1253, 863 N.E.2d 164 (indefinite suspension for accepting a client\u2019s money for matters in which respondent did not do the work, failing to return a client\u2019s money, and failing to cooperate in disciplinary proceedings).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ANCI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, Lori J. Brown, Chief Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and Karen H. Osmond, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AsM\">Gerald T. Noel Jr., pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">{\u00b6 18} Having reviewed the record, the aggravating factors, and the fact that no mitigating factors exist in this case, and having considered the sanctions previously imposed for comparable conduct, we adopt the board\u2019s recommended sanction of an indefinite suspension. Accordingly, Gerald Thomas Noel Jr. is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio, with the suspension to commence on the date of our order. Costs are taxed to Noel.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">. We note that both the panel and board reports indicate that Noel filed an answer on October 11, 2011, and therefore we accept that the answer was filed. The record, however, does not include a copy of Noel\u2019s answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
