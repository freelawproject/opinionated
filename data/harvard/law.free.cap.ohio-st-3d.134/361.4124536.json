On May 24, 1995, we suspended his license for six months, stayed the suspension, and placed him on a two-year probation period after finding that he had handled a client\u2019s legal matter without adequate preparation and neglected an entrusted matter. <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. O\u2019Neal, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 234, 648 N.E.2d 1344 (1995). On July 9, 1997, we terminated his probation. <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. O\u2019Neal, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 1223, 681 N.E.2d 1335 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">{\u00b6 2} On April 11, 2011, relator, Dayton Bar Association, charged O\u2019Neal with multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct for his alleged mishandling and neglect of two probate matters for the same client. O\u2019Neal answered, and in September 2011, a three-member panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline conducted a hearing, where O\u2019Neal testified and the parties submitted stipulations of fact and misconduct. As a sanction, the parties jointly recommended a one-year suspension with six months stayed on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">{\u00b6 3} During the hearing, the panel became concerned about O\u2019Neal\u2019s cognitive abilities and memory. At that time, O\u2019Neal was 71 years old, and he repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>referred to his confusion as an explanation for his neglect of the probate matters. The panel requested that O\u2019Neal submit to a psychiatric examination by a qualified health professional, and he agreed. In November 2011, the panel-appointed physician filed his independent report, which diagnosed O\u2019Neal with \u201cage-associated cognitive decline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 4} After submission of the physician\u2019s report and the parties\u2019 final arguments, the panel determined that O\u2019Neal had committed some of the charged misconduct, dismissed the remaining allegations, and recommended a two-year suspension, with 18 months stayed on the conditions that he complete ten hours of continuing legal education in law-office management and probate law, submit to an additional psychiatric evaluation to show that there has been no further decline in his cognitive functioning, and serve two years of monitored probation. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct but recommended that O\u2019Neal be suspended for two years, with the entire suspension stayed on the conditions that he (1) complete the continuing-legal-edueation courses as recommended by the panel, (2) serve two years of monitored probation, and (3) contact the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), undergo an assessment, and enter into a contract with OLAP under the conditions and for the duration that it deems appropriate. O\u2019Neal has consented to the findings and recommended sanction, and relator has not filed any objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 5} We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct, but for the reasons that follow, we agree with the panel that a two-year suspension, with 18 months stayed on conditions, is the appropriate sanction. In addition, we condition O\u2019Neal\u2019s reinstatement upon his completing a geriatric psychological assessment and his submitting proof that he is fit to return to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 6} In March 2008, Alicia Wingo retained O\u2019Neal to represent her in two probate cases involving the estates of her uncle, George Taylor, and her father, Albon Wingo. Alicia Wingo was the representative of both estates, and she paid O\u2019Neal a $100 initial consultation fee. In May 2008, Wingo paid O\u2019Neal a $2,000 retainer. At that time, O\u2019Neal did not have \u2014 and therefore did not deposit the money into \u2014 a client trust account. Over the next year, O\u2019Neal neglected the two probate matters by persistently missing court deadlines, failing to appear for court hearings, and failing to keep in contact with Wingo, and he was eventually held in contempt by the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">{\u00b6 7} Specifically, in the Taylor case, O\u2019Neal missed three consecutive deadlines to file the commissioner\u2019s report, and he failed to appear for the ensuing show-cause hearing. The probate court cited him and fined his client, who eventually filed the report without O\u2019Neal\u2019s assistance. Wingo, however, wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>fully distributed estate funds to herself and her brother, and the court ordered that she recover the funds and file an amended report. But neither O\u2019Neal nor Wingo filed the amended report, and the court issued two additional citations for missed deadlines. Similarly, in the Albon Wingo probate case, the court issued five citations to O\u2019Neal for missing deadlines to file the estate\u2019s inventory report and account reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 8} On April 3, 2009, Wingo sent O\u2019Neal a letter terminating their attorney-client relationship and demanding the return of her money and files. O\u2019Neal received the letter by certified mail, but he did not refund the money or seek to withdraw as counsel. Instead, on April 29, 2009, he filed a commissioner\u2019s report in the Taylor case, which showed a distribution of legal and commissioner fees that had not been previously approved by the court. The court immediately ordered O\u2019Neal to appear for a May 26, 2009 show-cause hearing regarding why he and his client had not followed the court\u2019s prior orders. By the time of the May hearing, however, Wingo had obtained new counsel, who assumed responsibility for the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 9} O\u2019Neal\u2019s participation in the probate matters did not end there. In December 2009, Wingo and her new counsel filed a fiduciary\u2019s account report in her father\u2019s case, which listed a $3,050 distribution to O\u2019Neal. These fees had not been approved by the probate court, as required by local rule, and the court ordered O\u2019Neal to appear for a February 1, 2010 hearing. O\u2019Neal failed to appear but later requested additional time to submit applications for attorney fees in both the Albon Wingo and Taylor probate cases. O\u2019Neal, however, did not timely file the fee applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 10} The court\u2019s magistrate thereafter determined that O\u2019Neal was not entitled to any attorney fees and ordered that he return all fees he had obtained from Wingo. Upon receipt of O\u2019Neal\u2019s motion to submit fees \u201cout-of-time,\u201d the magistrate gave him one final opportunity to justify his fee distribution. However, O\u2019Neal again failed to appear for the scheduled hearing, and on July 9, 2010, the magistrate reordered O\u2019Neal to return all fees to Wingo. By March 16, 2011, O\u2019Neal had not returned his client\u2019s money, and the probate judge found him in contempt. O\u2019Neal then disgorged his client\u2019s funds, and his sentence was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 11} The parties stipulated, the board found, and we agree that O\u2019Neal\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client), 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client), 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients in an interest-bearing client trust account, separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property), and 1.15(c) (requiring a lawyer to deposit advance legal fees and expenses into a client trust account, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>or expenses incurred). In addition, although the parties did not stipulate to the violation, the board found that O\u2019Neal\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(d) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver funds or other property that the client is entitled to receive), and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 12} Relator also charged O\u2019Neal with violations of Prof.Cond.R. 1.4 (requiring a lawyer to reasonably communicate with a client), 1.16(d) (requiring a lawyer withdrawing from representation to take steps reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interest), 3.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). Relator requested and the board recommended dismissal of those allegations. Because relator has not proven the allegations by clear and convincing evidence, we hereby dismiss the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 13} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 14} We have already addressed how O\u2019Neal breached ethical duties owed to his client. As aggravating factors, the board found a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). As mitigating factors, the board found that O\u2019Neal (1) did not act with a dishonest or selfish motive, (2) made restitution, although not timely, (3) displayed a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceeding, and (4) demonstrated good character and reputation. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(b), (c), (d), and (e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, as to the fourth factor, the board noted that throughout his career, O\u2019Neal has represented underserved individuals who might not otherwise be able to hire legal counsel, and such services are valued by the Dayton community and the courts. Further, Judge Timothy N. O\u2019Connell of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas testified to O\u2019Neal\u2019s good character, stating that he is \u201cindustri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ous, very honest and has an excellent work ethic demonstrating commitment to his clients and his community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 15} O\u2019Neal\u2019s age-associated cognitive decline does not qualify as a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g). The panel-appointed physician, David G. Bienenfeld, M.D., reported that there is no treatment for the condition, and under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)(iii), a \u201csustained period of successful treatment\u201d is a necessary element for any mental disability to be considered in mitigation. We nonetheless find that the diagnosis is relevant to determining the appropriate sanction. As we have previously explained, each disciplinary case is unique, and we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Hartke, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 116, 2012-Ohio-2443, 969 N.E.2d 1189, \u00b6 9, quoting BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B); <em>see also Disciplinary Counsel v. Parker, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 64, 2007-Ohio-5635, 876 N.E.2d 556, \u00b6 86 (\u201c[W]e frequently do weigh concerns not specified [in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B)]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 16} According to the panel report, O\u2019Neal repeatedly testified that he had \u201cconfusion\u201d about what was required by the probate court and about Wingo\u2019s termination of his legal services. The panel found that O\u2019Neal\u2019s answers often rambled, and he referred to irrelevant information, was vague, and was difficult to follow. The panel further reported that he had difficulty remembering his age. The panel was in the best position to assess O\u2019Neal\u2019s testimony, and we defer to their description of his demeanor and mental state. <em>See, e.g., Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 24 (\u201cUnless the record weighs heavily against a hearing panel\u2019s findings, we defer to the panel\u2019s credibility determinations, inasmuch as the panel members saw and heard the witnesses firsthand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 17} Dr. Bienenfeld reported that O\u2019Neal\u2019s condition does not meet the definition of a \u201cmental illness\u201d in R.C. 5122.01(A). Instead, age-associated cognitive decline is defined as \u201can objectively identified decline in cognitive functioning consequent to the aging process that is within normal limits given the person\u2019s age.\u201d Individuals with this condition \u201cmay report problems remembering names or appointments or may experience difficulty in solving complex problems.\u201d According to Dr. Bienenfeld, O\u2019Neal\u2019s ability to conduct a normal everyday life is not impaired, but he may be affected in \u201cspecific areas in which an attorney must function above the cognitive levels required for everyday life, including keeping track of multiple simultaneous tasks, adapting quickly to changing circumstances, [and] integrating disparate types of information towards a legal task.\u201d Further, Dr. Bienenfeld reported that O\u2019Neal \u201cdoes demonstrate cognitive impairment that likely impairs his ability to deliver quality legal services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Because the condition is part of the \u201cnormal aging process,\u201d Dr. Bienenfeld concluded that \u201cit is not classified as a disease, and there is no treatment.\u201d If O\u2019Neal continues to practice law, Dr. Bienenfeld recommended either periodic monitoring or more rigorous neuropsychological evaluations at yearly intervals to determine whether there is any further decline in cognitive abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 19} We have consistently explained that \u201c \u2018in determining the appropriate length of the suspension and any attendant conditions, we must recognize that the primary purpose of disciplinary sanctions is not to punish the offender, but to protect the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 204, 2004-Ohio-4704, 815 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 53. That purpose is served by suspending O\u2019Neal from the practice of law for two years, with 18 months stayed, and imposing conditions on reinstatement. While relator did not show that O\u2019Neal intended his client to suffer any harm \u2014 and O\u2019Neal has acknowledged his wrongdoing, demonstrated his good character, and cooperated in the disciplinary investigation \u2014 Dr. Bienenfeld reported that no treatment is available for age-associated cognitive decline and O\u2019Neal\u2019s cognitive impairment \u201clikely\u201d impairs his ability to provide quality legal services. Therefore, to protect the public and maintain the integrity of the legal profession, any future reinstatement must be conditioned on O\u2019Neal\u2019s undergoing another evaluation and submitting proof that his age-associat\u00e9d cognitive decline does not prevent him from competently and ethically practicing law. If O\u2019Neal meets the conditions of reinstatement, an ongoing OLAP contract, which should assist him in addressing and managing the identified aging issues, combined with the monitoring, reporting, and other probationary restrictions imposed by Gov.Bar R. V(9) on his professional relationships, will allow him to practice law and continue to serve the courts and his community without posing a threat to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 20} Based on the foregoing, Raymond Walter O\u2019Neal Sr. is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio for two years, with 18 months stayed on the conditions that he (1) commit no further misconduct and (2) complete a minimum of ten hours of continuing legal education in topics related to law-office management for solo practitioners and estate and probate law in addition to the requirements of Gov.Bar R. X(3)(G). If O\u2019Neal fails to comply with the conditions of the stay, the stay will be lifted, and O\u2019Neal shall serve the entire two-year suspension. In applying for reinstatement, O\u2019Neal shall (1) submit evidence from a qualified medical professional that he completed a geriatric psychological assessment and provide proof to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that he is fit to return to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law and (2) submit evidence that he has entered into a contract with OLAP to address aging issues' \u2014 -the duration of which shall be determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>OLAP \u2014 and has complied with all of OLAP\u2019s recommendations. If reinstated, O\u2019Neal shall serve a two-year probation under the supervision of a monitoring attorney in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9) to review his files and ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards of practice. Costs are taxed to O\u2019Neal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7E\">Christopher R.
