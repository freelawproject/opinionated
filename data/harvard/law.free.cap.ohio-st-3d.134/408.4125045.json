The Twelfth District Court of Appeals held that R.C. 2305.113(C), as applied to the facts of this case, violates the right-to-remedy clause of the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 16, relying in part upon <em>Hardy v. VerMeulen, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 45, 47, 512 N.E.2d 626 (1987). For reasons that follow, we overrule <em>Hardy </em>and reverse the judgment of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. 2305.113(C) sets a four-year statute of repose for medical-malpractice claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Except for minors or those of unsound mind, a person must file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>medical claim no later than four years after the alleged act of malpractice occurs or the claim will be barred. Limited exceptions also exist for malpractice discovered during the fourth year after treatment and for malpractice that leaves a foreign object in a patient\u2019s body. R.C. 2305.113(D)(1) and (2). Those exceptions allow one additional year after discovery of an injury to file suit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 3} This case involves a medical-malpractice claim filed well after the statute of repose set forth in R.C. 2305.113(C), and no statutory exception applies. Timothy Ruther developed abdominal pains that led to a diagnosis of a liver lesion and hepatitis C in December 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 4} Around this time, Timothy Ruther\u2019s wife, appellee Tracy Ruther reviewed medical records detailing appellant Dr. George Kaiser\u2019s care of her husband. These records showed elevated liver-enzyme levels in July 1995, May 1997, and October 1998. Although the parties contest the length of time Mr. Ruther received treatment at Dr. Kaiser\u2019s practice, appellant Warren County Family Practice Physicians, Inc., it is not disputed that Dr. Kaiser stopped treating Mr. Ruther years before he complained of abdominal pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 5} In May 2009, the Ruthers sued Dr. Kaiser and Warren County Family Practice Physicians, Inc., for medical malpractice. The Ruthers claimed that Dr. Kaiser had failed \u201cto properly assess, evaluate and respond to abnormal laboratory results including, but not limited to, very high liver enzymes.\u201d Mr. Ruther died while the case was pending. Mrs. Ruther then amended the complaint to add a claim for wrongful death and sought a declaratory judgment that R.C. 2305.113(C), as applied to her husband, violates the United States and Ohio constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 6} Dr. Kaiser and the medical practice moved for summary judgment, asserting that the statute of repose found in R.C. 2305.113(C) barred the amended complaint, having been brought more than ten years after the alleged act of malpractice. The trial court, however, denied the motion, concluding that applying the statute of repose in this case would violate the Ohio Constitution, Article 16, Section 1. The trial court also denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to Mrs. Ruther\u2019s wrongful-death claim because it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>filed within the statute of limitations. That ruling was not appealed. Thus, the wrongful-death action is not before \u00fas.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">{\u00b6 7} The Twelfth District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment. <em>Ruther v. Kaiser, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2010-07-066, 2011-Ohio-1723, 2011 WL 1346836. Like the trial court, the appellate court concluded that the statute, as applied to Mrs. Ruther\u2019s medical-malpractice claim, \u201cbars her claim after it had already vested, but before she or the decedent knew or reasonably could have known about the claim[,] [thereby constituting] a violation of the right-to-a-remedy provision of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 8} We granted Dr. Kaiser\u2019s request for discretionary review. <em>Ruther v. Kaiser, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2011-Ohio-4751, 953 N.E.2d 841. The sole proposition of law reads: \u201cThe medical malpractice statute contained in O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.113(C) does not violate the open courts provision (Section 16, Article I) and is therefore constitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A. The Statute Is Presumed to Be Constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2305.113(C) has a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>Arbino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 25. An as-applied constitutional challenge, such as Mrs. Ruther raises, alleges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">the application of the statute in the particular context would be unconstitutional. \u201cThe practical effect of holding a statute unconstitutional \u2018as applied\u2019 is to prevent its future application in a similar context, but not to render it utterly inoperative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\"><em>Yajnik v. Akron Dept. of Health, Hous. Div., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 106, 2004-Ohio-357, 802 N.E.2d 632, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Ada v. Guam Soc. of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists, </em>506 U.S. 1011, 113 S.Ct. 633, 121 L.Ed.2d 564 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The standard for such a challenge is clear and convincing evidence. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Congress of Parents &amp; Teachers v. State Bd. of Edn., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 568, 2006-Ohio-5512, 857 N.E.2d 1148, \u00b6 21. \u201cThe only judicial inquiry into the constitutionality of a statute involves the question of legislative power, not legislative wisdom.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bowman v. Allen Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>124 Ohio St. 174, 196, 177 N.E. 271 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">1. Right to Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 10} The constitutional provision at issue in this case, Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 16, guarantees that \u201c[a]ll courts shall be open, and every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d This one provision contains many important constitutional principles' \u2014 \u201copen courts,\u201d \u201cright to remedy,\u201d and \u201cdue course of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, we are concerned with the right to remedy, which has been a part of our constitution since Ohio was admitted to the union. Little is known about the intent behind its inclusion, as the records of the 1802 convention indicate that the original right-to-remedy provision, Ohio Constitution of 1802, Article VIII, Section 7, was enacted without amendment or recorded discussion. <em>See E.W. Scripps Co. v. Fulton, </em>100 Ohio App. 157, 171-172, 125 N.E.2d 896 (8th Dist.1955) (Hurd, J., concurring). Although it was almost deleted at the 1850-1851 convention, this section was ultimately carried unchanged into the current Bill of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 172. The 1873-1874 constitutional convention made no changes in this section, and the 1912 convention also left the words of the 1802 drafters unaltered, though it added a sentence not at issue in the instant case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 12} A plain reading of Article I, Section 16 reveals that it does not provide for remedies without limitation or for any perceived injury. Rather, the right-to-remedy clause provides that the court shall be open for those to seek remedy \u201cby <em>due course of laiv.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Article I, Section 16 does not prevent the General Assembly from defining a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 13} We have previously stated that the right-to-remedy provision applies only to existing, vested rights and that the legislature determines what injuries are recognized and what remedies are available. <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 150, quoting <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co., </em>49 Ohio St.3d 193, 202, 551 N.E.2d 938 (1990). \u201cNo one has a vested right in rules of the common law. * * * The great office of statutes is to remedy defects in the common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to new circumstances.\u201d <em>Fassig v. State ex rel. Turner, </em>95 Ohio St. 232, 248, 116 N.E. 104 (1917), <em>overruled on other grounds by Griffin v. Hydra-Matic Div., Gen. Motors Corp., </em>39 Ohio St.3d 79, 529 N.E.2d 436 (1988), syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, the General Assembly has the right to determine what causes of action the law will recognize and to alter the common law by abolishing the action, by defining the action, or by placing a time limit after which an injury is no longer a legal injury. For example, the General Assembly abolished the torts of breach of a promise to marry, alienation of affections, and criminal conversation. R.C. 2305.29; <em>Strode v. Pressnell, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 207, 214, 527 N.E.2d 1235 (1988), and paragraph one of the syllabus (upholding the statute that abolished \u201camatory actions\u201d as constitutional). The legislature has also redefined the common-law definition of employer intentional torts. R.C. 2745.01; <em>Kaminski v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>Metal &amp; Wire Prods. Co., </em>125 Ohio St.3d 250, 2010-Ohio-1027, 927 N.E.2d 1066. It has also limited the ability to pursue negligence actions that are discovered six months after a decedent\u2019s death. R.C. 2117.06(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 15} The question remains whether R.C. 2305.113(C) is a valid exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s authority to define or limit a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">2. No Extinguishment of Vested Right</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 16} The Twelfth District Court of Appeals declared R.C. 2305.11(C) unconstitutional as applied, reasoning that the statute extinguishes the right to remedy for a vested claim, relying in a large part on <em>Hardy, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 47, 512 N.E.2d 626. <em>Ruther, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2010-07-066, 2011-Ohio-1723, 2011 WL 1346836, \u00b6 38. The error in <em>Hardy, </em>repeated by the appellate court, is that there is no actual examination of when a medical-malpractice claim vests. <em>Hardy </em>mistakenly appears to conclude that a medical-malpractice claim arises (becomes \u201cactionable\u201d) immediately upon the breach of the standard of care \u2014 i.e., the negligent act or omission. And yet a cause of action for negligence does not arise until there is \u201cthe existence of a duty, a breach of that duty and injury resulting proximately therefrom.\u201d <em>Mussivand v. David, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 17} To be actionable, then, the claim for medical negligence requires an injury. We have clearly stated that it is when a patient discovers or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered the resulting injury that a cause of action for medical malpractice accrues, or, in other words, vests. <em>Oliver v. Kaiser Community Health Found., </em>5 Ohio St.3d 111, 449 N.E.2d 438 (1983); <em>Hershberger v. Akron City Hosp., </em>34 Ohio St.3d 1, 516 N.E.2d 204 (1987), syllabus. If indeed an action immediately accrues upon a negligent act or omission, then the one-year statute of limitations for filing all medical-malpractice claims would begin to run immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 18} But the General Assembly recognized in R.C. 2305.113 that in some cases, an injury may not manifest itself within one year of a breach of a duty of care and so has provided the general discovery period of four years. Within that boundary, when the patient discovers or should have discovered the injury, or when the relationship with the doctor terminates, whichever is later, the one-year statute of limitations begins to run. R.C. 2305.113(C) does not bar a vested cause of action, but prevents a cause of action from vesting more than four years after the breach of the duty of care. Therefore, it is a true statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">3. Rational Basis for R.C. 2305.113(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">{\u00b6 19} Many policy reasons support this legislation. Just as a plaintiff is entitled to a meaningful time and opportunity to pursue a claim, a defendant is entitled to a reasonable time after which he or she can be assured that a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>will not have to be mounted for actions occurring years before. The statute of repose exists to give medical providers certainty with respect to the time within which a claim can be brought and a time after which they may be free from the fear of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 20} Forcing medical providers to defend against medical claims that occurred 10, 20, or 50 years before presents a host of litigation concerns, including the risk that evidence is unavailable through the death or unknown whereabouts of witnesses, the possibility that pertinent documents were not retained, the likelihood that evidence would be untrustworthy due to faded memories, the potential that technology may have changed to create a different and more stringent standard of care not applicable to the earlier time, the risk that the medical providers\u2019 financial circumstances may have changed \u2014 i.e., that practitioners have retired and no longer carry liability insurance, the possibility that a practitioner\u2019s insurer has become insolvent, and the risk that the institutional medical provider may have closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 21} Responding to these concerns, the General Assembly made a policy decision to grant Ohio medical providers the right to be free from litigation based on alleged acts of medical negligence occurring outside a specified time period. This decision is embodied in Ohio\u2019s four-year statute of repose for medical negligence, set forth in R.C. 2305.113(C). The statute establishes a period beyond which medical claims may not be brought even if the injury giving rise to the claim does not accrue because it is undiscovered until after the period has ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">B. <em>Hardy </em>Should Be Overruled</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 22} Ruther urges that <em>Hardy </em>is binding precedent and that there is no justification for departing from that precedent. However, a newly enacted statute warrants a fresh review on its individual merits. <em>Arbino, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 468, 2007-Ohio-6948, 880 N.E.2d 420, at \u00b6 24. We are also persuaded that <em>Hardy </em>should be overruled when we examine it under the stringent standard set forth in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph one of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">A prior decision of the Supreme Court may be overruled where (1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>1. Considering whether <em>Hardy </em>was wrongly decided and whether circumstances have changed</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 23} <em>Hardy </em>rests on a flawed foundation \u2014 it ignored the cases that establish when a medical claim vests. The <em>Hardy </em>court concluded that an earlier version of the statute of repose violated the open-courts provision of the Ohio Constitution by denying \u201clegal remedy to one who has suffered bodily injury.\u201d 32 Ohio St.3d at 48, 512 N.E.2d 626. Without any analysis, the court assumed that the right to a remedy attached to an unaccrued claim, holding that because a plaintiff did not become aware of an injury until after the four-year statute of repose period had expired, \u201chis cause of action was extinguished before he could act upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45-46. There was no detailed discussion of when a medical claim arises, accrues, vests, or is actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 24} We have acknowledged that \u201cit is state law which determines what injuries are recognized and what remedies are available.\u201d <em>Groch, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, at \u00b6 150. Although <em>Groch </em>repeated without any analysis <em>Hardy\u2019s </em>statement of when a medical claim accrues, <em>Groch </em>departed from precedent by holding that it is not unconstitutional for a statute of repose to bar a claim that does not vest until after the period provided by the statute of repose has expired. If a statute takes away a claim before it accrues, the claim never vests, and the statute of repose does not violate the open-courts provision of Article I, Section 16. \u201c \u2018The right-to-a-remedy provision of Section 16, Article I applies <em>only to existing, vested rights, </em>and it is state law which determines what injuries are recognized and what remedies are available.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Sedar, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 202, 551 N.E.2d 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 25} For purposes of the statute of limitations, this court has recognized that a medical claim accrues upon the later of the termination of the doctor-patient relationship or the discovery of the injury. <em>Frysinger v. Leech, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 38, 512 N.E.2d 337 (1987), paragraph one of the syllabus. If there is no discovery of any injury, the claim has not accrued. Nor has it vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 26} Justice Wright and two other dissenters understood this point when examining the General Assembly\u2019s ability to define time periods for causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">Is an undiscovered claim for damages a constitutional right inviolate against legislative limitation as to time constraints? Does Section 16, Article I forever provide a remedy to an as yet undiscovered claim? To suggest, as does the majority, that every commonlaw [sic] right is indelibly embedded in the Ohio Constitution and that subjective awareness of a potential legal claim is required prior to the abolishment of a cause of action is sheer legal fiction. Nevertheless, because the majority disagrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>with the time constraints under [the statute], it has, under the guise of judicial interpretation, abrogated the function of the General Assembly and the electorate by amending the Constitution of Ohio by judicial fiat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><em>Hardy, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 55, 512 N.E.2d 626 (Wright, J., concurring in judgment only and dissenting in part). We agree with Justice Wright\u2019s analysis in <em>Hardy </em>and hold that the case was wrongly decided. The General Assembly has the right to define the contours of a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 27} Circumstances have also changed since <em>Hardy, </em>for the General Assembly addressed certain constitutional concerns when enacting R.C. 2305.113(C) in 2003. 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3791, 3799-3804. Just as in 1987, when <em>Hardy </em>was decided under former R.C. 2305.11(A), 141 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3223, 3228, \u201can action upon a medical claim * * * shall be commenced within one year after the cause of action <em>accrued.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 2305.113(A). And in addition, no action upon a medical claim shall be <em>commenced </em>\u201cmore than four years after the <em>occurrence </em>of the act or omission constituting the alleged basis\u201d of the medical claim. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2305.113(C). But now, unlike under the statute addressed in <em>Hardy, </em>the statute of repose will not apply to persons within the age of minority or to those of unsound mind. <em>Id. See </em>141 Ohio Laws, Part II, at 3229. Those who discover the injury in the fourth year after the alleged negligent act or omission have an additional year to file suit, R.C. 2305.113(D)(1), and those with a foreign object left in their bodies have one year to sue from the time that a person exercising reasonable care and diligence should have discovered it. R.C. 2305.113(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 28} Thus, a prospective plaintiff in an action for medical negligence is typically granted one year to pursue a claim from the time it accrues, provided that the accrual itself happens within four years. The statute of repose grants a prospective plaintiff to whom it applies four years to discover a claim and one year to commence that action, or it is barred before it arises. Although in some cases, discovery of an injury will not occur within the time frame chosen, the General Assembly has struck a rational balance between the rights of prospective claimants to pursue their allegations and the rights of prospective defendants to have protection from stale litigation. This court should not substitute its judgment for that legislative choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">2. Considering practical workability</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 29} For the reasons expressed earlier, if the General Assembly cannot legislate a statute of repose, medical providers are left with the possibility of unlimited liability indefinitely. We explained in <em>Groch </em>that statutes of repose are not constitutionally infirm. We have also held that only accrued causes of action are vested, substantive rights. <em>Gregory v. Flowers, </em>32 Ohio St.2d 48, 58, 290 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>N.E.2d 181 (1972). To hold that a party has a property right in unaccrued claims means that the General Assembly may never make a change in common-law causes of action such as medical negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">3. Considering reliance interests</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 30} The final test in <em>Galatis </em>is whether undue hardship would be visited upon those who have relied on <em>Hardy. </em>We must ask \u201c \u2018whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at \u00b6 58, quoting <em>Robinson v. Detroit, </em>462 Mich. 439, 613 N.W.2d 307 (2000). To the contrary, readjustment and dislocation will occur in upholding <em>Hardy, </em>and no reliance interest will be jeopardized by overruling it. The current statute of repose has been in effect since 2003, and it is less likely that people who are injured due to a medical provider\u2019s breach of duty will not discover injury proximately caused by that act or omission before the statute of repose bars the claim from vesting. The General Assembly has chosen up to four years for the cause of action to arise (to be discovered). If one is not aware of a cause of action, one cannot rely on a case that stated it would never be barred after passage of time. Thus, there would be no undue hardship created if <em>Hardy </em>were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 31} As noted above, <em>Hardy </em>did not properly analyze when the vesting of a medical cause of action occurs. It ignored cases stating that this type of claim accrues upon discovery of an injury and thus that an undiscovered claim does not vest. The interplay between the statute of limitations and the statute of repose is important. Otherwise, the plaintiff would be required to file suit within one year of the occurrence of the breach of the medical standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">C. Upholding the Statute of Repose Is Consistent with the Majority View</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 32} The Supreme Court of Wisconsin faced a similar right-to-remedy challenge to its statute of repose. The medical claim involved a child whose congenital condition that later caused blindness was discovered sometime after her tenth birthday. A lawsuit on her behalf was filed three years later against the doctor who had treated her as a newborn. The Wisconsin statutes of limitations and repose granted one year from discovery to file suit, as long as five years had not passed since the act or omission that was the basis of the claim, or until the minor\u2019s tenth birthday. The court recognized that some claims would be foreclosed before a plaintiff had an opportunity to know that an injury occurred, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>[T]he legislature may sever a person\u2019s claim by a statute of limitations or a statute of repose when the person has had no possibility of discovering the injury \u2014 -when the person has been blameless in every respect. These decisions represent judicial deference to the stated policy of the legislature. Protecting the interests of those who must defend claims based on old acts or omissions is a policy concern that legislative bodies have weighed for centuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><em>Aicher v. Wisconsin Patients Comp. Fund, </em>237 Wis.2d 99, 2000 WI 98, 613 N.W.2d 849, \u00b6 50. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">We find [the statutes of limitations and repose] constitutional, despite the harsh results they yield in this case. We hold that [the statutes] do not violate the right-to-remedy clause because a prospective claimant does not have a legislative right to pursue a medical malpractice action if the injury is discovered after the statutory time limitation period elapses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 33} <em>Aicher </em>is not the only opinion analyzing a statute of repose for medical claims in this way. Thirty-two states have such statutes in existence. <em>See </em>Robin Miller, Validity of Medical Malpractice Statutes of Repose, 5 A.L.R.6th 133 (2011). And of that number, at least 16 statutes of repose have been upheld as constitutional against challenges similar to that of the open-courts or right-to-remedy provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 9-11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the contrary, Mrs. Ruther cites three cases, only one of which directly addresses the right to remedy. <em>McCollum v. Sisters of Charity of Nazareth Health Corp., </em>799 S.W.2d 15, 19 (Ky.1990). The statutes from Arizona and Colorado were struck down on equal-protection provisions of those state constitutions. <em>Kenyon v. Hammer, </em>142 Ariz. 69, 87, 688 P.2d 961 (1984); <em>Austin v. Litvak, </em>682 P.2d 41, 52 (Colo.1984). Interestingly, one of the cases that <em>Hardy </em>relied upon was overruled by the Supreme Court of South Dakota. <em>See Cleveland v. Lead, </em>2003 SD 54, 663 N.W.2d 212, \u00b6 45, overruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>Daugaard v. Baltic Co-op. Bldg.

That supreme court stated, \u201c[I]f ten years is violative of \u2018open courts\u2019 constitutional protection, what about 20 years, 50 years or 100 years or \u2018any longer length of time into perpetuity\u2019?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 44, quoting <em>Green v. Siegel, Barnett &amp; Schutz, </em>1996 SD 146, 557 N.W.2d 396, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 34} Continuing to follow <em>Hardy </em>would place Ohio in a distinct minority position.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 35} A plaintiff like Mrs. Ruther, whose cause of action for medical malpractice does not accrue until after the statute of repose has expired pursuant to R.C. 2305.113(C), is not deprived of a vested right. Because R.C. 2305.113(C) is a valid exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s authority to limit a cause of action, Mrs. Ruther failed to present clear and convincing evidence that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to her claim. We therefore hold that the medical-malpractice statute of repose found in R.C. 2305.113(C) does not extinguish a vested right and thus does not violate the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 16. <em>Hardy v.

This is an as-applied constitutional challenge to Ohio\u2019s statute of repose. The facts of this case are tragic, and our decision today leaves an alleged injured party with no opportunity to pursue her claim of medical negligence. However, it is unquestionably the province of the legislature to define claims and remedies under Ohio law. In this case, the General Assembly has determined that four years from the date of the alleged negligence is the appropriate timeframe in which to file a medical-malpractice claim. R.C. 2305.113(C). We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 37} More importantly, this court has firmly established that the right-to-remedy clause found in Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution does not bar the application of statutes of repose to undiscovered negligence. <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 149. The plain language of R.C. 2305.113(C) eliminates a claim for medical malpractice after four years, except in limited circumstances. As the majority points out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution protects remedies, not claims. Therefore, the right-to-remedy clause simply does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 38} Belated discovery of medical negligence is a frightening proposition for anyone who has been injured by a medical professional. However, the legislature is required to balance the needs of medical professionals, who need some finality to potential litigation, with the unusual circumstance of belatedly discovered negligence. To the extent that the four-year time limit in Ohio\u2019s statute of repose is seen as harsh, the remedy is in the legislature, not the courts. The people are responsible for their political choices. <em>See Natl. Fedn. of Indep. Business v. Sebelius, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 2579, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) (\u201cpolicy judgments * * * are entrusted to our Nation\u2019s elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 39} The Ohio Constitution permits the General Assembly to ensure some degree of finality for prospective negligence claims. It is not for this court to determine where the legislature should draw that line. Accordingly, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b521-10\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 40} Early in law school, every student is introduced to the rich historical tradition and critical importance of the common law in our nation\u2019s development. Today, American judges and attorneys are invited to assist both developed and developing countries in applying our common-law traditions, which date back centuries in England, to their efforts in empowering their courts to protect basic and constitutional human rights without interference from political leaders and legislative bodies or their military establishment. The power of every citizen in the United States to seek redress in our open courts for injury done, be it by our government, another citizen, or a large corporation, is a source of some amazement and great envy in many parts of the world. That the resulting decisions by judges and juries are respected and enforced without police or military intervention is incomprehensible in some quarters. Protecting our citizens\u2019 individual fundamental constitutional rights from attack by the government is the proud duty of the American judiciary and a part of our oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">{\u00b6 41} The case of <em>Ruther v. Kaiser, </em>rolled out amidst a blizzard of announcements by this court, will be of little immediate notice, except to the parties, the medical community, and a small, specialized element of the bar. Over time, however, <em>Ruther </em>will come to be known for the profound damage done to every Ohio citizen\u2019s constitutional right to remedy in open court for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation. Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>{\u00b6 42} The sweeping language employed by the majority in this case is the crescendo in our court\u2019s decade-long deference to, and acceptance of, the General Assembly\u2019s assault on our citizens\u2019 right to remedy set forth, without alteration, for over two centuries in the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 43} When is a fundamental right, contained in the Ohio Constitution and Bill of Rights since 1802, no longer the individual right of an Ohio citizen? According to this court, whenever the Ohio General Assembly chooses to extinguish the right, it will no longer exist, period. The majority writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">A plain reading of Article I Section 16 reveals that it does not provide for remedies without limitation or for any perceived injury. Rather, the right-to-remedy clause provides that the court shall be open for those to seek remedy \u201cby <em>due course of law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Article I, Section 16 does not prevent the General Assembly from defining a cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Majority opinion, \u00b6 12. In case the reader did not understand the breadth of the majority\u2019s devastating proclamation, it continues: \u201cThus, the General Assembly has the right to determine what causes of action the law will recognize and to alter the common law by abolishing the action, by defining the action, or by placing a time limit after which an injury is no longer a legal injury.\u201d Majority opinion, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 44} Under <em>Ruther, </em>we now fully abdicate our solemn duty to enforce and protect constitutional rights afforded citizens since the beginning of statehood. If the General Assembly abolishes a remedy, including those recognized at common law when the constitution was written, it is now clearly within its power. We will afford \u201cgreat deference\u201d in presuming constitutionality of any act of the General Assembly limiting or abolishing a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 45} Continued erosion of the venerable right of every citizen to a remedy in open court for injury done will inevitably flow from the General Assembly. It may come in small drips or in tidal waves, but it will come. The economic interests pushing limitations on causes of action are just too powerful and too seductive for the General Assembly to resist. We have now removed the Assembly\u2019s only dam against the onslaught: this court\u2019s previous vigorous enforcement of the \u201cright to remedy\u201d constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 46} When Timothy and Tracy Ruther sought a remedy in open court for injuries suffered because of a doctor\u2019s failure. to properly respond to three elevated liver-enzyme tests taken more than a decade before Timothy developed a fatal liver lesion and hepatitis C, they could never have envisioned the damage their ease would ultimately cause for generations of Ohioans yet to be injured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Their personal tragedy has evolved into a undiscovered nightmare for legions of Ohioans who will find the courthouse doors barred for the presentation of their future legitimate injury claims.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APp0\">Santen &amp; Hughes, John Holschuh, Brian O\u2019Connor, and Sarah Tankersley, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ana\">Arnold Todaro &amp; Welch Co., L.P.A., John Welch, and Karen Clouse, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-5\">Bricker &amp; Eckler L.L.P., Anne Marie Sferra, and Bridget Purdue Riddell, urging reversal for amici curiae American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, American Osteopathic Association, Ohio Alliance for Civil Justice, Ohio Hospital Association, Ohio Osteopathic Association, and Ohio State Medical Association.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AvE\">Tucker Ellis and Susan Audey, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Association of Civil Trial Attorneys.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AR8\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Alexandra Schimmer, Solicitor General, and Michael Hendershot, Chief Deputy Solicitor, urging reversal for amicus curiae state of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AvOu\">Paul W.
