At issue is whether the insurance policy underlying this suit is covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461. Because Shearer\u2019s employer did no more than pay the premiums on the policy and ERISA does not regulate the \u201cbare purchase of insurance,\u201d Shearer\u2019s claims are not preempted by ERISA, and the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. Therefore, we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-18\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-19\">Shearer is the 50% owner of Intercontinental Materials Management, Inc. (\u201cIMMI\u201d), as well as an employee of the company. His mother, Christal Shearer (\u201cMs. Shearer\u201d) owns the other 50% of IMMI. On June 10, 2004, Shearer applied for health insurance for himself and his family from Defendant-Appellee Southwest Service Life Insurance Company (\u201cSWSL\u201d). The premiums for the policy were paid by IMMI. Shearer and his mother both stated in their affidavits that this was done for bookkeeping purposes. Some time later, Shearer\u2019s son suffered an injury requiring hospitalization and surgery, and Shearer submitted a claim under his policy to SWSL. Although SWSL paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>for a portion of the claim, Shearer contends that the policy required SWSL to pay for the entire amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Shearer filed suit against SWSL and its agent, Defendant-Appellee Richard Sanders (\u201cSanders\u201d), in Texas state court on March 2, 2007, bringing state law claims of misrepresentation, breach of contract, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and unfair claim settlement practices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SWSL, with Sanders\u2019s consent, removed the case on April 6, 2007. Defendants claimed that the insurance policy at issue was covered by ERISA and thus Shearer\u2019s claims were preempted by ERISA and removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Shortly after removal, the district court struck Sanders as a defendant. Shearer then filed a motion to remand, arguing that his insurance policy was not an ERISA plan. The district court denied the motion without comment. The district court then granted SWSL\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that Shearer\u2019s claims failed to meet the ERISA standard for relief. Shearer now appeals and contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case because the insurance policy was not an ERISA plan. We have jurisdiction to hear his appeal, as a final judgment has been entered. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">As the party removing the case, SWSL bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction. <em>See Boone v. Citigroup, Inc., </em>416 F.3d 382, 388 (5th Cir.2005). In this case, SWSL asserts that federal question jurisdiction exists because ERISA preempts Shearer\u2019s state law claims. SWSL bases this argument on its assertion that the insurance policy at issue is an \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d under ERISA, and ERISA preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan .... \u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a); <em>Peace v. Am. Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>462 F.3d 437, 442 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, we must determine whether Shearer\u2019s insurance policy is an employee benefit plan as defined by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Typically, the existence of an ERISA plan is a question of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>Reliable Home Health Care, Inc. v. Union Cent. Ins. Co., </em>295 F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir.2002). However, when the facts are undisputed, we treat the issue as one of law and review it de novo. <em>See House v. Am. United Life Ins. Co., </em>499 F.3d 443, 448-49 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Jan. 2, 2008)(No. 07-895). Here, there are no factual disputes with respect to the insurance policy or its purchase. Consequently, we review the matter de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">Pursuant to ERISA, an \u201cemployee benefit plan\u201d includes an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(3). ERISA defines an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-15\">any plan, fund, or program which was ... established or maintained by an employer ... to the extent that such plan, fund, or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, (A) medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-16\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1002(1). SWSL contends that Shearer\u2019s insurance policy fits within this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>This court uses a three-prong test to determine whether an employee benefit arrangement meets the definition of an employee welfare benefit plan and, thus, is an ERISA plan. <em>Peace, </em>462 F.3d at 439. To be an ERISA plan, the arrangement must be (1) a plan, (2) not excluded from ERISA coverage by the safe-harbor provisions established by the Department of Labor, and (3) established or maintained by the employer with the intent to benefit employees. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Meredith v. Time Ins. Co., </em>980 F.2d 352, 355 (5th Cir.1993)). Here, Shearer concedes that, under this court\u2019s precedent, his insurance policy constitutes a plan and does not fall within the safe-harbor provisions of the Department of Labor. However, Shearer asserts that his insurance policy fails the third element of the test because it was not established or maintained by IMMI with the intent to benefit employees. <em>See MDPhysicians &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. State Bd. of Ins., </em>957 F.2d 178, 183 (5th Cir.1992) (noting that simply because a plan exists does not mean that the plan is an ERISA plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In the past, we have broken down the third step of our analysis into two elements\u2014(1) whether the employer established or maintained the plan, and (2) whether the employer intended to provide benefits to its employees. <em>Meredith, </em>980 F.2d at 355. \u201cTo determine whether an employer \u2018established or maintained\u2019 an employee benefit plan, \u2018the court should [focus] on the employer ... and [its] involvement with the administration of the plan.\u2019\u201d <em>Hansen v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>940 F.2d 971, 978 (5th Cir.1991). We have stated that \u201cthe purchase [of insurance] is evidence of the establishment of a plan, fund, or program\u201d and that \u201cthe purchase of a policy or multiple policies covering a class of employees offers substantial evidence that a plan, fund, or program has been established.\u201d <em>Mem\u2019l Hosp. Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co., </em>904 F.2d 236, 242 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we have consistently held that if an employer does no more than purchase insurance for its employees and has no further involvement with the collection of premiums, administration of the policy, or submission of claims, the employer has not established an ERISA plan. <em>Hansen, </em>940 F.2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In <em>Taggart Corp. v. Life &amp; Health Benefits Administration, Inc., </em>we held that a company\u2019s purchase of insurance for its lone employee was insufficient to establish an ERISA plan. 617 F.2d 1208, 1211 (5th Cir.1980) (noting that \u201c[t]he corporation did no more than make payments to a purveyor of insurance, patently for tax reasons\u201d). We reached a different result in <em>Memorial Hospital, </em>in which an employer purchased insurance for all of its employees, finding that to be sufficient evidence of an intent to establish and maintain an ERISA plan. 904 F.2d at 242-43. Relying on <em>Memorial Hospital, </em>we held in <em>Kidder v. H &amp; B Marine, Inc., </em>932 F.2d 347, 353 (5th Cir.1991), that an employee benefit plan purchased by the employer for all of its employees was an ERISA plan. In <em>Hansen, </em>we reaffirmed our rule that the purchase of insurance alone is insufficient to demonstrate an ERISA plan, but held that other evidence in that case, such as the employment of a benefits administrator and the issuance of a booklet regarding the plan endorsed by the employer, satisfied the burden of demonstrating the employer\u2019s intent to establish an ERISA plan. 940 F.2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Here, the evidence before the district court demonstrated that IMMI paid the premiums on Shearer\u2019s policy and that IMMI paid the premiums on a separate policy from a different insurance company for Ms. Shearer. IMMI, however, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>pay for insurance for any of IMMI\u2019s other employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The facts of this case, therefore, fall somewhere between <em>Taggart </em>and the other cases described above. Considering all of the facts and our precedent, we conclude that IMMI\u2019s payment of premiums on two separate policies for two different employees, while not providing insurance for any other employees, is not sufficient evidence of IMMI\u2019s intent to establish or maintain an ERISA plan. The plans in <em>Memorial Hospital </em>and <em>Kidder </em>were purchased for all of the company\u2019s employees, which lends greater support to the argument that a plan existed. Here, however, the alleged plan covered Shearer, with a different policy covering his mother. This is not sufficient to demonstrate that IMMI intended to establish and maintain a plan to benefit its employees. Consequently, there was no ERISA plan at issue, and the district court lacked jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">Defendants incorrectly assert that <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co. v. Sharpless, </em>364 F.3d 634 (5th Cir.2004), is binding in this situation. The issue in <em>Sharpless </em>was not whether the employer established or maintained an ERISA plan. Instead, the court in <em>Sharpless </em>was concerned with whether shareholding doctors could be considered \u201cemployees\u201d for purposes of establishing and maintaining an ERISA plan \u201cfor the benefit of employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638. The court held that the shareholders could be considered employees. <em>Id. </em>at 639. In this case, Shearer does not dispute that he may be considered an employee under ERISA, despite owning 50% of IMMI. Therefore, <em>Sharp-less </em>is not dispositive of the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Because IMMI\u2019s payment of premiums alone is insufficient to create an ERISA plan, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. We therefore VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">.
