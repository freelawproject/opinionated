Edgar Leahey, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AolN\">The Act of January 30, 1874, P. L. 31, section 13, as amended finally by the Act of 1923, P. L. 267, is not repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States in its application to returns in congressional elections: Congressional District Nomination, 268 Pa. 313; Carbondale Election, 280 Pa. 159.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-7\"><em>Ira Jewell Williams </em>and <em>J. Earl Ogle, Jr., </em>with them <em>Walter W. Krebs, Alvin Sherbine, Frank P. Barnhart, A. Carson Simpson </em>and <em>Francis Shunk Brown, </em>for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>pellee. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGi\">This court has in effect determined that the house of representatives is the proper tribunal to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members: Com. v. Emminger, 74 Pa. 479; McNeill\u2019s Election, 111 Pa. 235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-4\">Since each house of Congress is the judge of the elections returns and qualifications of its own members, no contest lies in a state court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">The house, being the tribunal created by the federal Constitution, with its practice regulated by act of Congress and standing rules, its jurisdiction is exclusive in contested cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">Such an election contest in a state court would be futile and farcical. Recounting the ballots in the St. Michael\u2019s Election District, with the box in the condition in which it was when brought into court, is permissible only in an election contest, whether the certificate of election be for a state office, or for congressman under the existing laws in relation thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\">Any procedure which in substance partakes of the essence of an election contest, in whole or in part, is reserved to Congress when the certificate involved is for the office of congressman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">While the legislature, in respect to state offices, may impose on computation boards jurisdiction and powers essentially those of a court trying phases of a contested election case, the legislature will be presumed not to intend to attempt to confer such jurisdiction in respect of representatives in Congress, \u2014 just as the legislature will not be presumed to have included the office of representative in congress in any general law providing for plenary election contests.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\">To attempt to clothe a computation board in respect to the office of representative in Congress with the powers and jurisdiction of a court sitting in even a partial or quasi contested election case would be beyond the scope of the functions of the State, just as much as to attempt to give jurisdiction in a plenary election contest.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ACkB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>December 5, 1924:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b589-3\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The judges who heard this case are equally divided in opinion on the question as to whether or not the votes in the ballot box of St. Michael\u2019s Election District could legally be counted by the board computing the returns; when these ballots are considered and the returns changed according to the recount, Bailey is entitled to the certificate of election, but when not, Walters is entitled to receive it. This court being divided on the question of the legal right to count the votes involved, it follows that the order appealed from must stand as made and the certificate issue to Anderson H. Walters; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
