Edgar Leahey, claiming to be \u201ctrustee and attorney-in-fact for Margaret B. O\u2019Connor [hereinafter called the defendant], under a certain [written] agreement.\u201d The bill recited that Francis J. O\u2019Connor died August 13,1920, testate; that, after sundry bequests, he devised the residue of his estate to his widow, the defendant, absolutely and in fee; that, on the day of the execution of his will, April 8, 1920, the written agreement in controversy was entered into between testator, defendant, plaintiff and Peter J. Little (cross-plaintiff), whereby it was agreed that defendant would appoint Little and Leahey as her trustees and attorneys-in-fact to manage the estate left to her under the will and would authorize them \u201cto sell, convey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and dispose of the same [with certain exceptions] as they should deem proper and advantageous.\u201d The bill avers, \u201csaid written agreement\u201d provides that, \u201cin consideration of the execution of the will aforesaid,\u201d defendant would, \u201cat any time, upon request\u201d of plaintiff and cross-plaintiff, convey to them the property devised to her by the will of Francis J. O\u2019Connor, \u201cto the intent that the residue of such estate should [eventually] be distributed to the collateral heirs\u201d of testator, but upon condition that the grantees would, as trustees, pay to defendant, \u201cout of the income or principal of said estate in their hands,\u201d a monthly sum to meet her living requirements. Plaintiff then avers that, though the name of Little (cross-plaintiff) is mentioned in the written agreement, he did not join in its execution, and had subsequently \u201cdeclared he would not act as trustee thereunder\u201d ; that this action left plaintiff as the one solely entitled to enforce the agreement against defendant; that he had made demand on the latter to execute and deliver to him proper deeds of conveyance and bills of sale of the real and personal estate involved, with which demand she had refused to comply. The bill prays \u201cthat defendant be ordered......to perform specifically her covenants under said written agreement.....by executing and delivering unto [plaintiff] proper deeds of conveyance and bills of sale, so as to vest in [him, as trustee,] all of the estate......of which the said Francis J. O\u2019Connor died seized or possessed, subject to the reservations......and......conditions......set out in said agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">Defendant\u2019s answer, while admitting many of the facts recited in the bill, states that the contents of the alleged agreement were unknown to her when she signed it; that her signature had been secured by \u201cfraud and concealment\u201d of material facts and legal rights; therefore the writing was not binding upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">The cross-bill of Peter J. Little, \u2014 who was first permitted to intervene as a defendant, \u2014 follows the lines of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the original bill, but recites the additional fact that an arrangement quite like the one contempated by the documents now before the court was entered into by the O\u2019Connors five years previous thereto, and had been evidenced by somewhat similar writings at that time. The cross-plaintiff alleges that testator made his will, \u201cin consideration of the execution by his said wife of the [contemporaneous] agreement......and in reliance upon her good faith [and] willingness......to fully perform and carry out the same......[and that she], by her voluntary execution and delivery of said agreement, contemporaneously with the execution by said testator of his will, induced the latter to make and publish his will devising the residue of his estate to defendant.\u201d Finally, the cross-bill sets forth and describes the real estate left by testator, with averments as to values, and states that, \u201csince the death of said Francis J. O\u2019Connor, said defendant has been......in possession of all the real estate owned by said testator and has collected and received the rents and profits thereof......and [that she] wrongfully, illegally and fraudulently claims to be the absolute owner of all the estate, real and personal, of said testator, subject to the pecuniary legacies mentioned in said will.\u201d The prayers of the cross-bill are for a conveyance by defendant to Little and Leahey of the estate devised to her by testator, to be held in trust by them for the purposes mentioned in the agreement; for an injunction and an accounting; and, \u201cif for any reason it should appear that defendant is not legally and equitably bound to carry out and perform said agreement in toto, and that [she] is entitled to the interest in the estate of said testator secured to her under the intestate laws,\u201d then for partition of the real estate left by testator according to the rights of the parties entitled thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The answer to the cross-bill denies that defendant had any greater knowledge of the previous arrangement concerning the disposition of her husband\u2019s property than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>she had of the alleged agreement of 1920; and, as to the latter, defendant avers that she was \u201cunaware of the contents and purport of said paper when the same was signed\u201d by her. She further states that her rights as a wife were not explained to her, and that neither the extent of the estate of Francis J. O\u2019Connor nor her rights therein were disclosed to her by testator, plaintiff or any other person. Defendant particularly denies that testator\u2019s will was made in consideration of the execution of the alleged agreement or that she had in any manner induced the devise to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The chancellor found the facts as to which there was no controversy substantially as stated in the foregoing recitals. He also found that, originally, the cross-plaintiff had presented for probate both the will and the alleged agreement, claiming that they, together, constituted one testamentary document; that these papers were accepted accordingly and their probate sustained by the orphans\u2019 court, but that, on appeal, our court had held the alleged agreement not to be testamentary in character: see O\u2019Connor\u2019s Est., 273 Pa. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The adjudication also contains, inter alia, the following findings: that O\u2019Connor and plaintiff Leahey, who was the former\u2019s confidential secretary, had for years pursued a \u201cstudied effort\u201d to prevent defendant from \u201cknowing anything about the plan,\u201d represented by the agreement, for the disposition of testator\u2019s estate; that the purpose of this plan was to deprive the widow of her rights under the law, and the Commonwealth of its collateral inheritance tax, and, in the end, to vest testator\u2019s property in persons of his own blood; that, at the time defendant signed the alleged agreement, in her husband\u2019s room at the hospital, she was in such an emotional state as to prevent her understanding its contents had it been read or explained to her, but, as a matter of fact, \u201cthe paper was not read or explained......and she was given no opportunity to read it\u201d; that she was not told and did not know what estate her husband had or what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>her rights were in its disposition; that it was not even intimated to her \u201cthat the paper she was asked to sign in any way affected her interest in her husband\u2019s estate, or that the paper differed in any way from numerous papers she for years had been accustomed to sign, without question, to facilitate the transaction of her husband\u2019s business affairs\u201d; that the papers signed by defendant five years previous to those in controversy were executed under different attending conditions, and defendant was then equally uninformed as to her rights and had no more knowledge of the contents of the prior documents than she afterwards had of those now before the court; that defendant\u2019s husband, even after the execution of the papers in controversy, had assured her, \u201cI am leaving you my entire estate\u201d; that defendant is in absolute possession of all the real estate in controversy and has refused to carry out the alleged agreement to convey it to plaintiff and cross-plaintiff; that \u201ctestator made his will in the form in which it was probated voluntarily and without inducement on the part of defendant by word or deed\u201d; finally, that \u201cdefendant\u2019s signature was obtained by concealment and fraud, to defeat her title under testator\u2019s voluntary will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On the above findings, the chancellor properly concluded that \u201cplaintiffs have no standing in a court of equity to set up the agreement of April 8, 1920,...... defendant is not bound by [it] and cannot be compelled to carry out its provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The chancellor stated and discussed other conclusions of law, apparently in an effort to meet certain issues, sought to be raised by the averments of the cross-bill, as to the effect of the alleged agreement on the rights of plaintiff and the collateral heirs of testator in the estate left by the latter; but, as shown in the following paragraph, it is not necessary to treat of those conclusions in disposing of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The cross-bill was filed by Little as trustee under the alleged agreement, which the chancellor found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>fraudulent and void. As there was no contract, it follows that Little was not a trustee thereunder, and, hence, had no standing to raise the issues which he sought to have adjudicated; consequently, the court below might have dismissed the cross-bill without deciding more than was necessary under the averments of the original bill and answer, \u2014 that is to say, the issues as to alleged fraud; and when they were found in favor of defendant, the chancellor need only have determined their legal results, namely, that plaintiffs had no right to the relief sought, \u2014 or, in other words, no right to enforce the alleged contract against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">True, the cross-bill contains an alternative prayer for partition, but, as a petition for partition, the bill is defective in many respects: (1) it does not name or attempt to name the collateral heirs of testator, or the parties entitled under the intestate laws, which is essential (Ragan\u2019s Est., 7 Watts 438, 439-41: Thompson and Wife v. Stitt, 56 Pa. 156, 159-60; Richards v. Rote, 68 Pa. 248, 251-53; Danhouse\u2019s Est., 130 Pa. 256, 259; Klingensmith\u2019s Est., 130 Pa. 516, 522; while the foregoing are orphans\u2019 court cases, the broad principle involved is equally applicable to all partition proceedings: see also section 9, Act of April 25, 1850, P. L. 569, 571, and Reid v. Clendenning, 193 Pa. 406, 419); (2) it does not aver or endeavor to show the cross-plaintiff\u2019s right to ask partition on behalf of such persons, whoever they may be; (3) it shows that defendant is in sole possession of the real estate in question and that she claims absolute legal title against plaintiffs and all others, thus imparting an element of controversy which ordinarily has no place in a proceeding for partition (Lewis v. Pratt, 2 Wh. 80, 81, 82, 90, 91; Law v. Patterson, 1 W. &amp; S. 184, 193; McMasters v. Carothers, 1 Pa. 324; Bigley v. Jones, 114 Pa. 510, 519; Wister\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 241, 246).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">It is idle to contend that appellant was asserting the equitable title of third parties for whom he acted as trustee under the alleged agreement, and that, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the strict rules which control forms of partition other than those in equity do not apply (Church\u2019s App., 17 W. N. C. 541), for, as already noted in our recital of the pleadings, the prayer of the cross-bill expressly makes the suggested right of partition to depend on the possibility of the court below finding that the so-called agreement lacked validity as binding on defendant and that decedent\u2019s property was distributable under the intestate law. From this latter standpoint, appellants show no right to represent the collateral heirs of testator or to tender issues to be determined for or against their interests. We conclude that the cross-bill was entirely ineffective in its attempt to bring about a partition of the real estate in controversy between defendant and others who might be entitled under the intestate laws, and, since the latter are not parties to the present proceeding, matters which may affect rights claimed by them should be considered only to the extent necessary to decide issues raised by the original bill and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On the pleadings and evidence, and under the findings on the issues of fraud, the court below did not err in refusing to enforce against defendant the alleged written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The above conclusion in effect disposes of all the assignments of error except the thirty-fifth, which complains of a ruling on the evidence. When plaintiff Leahey was on the stand as a witness in his own behalf, he was asked a question as to what sort of discussion he and testator had prior to April, 1920, about drawing the latter\u2019s will. This was objected to \u201cas irrelevant and immaterial and not cross-examination.\u201d Following some talk between counsel and the court, the question was allowed and put to the witness thus, \u201cWhat sort of discussion did you [and testator] have along that line?\u201d To this question the witness answered, \u201cWe talked over different matters that he had intended to insert in the will and this agreement.\u201d After this responsive answer, another question was put: \u201cWhat was the purpose [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>testator] had in mind by having this agreement drawn, as he disclosed it to you?\u201d and, again, \u201cWhat reason did he give?\u201d Answering these questions, and others along the same line, the witness stated facts which were subsequently used by the court below in making its findings on the issues of fraud. Appellant now argues it was wrong to receive this testimony, and he attempts to assign its admission as error, under the exception above noted, which is the oniy exception in this part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">As we read the testimony, the question objected to was fully answered before the evidence now complained of was elicited; but, treating the exception granted appellant as broad enough to cover the testimony in controversy, we cannot sustain appellant\u2019s contention that the witness should have been barred from giving evidence on the ground that he was testifying adversely to the interests of a decedent for whom he had been attorney. In the first place, appellant\u2019s objections stated no such ground of complaint, and, secondly, the evidence indicates that the witness, while a lawyer, acted in the matters under investigation as the private secretary of testator, not as his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The decree dismissing the bills is affirmed at cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
