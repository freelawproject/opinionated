Richardson and Zia P. Richardson to perform a part of the work called for in contract No. I2r-13814 which the said Richardsons had entered into with the defendant. Defendant demurs because plaintiff\u2019s petition fails to allege that this subcontract had any connection with the prosecution of the war effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">For the reasons stated in Richardson et al v. United States, Ct.Cl., 86 F.Supp. 1019, the absence of this allegation makes plaintiff\u2019s petition defective, since relief under the Lucas Act, 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 106 note, is available only to those persons who entered into contracts, within the dates specified, for work in connection with the prosecution of the war effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-13\">For this reason the defendant\u2019s demurrer is sustained and plaintiff\u2019s petition will be dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
