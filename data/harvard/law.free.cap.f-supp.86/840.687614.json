We overruled the demurrer, deciding that the petition stated facts which, assuming them to be true, entitled the plaintiff to recover. Gargaro v. United States, 73 F. Supp. 973, 109 C. Cl. 528, 529.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties thereupon agreed upon a statement of facts, which we have adopted as our findings. These facts are the same, in all essential respects except one, which will be discussed herein, as those recited in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, hence the principal legal problem before us now is the same as the one which the Government\u2019s demurrer presented. The Government has urged us to reconsider the position which we took in that decision, and we have done so, but we have again -come to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">The Government raises one question which was not dealt with in our former decision. It appears from our finding 8 that, in the renegotiation which reduced the profits of the plaintiff\u2019s employer by $240,-000, the employer\u2019s income taxes were, pursuant to Section 3806 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3806, reduced by $227,526.03, so that, in fact, the employer refunded \u00a1to the Government only $12,473.-97. The Government says that the plaintiff\u2019s repayment to his employer should have been only 10% of that amount, or $1,247.-39, and ,his refund of income tax- paid should be computed on the basis of an overstatement of income of only $1,247.39 instead of $24,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">The agreed statement of facts, upon which our findings are based, show that in fact the plaintiff refunded $24,000 to his employer. That, of course, is the strongest possible evidence that the agreement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>parties as to the 10% bonus was unrelated to the question of the amount of the employer\u2019s taxes. Since there is no evidence to the contrary, we conclude that the conduct of the parties was in accordance with their legal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The plaintiff is entitled to a judgment for $19,187.79, with interest as provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">JONES, Chief Judge, and HOWELL and LITTLETON, Judges, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">WHITAKER, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">I dissent for the reasons stated when the case was before us on demurrer (73 F.Supp. 973, 109 C.
