Scott petitioned for relief on the ground that a Florida court resentenced him based on a finding of fact not made by the jury at trial, in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court denied Scott\u2019s petition as successive and untimely, but we vacated that decision and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Scott v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>307 Fed.Appx. 347 (11th Cir.2009). On remand, the district court ruled that the decision of the state court was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">Scott argues that the state court violated his right to a trial by jury by adjudicating him guilty of robbery with a weapon without a specific finding to that effect by a jury, but this argument fails. Under the Florida statute, a defendant is guilty of robbery in the first degree whether he \u201ccarried a firearm or other deadly weapon,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 813.12(2)(a), or \u201ccarried a weapon,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 813.12(2)(b). The jury found Scott guilty of \u201carmed robbery,\u201d but the jury did not make a special finding that he carried a firearm. After collateral review, Scott was resentenced as guilty of robbery with a weapon instead of robbery with a firearm. <em>See Mashburn v. State, </em>745 So.2d 453, 454 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999). We will not review how the state courts reconciles the robbery statute and jury verdicts. <em>See Marshall v. Sec., Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>610 F.3d 576, 583 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c \u2018[Federal courts do not sit to revisit a state supreme court\u2019s judgment as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the trial court complied with state law.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bolender v. Singletary, </em>16 F.3d 1547, 1570 (11th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The district court correctly denied Scott habeas relief because the state court reasonably concluded that Scott\u2019s sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi. </em>The Supreme Court held in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The state court reasonably relied on the verdict of the jury that Scott committed armed robbery to adjudicate Scott guilty of robbery with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Scott\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
