Hutchinson argues that the administrative law judge erred by not finding her depression, anxiety, or a combination of both impairments severe at the second step of the Social Security sequential evaluation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hutchinson also argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision that she can return to her past relevant work. She asserts that substantial evidence shows that she cannot work a 40-hour work week due to chronic incontinence, severe pain from fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety. She submits that she cannot work full-time because she needs to take extra bathroom breaks, preventing her from returning to her past relevant full-time work.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is \u201cdemarcated by a deferential reconsideration of the findings of fact and an exacting examination of the conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). The Commissioner\u2019s \u201cconclusions of law ... are not presumed valid\u201d and are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>but the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance: it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The Social Security regulations provide a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine if a claimant has shown she is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. Hutchinson challenges aspects of the ALJ\u2019s findings at the second and fourth steps of that process. The second step requires the claimant to show that she has an impairment or impairment combination that is severe. <em>See id. </em>The fourth step requires the claimant to prove that she is unable to perform her past relevant work. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">The claimant bears the burden of showing that she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments that may qualify as a disability. <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir.1986). While that burden is \u201cmild,\u201d <em>id., </em>proof of the mere existence of impairments does not prove the extent to which they limit a claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>McCruter v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 1544, 1547 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201c[T]he \u2018severity\u2019 of a ... disability must be measured in terms of its effect upon ability to work, and not simply in terms of deviation from purely medical standards of bodily perfection or normality.\u201d) Impairments alone or in combination are severe if they \u201csignificantly limit the claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to perform basic work skills\u201d like standing, sitting, seeing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>hearing, speaking, using judgment, and following simple instructions. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.921(b). If contrary to other evidence, a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony about pain and other symptoms may be discredited by the ALJ. <em>See Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). But that testimony must be accepted as true if the ALJ fails to articulate reasons for rejecting it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The bulk of the evidence Hutchinson presented about her depression and anxiety was subjective. The ALJ properly articulated reasons supported by substantial evidence that Hutchinson\u2019s subjective testimony about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her symptoms was \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d The scant objective evidence, even if viewed in Hutchinson\u2019s favor, merely established at most that the depression and anxiety existed. She had no objective history of treatment for mental impairments and never sought counseling or hospitalization for her depression or anxiety. She did not objectively show when or how it affected her ability to perform basic work skills. Substantial evidence thus supported the ALJ\u2019s decision that Hutchinson\u2019s alleged depression and anxiety \u201cresulted in no restriction of activities of daily living, no difficulties in maintaining social functioning, and no difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace without episodes of decompensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Hutchinson also argues that the ALJ did not consider her impairments of depression and anxiety in combination. We disagree. The ALJ specifically stated that Hutchinson did not have an \u201cimpairment, individually or in combination\u201d that met one of the listed impairments in evaluating step three of the process. That statement shows that the ALJ considered the combined effects of Hutchinson\u2019s impairments during her evaluation. <em>See Jones v. Dept. of Health and Human Servs., </em>941 F.2d 1529, 1533 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The Social Security regulations place a very heavy burden on the claimant to show an inability to perform past relevant work. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Hutchinson argues that the ALJ improperly gave less weight to the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Richard King, and that the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits is contrary to the testimony of the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Medical opinions are statements from physicians or other medical sources that reflect judgments about the nature and severity of impairments, including symptoms, diagnosis, what the applicant can still do despite her impairments, and any physical or mental restrictions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(a)(2). Opinions from medical sources on some issues are \u201cnot medical opinions\u201d because they are reserved for the Commissioner as \u201cadministrative findings that are dispositive of the case; i.e., that would direct the determination or decision of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1527(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">The opinions of treating physicians, like Dr. King, are generally entitled to more weight than non-treating physicians unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 416.927(d); <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240. Good cause exists when a physician\u2019s opinion is contrary to or unsupported by the evidence of record. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. Where the ALJ articulates specific reasons supported by substantial evidence for not giving the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, no reversible error exists. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">? makes much in her brief of Dr. King\u2019s opinion that her bladder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>incontinence \u201ccauses a great deal of difficulty holding a job.\u201d The ALJ, however, noted that Dr. King gave the opinion in September 2008 and did not see Hutchinson again until May 2005. The ALJ did not give that opinion great weight because after it was rendered, Hutchinson performed missionary work in the Dominican Republic that she said was \u201cvery hard.\u201d Additionally, whether Hutchinson could hold a job is a vocational opinion, not a medical one. That question is reserved to the ALJ. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The ALJ gave great weight to the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that a hypothetical claimant with Hutchinson\u2019s impairments could perform medium work. Hutchinson argues that the ALJ incorrectly ignored the vocational expert\u2019s testimony regarding a second hypothetical claimant who could not perform such work because of four to six extra bathroom breaks a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">That argument misses a key point: the ALJ specifically found that Hutchinson was not that second hypothetical claimant who required numerous extra breaks. As we have already mentioned, the ALJ found Hutchinson\u2019s \u201callegations and subjective symptoms ... out of proportion and inconsistent with the medical evidence and ... not fully credible.\u201d The ALJ articulated specific reasons for those findings, including among other things Hutchinson\u2019s ability to drive and attend to her personal needs, her refusal to complete a urgency/frequency symptom scale for her incontinence, and her ability to perform \u201cvery hard\u201d missionary work in the Dominican Republic. The ALJ reasonably discredited her uncorroborated testimony about her need for numerous bathroom and other breaks during the work day. Substantial evidence thus supports the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity finding that Hutchinson could still perform medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">. Hutchinson also makes a passing reference to her \u201cneck pain\u201d in her brief to this Court. It is unclear what impairment \"neck pain\u201d references because it was not one of the impairments claimed by Hutchinson. She offers no argument to clarify that issue in her brief and has thus abandoned it. <em>See Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.3d 1325, 1330 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that failing to develop argument in the briefs abandons that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
