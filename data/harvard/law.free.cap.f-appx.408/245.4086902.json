The district court concluded correctly that, because the deputies had probable cause to stop and to search Corley\u2019s vehicle, the deputies\u2019 actions violated no constitutional rights and required no suppression of evidence; accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">One evening in 2008, two sheriffs deputies observed Corley\u2019s vehicle driving more slowly than other vehicles on the interstate and \u2014 for no apparent reason\u2014 veering out of and back into its lane. While they followed Corley\u2019s vehicle, police dispatch told the deputies that Corley\u2019s tag number was not on file, prompting the deputies\u2019 suspicion of an invalid tag.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the deputies pulled over Corley\u2019s vehicle, they smelled burnt marijuana and witnessed Corley behaving nervously, failing to look them in the eye, and giggling. In a pat-down search of Corley outside his vehicle, the deputies found a small bag of marijuana in Corley\u2019s pocket. Having found marijuana, the deputies\u2019 searched Corley\u2019s vehicle and discovered a box of cocaine in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Corley\u2019s case comes to us after both the magistrate judge and the district court judge denied Corley\u2019s motion to suppress evidence from the deputies\u2019 search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Ponce-Aldona, </em>579 F.3d 1218, 1221 (11th Cir.2009). We afford considerable deference to the magistrate judge\u2019s and district court judge\u2019s credibility determinations because they are \u201cin a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">Corley first contends that the deputies\u2019 traffic stop of his vehicle was racially motivated and violated his Fourth Amendment rights. A traffic stop is constitutional if it is either based upon probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred or justified by reasonable suspicion that a person is engaged in criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2008). Probable cause requires more than mere suspicion but does not require the same \u201cstandard of conclusiveness and probability as the facts necessary to support a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Here, the magistrate determined that the deputies credibly testified that a lane violation occurred, which provided sufficient probable cause for the deputies to stop Corley\u2019s vehicle. <em>See Rayo-Leon v. State, </em>281 Ga.App. 74, 635 S.E.2d 368, 370 (2006).<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The deputies\u2019 incorrect but rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>sonable belief of a possible tag violation provides another source of probable cause and bolsters \u2014 rather than undermines as Corley contends \u2014 the deputies\u2019 belief that they had probable cause for a stop. <em>See United States v. Chanthasouxat, </em>342 F.3d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). Because the deputies had probable cause for the stop, we need not consider Corley\u2019s claim about a racially motivated pretext for the stop. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774-77, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Corley next contends that his constitutional rights were violated during his detention and pat down after the deputies had stopped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">An officer\u2019s investigation after a traffic stop \u201cmust be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place,\u201d and the stop \u201cmust be limited to the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). But an officer may detain a person for investigation unrelated to the stop\u2019s initial purpose where, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer \u201chas objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity has occurred or is occurring.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>928 F.2d 1113, 1117 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Here, supported by the magistrate judge\u2019s credibility determinations, the deputies possessed reasonable suspicion to justify their further investigation into possible criminal activity because the deputies smelled marijuana when they approached Corley\u2019s vehicle. <em>See United States v. White, </em>593 F.3d 1199, 1203 (11th Cir.2010). Given this reasonable suspicion, the duration of the stop \u2014 less than five minutes between the stop\u2019s beginning and the deputies\u2019 discovery of cocaine \u2014 was constitutionally permissible. <em>See United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1279 (11th Cir.2001). Under the totality of the circumstances, we also see no error in the deputies\u2019 instruction for Corley to exit the vehicle, for the pat down of Corley, or for the seizure of marijuana from Corley\u2019s pocket. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 333 n. 6, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977); <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2137, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993); <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1327 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Last, Corley contends that the deputies\u2019 search of Corley\u2019s trunk violated his Fourth Amendment rights. A warrantless search and seizure of a vehicle is permissible, even without consent, when officers have appropriate probable cause: in this context, \u201cwhen under the totality of the circumstances, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the vehicle.\u201d <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). Because the deputies smelled marijuana and found Corley in possession of marijuana, the totality of the circumstances supported the warrantless search of the trunk here. <em>See United States v. Lueck, </em>678 F.2d 895, 903 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">. The deputies later discovered that this tag search was performed incorrectly and that the tag was legitimate. But this error raises no question about the reasonableness of the deputies\u2019 belief at the pertinent time that Corley\u2019s tag may not have been registered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-17\">. Regardless of the motive, if any, behind the deputies\u2019 alleged thirty-minute delay in telling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Corley that they pulled him over because of the improper lane change, the controlling fact remains that the deputies objectively possessed probable cause for the stop. <em>See Harris, </em>526 F.3d at 1337; <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>418 F.3d 1206, 1210 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005) (disregarding subjective intentions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
