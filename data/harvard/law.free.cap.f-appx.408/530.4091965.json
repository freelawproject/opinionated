For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-25\">In April 2010, Lindsey filed this civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By administrative order dated May 6, 2010, the District Court gave Lindsey thirty days to either pay the $350.00 filing fee or complete an application to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP). Lindsey filed an incomplete IFP application \u2014 it did not include an authorization form \u2014 two weeks later. In June 2010, the District Court dismissed Lindsey\u2019s civil action without prejudice because \u201c[tjhirty (30) days have elapsed from the date of our Order and the Plaintiff has neither filed an authorization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>form nor requested an extension of time in which to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Lindsey then moved for reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s order, claiming that his failure to timely file a complete IFP application was due to forces \u201cbeyond his control.\u201d Lindsey attached to his motion a filled-out authorization form. In July 2010, the District Court denied the motion for reconsideration, concluding that \u201cpetitioner fails to rely on one of three major grounds for reconsideration ... and merely reargues matters addressed by the court and disposed of in the previous order.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court instructed that Lindsey \u201cmay file a new action.\u201d The District Court reinforced that instruction in a footnote to its order, stating that its previous \u201cdismissal was without prejudice to plaintiffs right to refile the action with the appropriate forms.\u201d Lindsey appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We must first consider our jurisdiction. The District Court dismissed Lindsey\u2019s civil action without prejudice. The general rule is that a without-prejudice dismissal \u201cis neither final nor appealable because the deficiency may be corrected by the plaintiff without affecting the cause of action.\u201d <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, 532 </em>F.2d 950, 951 (3d Cir.1976) (per curiam). Here, however, the District Court\u2019s July 2010 order made clear to Lindsey that the defect in his filing could not be cured in the civil action at issue, and that he would have to \u201cfile a new action\u201d to advance his civil rights claims. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir.1995). Therefore, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the District Court\u2019s without-prejudice dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">A District Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to pay fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jones v. Zimmerman, </em>752 F.2d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1985). That same standard is used in reviewing the denial of a motion for reconsideration. <em>See United States v. Dupree, </em>617 F.3d 724, 732 (3d Cir.2010). We may take summary action if an appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 24.7; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Lindsey\u2019s civil action for failure to either pay the associated filing fee or file a completed IFP application. Lindsey\u2019s IFP application was plainly lacking an authorization form, even though the District Court\u2019s May 6, 2010 administrative order explained to Lindsey that the form was a necessary component. The administrative order also indicated that \u201c[a]n application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and an authorization form [were] enclosed\u201d in the District Court\u2019s mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">We also conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lindsey\u2019s motion for reconsideration. \u201cThe purpose of such a motion is to correct a clear error of law or to prevent a manifest injustice in the District Court\u2019s original ruling.\u201d <em>Dupree, </em>617 F.3d at 732. The District Court committed no error of law in dismissing Lindsey\u2019s case. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>we cannot say that there was some manifest injustice latent in the District Court\u2019s decision; Lindsey can refile his complaint, accompanied by the documents that are required to obtain IFP status, at any time within the applicable limitations period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. Appellant\u2019s motion for remand under Rule 27, Fed. R.App. P., is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. The District Court did not consider whether Lindsey\u2019s motion for reconsideration could be construed as a motion for relief from judgment, based on excusable neglect, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1). Any error was harmless, however, because Lindsey's allegations \u2014 that his failure to file an authorization form was the result \"of a lack of information and misfiling\u201d \u2014 are belied by the record. <em>See Nara v. Frank, </em>488 F.3d 187, 193-94 (3d <em>Cir.2007) </em>(\u201cThe test for 'excusable neglect' is equitable, and requires us to weigh the \u2018totality of the circumstances.' \") (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-15\">. Based on Lindsey\u2019s allegations, the earliest complained-of civil rights violation appears to have occurred \"on or about August 14, 2009.\u201d Despite the time exhausted while Lindsey pursued this appeal, he should have no difficulty with timely refiling his complaint. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Holtz, </em>87 F.3d 108, 111 n. 2 (3d Cir.1996) (\"In \u00a7 1983 cases, federal courts apply the state personal injury statute of limitations, which in [Pennsylvania] is two years.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
