Mathis raises substantive challenges to the denial of his motion to revisit arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Government breached a stipulation entered into by both parties regarding the amounts and types of drugs involved in his offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government responds that, pursuant to the unambiguous language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Mathis\u2019s motion to revisit his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions concerning the jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010). Whether a district court has authority to modify and vacate a sentence is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">As we have recently held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-24\">The authority of a district court to modify an imprisonment sentence [once it has been imposed] is narrowly limited by statute. Specifically, [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3582(c) provides that a court may not modify an imprisonment sentence except in these three circumstances: (1) where the Bureau of Prisons has filed a motion and either extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant a reduction or the defendant is at least 70 years old and meets certain other requirements, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A); (2) where anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>er statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 expressly permits a sentence modification, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B); or (3) where a defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Commission and certain other requirements are met, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar7\"><em>Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We conclude that none of the circumstances allowing a district court to modify a sentence are present in the instant case. Although the district court ultimately denied Mathis\u2019s motion to revisit his sentence, it did not have jurisdiction to consider the motion on its merits. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand for the district court to dismiss the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-18\">. We decline to address the substantive challenges to the denial of Mathis\u2019s motion to revisit based on our decision to vacate and remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
