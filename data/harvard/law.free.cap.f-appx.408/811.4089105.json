He also claims that the BIA abused its discretion by not remanding his case so that the IJ could make findings of fact regarding his request for voluntary departure. Lobo-Maradiaga did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his voluntary departure claim by raising it first before the BIA. This court therefore lacks jurisdiction to consider the claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.Bd 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Lobo-Maradiaga also contends that he is entitled to withholding of removal because of past persecution and the likelihood of future persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group (namely, individuals who disagree with the ideology of Honduran gangs) and his political opinion. We review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that Lobo-Maradiaga is not eligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial evidence standard \u201crequires only that the BIA\u2019s decisions be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 863 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show that \u201c \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution on account of one of the five categories mentioned under asylum.\u201d <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)). The protected categories are \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). The determination that Lobo-Maradiaga has not shown membership in a particular social group or political opinion is supported by the record and is substantially reasonable. <em>See Shaikh, </em>588 F.3d at 863. Because he has not demonstrated that any protected ground was a central reason for the alleged persecution, Lobo-Maradiaga has not demonstrated that the IJ and the BIA erred in denying withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
