Kastner asserts several claims arising from the defendants\u2019 December 2009 denial of his application to practice law in Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a magistrate judge granted Kastner leave to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis, </em>the district court dismissed Kastner\u2019s complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Kastner first applied to practice law in Texas shortly after passing the bar examination in 1999. After determining that Kastner lacked the requisite moral character and that he suffered from a chemical dependency, the BLE denied Kastner\u2019s application, but stated that he would be allowed to apply again after July 2001 if he attended a rehabilitation program and refrained from violating the law. Kastner eventually reapplied for admission in 2005. Upon investigation, the BLE reached a preliminary determination that Kastner still lacked good moral character, based in part on two criminal convictions in the intervening years, and that he still suffered from a chemical dependency, based on his failure to attend the rehabilitation program. After a full hearing and a series of delays due to legal action, the BLE issued its final decision denying Kastner\u2019s 2005 application on December 17, 2009. This lawsuit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">This is not Kastner\u2019s first lawsuit challenging the BLE decisions. Kastner filed a materially identical lawsuit in 2007 following the BLE\u2019s preliminary determination that he still lacked good moral character. We ultimately held that the district court lacked jurisdiction over Kastner\u2019s claims at that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to the 2005 application, we held that Kastner\u2019s claims were not ripe for review because the BLE had not yet issued a final decision;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the alternative, we held that <em>Younger </em>abstention prohibited the federal courts from considering Kastner\u2019s constitutional challenges to the state BLE proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the extent Kastner also sought to challenge the denial of his 1999 application, we held that we were barred from hearing those claims by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>holds that \u201clower federal courts lack jurisdiction to review state court judgments when the constitutional claims are \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with [a] challenged state court judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Although Kastner filed the present complaint after the BLE\u2019s final decision, and thus his claims are now ripe, the district court correctly held that the complaint must be dismissed because Kastner remains unable to overcome the bar of <em>Rook-er-Feldman. </em>State bar admissions determinations are judicial proceedings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and any challenge must be raised by appeal to the state appellate courts, not by collateral attack in a federal district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Kastner insists that his claims fall outside of <em>Rook-er-Feldman </em>because he purports to challenge the constitutionality of the BLE rules generally, rather than just their application in his case, but we already held in his prior lawsuit that his complaint can only be understood as an as-applied challenge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because there is no material difference between Kastner\u2019s prior lawsuit and his present complaint for purposes of <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>the district court was correct to dismiss Kastner\u2019s new complaint as frivolous. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\">. Specifically, Kastner alleges that the denial of admission violated his due process rights, his constitutional right to Full Faith and Credit as implement by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, and Tex. Gov.Code \u00a7\u00a7 82.028 and 82.030. He also alleges claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of his civil rights and libel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. <em>See Kastner v. Tex.
