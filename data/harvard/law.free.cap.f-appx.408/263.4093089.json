Villanueva-Ochoa had previously been deported following two convictions for domestic battery \u2014 one of which included punching the pregnant mother of his child in the stomach so hard that she suffered vaginal bleeding. The district court enhanced Villanueva-Ochoa\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because he had been previously deported following an aggravated felony. Villanueva-Ochoa contends that the district court unconstitutionally erred when it enhanced his sentence because his prior felony conviction was not alleged in the indictment or admitted to during the plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the constitutional challenges to a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court held in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>that \u201csubsection [8 U.S.C. 1326(b)(2) ] is a penalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d 523 U.S. 224, 226-227, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although VillanuevaOchoa argues that the Supreme Court has cast doubt on its reasoning in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>that decision has not been overruled. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (\u201c[I]t is arguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided\u201d); <em>but see id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362 (\u201cApprendi does not contest <em>[Almendarez-Torres\u2019] </em>validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today\u201d). \u201cAs we have said several times, unless and until the Supreme Court specifically overrules <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we will continue to follow it.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n.3 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u201d); United States v. Guadamuz-Solis, </em>232 F.3d 1363 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
