Bishop, Texas prisoner # 688987, appeals the summary-judgment dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. In his complaint, he alleged that Dr. David Karney discharged and transferred him out of the Step Down Program, a program for aggressive inmates who are a frequent danger to themselves, in retaliation for his previous litigation against the prison medical staff. Bishop also contended that Karney, in discharging him from the program, was deliberately indifferent to his health and safety and treated him differently than other similarly situated prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">With regard to Zonia Scott, Bishop averred that she confiscated his \u201cself-help law books\u201d in retaliation for his having filed a lawsuit against friends and co-workers. He alleged that Rowland ordered \u201cchemical agents\u201d to be sprayed onto his person in retaliation for his having filed a lawsuit and for filing a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a). When considering whether to grant summary judgment, a court may not determine the credibility of a witness. <em>International Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally\u2019s Inc., </em>939 F.2d 1257, 1263 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">As an initial matter, Bishop does not address the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Rowland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>and Scott or the dismissal of his due process claim. Thus, the claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Bishop first avers that the district court improperly resolved factual disputes in granting summary judgment. He contends that his affidavit \u201csquarely contradicts\u201d the defendants\u2019 summary judgment evidence. Bishop\u2019s argument is entirely conclusional. Bishop does not identify the \u201cfactual disputes\u201d or the alleged contradictions. This court is not required to search the record to find a factual or legal basis for an issue. <em>United States v. Brace, </em>145 F.3d 247, 255 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">With regard to the retaliation claim against Karney, Bishop argues that he established a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether Karney\u2019s decision to transfer him from the Step Down Program was motivated by retaliatory animus. However, he fails to adequately address the district court\u2019s alternative finding that Karney was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">A qualified immunity defense alters the usual summary judgment burden of proof. <em>See Michalik v. Hermann, </em>422 F.3d 252, 262 (5th Cir.2005). Once an official pleads the defense, the burden then shifts to the plaintiff, who must rebut the defense by establishing a genuine fact issue as to whether the official\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly established law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The qualified immunity defense has two prongs: whether an official\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right of the plaintiff; and whether the right was clearly established at the time of the violation. <em>Manis v. Lawson, </em>585 F.3d 839, 843 (5th Cir.2009). A court may rely on either prong of the defense in its analysis. <em>Id. If </em>the defendant\u2019s actions violated a clearly established constitutional right, the court then asks whether qualified immunity is still appropriate because the defendant\u2019s actions were \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d in light of \u201claw which was clearly established at the time of the disputed action.\u201d <em>Collins v. Ainsworth, </em>382 F.3d 529, 537 (5th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). To be clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity, the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. <em>Brown v. Miller, </em>519 F.3d 231, 236 (5th Cir.2008). The unlawfulness of the defendant\u2019s actions must have been readily apparent from sufficiently similar situations, but it is not necessary that the defendant\u2019s exact acts have been illegal. <em>Id. </em>at 236-37. In essence, a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that no reasonable officer could have believed his actions were proper. <em>Babb v. Dorman, </em>33 F.3d 472, 477 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Here, the district court determined that Karney\u2019s action, even if based on erroneous judgment, was objectively reasonable entitling him to qualified immunity. Bishop\u2019s argument on this point consists of only boilerplate recitations of law and a statement that because Karney \u201cacted as a private contractor, under color of state law of Texas,\u201d he was not entitled to qualified immunity. Karney, in his affidavit stated, that he was a licensed psychiatrist who worked for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice under a personal services contract with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. A private doctor under contract with a state prison to provide medical care to prisoners is considered a state actor because his action in providing medical care to prisoners is fairly attributable to the state. <em>See West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 49-50, 54-57, 108 S.Ct. 2250,101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Accordingly, Karney was a state actor entitled to the protections of qualified immunity. Moreover, Bishop provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>no challenge to the district court\u2019s explicit finding that Ramey\u2019s action of transferring him off the Step Down Program was objectively reasonable so as to entitle him to qualified immunity. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bishop\u2019s retaliation claim against Rarney on the basis that he was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Bishop contends that Ramey\u2019s action in transferring him out of the Step Down program exhibited deliberate indifference to his health and safety. Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). Deliberate indifference encompasses only unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain repugnant to the conscience of mankind. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Bishop\u2019s transfer from the Step Down Program did not result in a denial of medical treatment. The record reflects that Bishop received numerous medical visits and ongoing mental health treatment for his self-mutilation. As such, Bishop has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to his deliberate indifference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In sum, the record reflects that Bishop has failed to raise genuine issues of material fact as to his retaliation and his deliberate indifference claims. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and Bishop\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
