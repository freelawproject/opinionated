Ford filed a notice of appeal, and the district court granted him a certificate of appealability (COA) as to whether he had \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right with respect to his claims related to newly discovered evidence and alleged destruction of evidence.\u201d Ford contends Alabama\u2019s post-conviction relief procedures are \u201cfundamentally inadequate to vindicate [his] substantive rights\u201d because the district attorney destroyed evidence, in bad faith and in violation of the Due Process Clause, which could have substantiated his claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-20\">A federal habeas petitioner must obtain a COA from the district court to appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). However, \u201c[w]hen a district court dismisses a petition as time-barred, it is inappropriate to grant a COA on the [underlying] constitutional claim.... \u201d <em>Ross v.
