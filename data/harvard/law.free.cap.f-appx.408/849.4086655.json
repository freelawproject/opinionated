Hernandez-Chaparro was sentenced within his advisory guidelines range to 57 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, is not empirically based and double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. As acknowledged by HernandezChaparro, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Hernandez-Chaparro also contends that his sentence should be vacated as substantively unreasonable because it was based in part on \u00a7 2L1.2 and was greater than necessary to meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Regarding \u00a7 3553(a), Hernandez-Chaparro contends that his sentence overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense and failed to properly reflect his personal history and characteristics. The substantive reasonableness of Hernandez-Chaparro\u2019s sentence is reviewed for plain error because he did not object on that ground in the district court. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007)). Hernandez-Chaparro\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish any error in his sentence, plain or otherwise. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
