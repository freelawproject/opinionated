White, Sr., a state prisoner, filed an <em>in forma pauperis </em>civil rights complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on April 9, 2010. He named as defendants Pennsylvania State Troopers Brian Couch and Alan Collins, among many others. In a lengthy and at times confusing narrative, White alleged the essential facts that Couch and Collins fabricated an arrest warrant on drug charges against him on September 23, 2003. He finally was charged and brought before a magistrate in Butler County on January 9, 2006, and then released on his own recognizance. A preliminary hearing was held on May 5, 2008, at which his bail was continued, and this is where White\u2019s narrative ends. White alleged in the complaint a malicious prosecution claim, in violation of his constitutional rights, in connection with the arrest and his subsequent imprisonment, and he requested that counsel be appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Prior to service of the complaint, the Magistrate Judge filed a Report and Recommendation, in which she concluded that White, a state prisoner, was challenging a conviction which had never been invalidated. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). She recommended dismissal of the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In accordance with the Magistrate\u2019s Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) and (C), and Rule 72.D.2 of the Local Rules for Magistrates, objections to this Report and Recommendation were due by June 2, 2010. On June 4, 2010, the deadline for the filing of objections having passed, the District Court dismissed White\u2019s civil rights complaint under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) (2) (B) (ii), and denied his motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">White appeals. Our Clerk granted him leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and advised him that the appeal was subject to summary dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) or summary action under Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">We will summarily vacate the order of the District Court and remand the matter for further proceedings because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although the District Court was unaware of this, on the same day the court dismissed White\u2019s complaint, his objections were received and filed on the district court docket. It appears the District Court was not advised that the objections had in fact been submitted. Insofar as the objections are dated May 28, 2010 and were mailed from prison on June 2, 2010 (according to the postmark), they may be considered timely filed. White is a prisoner and he thus receives the benefit of the \u201cprison mailbox rule.\u201d <em>See Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">White asserts in his objections that the drug charges brought against him in 2006, which resulted from his arrest in September, 2003, were \u201cnolle prossed\u201d on May 19, 2009, at which point his cause of action accrued. The term of imprisonment he currently is serving involves a conviction he did not intend to challenge in his civil rights complaint. <em>See </em>Objections, at 8, 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>In elucidating his claim of malicious prosecution, White states: \u201cThe defendants Brian Couch and Alan Collins fabricated a drug charge against the plaintiff in September of 2003, and for 5 years and six months used the fabricated charge to violate plaintiffs constitutional rights and conspired with a number of other defendants who assisted in the false arrest, false imprisonment and official oppression.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 6. White attached a copy of a state court order to his objections, and the order indicates that a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County gave permission on May 19, 2009 to enter a <em>Nolle Prosequi </em>in the criminal case against White docketed at CP-10-CR-0000099-2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">A state prisoner\u2019s section 1983 action is barred, no matter the relief sought, if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (citing <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364). As a prerequisite to a civil suit, a plaintiff must prove that his conviction and sentence have been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. A claim bearing the necessary relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been invalidated is not cognizable. <em>See id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the criminal case docketed at CP-10-CR-0000099-2006 on May 19, 2009 raises the question whether it constitutes a favorable termination in White\u2019s malicious prosecution case, and, if it does, whether <em>Heck </em>applies to bar White\u2019s civil rights action. We leave this question to the District Court. Because the District Court did not consider the merits of White\u2019s objections, we will remand for its consideration in the first instance. <em>See Grandison v. Moore, </em>786 F.2d 146, 149 (3d Cir.1986). The abandonment of proceedings may not indicate a favorable termination if it \u201cresults from: an agreement or compromise with the accused; misconduct on the part of the accused in order to prevent trial; or the impossibility or impracticability of having the accused tried.\u201d <em>Washington v. Summerville, </em>127 F.3d 552, 557 (7th Cir.1997) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 660, 661 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We realize that the District Court did not specifically adopt the Report and Recommendation as the Opinion of the Court in dismissing White\u2019s complaint, and thus the court may have dismissed the action on some basis other than <em>Heck. </em>Nevertheless, on remand the District Court should consider White\u2019s objections since they were timely filed without the court\u2019s knowledge. We express no view whatever on the proper disposition of White\u2019s case under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily vacate the order of the District Court and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
