Kay, </em>359 F.3d 738, 742 (5th Cir.2004). This court reviews a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen a detention hearing under \u00a7 3142(f) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hare, </em>873 F.2d 796 (5th Cir.1989). A detainee is entitled to reopen his detention hearing only if he presents new and material evidence bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure his appearance at trial. <em>See id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-20\">Simpson contends that he has presented new and material evidence: the length of his detention, the results of a polygraph examination showing that he has no intent to flee, the conditions of his confinement, and the large amount of discovery in his case. Simpson has failed to establish that this information is new and material; therefore, he has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen under \u00a7 3142(f). <em>See id. </em>at 798-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">Simpson also contends that he is entitled to automatic review of his detention under \u00a7 3164, which pertains to persons detained pending trial and which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-22\">(b) The trial of any person described in subsection (a)(1) [a detained person who is being held in detention solely because he is awaiting trial] ... of this section shall commence not later than ninety days following the beginning of such continuous detention.... The periods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>delay enumerated in [18 U.S.C.] section 3161(h) are excluded in computing the time limitation specified in this section, (c) Failure to commence trial of a detainee as specified in subsection (b), through no fault of the accused or his counsel ... shall result in the automatic review by the court of the conditions of release. No detainee, as defined in subsection (a), shall be held in custody pending trial after the expiration of such ninety-day period required for the commencement of his trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In this regard, the district court relied on language contained in \u00a7 3164(b) that states that the periods of delay enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h) are excluded in computing the time limitations specified in \u00a7 3164. The district court determined that, because it granted an \u201cends-of-justice\u201d continuance under \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) due to the complexity of the case, the delay was excluded from the 90-day time limitation prescribed by \u00a7 3164(b). The district court concluded that, because fewer than 90 days had elapsed between Simpson\u2019s arrest and its order designating the case as complex, \u00a7 3164(c) did not require Simpson\u2019s release or the review of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">This court agrees with the district court that the \u201cends-of-justice\u201d continuance, which is properly excludable under \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A), resulted in Simpson not being entitled to automatic review of his pretrial detention under \u00a7 3164(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3164(b); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A). This conclusion is consistent with the holding in two Ninth Circuit opinions. <em>See United States v. Avila, </em>Nos. 90-30221, 90-30385, 90-30386, 90-30401, 1992 WL 75236, *13 (9th Cir. Apr. 16, 1992) (unpublished) (determining that because the district court granted an \u201c \u2018ends-of-justice\u2019 \u201d continuance, which was excludable under \u00a7 3161(h)(8), the court\u2019s failure to conduct an automatic review of appellants\u2019 pretrial detention did not violate \u00a7 3164(c)); <em>see also United States v. Dutkel, </em>No. 88-5465, 1990 WL 127618, *2 (9th Cir. Sept. 6, 1990) (unpublished) (determining that because the district court granted an \u201c\u2018ends-of-justice\u2019\u201d continuance, \u00a7 3164(c)\u2019s automatic review provision did not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
