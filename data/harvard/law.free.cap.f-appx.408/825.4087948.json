Arreaga argues that the BIA erred in determining that he had not established entitlement to withholding of removal under the INA. Arreaga does not challenge the BIA\u2019s decision that his asylum application was untimely. He has therefore abandoned any such challenge. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-22\">Arreaga complained in his application of threats of violence and extortion by gang members who did not act under official sanction. The actions of the gang members, he argued, constituted persecution. However, Arreaga\u2019s refusal to give money to gang members in exchange for not being beaten up does not qualify him as a member of a protected social group. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, the evidence in the record does not establish a clear probability of persecution if Arreaga is returned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Guatemala. <em>See id.; Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Our review of the record shows that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Arreaga\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b853-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
