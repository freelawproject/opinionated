He claims that he will be persecuted by a gang, a member of which is related to a family that Amaya holds responsible for the murder of his foster-father. According to Amaya, his foster-father was murdered, and he and his family were threatened by the gang member\u2019s family, following the breakup of a marriage between Amaya\u2019s foster-sister and the gang member\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal for substantial evidence and will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). To qualify for withholding of removal, the alien \u201cmust demonstrate a \u2018clear probability\u2019 of persecution upon return.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d </em>132, 138 (5th Cir.2004) (citation omitted). At a minimum, there must be some particularized connection between the feared persecution and the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">The BIA determined that Amaya had not shown any such particularized connection, and Amaya does not assert such a connection in his petition for review. The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Amaya was threatened due to a personal dispute between his family and that of the gang member rather than due to any connection with a statutorily-protected ground is supported by substantial evidence. Put differently, the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to that reached by the BIA. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
