The district court dismissed her complaint on the ground that it was not timely filed within the 60-day statute of limitations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and that she was not entitled to equitable tolling. On appeal, she contends that the district court erred in determining that she failed to show extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">We have held that while \u201cequitable tolling may apply to \u00a7 405(g)\u2019s statute of limitations, before a court may do so it must apply \u2018traditional equitable tolling principles.\u2019 And traditional equitable tolling principles require that the claimant demonstrate <em>extraordinary circumstances, </em>such as fraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, more than a showing <em>of good </em>cause is required to meet this standard, and we accordingly held in <em>Jackson </em>that the claimant was not entitled to equitable tolling because she failed to show that extraordinary circumstances contributed to her mistakenly filing her complaint in state rather than federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 1355-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">On appeal, Collier-Fluellen emphasizes that the Social Security Administration took nearly seven years to adjudicate her claim, and that this undue delay has the effect of precluding her from filing a new administrative claim. She further points out that allowing her claim to proceed on the merits would not prejudice the Commissioner. However, it is undisputed that the reason why Collier-Fluellen\u2019s complaint was not timely filed was because her attorney miscalculated the filing deadline. Unfortunately, such negligence on the part of her attorney does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance. <em>See id. </em>at 1355-56 (citing <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir.1999)). Accordingly, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-16\">. \"The question of whether equitable tolling applies is a legal one subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Jackson v.
