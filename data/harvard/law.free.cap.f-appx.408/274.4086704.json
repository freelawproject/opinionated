On appeal, Phillips argues that the district court effectively rejected his plea agreement that dismissed three counts against him by imposing a sentence that would have been within the guideline range had there not been a plea agreement. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">We review a variance from the guideline range for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will not reverse a district court so long as its ruling \u201cdoes not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-18\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider other \u00a7 3553(a) factors under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1188-90 (11th Cir.2008). The other \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; the kinds of sentences available; the Sentencing Guidelines range; pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>weight accorded to the \u00a7 8553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Extraordinary justification is not required for a sentence outside the guidelines range, but the district court should explain why the variance is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justification to support the degree of variance. <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1238. The \u201cjustification for the variance must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1187 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727). We \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We may \u201cvacate a sentence because of the variance only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Shaw, 560 </em>F.3d at 1238 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Comparing the sentence imposed against the statutory maximum sentence is one indication of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006). In imposing a variance in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), it is permissible for the district court to consider conduct that had already been considered in calculating the defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable, considering both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Contrary to Phillips\u2019s contention that the district court did not \u201caccept\u201d his plea agreement because it imposed a sentence that was within the guideline range had there not been a plea agreement, a review of the record indicates that the court accepted his plea agreement and imposed an upward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court said that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1281 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that a \u201ccourt need not state on the record that it has considered each of the \u00a7 3353(a) factors,\u201d and an acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3353(a) factors will suffice). It also explained why the variance was appropriate here with sufficient justification to support the degree of variance. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187. Further, Phillips\u2019s 38-month sentence was well below the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 751-52. Considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the discretion accorded to the district court in evaluating and weighing those factors, the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying an upward variance of 17 months above the top of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
