We will affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">Because we solely write for the parties, we will only briefly summarize the essential facts. Yummi was arrested in October 2008 due to his involvement in an identity theft ring. Yummi and his co-conspirators, under the guise of operating a collection agency, had gathered personal identifying information for potential victims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>from commercial databases, and then used that information to deplete the victims\u2019 bank accounts and credit lines. On July-16, 2009, Yummi waived his right to an indictment and entered a plea of guilty to a two-count information charging him with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and aggravated identify theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1349,1028A(a)(l), and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The District Court held a sentencing hearing on January 25, 2010. At that hearing, Yummi made two arguments that are relevant for purposes of this appeal. First, Yummi maintained that Application Note 2 of \u00a7 2B1.6 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) precluded the consideration of any specific offense characteristics in this case. Second, Yummi posited that there was insufficient evidence to support the two-level upward adjustment required if the offense involved ten or more victims. Yummi specifically objected to the District Court\u2019s reliance on a series of redacted emails submitted by the Government as \u201cExhibit A\u201d to a letter dated January 21, 2010. <em>See </em>Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) at 46-64. These emails, either sent from or received by the \u201cJJRado\u201d e-mail account, identified various individuals through personal identification information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and credit card numbers. Although Yummi did not dispute that the JJRado account was his email account or that the emails were genuine, Yummi argued that the redacted emails were insufficient to establish that at least ten victims were involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The District Court rejected both of these arguments. Applying upward adjustments for the specific offense characteristics, which included intended loss, the use of sophisticated means, and a two-level adjustment for a scheme involving ten or more victims, the District Court calculated Yummi\u2019s total offense level to be at twenty-two.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court ultimately sentenced Yummi to a term of fifty-six months for the conspiracy to commit bank fraud count and a consecutive term of twenty-four months for the aggravated identity theft count, for a total of eighty months of imprisonment. The District Court also ordered Yummi to pay $80,000 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Yummi now appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The District Court possessed jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">\u201cOur responsibility on appellate review of a criminal sentence is limited yet important: we are to ensure that a substantively reasonable sentence has been imposed in a procedurally fair way.\u201d <em>United States v. Levinson, </em>543 F.3d 190, 195 (3d Cir.2008). We therefore must first determine whether the District Court committed \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d for example, by \u201cfailing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see United States v. Smalley, </em>517 F.3d 208, 214 (3d Cir.2008). In conducting this procedural assessment, \u201c[w]e review alleged factual errors for clear error but exercise plenary review over \u2018purely legal\u2019 errors, such as a misinterpretation of the Guidelines or the governing case law.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>595 F.3d 498, 526 (3d Cir.2010) (citation omitted). If the District Court\u2019s decision is procedur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ally sound, we then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence \u201cunder an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On appeal, Yummi argues that the District Court committed two procedural errors during sentencing. First, Yummi contends that the District Court clearly erred in determining that Yummi\u2019s offense involved ten or more victims. Second, Yummi asserts that the District Court misinterpreted the Guidelines by failing to read Application Note 2 of \u00a7 2B1.6 as precluding the imposition of any specific offense characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We will discuss each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Information used as a basis for sentencing under the Guidelines must have \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); <em>see United States v. Brothers, </em>75 F.3d 845, 848 (3d Cir.1996). Yummi argues that, pursuant to this standard, the District Court clearly erred in relying on Exhibit A to the Government\u2019s January 21, 2010 letter in applying a two-level enhancement for offenses that involve ten or more victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">As an initial matter, it is necessary to review briefly the statutory definitions at issue. According to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A) of the Guidelines, a two-level enhancement is applied if the offense \u201cinvolved 10 or more victims.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A). A \u201cvictim,\u201d for \u201c[c]ases [i]nvolving [m]eans of [identification,\u201d is defined in relevant part as \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 4(E). \u201c \u2018Means of identification\u2019 has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual (i.e., not fictitious) individual.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. And under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7), \u201cmeans of identification\u201d includes, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any ... name, social security number, date of birth, [and] official State or government issued driver\u2019s license or identification number.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">Pursuant to these definitions, we see no clear error in the District Court\u2019s reliance on Exhibit A to conclude that Yummi\u2019s scheme involved ten or more \u201cvictims.\u201d As noted, Exhibit A to the Government\u2019s January 21, 2010 letter is a compilation of various emails sent from and received by the JJRado email account. Yummi disputes neither his ownership of the account nor the authenticity of the emails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those emails, partially redacted to protect those involved, identify more than ten individuals through \u201cmeans of identification\u201d such as names, addresses, birth dates, and credit card numbers. The District Court did not clearly err in determining that these individuals constitute \u201cvictims\u201d under a \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d standard, given that Yummi, at the very least, \u201cused\u201d these identities \u201cwithout authority\u201d by either receiving or transferring their \u201cmeans of identification\u201d through the JJRado email account. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Yummi next objects to the District Court\u2019s interpretation of Application Note 2 of \u00a7 2B1.6 of the Guidelines. That note provides that \u201c[i]f a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic <em>for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification </em>when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.6 cmt. n. 2 (emphasis added). Yummi argues that since he was sentenced for both aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, the application note prohibits the consideration of any specific offense characteristics when calculating his range under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Yummi\u2019s proffered interpretation is contradicted by the plain text of Application Note 2. The note does not, as Yummi contends, prohibit the application of <em>all </em>specific offense characteristics, but rather only those specific offense characteristics that are based on \u201cthe transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification.\u201d Here, the District Court granted upward adjustments for intended loss, the use of sophisticated means, and the number of victims. None of these specific offense characteristics pertain to \u201cthe transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification,\u201d and thus are not forbidden by the text of the note.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the District Court did not erroneously consider any special offense characteristics in sentencing Yummi.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\">. The District Court calculated Yummi's sentence using the November 1, 2009 Guidelines. The parties stipulated to this below, and, on appeal, neither party challenges the District Court's reliance on the 2009 Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. This appeal thus presents a stark contrast to the case cited by Yummi, <em>United States v. Miele, </em>989 F.2d 659 (3d Cir.1993), in which we held that the unsworn, uncorroborated, and inconsistent testimony of a drag-addicted co-conspirator did not meet the \"sufficient indicia of reliability\u201d standard. <em>See id. </em>at 665-66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\">. As the Government points out, the District Court did not grant an upward adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10), which does pertain to \"the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification\u201d and thus would be precluded from consideration as a specific offense characteristic pursuant to Application Note 2 of \u00a7 2B1.6 of the Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. Yummi argues that the putative procedural deficiencies preclude effective reasonableness review in this case. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17-18. For the reasons discussed, we see no procedural error in the District Court\u2019s sentencing of Yummi. We thus reach the issue of reasonableness and hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a substantially unreasonable sentence. The District Court meaningfully considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sufficiently stated its reasons for the sentence imposed, fashioning a sentence appropriate to the circumstances of Yummi\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
