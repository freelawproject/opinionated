After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Manzo first argues that the ALJ incorrectly identified her visual impairment as \u201cglaucoma with a history of bilateral cataract surgeries.\u201d We review the ALJ\u2019s ruling, not the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Shinn ex rel. Shinn v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>391 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cWhen, as in this case, the ALJ denies benefits and the [Appeals Council] denies review, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We do not reweigh evidence, decide facts anew, or make credibility findings. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, we review the entire record to determine whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997), but less than a preponderance, and is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. But the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law are subject to \u201cexacting examination.\u201d <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">The Social Security regulations set forth the following five-step \u201csequential evaluation\u201d process to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) the disability examiner determines whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d; (2) if not, the examiner decides whether the claimant\u2019s condition or impairment is \u201csevere,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>whether it significantly limits the claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities; (3) if so, the examiner decides whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Impairments (\u201cListing\u201d), thereby precluding any gainful work activity; (4) if the claimant has a severe impairment that does not meet or equal the severity of an impairment in the Listing, the examiner assesses a claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), which measures whether a claimant can perform past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) if the claimant is unable to do past relevant work, the examiner determines whether, in light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, the claimant can perform other work. <em>See Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c)-(f), 416.920(c)-(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The ALJ in this case determined (1) that Manzo had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since she filed her application for SSI on May 18, 2005; (2) that she had hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and \u201cglaucoma with a history of bilateral cataract surgeries,\u201d which were all severe impairments, as well as anxiety, which was a non-severe impairment; (3) that none of the impairments met or equaled a listed impairment; and (4) that she had the RFC to perform her past relevant work as a sewing machine operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Manzo argues that the ALJ erred at step two by incorrectly identifying her severe impairment as \u201cglaucoma with a history of bilateral cataract surgeries\u201d rather than \u201ccataracts, the cataract surgeries themselves, and the period of recovery from those surgeries,\u201d and therefore improperly failed to consider her visual impairments resulting from the cataracts and cataract surgeries when determining her RFC at step four. Manzo contends that her impairment was not a \u201chistory\u201d of bilateral cataract surgeries during the relevant time period, which was June 2005 through September 2006,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because her cataract impairment did not improve until March 22, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">We reject this argument. The ALJ properly considered Manzo\u2019s visual impairments during the relevant time period and found that her \u201cvision remains more or less intact (20/40).\u201d As the district court explained, this \u201cobservation ... accounts for the periods before and after [Manzo\u2019s] cataract surgeries.\u201d The record reveals that from February 2005 until her cataract surgeries in March and April of 2006, Manzo\u2019s vision was between 20/40 and 20/50 in both eyes. In her post-operative visits in May 2006, Manzo\u2019s vision had improved to 20/20 in both eyes. We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s assessment of Manzo\u2019s vision during the relevant time period and that the ALJ did not err by classifying Manzo\u2019s impairment as \u201ca history of bilateral cataract surgeries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Manzo also appears to argue that the ALJ erred at step four of the sequential evaluation by not including Manzo\u2019s claimed visual limitations in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) to determine Manzo\u2019s RFC. \u201cIn order for a [VE\u2019s] testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). The ALJ must instruct the VE to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>consider all \u201csevere\u201d impairments when eliciting testimony. <em>Pendley v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 1561, 1563 (11th Cir.1985). But \u201cthe ALJ [i]s not required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ had properly rejected as unsupported.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ did not need to include Manzo\u2019s claimed visual limitations in the hypothetical question because, as explained above, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s rejection of these claimed limitations during the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Manzo next argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision not to credit Manzo\u2019s testimony that she suffered from headaches and vision problems as a result of her glaucoma. To establish disability through her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, Manzo needed to show \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225. The ALJ must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for discrediting testimony concerning subjective complaints, <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005), and cannot discredit testimony as to the intensity or persistence of pain and fatigue solely based on the lack of objective medical evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529(c)(2), 416.929(c)(2); <em>see also Todd v. Heckler, </em>736 F.2d 641, 642 (11th Cir.1984) (explaining that pain alone may be disabling and that it is improper for an ALJ to require objective medical evidence to support a claim of disabling pain).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The ALJ properly stated the specific reasons for discrediting Manzo\u2019s testimony that she suffered from headaches and vision problems. The ALJ found, \u201cbased on a consideration of the entire case record,\u201d that Manzo\u2019s testimony concerning the severity, intensity and limiting effects of the symptoms of her impairment were not credible because they conflicted with Manzo\u2019s RFC, which assigned no visual limitations. The ALJ explained that Manzo had not regularly reported chronic headaches to her treating doctor. While Manzo did report blurriness, floaters and difficulty reading during her cataract evaluation pri- or to her surgeries, the ALJ concluded from the record that Manzo\u2019s \u201cvision remains more or less intact (20/40)\u201d and emphasized that \u201cno treating or examining source ha[d] offered limitations greater than those found [in Manzo\u2019s RFC].\u201d We conclude that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that the testimony that Manzo suffered from headaches and vision problems was not credible to the extent that it was inconsistent with the contrary evidence underlying the RFC assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Manzo also argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Manzo\u2019s anxiety was not severe. With regard to step two of the sequential process, an impairment is \u201csevere\u201d if it \u201csignificantly limits claimant\u2019s physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d <em>Crayton, </em>120 F.3d at 1219. An impairment is not severe if it is a \u201cslight abnormality\u201d that has \u201ca minimal effect on the individual that ... would not be expected to interfere with the individual\u2019s ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or work experience.\u201d <em>Brady v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 914, 920 (11th Cir.1984). Although the claimant bears the burden of showing severity, the burden is mild, such that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>claimant need only show her impairment is \u201cnot so slight and its effect is not so minimal\u201d as to be trivial. <em>McDaniel v. Bowen, </em>800 F.2d 1026, 1031 (11th Cir.1986). Severity is measured based on its effect upon ability to work, \u201cnot simply in terms of deviation from purely medical standards of bodily perfection or normality.\u201d <em>McCruter v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 1544, 1547 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">? conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Manzo failed to carry her burden of establishing that her anxiety constituted a severe mental impairment, instead of a \u201cslight abnormality.\u201d The ALJ noted in particular that Manzo had never been referred for mental health treatment. <em>See Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 295 (5th Cir.1992) (holding that ALJ\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s mental impairment was not severe was supported by substantial evidence where the record \u201cd[id] not ... disclose that treatment has been recommended for her condition\u201d). Manzo argues the ALJ failed to consider the possibility that her family physician decided not to refer her for mental health treatment because the physician knew that Manzo\u2019s insurance would not cover the treatment. But this is pure speculation, as Manzo has pointed to no evidence in the record to suggest that the lack of a referral was due to her inability to pay. We therefore conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Manzo failed to establish that her anxiety was a severe mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">For all of these reasons, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\">. The parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by a United States Magistrate Judge in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">. SSI benefits cannot be paid until the month after an application is filed and all other requirements for eligibility are met. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.335. Manzo filed her application for SSI in May 2005, so the relevant time period begins in June 2005. Once a claimant reaches age 65, she can qualify for SSI based on age rather than disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.202. Because Manzo\u2019s application was still pending when she turned 65 in September 2006, the ALJ concluded that she would be eligible to receive payments beginning in October 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
