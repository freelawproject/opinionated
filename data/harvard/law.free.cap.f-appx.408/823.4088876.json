Jimenez argues that the sentence imposed is procedurally unreasonable because the district court relied on a clearly erroneous fact and because the district court inadequately explained the sentence. He also asserts that the sentence imposed is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">This court reviews sentencing decisions for reasonableness, applying an abuse-ofdiseretion standard. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Appellate courts must first ensure that the district court did not commit procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 764. The term \u201cprocedural error\u201d includes \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range ... [or] selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\u201d 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Because we conclude that a procedural error occurred here that was not harmless, we do not reach the other issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Both sides agree that the district court correctly calculated the sentencing range under the applicable guidelines. Jimenez\u2019s range of 46-57 months was largely due to a sixteen-level enhancement for a fifteen year old transportation of illegal aliens conviction. During the short sentencing hearing, Jimenez\u2019s attorney argued for a below-guidelines sentence because of the age of that conviction and the fact that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any evidence showing that he was making any money off of it.\u201d The district court twice stated that \u201cit was found that he was profiting from this,\u201d despite Jimenez\u2019s attorney\u2019s contrary statements referencing the pre-sentence report (PSR). The PSR specifically states that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that Jimenez profited from the transportation offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">Jimenez argues that the district court procedurally erred because it mistakenly believed that he profited from transporting illegal aliens. We agree that the district court\u2019s belief is clearly erroneous. The Government argues that this error was harmless because the guidelines range was correctly calculated and the profit from the prior crime was irrelevant. \u201cA procedural error during sentencing is harmless if the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009)(internal quotations marks and citations omitted). Where, as here, the error was preserved and the Government seeks affirmance, it bears the burden of proving that the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\"><em>Gall </em>makes clear that an improper calculation of the range and reliance on a clearly erroneous fact are separate procedural errors. 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number><em>also United States v. Guidry, </em>462 F.3d 373, 376-77 (5th Cir.2006) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>finding procedural error as a result of the district court\u2019s \u201cmultiple clearly erroneous factual determinations\u201d). Thus the correct calculation of the range does not end the procedural error inquiry. Because the district court twice mentioned the profit issue in an otherwise very short colloquy, the Government has not shown that the error had no effect on the length of the sentence. As a result, the district court\u2019s procedural error is not harmless. <em>See Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 753. Accordingly, we VACATE Jimenez\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-15\">.
