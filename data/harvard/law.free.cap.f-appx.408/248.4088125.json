After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56; <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In reviewing orders granting summary judgment, we resolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant. <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1187 (11th Cir.1999). However, \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence in support of the nonmoving party will not suffice to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004). We may affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any ground, regardless of whether the ground was addressed and relied upon by the district court. <em>Cuddeback v. Florida Bd. of Educ., </em>381 F.3d 1230, 1235 (11th Cir.2004). We review a district court\u2019s treatment of a magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R for abuse of discretion. <em>Stephens v. Tolbert, </em>471 F.3d 1173, 1175 (11th Cir.2006). Similarly, we review a district court\u2019s decision not to consider arguments that were not raised before a magistrate for abuse of discretion. <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2747, 174 L.Ed.2d 249 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">First, we are unpersuaded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Worley\u2019s Title VII and \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids employment discrimination against \u201cany individual\u201d based on that individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). The anti-retaliation provision in Title VII forbids an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>from \u201cdiscriminating] against\u201d an employee because that individual \u201copposed any practice\u201d made unlawful by Title VII or \u201cmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\u201d a Title VII proceeding or investigation. \u00a7 2000e-8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Section 1981, U.S.Code Title 42, also prohibits retaliation based on race, even though the statute is silent on that cause of action. <em>CBOCS West v. Humphries, 553 </em>U.S. 442, 457, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008). The elements required to establish retaliation claims under \u00a7 1981 are the same as those required for Title VII claims. <em>See Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1277 (11th Cir.2008) (applying the same three-part test to retaliation claims under \u00a7 1981 and Title VII); <em>see also Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that claims under \u00a7 1981 are analyzed under the Title VII framework).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In reviewing Title VII claims supported by circumstantial evidence, we use a three-step burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 975-76 (11th Cir.2008). The burden is first on the plaintiff to establish sufficient evidence of a prima facie case of retaliation. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">A plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of retaliation by presenting evidence that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) the employer took action that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee, and (3) there was some \u2022 causal relation between the two events. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In order to satisfy the second prong, the Supreme Court has explained that a plaintiff need only show a materially adverse action that \u201cwell might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (quotations omitted) (addressing Title VII retaliation claim). The Court clarified though that the acts must be material and significant and not trivial. <em>Id. </em>We have recognized <em>Burlington </em>to hold that \u201cthe type of employer conduct considered actionable has been broadened from that which adversely affects the plaintiffs conditions of employment or employment status to that which has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 973. Furthermore, we noted that \u201cthe adverse employment action standard previously applied in this circuit to Title VII retaliation claims is more stringent than the \u2018materially adverse\u2019 standard announced in <em>Burlington,\u201d </em>and that <em>Burlington </em>\u201cstrongly suggests that it is for a jury to decide whether anything more than the most petty and trivial actions against an employee should be considered \u2018materially adverse\u2019 to him and thus constitute adverse employment actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 973-74 &amp; n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In <em>Burlington, </em>the Supreme Court noted that not every job reassignment is automatically actionable because \u201c[w]hether a particular reassignment is materially adverse depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, and should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position, considering all the circumstances,\u201d as some jobs may be more desirable than others. <em>Burlington, </em>548 U.S. at 70-71, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (quotation omitted). The plaintiff in <em>Burlington </em>was reassigned from her job working as a forklift operator to a job she had previously held working as a \u201ctrack laborer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 126 S.Ct. 2405. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Court concluded that, where the evidence showed that the plaintiffs reassignment consisted of duties that were \u201cmore arduous and dirtier\u201d and the job was considered to be less prestigious and less desirable, a reasonable jury could conclude that the reassignment of responsibilities was materially adverse to a reasonable employee. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (quotation omitted) (noting that the prior job required more qualifications, which is an indication of prestige).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In <em>Crawford, </em>we held that a plaintiff suffered a materially adverse action in the form of an unfavorable performance review that affected her eligibility for a merit pay increase because the employer\u2019s conduct \u201cclearly might deter a reasonable employee from pursuing a pending charge of discrimination or making a new one.\u201d 529 F.3d at 974. Notably, the evidence in <em>Crawford </em>showed that, as a result of the rating the plaintiff\u2019s employer gave her on an evaluation, she did not receive a merit increase in her salary. <em>Id. </em>at 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. When the employer meets its burden, the plaintiff may then demonstrate that the employer\u2019s reasons are a \u201cpretext for prohibited retaliatory conduct.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv., Inc., </em>234 F.3d 501, 507 n. 6 (11th Cir.2000). A legitimate nondiscriminatory reason proffered by the employer is not a pretext for prohibited conduct unless it is shown that the reason was false and that the real reason was impermissible retaliation or discrimination. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot merely recast the reason, but must meet it \u201chead on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc). Conclusory allegations or unsupported assertions of discrimination, without more, \u201care not sufficient to raise an inference of pretext.\u201d <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In this case, regardless of whether, as the district court found, Worley\u2019s performance evaluation and temporary transfer to work on the DOM constituted adverse actions, Worley has failed to show that the legitimate non-discriminatory reasons proffered by Houck were a pretext for prohibited retaliatory conduct. Notably, Worley has not shown that the reasons Houck provided for Worley\u2019s evaluation grades and reassignment \u2014 namely, complaints from other officers and Worley\u2019s prior experience working on the DOM \u2014 were false. Accordingly, the Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Worley\u2019s Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims, and we affirm as to this issue, albeit for a different reason than the district court gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">We also reject Worley\u2019s argument that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his First Amendment retaliation claim. To prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim under the commonly accepted formulation, \u201ca plaintiff must establish first, that his speech or act was constitutionally protected; second, that the defendant\u2019s retaliatory conduct adversely affected the protected speech; and third, that there is a causal connection between the retaliatory actions and the adverse effect on speech.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Hendrix, </em>423 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIn the employment context, the required adverse action in a retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>claim is an \u2018adverse employment action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">A complained-of action constitutes an adverse employment action in a First Amendment retaliation case if the alleged employment action would likely chill the exercise of constitutionally protected speech. <em>Akins v. Fulton Cnty., </em>420 F.3d 1293, 1300 (11th Cir.2005). The complained-of action must also involve an important condition of employment. \u201cThus, if an employer\u2019s conduct negatively affects an employee\u2019s salary, title, position, or job duties, that conduct constitutes an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Akins, </em>we held that unwarranted reprimands, a negative work evaluation, threat of job loss through dissolution of the plaintiffs division, threat of suspension without pay, removal of job duties, and exclusion from meetings did not constitute adverse employment actions, either singly or when considered in the aggregate. <em>Id. </em>at 1301-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201cQualified immunity protects municipal officers from liability in \u00a7 1983 actions as long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Lewis v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>561 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1503, 176 L.Ed.2d 109 (2010). \u201cTo receive qualified immunity, the officer must first show that he acted within his discretionary authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicability of qualified immunity is subject to a two-part test, which asks whether the officer\u2019s conduct amounted to a constitutional violation, and whether the right violated was clearly established at the time of the violation. <em>Id. </em>The order of the inquiry is fluid, and we may address the two issues in either order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cTo defeat a defendant\u2019s claim to qualified immunity, a plaintiff must show that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have been on notice that his actions violated clearly-established law.\u201d <em>Maggio v. Sipple, </em>211 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">For the law to be clearly established to the point that qualified immunity does not apply, the law must have earlier been developed in such a concrete and factually defined context to make it obvious to all reasonable government actors, in the defendant\u2019s place, that what he is doing violates federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-10\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Because the analysis of First Amendment retaliation claims involves intensely fact-specific legal determinations, \u201ca defendant in a First Amendment suit will only rarely be on notice that his actions are unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Even if a plaintiff presents a factual question as to whether he was retaliated against because of constitutionally protected speech, a defendant may still obtain summary judgment through the affirmative defense of qualified immunity by showing that the defendant acted with both lawful and unlawful motivations and pre-existing law did not dictate that the merits of the case must be decided in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Foy v. Holston, </em>94 F.3d 1528, 1535 (11th Cir.1996). Thus, a \u201cdefendant is entitled to qualified immunity under the <em>Foy </em>rationale only where, among other things, the record indisputably establishes that the defendant in fact was motivated, <em>at least in part, </em>by lawful considerations.\u201d <em>Stanley v. City of Dalton, </em>219 F.3d 1280,1296 (11th Cir.2000). In <em>Stanley, </em>we held that a police chief was entitled to a defense of qualified immunity because the record showed that the police chief was motivated, at least in part, to terminate the plaintiff police officer\u2019s employment based on lawful considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>involving the officer\u2019s prior disciplinary incidents. <em>Id. </em>at 1296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Here, the district court correctly found that Houck could avail himself of a qualified immunity defense. Worley cannot show that he had a clearly established right not to receive an unfavorable performance evaluation that still resulted in a raise or not to be reassigned to work he had previously done, because it was not clearly established at the time Houck committed these acts that they constituted adverse employment actions necessary for a retaliation suit. Moreover, the record indisputably establishes that Houck was motivated to give Worley his performance evaluation and reassignment, at least in part, by lawful considerations, and preexisting law did not dictate that the merits of the case must be decided in the Worley\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Finally, we find no merit in Worley\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in failing to consider evidence presented for the first time in Worley\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R. In <em>Williams, </em>we noted that \u201ca district court has discretion to decline to consider a party\u2019s argument when that argument was not first presented to the magistrate judge.\u201d 557 F.3d at 1292. Therefore, we held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider a new argument raised by a \u00a7 2254 petitioner in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R. In finding that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we noted that \u201cto require a district court to consider evidence not previously presented to the magistrate judge would effectively nullify the magistrate judge\u2019s consideration of the matter and would not help to relieve the workload of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">As applied here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider evidence and arguments that Worley advanced for the first time in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s R &amp; R. As we\u2019ve held, the district court had the discretion to decline to consider the arguments not presented to the magistrate judge, and it properly exercised this discretion here. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, Worley has advanced no reason why he could not have discovered or presented his argument regarding overtime pay to the magistrate judge because the argument was based on his personal knowledge, and the magistrate judge allowed him to supplement his response to the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion eight times. <em>Cf. Young, </em>358 F.3d at 863-64 (holding that a district court did not abuse its discretion by denying a counseled plaintiffs fifth extension to file responses to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in part because previous extensions had been granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">. While before the district court, Worley dismissed his claim against the current Lilburn Chief of Police, John Davidson. In addition, Worley has not raised on appeal any argument regarding the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City on his \u00a7 1981 and First Amendment claims, which he conceded below were meritless. Because Worley did not raise these issues in his initial appellate brief, he has abandoned these arguments. <em>See In re Egidi, </em>571 F.3d 1156, 1163 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that \u201d[a]rguments not properly presented in a party\u2019s initial brief or raised for the first time in the reply brief are deemed waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
