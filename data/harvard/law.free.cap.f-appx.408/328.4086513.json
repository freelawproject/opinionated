Quintero-Mejia subsequently filed a motion to reopen, arguing that exceptional circumstances \u2014 namely, his taxicab driver\u2019s failure to find the immigration court \u2014 precluded him from attending the hearing. Both the IJ and BIA concluded that Quintero-Mejia failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">An order removing an alien <em>in absentia </em>may be rescinded, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cupon a motion to reopen ... if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)) ...\u201d Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-17\">The term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">INA \u00a7 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">The failure of Quintero-Mejia\u2019s taxicab driver to locate the immigration court does not constitute exceptional circumstances. The IJ had previously provided QuinteroMejia with the court\u2019s address, QuinteroMejia had previously attended a hearing at that very location, and Quintero-Mejia had several months to make the necessary travel arrangements. Thus, Quintero-Mejia\u2019s failure to attend the hearing was not beyond his control. Moreover, QuinteroMejia made no attempt to contact the IJ on the day of the hearing, even though he admittedly attempted to call his attorneys. <em>See Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-20\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\">. We review the denial of motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). This review is limited to determining whether the IJ or BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
