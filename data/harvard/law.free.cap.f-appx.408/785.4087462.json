The district court found that Blake was not eligible for a reduction because he had been sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">Blake first moves for appointment of counsel on appeal. Although we have not held that a defendant is entitled to counsel when appealing a \u00a7 3582 motion, we have found that we have discretion to appoint counsel \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008). Because we conclude that the district court correctly found that Blake was not eligible for relief, we decline to exercise our discretion to appoint counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b814-19\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the applicable sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Because the district court\u2019s denial of Blake\u2019s motion was based on its determination that Blake was not eligible for a reduction due to his career offender status under the Sentencing Guidelines, review is de novo. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-23\">Blake argues that he is not precluded from receiving a reduction merely because he was sentenced as a career offender and that the calculation of an offense level based on the amount of drugs still is relevant. However, when a defendant is sentenced as a career offender, the \u201cbase offense level is moored to the statutory maximum penalty of the underlying crime,\u201d not the drug amount <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2009). Therefore, Blake \u201cwas not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791 &amp; n. 8 (inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>nal quotations and citation omitted). The district court was correct in concluding that Blake was not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 790-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Blake also argues that, because the guidelines are no longer mandatory following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the requirements of \u00a7 1B1.10 that limit sentencing reductions also are not mandatory. In <em>Doublin, </em>we held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply and does not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. The Supreme Court also has held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
