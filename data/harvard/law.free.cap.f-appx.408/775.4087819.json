His petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>In 1991, Rodriguez pled guilty to transporting an illegal alien within the United States, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(ii). (When Rodriguez was convicted, this offense was codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(B).) In 2006, he was charged with removability on the ground that this offense is an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). Rodriguez conceded that he was removable and then applied for a waiver under the former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). To be eligible for a waiver, the alien must be removable on a ground that has a statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility listed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5); <em>Brieva-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 356, 362 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">We generally lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to a removal order where the alien is ordered removed on the ground that he has committed an aggravated felony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006). Nonetheless, we retain jurisdiction over constitutional and legal questions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Hernandez-Castillo, </em>436 F.3d at 519. Rodriguez challenges only the BIA\u2019s legal determination that he was ineligible for a waiver of deportation because the ground for his removal did not have an statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility. Thus, we have jurisdiction to consider Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review. <em>See Brieva-Perez, </em>482 F.3d at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Because the BIA engaged in its own analysis and did not adopt the decision of the IJ, we review only the decision of the BIA; Rodriguez\u2019s legal arguments are reviewed <em>de novo. See Beltran-Resendez v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2000). We defer to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of immigration regulations. <em>Hernandez-Castillo, </em>436 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Rodriguez argues that the BIA erred in determining that the relevant comparison is between the grounds of inadmissibility in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) and his ground of removability in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). He contends that the proper comparison is between the ground of inadmissibility, which he says is 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (6) (E) (i), and the offense of conviction, here, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A). Rodriguez also argues that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), waivers are available to aliens who have served a sentence of less than five years on their aggravated felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Rodriguez\u2019s arguments are without merit. We have approved of and applied the rule that the BIA followed here: for an alien who is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony, eligibility for a waiver of deportation depends on whether the category of aggravated felony has a statutory counterpart in the grounds for inadmissibility. <em>Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 368-72 (5th Cir.2007). We have explicitly rejected the argument that Section 1182(c) relief is available to aggravated felons as long as they served less than five years of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 370-71. The BIA properly applied its comparability analysis because the language used in Section 1101(a)(43)(N) and Section 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is dissimilar. Congress intended the statutes to apply to different conduct, and Section 1182(a)(6)(E)(i) is more comparable to Section 1227(a)(l)(E)(i). <em>See Leon-Medina v. Holder, </em>351 Fed.Appx. 881, 885 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Popoca v. Holder, </em>320 Fed.Appx. 252, 258-59 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Finally, Rodriguez argues that the BIA\u2019s decision improperly restricted the holding in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). Specifically, that a waiver of deportation remains available to aliens who could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>been eligible for this relief at the time of their guilty pleas because the aliens could have relied on the availability of this relief in deciding to plead guilty. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Rodriguez, however, cannot show that he reasonably relied on the availability of relief because, given the conclusion that his ground of removability had no counterpart in the statutory grounds for admissibility, he was ineligible for the waiver at the time he pled guilty. <em>See Vo, </em>482 F.3d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Rodriguez is statutorily ineligible for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
