He appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the regulations used by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to determine an inmate\u2019s eligibility date for transfer to a residential reentry center.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-25\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Young\u2019s appeal was rendered moot by his pre-release transfer to a residential reentry center, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>In re Scruggs, </em>392 F.3d 124, 128 (5th Cir.2004). Young\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is likewise DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-26\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
