He contends that his liberty and property interests were implicated by the denial of procedural due process during his disciplinary hearing. He alleged that his disciplinary conviction resulted in punishment of a reduction in his time-earning class, the loss of recreation and commissary privileges for 45 days, and the forfeiture of $710 from his inmate account.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">With regard to his liberty interest claims, Hampton has not shown \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). With regard to Hampton\u2019s claim that the forfeiture of $710 infringed his property interests, the district court did not address the issue below; the district court did not determine whether the claim is cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 2254 and, if so, whether the procedural due process requirements of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), were satisfied. We therefore DENY the motion for a COA in part, GRANT the motion for a COA in part, VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment, and REMAND for the district court to consider only Hampton\u2019s claim regarding the infringement of his property interest without procedural due process. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>Whitehead v.
