On appeal, Tacy argues that Benton, acting under the color of state law, deprived the prisoners and them friends and family of rights protected under federal law and the Constitution in restricting the type, size, and content of the mail prisoners received while incarcerated in the Highlands County jail. Tacy argues that no part of his class action complaint is frivolous, and therefore, should not be dismissed. Lastly, Tacy argues that because \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 indicates that Congress assigned federal courts with the role of protecting constitutional rights, we must reverse and remand the case to the district court for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of Tacy\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Grayson v. King, </em>460 F.3d 1328, 1336 n. 5 (11th Cir.2006). We have interpreted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, the general provision permitting parties to proceed <em>pro se, </em>as providing \u201ca personal right that does not extend to the representation of the interests of others.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 873 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(llth Cir.2008). We have affirmed the dismissal of the portion of a prisoner\u2019s complaint seeking relief on behalf of fellow inmates. <em>Massimo v. Henderson, </em>468 F.2d 1209, 1210 (5th Cir.1972); <em>see Oxendine v. Williams, </em>509 F.2d 1405, 1407 (4th Cir.1975) (holding that it is plain error to permit an imprisoned litigant who is unassisted by counsel to represent his fellow inmates in a class action).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Following the holding of <em>Massimo, </em>Tacy may not seek relief on behalf of his fellow inmates. 468 F.2d at 1210. Because Tacy may not represent the plaintiffs in a class action suit, the district court properly dismissed Tac^s \u00a7 1983 complaint. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
