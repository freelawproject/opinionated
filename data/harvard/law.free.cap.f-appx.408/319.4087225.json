Zavala was sentenced to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1, 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 20, to be served concurrently with the sentence on Count 1, and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 6, to be served consecutively with the sentences on Counts 1 and 20, for a total sentence of 384 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Zavala argues that: (1) the entry and search of his residence with an arrest warrant for a third-party suspect, rather than a search warrant for the premises, violated his Fourth Amendment rights; and (2) statutory mandatory minimum sentences in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>both capital and noncapital cases violate the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In this same case, Jose Macias Martinez appeals his convictions for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841 (b)(1)(A)(ii) (Count 1), and conspiring to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (Count 20). Macias Martinez was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1 and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 20, to be served concurrently, for a total sentence of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. Macias Martinez argues on appeal that the government provided insufficient evidence to convict him because the evidence established only his presence with others who were engaging in criminal conduct. After careful review, we affirm both Zavala\u2019s convictions and sentences, and Macias Martinez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Review of a denial of a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Delaney, </em>502 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts, including whether the police reasonably believed that a suspect resides at a particular location, is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Magluta, </em>44 F.3d 1530, 1536-37 (11th Cir.1995). The factual findings of the district court are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1536, 1537 n. 14. When, as in Macias Martinez\u2019s case, a defendant does not move the district court for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence, we may reverse the conviction only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 556-57 (11th Cir.1990). This standard requires that \u201cthe evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Tapia, </em>761 F.2d 1488, 1492 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation omitted). In making this determination, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and accept all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations that support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">First, we reject Zavala\u2019s claim that the district court erred in finding the entry and search of his residence constitutional. Warrantless searches and seizures inside a home are presumptively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). Nonetheless, an arrest warrant for a suspect carries a \u201c \u2018limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263-64 (quoting <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)). When entering a residence pursuant to an arrest warrant, the police must have: (1) \u201ca reasonable belief that the location to be searched is the suspect\u2019s dwelling,\u201d and (2) \u201c \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that the suspect is within the dwelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe fact that a suspect may live somewhere else from time to time does not categorically prevent a dwelling from being the suspect\u2019s residence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>555 F.3d 962, 965 (11th Cir.2009). The reasonableness of the belief is evaluated based on \u201cthe facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the law enforcement agents, when viewed in the totality....\u201d <em>Magluta, </em>44 F.3d at 1535. In evaluating the agents\u2019 determination that the suspect lives at the residence and is within at the time of the search, \u201ccourts must be sensitive to common sense factors indicating a resident\u2019s presence.\u201d <em>Id.; see Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d at 1263 (expanding the review of \u201ccommon sense factors\u201d to both prongs of the reasonableness inquiry). In <em>Steagald v. United States, </em>law enforcement agents, with an arrest warrant for a third party, entered a defendant\u2019s home and discovered cocaine. 451 U.S. 204, 206, 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981). The Supreme Court held that, under the Fourth Amendment, the arrest warrant for the third party was insufficient to justify the entry into the defendant\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 101 S.Ct. 1642.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Here, based on the presence of the suspect\u2019s car, the early hour, and the absence of the suspect at his other suspected residence, the agents had a reasonable belief that the suspect was within the dwelling at the time that they executed the arrest warrant. Furthermore, the agents had a reasonable belief that the dwelling was the suspect\u2019s residence based on these factors and the fact that the suspect\u2019s car had been located at the dwelling in the week before the search. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Zavala\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We likewise find no merit in Zavala\u2019s argument that statutory mandatory minimum sentences \u2014 which his drug and firearms convictions carried \u2014 violate the Eighth Amendment. A sentence that is not otherwise cruel and unusual does not violate the Eighth Amendment simply because it is mandatory. <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>see United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343 (11th Cir.) (holding that \u201cthe mandatory nature of a non-capital penalty is irrelevant for proportionality purposes\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). The Supreme Court has \u201cdrawn the line of required individualized sentencing at capital cases.\u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 996, 111 S.Ct. 2680. In noncapital cases involving a statutory minimum sentence, \u201cthe Eighth Amendment encompasses, at most, only a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Only sentences that are \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the crime violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1343 (citing <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 1001, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (Kennedy, J., concurring)). We have rejected Eighth Amendment challenges to the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences where the sentence imposed was within statutory limits. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1178-79 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that the mandatory minimum sentences found in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) were not unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that a mandatory sentence of 15 years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) did not violate the Eighth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Here, Zavala has failed to demonstrate that his mandatory minimum sentences were unconstitutional, as he makes no argument as to proportionality. Moreover, his argument that mandatory minimum sentences in general violate the Eighth Amendment is foreclosed by case-law from this Circuit and the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">We also are unpersuaded by Macias Martinez\u2019s challenge to his conviction. \u201cTo sustain a conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) an illegal agreement existed; (2) the defendant knew of it; and (3) the defendant, with knowledge, voluntarily joined it.\u201d <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2001). To convict a defendant of conspiracy to commit money laundering, the government must prove that (1) there was an agreement to launder money, and (2) the defendant, knowing the unlawful plan, voluntarily joined the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>440 F.3d 1286, 1294 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">\u201cAlthough mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to support a conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>acy conviction, presence nonetheless is a probative factor which the jury may consider in determining whether a defendant was a knowing and intentional participant in a criminal scheme.\u201d <em>McDowell, </em>250 F.3d at 1365. A defendant\u2019s participation in a criminal conspiracy may be inferred from circumstantial evidence. <em>See United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 962 (11th Cir.1990). However, where the case is based on circumstantial evidence, \u201creasonable inferences, not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1557 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Based on the evidence at trial, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Macias Martinez knew that nearly $2.4 million, which was hidden in hollowed-out doors on top of his business\u2019s truck, came from the sale of cocaine. As the evidence showed, Macias Martinez was at a drug stash house earlier that day, multiple kilograms of cocaine were delivered to that house, and Macias Martinez helped package and load a substantial amount of money into the doors on top of the truck. Accordingly, he fails to show that his conviction was a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
