Unless it can be said, as a matter of law, that there is no substantial evidence to support a contrary judgment, this court cannot reverse the trial court\u2019s determination on such a motion. <em>(Richardson </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>44 Cal. 2d 772 [285 P.2d 269].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">From the record before us, there assuredly appears to be a conflict in the evidence as to the damages sustained by the plaintiffs by reason of the defendant\u2019s acts. Under such a state of the record, the trial court could well have discredited the testimony presented by plaintiffs as to the amount of the damages, both actual and exemplary.  An order granting a new trial for excessive damages will not be disturbed, if there is a reasonable or fairly debatable justification therefor, and from the record before us it appears that such justification appears here. The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Peters, P.
