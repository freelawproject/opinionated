The complaint concluded with a prayer that defendants be compelled to specifically so perform the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">At the conclusion of the trial the court found in part that none of the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint were \u201c. . . true except it is true that there <em>may </em>have been an original offer of $21,000.00, but if there was such an offer it was soon thereafter annulled by the offeror and offerees and a new offer was made of $23,000.00 plus the $3,500.00 loan [to the lessors]. It is true that Mrs. Mills was given notice of these transactions in accordance with the contract, and she not only failed to meet this latter offer, but she sold her rights to do so for the sum of $1,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The primary question presented on appeal by counsel for plaintiff\u2014that the court erred in denying specific performance of the option as alleged\u2014is essentially one of fact and hence is governed by rules too well established to warrant citation of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">An examination of the record shows specific testimony by Smith that there had been talk of $21,000 plus a loan of $5,000, but that the ultimate agreement was $23,000 plus a $3,500 loan. Ruppert testified to the same effect. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that she had \u201c. . . suspicions only. I couldn\u2019t get a confirmation from them there had ever been a price of 21.\u201d She further testified that Ruppert told her the deal was $21,000 plus a $5,000 loan, but they had changed their minds; that she saw escrow instructions at the title company for $21,000 plus a $5,000 loan; that over these figures were superimposed the figures of $23,000 and $3,500, respectively; (her counsel gave similar testimony concerning the escrow); and that she was not interested in buying the property at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the price quoted in the escrow. Finally, it is not denied that she accepted the sum of $1,000 and executed a waiver of her rights under the option to purchase defendants\u2019 interest. The evidence so summarized was amply sufficient to sustain the conclusions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We find no merit in plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions relative to the reasonableness of the selling price of the property and the phraseology of the option.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Van Dyke, P. J., and Schottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 30, 1958.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
