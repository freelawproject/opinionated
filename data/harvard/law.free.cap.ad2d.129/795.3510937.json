Gutierrez also alleged that he had obtained an appraisal of the property which indicated that it was worth $90,000, i.e., more than the selling price at the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"AfN\">In an action to foreclose a mortgage, the defendant Noah Industrial Marine &amp; Ship Repair, Inc., appeals from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Vinik, J.), entered September 23, 1985, which denied its motion, <em>inter alia, </em>to vacate a judgment of foreclosure of the same court, entered June 19, 1985, and to enjoin the transfer of the property.</p><p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p><p id=\"b830-4\">The plaintiff commenced an action to foreclose a mortgage executed by the corporate defendant on a two-story factory building in Brooklyn. The parties initially settled the action pursuant to stipulation, but the defendant defaulted in the required payments. Thereafter, the plaintiff proceeded to enter a judgment and the property was sold at a foreclosure sale for $59,000.</p><p id=\"b830-6\">Special Term denied the appellant\u2019s motion.</p><p id=\"b830-7\">The papers submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to the appellant\u2019s motion demonstrate that Gutierrez understood the English language and had familiarity with foreclosure actions. The record further indicates that the appellant was represented by counsel during the course of the instant action. Accordingly, the appellant\u2019s argument in this regard must be rejected.</p><p id=\"b830-8\">It is also well settled that mere inadequacy of price is insufficient to vacate a foreclosure sale, unless there are \"additional circumstances that warrant invocation of equity powers *- * * or unless the price is so inadequate as to shock the court\u2019s conscience\u201d <em>(Polish Natl. Alliance v White Eagle Hall Co., </em>98 AD2d 400, 407). Clearly, the appellant\u2019s allegation concerning the sale price obtained at the foreclosure sale is insufficient to warrant vacatur of the sale.</p><p id=\"b830-9\">We have reviewed the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Mollen, P. J., Mangano, Eiber and Sullivan, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
