His contention is that the prosecutor made several improper comments during summation which deprived him of a fair trial. Since no objection was taken during the summation, these contentions have not been preserved for appellate review <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Simmons, </em>121 AD2d 579). Further, review of these allegations as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Judgment affirmed. Mahoney, P. J., Main, Casey, Mikoll and Harvey, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
