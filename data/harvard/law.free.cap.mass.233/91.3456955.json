The others were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>If the jury find that the plaintiff employed the witness Hines to sell for her certain articles of furniture stored with the defendant, Hersum and Company [Incorporated], and told Hines to obtain from the defendant, Hersum and Company, the said articles of furniture, and if Hines in the course of his employment, and in undertaking to carry out what he was employed to do, .through negligence, error or mistake, informed the defendant, Hersum and Company, that he, Hines, was instructed by the plaintiff to obtain and to sell all the goods belonging to the plaintiff stored with the defendant, Hersum and Company, and requested the defendant to deliver said goods to Hines, and if the defendant, relying on said statement and believing that Hines had been instructed by the plaintiff to obtain and sell all her goods, stored with the defendant, Hersum and Company, delivers the goods so stored to Hines, the defendant by so doing is not liable for the conversion of said goods or any of them, and the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\"><em>\u201c3. </em>If the jury find that there was an agreement between the plaintiff and the witness Hines whereby Hines was employed by the plaintiff to obtain and sell certain articles of household furniture belonging to the plaintiff and stored with the defendant, Hersum and Company, and if Hines in the performance of said agreement and in undertaking to perform the acts for which he was employed, through negligence, error or mistake, informed the defendant, Hersum and Company, that he had been authorized by the plaintiff to obtain from the defendant and to sell all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>furniture and goods stored by the plaintiff with the defendant, Hersum and Company, and if the defendant, relying on such information and believing the same to be true, delivers all the said furniture and goods so stored to Hines, the delivery of said furniture and goods to Hines is in law a delivery of said furniture and goods to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff is bound by the act of Hines in so obtaining all said furniture and goods and she cannot maintain this action for the conversion of said furniture and goods, or any of it, so delivered by the defendant to Hines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\"><em>\u201c </em>4. If the jury find that the plaintiff employed the witness Hines to sell for her certain articles of household furniture belonging to her which she had stored with the defendant and instructed Hines to obtain said articles from the defendant but did not instruct Hines to obtain or sell for her certain other articles of household furniture and goods stored by her with the defendant, and if the jury further find that Hines, in the course of his employment and in undertaking to carry out what he was employed to do, requested the defendant to deliver to him not only the certain articles which he was instructed by the plaintiff to obtain and sell but all other ' household furniture and goods stored by the plaintiff with the defendant, and if the jury further find that the defendant did not know that the plaintiff had not instructed Hines to obtain and sell for her all the household furniture and goods stored by the plaintiff with the defendant but that the defendant was informed by said Hines that he, Hines, was so instructed by the plaintiff, and if the defendant relied on the statement of Hines that he, Hines, was instructed by the plaintiff to obtain and sell for the plaintiff all the household furniture and goods stored by the plaintiff with the defendant (if such statement is found to have been made by said Hines to the defendant), and if the defendant did not know that said statement was untrue and did not have any knowledge or notice of any facts or circumstances from which a reasonably prudent man, under the circumstances could fairly and reasonably infer that said statement was untrue, then the defendant in delivering to Hines all the household furniture and goods stored by the plaintiff with the defendant in accordance with Hines\u2019 request is not liable to the plaintiff for the conversion of said household furniture and goods or any of it, and the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The judge refused to give any of these instructions, and submitted the case to the jury with other instructions.

The defendant before delivering all the plaintiff\u2019s goods to Hines was bound to inquire and ascertain the nature and extent of his authority. <em>Lovett, Hart &amp; Phipps Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>189 Mass. 535. <em>A. Blum Jr\u2019s Sons </em>v. <em>Whipple, </em>194 Mass. 253, 257. The acts and declarations of Hines were plainly incompetent to prove his authority or its extent. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Carberry, </em>172 Mass. 432. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>182 Mass. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"A2v\">The defendant\u2019s second, third and fourth requests in substance were that, if Hines was employed by the plaintiff to sell certain articles which she directed him to obtain from the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>but by negligence or mistake Hines informed the defendant that he was employed by the plaintiff to obtain and sell all the goods, the defendant is not liable. These requests properly could not have been given. The defendant as a bailee of the plaintiff\u2019s property impliedly contracted to return it to her, or to some third person with her express or implied consent. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Peerless Motor Car Co. of New England, </em>226 Mass. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Delivery of property by a bailee to a person not authorized by the owner is of itself a conversion, rendering the bailee liable without regard to the question of due care or negligence. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>14 Allen, 439, 443. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. </em>210 Mass. 188, 195. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stewart-Warner Speedometer Corp. </em>223 Mass. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The well settled principle that a master is liable for the negligence of his servant committed while engaged in his master\u2019s business, and within the scope of his employment, is not applicable to the facts in the case at bar; accordingly, <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Newmarch, </em>12 Allen, 49, and similar cases cited and relied on by the defendant, are not authorities in favor of its contention that the rulings requested should have been given. The instructions given were correct and fully protected the rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
