Writ dated May 7, 1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-3\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Aiken, </em>C. J. At the close of the evidence the plaintiff asked for certain instructions. Those not given by the judge which were relied .on in the plaintiffs brief were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-4\"><em>\u201c7. </em>That the fact that the power of the car at the time of the accident was reversed in an attempt to stop the car, said car went a distance of from two hundred (200) to two hundred and fifty (250) or three hundred (300) feet beyond the point where the accident took place, then the jury have a right to consider whether the car was being driven at a high and dangerous rate of speed that it could not be stopped until it had gone the distance above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\">\u201c8.

That upon all the evidence there is no testimony to show that the plaintiff was in any degree negligent and that the evidence does show that the defendant, through its agents and servants, was negligent and careless in the operation of its car in its failure to sound the whistle giving warning of its approach and failure to have the headlight lighted and the further evidence that shows that the motorman was not keeping a look out ahead.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-7\">The other requests of the plaintiff for instructions are referred to in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-8\">The Chief Justice submitted the case to the jury with full instructions.

It depends on what other noise there was going on; with conditions that night, half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>a mile. Quite frequently the trolley-wheel makes a noise, which can be heard some distance. . . .\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-3\"><em>F. J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4B\">This is an action of tort wherein the plaintiff seeks to recover damages sustained by him in person and property arising from a collision between an express car operated by the defendant upon its track and an automobile owned and operated by the plaintiff. The verdict was for the defendant and the case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s requests for instructions were denied rightly. The eighth and ninth in substance required a ruling that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and that the defendant was negligent. These were both controverted issues, as to which there was conflicting evidence. There was a considerable body of testimony touching the conduct of the plaintiff and of the motorman. in charge of the defendant\u2019s car immediately before and at the time of the collision. The jury may have disbelieved all that which tended to support the contentions of the plaintiff and credited only that which supported those of the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, 232 </em>Mass. 58, 70. The case falls within the principle that it cannot usually be ruled as matter of law that a burden of proof has been sustained. <em>McDonough </em>v. Metro<em>politan Life Ins. Co. </em>228 Mass. 450, 452, 453. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 370<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The subjects referred to in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth requests were adequately dealt with in the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The sixth and seventh requests referred to specific facts which the judge was not required to single out for special treatment. <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Ratshesky, </em>213 Mass. 589, 593. The charge was ample and fair and not open in these respects to just criticism. <em>\u2018 </em>The several questions allowed to be put respecting the plaintiff\u2019s habits in the excessive use of intoxicating liquor were carefully confined by the judge to the issue of damages, in connection with which the testimony was relevant and admissible. <em>Ceresola </em>v. <em>Joseph F. Paul Co. </em>224 Mass. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Evidence was competent tending to show that the injuries which, according to the claims of the plaintiff, resulted from the collision in question, were in truth caused by other and previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>accidents sustained by him. As bearing upon this point, testimony as to other injuries received by the plaintiff was relevant. It is too plain for discussion that there is nothing inconsistent with this in decisions like <em>Wiemert </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 598, and <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>106 Mass. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">The admission of the testimony of the motorman as to the distance at which his car could have been heard on the night in question, cannot be pronounced harmfully erroneous. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>222 Mass. 560, 562. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, 229 </em>Mass. 421, 427. The exclusion of somewhat similar evidence has been held not ground for sustaining exceptions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooley, </em>6 Gray, 350, and <em>Welch </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>176 Mass. 393. Ordinarily it is better practice to develop the pertinent facts as to distance, intervening obstacles, nature of surrounding objects, and leave the inference to be drawn from the collective circumstances to the jury. But where much depends upon conditions more or less difficult to reproduce accurately by words, the conclusion of the witness, although involving something of opinion, is not necessarily incompetent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 133. <em>Duddy\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 548. <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>221 Mass. 273. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>232 Mass. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The admission of the photographs in evidence cannot be pronounced erroneous. Such a matter rests largely in the discretion of the presiding judge. The fact that the jury later took a view of the scene shown by the photograph did not render it incompetent. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>199 Mass. 568. <em>Halloran </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>211 Mass. 132, 133. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Peerless Motor Car Co. </em>212 Mass. 352, 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">There are no other exceptions which require discussion. The record has been examined carefully and no error is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"ApS\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
