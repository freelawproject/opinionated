His father was not in good health and was not able to support his family, consisting of his wife and five children. The mother testified that she was dependent upon the son for support. The son began going to high school in Boston, but, when he found that tuition was charged him, he left school and went to work for the subscriber, where he received fatal injuries on the second day of his employment. At that time he had received no wages from his employer and had not sent his mother any money since he had come to Boston. The mother did not know that the son had begun to work until she received news of his death. The single member of the board found that the mother was partially dependent upon the son. The full board confirmed this finding. <em>Held, </em>that,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-11\">(1) Under the provisions of the act, the question of dependency was to be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact might be at the time of the injury, and that the finding of partial dependency could not be presumed erroneous in law;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-12\">(2) In view of all the facts, the circumstance, that the mother did not know that the son was working and that his intent was to send her the proceeds of that particular employment as fast as earned, was not in itself decisive;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-13\">(3) Evidence was admissible respecting the intent of the son to send to his mother the part of his wages which remained after paying for his board and clothing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b311-14\">In the proceeding above described, it further appeared that, at the time of receiving the fatal injuries, the employee\u2019s weekly wages were $12; that the amount he actually had earned during the preceding year was $510, and that he had sent to his mother during that time $350. There was some evidence that the employee received, besides the $510, his board, but there was no such finding by the single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>member or by the full board, nor any request for such a finding.. There also was evidence that, of the money that the employee sent his mother, the mother spent a part for his expenses. The board made no finding upon this subject. <em>Held, </em>that,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-5\">(4) The \u201c annual earnings of the deceased at the time of his injury <em>\u201d </em>should be computed by adding together his actual earnings during that period, and not by multiplying his weekly wages at the time of his injury by fifty-two;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-6\">(5) No question was saved upon the record as to whether the wages earned by the employee during the year preceding his injury were affected by the fact that for a part of that time he received his board as well as money compensation;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-7\">(6) The amount of money contributed by the employee to his mother during the twelve months preceding his injury was a question of fact upon which the finding of the Industrial Accident Board was final;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-8\">(7) Expenses incurred by the mother on account of her minor son, while pertinent in determining the question of dependency, were irrelevant in ascertaining the amount of compensation to be paid after the fact of dependency had been established.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">Appeal to the Superior Court under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14, from a decision of the Industrial Accident Board, in part affirming and adopting and in part revising the decision of a single member of. that board, awarding compensation to Gertrude Freeman, mother of Clarence \u2022 E. Freeman, a deceased employee, under Part II, \u00a7 6, of the act, as one partially dependent upon the employee at the time of his injuries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">The material portion of Part II, \u00a7 6, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">\u201c. . .If the employee leaves dependents only partly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of his injury, the <em>I </em>association shall pay such dependents a weekly compensation equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent as the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of his injury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-12\">Findings of the single member of the Industrial Accident Board, material to this decision, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-13\">\u201cThe claimant was a dependent within the meaning of Part V, \u00a7 <em>2\u2018 </em>and partially dependent upon her son, the decedent, at the time of his injury and death, under Part II, \u00a7 6 of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-14\">\u201cThe claimant received a total sum of $350 from her son for her support during the year preceding the date of the injury. Previous to leaving home, shortly before the occurrence of the fatal injury, the employee had talked with his mother relative to sending her money for her support. He promised, when he went to work, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>he would send her all his earnings except his board and money for' his clothes. On the day previous to the fatality, he accepted employment from the subscriber at an average weekly wage of $12 and advised Mrs. Annie L. Billings and Merle Billings that it was his intention to pay his board, $5, out of his earnings and send the balance home.\u2019. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-4\">\" (b) As to the basis upon which dependency shall be computed, the board member is of opinion that the insurer is obligated to pay the claimant \u2018 a weekly compensation equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent as the amount contributed (during the year preceding the date of his injury and death, $350) . . . bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of his injury.\u2019 The \u2018annual earnings of the deceased at che time of his injury\u2019 are $624; that is fifty-two times his average weekly wages of $12. The amount which would have been due the claimant, had she been wholly dependent, would be $8 a week for a period of five hundred weeks. Since she is partially dependent, the amount due her is 350/624 of $8 or $4.49 per week, for a period of five hundred weeks, subject to the provisions of the act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">Appended to the report of the single member of the board was a report of all the material evidence. The insurer asked the single member to nlake two rulings as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">\u201c1. The employee left no dependents wholly or partially dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of his injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201c2.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsK\">The deceased employee, a boy sixteen years of age, came to Boston early in September, 1918. He began going to high school, but when he found that tuition was charged him he left school, went to work and on the twenty-sixth of the same month received fatal injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment. This was the second day of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">1. There was evidence sufficient to support a finding of partial dependency by his mother on the earnings of the deceased. Before coming to Boston he had lived at home and had paid to his mother his wages which were substantial in amount. His father was not in good health and testified that he was not able to support his family, consisting of his wife and five children. - The mother testified that she depended upon the wages of the deceased for support; that \u201cPrior to leaving home, Clarence talked with her relative to sending her money for her support. He said that when he went to work he would send all his money home except his board and money for his clothes. . . . He told her he would send it to her for her support.\u201d He went to Boston to go to school and to work out of school hours. The mother did not know that the deceased had begun to work until she received word of his death, and he had sent her no money since he came to Boston. The question of dependency upon the earnings of a deceased employee under the workmen\u2019s compensation act is to be \u201cdetermined in Accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury.\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7; Part V, \u00a7 2. <em>Bott\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 152. The fact was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>that at the time of his injury the deceased was at work for wages, which it was his declared purpose as well as his filial duty to send home. The circumstance that the mother did not know that the son was working and that his intent was to send her the proceeds of that particular employment as fast as earned is not by itself decisive. A simple expression of purpose to contribute to support, unaccompanied by any actual contribution after reasonable opportunity, would not constitute dependency. The case at bar, however, in substance and effect discloses injury to the employee before his first pay day and before any opportunity had arisen to make contribution to the support of the dependent out of the wages of the particular service and substantial contributions from the earnings of earlier work. Partial dependency may be found even though the dependent might have subsisted without the aid. <em>McMahon\u2019s </em>Case, 229 Mass. 48. The deceased was a minor; hence a duty rested upon him to turn his wages over to the parent entitled thereto, and a correlative right to receive such wages vested in the parent. <em>Tornroos </em>v. <em>Autocar Co. </em>220 Mass. 336. The finding of partial dependency by the mother cannot be pronounced erroneous in law. <em>Kenney\u2019s Case, 222 </em>Mass. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">2. There was no error, under the circumstances here disclosed, in the admission of evidence respecting the intent of the deceased to send to his mother the part of his wages which remained after paying for his board and clothing. <em>Carriere </em>v. <em>Merrick Lumber Co. </em>203 Mass. 322, 327. <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Shelburne Falls &amp; Colrain Street Railway, </em>210 Mass. 197, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">3. The \u201cannual earnings of the deceased at the time of his injury\u201d in Part II, \u00a7 6, are to be ascertained by reference to the same factors as are \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d in Part V, \u00a7 2, unless inapplicable under all the circumstances. It would be a strained construction to interpret \u201c annual earnings\u201d with reference only to the wages earned at the moment of injury and to calculate other payments under the act upon the footing of \u201cearnings of the injured employee during the period of twelve calendar months immediately preceding the date of injury.\u201d The facts at bar presented a case for the ascertainment of \u201cannual earnings\u201d by reference to the wages received during the twelve calendar months immediately preceding the injury. See <em>Gillen\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">4. No question was saved on this record to the point whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the wages earned by the deceased in the year before his death were affected by the fact that for a part of the time he received his board as well as money compensation. Hence no decision of that matter is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">5. The amount of money contributed by the deceased to his mother during the twelve calendar months before his injury was on this record a pure question of fact, on which the finding of the board is final. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">6. Expenses incurred by the parent on account of the son are pertinent in determining the fact of dependency, but irrelevant in ascertaining the amount of compensation to be paid after the fact of dependency ,has been established. Dembinski\u2019s. <em>Case, </em>231 Mass. 261. No error is apparent in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
