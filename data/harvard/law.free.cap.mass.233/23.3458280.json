N. Foss.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">, The case was heard upon an agreed statement of facts substantially as follows: .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">, On July 6, 1917, Eugene N. Foss borrowed $25,000 from the defendant, giving to it the above note and the securities therein described. The interest for the first six months was discounted in advance by Mr. Foss at the time the loan was made, and an indorsement to that effect then was made on the back of the note. On November \u2022'9, 1917, Mr. Foss made a general assignment to the plaintiffs for the benefit of his creditors. Shortly thereafter, in the exercise of the power given by the note, the defendant sold the securities pledged as collateral, realizing from the sale the sum of $25,471.40. No question was raised as to the right of the defendant to sell the securities pledged as collateral. The defendant applied the proceeds of the1 sale to \u2018the payment of the interest for the second six months\u2019 period and to the payment of the principal of the note, the defendant contending as a matter of law that its application of the proceeds from the sale of the collateral in this manner was provided for in the special form of note. The sum received from the sale was insufficient to pay both the principal . and the interest for the second six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">The plaintiffs, as assignees, claimed $471.40, being that part of the proceeds of the sale of the pledged securities retained by the defendant on account of the interest for the second six months, and also $138.16, being the proportional part of the interest for the first six months\u2019 period discounted in advance, namely, for the period from the date of sale of the securities to the expiration of the first six months\u2019 period of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-9\">In the Municipal Court the judge found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $615.95 and, at the request of the defendant, reported the case to the Appellate Division, who ordered the report dismissed. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AWP\"><em>J. L.

The case was submitted on an agreed statement of facts. The defendant asked the presiding judge to rule as a matter of law that the defendant was entitled on the facts to a finding in its favor. This the judge declined to do and found for the plaintiffs on the first and second counts in the sum of. $615.95, and reported the case to the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The agreed facts disclose that Mr. Foss borrowed $25,000 from the defendant, secured by a pledge of certain securities. The note was dated July 6, 1917, and was payable in twelve months from date \u201cwith interest at the rate of <em>5% </em>per centum per annum, payable semi-annually in advance.\u201d In conformity with the terms of the note the interest for the first six months was paid in advance. The note provided that the due and demandable time of payment fixed therein should be accelerated upon the happening of certain specified events. So far as is material to the issue now presented that provision reads: \u201cIn case ... we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors . . . this note shall become due and payable immediately, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, and we hereby promise to pay the same immediately, and in case of the non-performance of this promise ... we hereby authorize and empower . . . [[the defendant] . . . to sell any or all of the securities then held ... it being mutually agreed . . . that the proceeds of said sale after deducting all costs and expenses are to be applied to the payment of any or all the liabilities aforesaid, with interest thereon to maturity; . . .\u201d Mr. Foss made a general assignment to the plaintiffs for the benefit of creditors on November 7,1917. Shortly thereafter, in the exercise of\" the power given by th\u00e9 note, the bank sold the securities pledged and realized therefrom a sum insufficient to pay the principal and the interest for the second six months. The bank applied the proceeds to the payment of the principal debt, and to the payment of the interest so far as the money received went.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">It contends that the obligation of Mr. Foss on making the assignment was not to pay the principal debt immediately, but was to pay that debt and a definite amount of interest which did not accrue from day to day but was \u201creserved by contract for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>of the particular fund for a twelve months\u2019 period and represented a present debt \u2014 an established liability.\u201d In a word, that a \u00a1fair construction of the contract is that the maker of the note agrees to pay for the loan of the money at once, a sum of money equal to six months\u2019 interest on the principal; and on a general assignment for the benefit of creditors the principal sum and a further sum of money -equal to six months\u2019 interest on the principal debt. The defendant further contends that this is not a case where the payee has exercised an option to call the principal debt and by that act has made the debt due and payable immediately, \u25a0because, he argues, by the terms of the instrument itself \u201cthis note,\u201d not the principal, becomes due and payable immediately on thehappening of the event, and that the additional words \u201c\u2018with interest thereon to maturity,\u2019 import an additional payment to be made by the maker, and unless these words are held to carry interest on the liability to the maturity date of the primary contract, they are given no meaning at all and may as well have been omitted from the instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We are of opinion the provisions of the note as to the payment of interest are to be taken in their common signification, and import that the payee is entitled to as much interest at the rate mentioned as shall accrue until the note is paid. And we are also of opinion that the words \u201cwith interest thereon to maturity,\u201d as used in the provision \u201cthat the proceeds of said sale after deducting all costs and expenses are to be applied to the payment of any or all the liabilities aforesaid, with interest thereon to maturity,\u201d have reference to the accrual of interest after the, liabilities, that is, principal and interest, in the note have been determined by the happening of any one of the contingencies specified in the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We do not assent to the contention of the defendant that a secondary contract to pay the principal sum and an \u201c amount of interest reserved by contract for the use of the particular fund\u201d came into existence upon the assignment by reason of the expression \u201cthis note\u201d shall become'due, instead of the more common phrase \u201call sums due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We are of opinion that the principal debt with accrued interest thereon became payable and demandable when the assignment was made on November 9, ,1917. We are of the further opinion that when the debt was paid, the incidental obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>interest thereon came to an end in the absence of any express agreement to continue to pay it thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The plaintiffs, under the third count of their declaration, are entitled to recover the excess of interest paid in advance for the use of the money, and also that part of the money retained from the proceeds of the s\u00e1le of the se\u00e9urities on account of the interest accruing on the note from January 6, 1918, to July 6, 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
