Nor was he required to rule that the order sent by the salesman, \u201cSend to I. Radkay, Hyde Park Ave. . . . ,\u201d constituted a special or implied contract that the title to the goods should not pass until delivery to the buyer at Hyde Park.

The judge by his refusal to rule as requested must be taken to have found that there was no agreement that the title should not pass until delivery at the place of business of the defendant, and to have ruled as he did rule \u201c that the title to the merchandise passed to the defendant upon delivery to Mahoney.\u201d <em>Twitchell-Champlin Co. </em>v. <em>Radovsky, </em>207 Mass. 72.

There was no acceptance until he had exercised this right-or waived it,\u201d is sound as a general statement of the law governing sales by sample, but is inapplicable, and could not have been given when the goods were lost by fire or otherwise, and, as here, in pursuance of the terms of the contract they were to be and were in fact delivered to a carrier chosen by ther purchaser.
