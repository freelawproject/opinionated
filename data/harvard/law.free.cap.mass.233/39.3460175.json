The defendant demurred to this bill. The demurrer was overruled, and no appeal was taken from the order overruling the demurrer. The defendant answered, the case came on for hearing before a judge of the Superior Court and a final decree was entered ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum \\of $1,435.09 and $17.89 costs, and that execution issue therefor. There was no appeal from this decree, and to enforce it these proceedings for contempt were instituted. The plaintiff moving for an order of notice to the defendant to show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt, the judge of the Superior Court ruled that the court had no jurisdiction to punish the defendant for contempt for failing to pay money according to the decree of the Superior Court, \u201cwhen that decree is based upon a decree of a New Jersey court, in separate support or divorce proceedings,\u201d and reported the case with the stipulation that, if his ruling was right, the motion should be overruled; and, if his ruling was wrong, the motion was to stand for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The right to bring an action at law or a suit in equity upon a decree of a court of a foreign State, ordering the payment of arrears of alimony, was discussed in <em>Page </em>v. <em>Page, </em>189 Mass. 85. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>100 Mass. 373, 375. In <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>209 Mass. 282, it was decided that an action at law could be maintained in this Commonwealth upon a final decree of the Circuit Court of Michigan for an ascertained sum of money payable to the divorced wife for the support of herself and children. In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Stowe, </em>218 Mass. 248, an execution for arrears of alimony was issued by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. The plaintiff brought an action in this Commonwealth and recovered on the decree. This court said, page 250: \u201cThe defendant became indebted to the plaintiff for the instalments of alimony as they accrued. The decree was an enforceable judgment in the State where it was rendered; and, at the latest, after execution was issued, it was not open to revision. Our duty to give effect to it clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>results from the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution.\u201d See <em>Sistare </em>v. <em>Sistare, </em>218 U. S. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A decree for separate maintenance or alimony ordered in divorce proceedings is like any other money judgment in an action at law for a debt, or a decree of a court of equity for the payment of money; and it is immaterial whether the original decree was based on an action of contract or on a petition for separate support in divorce proceedings. <em>Sistare </em>v. <em>Sistare, supra. </em>\u201cWhether the original decree was founded upon a common debt or a claim for alimony is entirely immaterial. In the sister State it was known as a decree for the payment of money, and is seen in no other light.\u201d <em>Page </em>v. <em>Page, </em>189 Mass. 85, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The New Jersey decree directed the defendant to furnish a bond with sureties to secure the performance of the decree, and if he neglected to give such bond or provide for the payments ordered the plaintiff was at liberty to apply to the court for process of sequestration or for such other order as the court deemed equitable. These were matters of execution and were no part of the judgment. While the judgment will be enforced in our courts, the plaintiff .cannot insist that the foreign judgment be executed by means of the remedies directed in the New Jersey decree. <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>181 U. S. 183. That decree, when it is before the courts of this Commonwealth for enforcement, is a decree merely for the payment of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The record presents, on the point reported, the single question whether a court of equity has jurisdiction to enforce a decree by contempt proceedings when that decree is merely for the payment of money. Originally the only way by which a court of equity could enforce its decrees was by process of contempt with imprisonment and sequestration of property, and until the power was conferred by statute or rule of court, a court of equity could not issue an execution in common form. This was true of a decree for the payment of money and such a decree was enforced by\u2019 a process of attachment for contempt, and not by execution as in an action at law. See Dan. Ch. Pl. &amp; Pr. (6th Am. ed.) 1032, 1042; 10 R. C. L. 353; <em>Orchard </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>1 Wall. 73, 77; <em>Noonan </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Black, 499, 509. Power is now given by R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 39, to courts of equity to issue writs of execution in common form for the enforcement of their decrees if such process is appropriate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>and also by Equity Rule 37, which rule provides that where a decree in equity is solely for the payment of money, final process to execute the decree may be by writ of execution in common form. See <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Purple, </em>107 Mass. 428, 434; <em>Slade </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>106 Mass. 499, 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Although in modern practice a money decree in equity is generally enforced by process of execution as in ordinary Cases and not by contempt proceedings,\u2014 see <em>Clements </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>79 Ga. 451; <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Hornthal, </em>154 N. Y. 648; U. S. Equity Rule 8; Equity Rule 37; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>214 Mass. 29; see, in this connection, <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>9 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1071; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>18 Dick. 306, \u2014 nevertheless a court of equity still retains its jurisdiction to enforce or carry out its decrees, include ing a decree for the payment of money, by proceedings for contempt. See Dan. Ch. Pl. &amp; Pr. <em>supra; Jones </em>v. <em>Boston Mill Corp. </em>4 Pick. 507. And this power to enforce a money decree by attachment for contempt is no greater than the power conferred by R. L. c. 168, \u00a7\u00a7 80, 81. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>173 Mass. 498. It follows that the court had jurisdiction to enforce its decree for a money payment by issuing an attachment for contempt, and the ruling of the Superior Court that it \u201chad no jurisdiction to punish the defendant for contempt in failing to pay money according to a decree of that court, when that decree is based upon a decree of a New Jersey court in separate support or divorce proceedings in New Jersey\u201d was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">According to the terms of the\" report, the motion is to stand for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
