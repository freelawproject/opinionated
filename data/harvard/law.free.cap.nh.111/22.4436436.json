No petition has been brought before the Berlin District Court charging Lucille Stranger with being a delinquent because of her alleged conduct with the defendant Earl Cross, under the provisions of RSA 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u201c At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved for the dismissal of both complaints,, on the grounds that, in essence, the alleged conduct of the defendant with Lucille Stranger constituted the crime of fornication, and that he could not be convicted on either complaint \u2018solely upon the testimony of a partner in guilt \u2019 in view of the provisions of RSA 579:4. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Upon the defendant\u2019s motions for dismissal of both complaints, the questions of law thereby raised were reserved and transferred to this court without ruling, under RSA 502-A: 17-a, by <em>J. L. Blais, </em>District Court Judge. In this court, the State thereafter moved to remand the case without decision of the transferred questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The defendant claims that the complaints must be dismissed because of the provisions of RSA 579:4 which read as follows: \u201c If any person shall be guilty of fornication such person shall be fined not more than My dollars, or imprisoned not more than six months; but no person shall be convicted solely upon the testimony of a partner in guilt. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">It is established law here that the requirement of the testimony of more than one witness in order to convict of an offense is an exception to the general rule and is not required unless expressly so provided by the Constitution or statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Desilets, </em>96 N.H. 245, 73 A.2d 800 (1950). RSA 579:3, which defines the offense with which the defendant is charged, states: \u201cIf any person shall be guilty of gross lewdness or lascivious behavior such person shall be imprisoned not more than six months or fined not more than two hundred dollars, or both</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The defendant argues in effect that to prove the offense with which he is charged, the State must prove fornication. This is not so. Clearly one may be guilty of lascivious behavior without committing the offense of fornication. RSA 579:4 provides that the defendant shall not be \u201c convicted \u201d of the crime of fornication except upon corroborating testimony. It does not prevent the use of evidence of fornication for .purposes other than conviction of that offense. The offenses under section 3 and section 4 are separate and distinct. That the alleged behavior of the defendant was \u201c lascivious \u201d and a violation of section 3 there can be no doubt. <em>State </em>v. Lizotte, 101 N.H. 494, 148 A.2d 91 (1959). The acts alleged in the complaint here go much further than those in the <em>Lizotte </em>case. In short, the offense with which the defendant was charged under section 3 did not require that the State first prove him guilty of fornication, under section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In regard to the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (RSA 169:32 as amended by Laws 1965, 129:1), the defendant offers the same defense, namely that he must first be convicted of fornication, which he cannot be because of 579:4. Again we hold that while he could not be convicted of fornication because of section 4, nevertheless the testimony of the minor was admissible to prove that he contributed to her delinquency under RSA 169:32 (supp.) which was in effect at the time of the alleged offense. This provides, so far as material, that anyone \u201cwho . . . has knowingly or wilfully done any act to produce, promote or contribute to the delinquency\u201d of a minor may be found guilty of the offense proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The words \u201cfound to be delinquent,\u201d which orginally appeared in the statute (RSA 169:32 ) were stricken by the 1965 amendment. Laws 1965, 129:1. It is therefore clear that the fact that the minor had not been found a delinquent in court proceedings under chapter 169 is immaterial. We need not labor the point that the acts alleged in the complaint could be found to have contributed to the minor\u2019s delinquence under RSA 169: 2 (II), since in the words of that section they were such as to \u201cendanger the health or morals of [herself] or others. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The State\u2019s motion to remand is denied; the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss the complaints, based upon the provisions of RSA 579:4 are likewise denied.
