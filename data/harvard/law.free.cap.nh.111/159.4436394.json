On August 14, 1967, the following written memorandum on a printed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>form entitled \u201c Agreement \u201d was signed by the plaintiff Robert F. Cunningham and the defendant Anna Singer. It reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201c The Cunninghams will purchase house with contents and one acre of land . . . first house on the left belonging to Mrs. Anna Singer ... on Lewis Hill Bethlehem, N. H.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cA survey will be made of the acre the cost of which will be shared by the Singers and Cunninghams equally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201cThe sale price will be $3,200 total. Sale to be completed on search of title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u201cA warranty deed will be presented by the Singers. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The matter was heard by a Master ( <em>William E. Lovejoy, </em>Esq. ) who made certain findings and rulings and recommended that specific performance be ordered for the conveyance to the plaintiff of the one acre lot and buildings thereon according to a descrip - tion resulting from a survey made on August 21, 1967. The Court (Johnson, J.) accepted the master\u2019s report after denying defendant\u2019s motion that it be set aside. Defendant\u2019s exceptions were reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The above writing executed by the parties clearly establish their agreement to buy and sell a certain one acre parcel of land. <em>Swanson </em>v. Priest, 95 N.H. 64, 66, 58 A.2d 207, 208 (1948). However, no action could be maintained upon it \u201cunless the agreement ... or some memorandum thereof, is in writing and signed by the party to be charged. . . . \u201d RSA506:1. The required writing must identify the parties, state the price, and describe the land involved. <em>Kidder </em>v. Flanders, 73 N.H. 345, 346, 61 A. 675, 676 (1905); Simpson, Contracts <em>s. </em>90 (2d ed. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Defendant\u2019s main contention appears to be that the description of the premises is insufficient to meet the requirements of the statute. It is true that the writing relied upon to constitute the memorandum must in and of itself furnish the evidence that the minds of the parties met as to the particular property which one party proposed to sell and the other party proposed to buy. However, reasonable certainty is all that is demanded and that requirement is fulfilled if the meaning of the contract, as a whole, is intelligible to the court. <em>Jesseman </em>v. Aurelio, 106 N.H. 529, 532, 214 A.2d 743, 746 (1965). Parol evidence of extrinsic circumstances may be resorted to for the purpose of specifically designating the property to which both parties are shown to have referred by the terms of the writing. <em>Gilbert v. </em>Tremblay, 79 N.H. 431, 432, 111 A. 314, 315-16 (1920); 49 Am. Jur. Statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Frauds <em>s. </em>349 (1943); 4 Williston, Contracts <em>s. </em>578, at 102 (3d ed. W.H.E. Jaeger 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">There was evidence that, when the defendant listed her property with the real estate broker who negotiated this sale, she pointed out to the broker the approximate boundaries of the one acre to be conveyed. There was further evidence that, when the parties signed the agreement of sale, the defendant verbally gave the boundary lines over again and agreed to an immediate survey. The broker testified that at the time of signing \u201cthere was a general understanding between all the parties of the general boundaries of the property. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The survey was made within one week thereafter. The defendant and her husband were present at the site when it was made and directed the surveyor as to the boundaries to be followed. The resulting plan and a specific description of the one acre to be conveyed were in evidence as exhibits before the master. Any ambiguity in the agreement as to the description of the property to be conveyed had thus been removed at the time the petition for specific performance was instituted. <em>White </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>74 N.H. 71, 73, 65 A. 255, 257 (1906); <em>Jesseman </em>v. <em>Aurelio, </em>106 N.H. 529, 533, 214 A.2d 743, 747 (1965); <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Blaisdell, </em>85 Me. 199, 27 A. 101 (1892); 37 C.J.S. Statute of Frauds <em>s. </em>190 (1943); <em>see </em>Annots., 23 A.L.R.2d 6 (1952); 46 A.L.R.2d 894 (1956). Consequently the master properly found that the agreement of the parties sufficiently identified the property covered thereby. Specific performance could properly be decreed as defendant\u2019s counsel stipulated the plaintiff was ready to perform. <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>First Church of Christ, </em>101 N.H. 363, 366, 143 A.2d 671, 674 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Defendant argues, however, that the court erred in so ordering because of an impossibility of performance by the defendant. The evidence is uncontradicted that she still owns the land to be conveyed. The evidence shows the defendant clearly agreed to convey by warranty deed which implies an undertaking to convey free of her husband\u2019s right of qurtesy. <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>95 N.H. 64, 58 A.2d 207 (1948); RSA 560:9. The evidence is also uncontradicted that her husband was present when the agreement was executed and when tire survey was made. He showed no outward signs of being upset at the sale but rather \u201c he appeared happy to be selling the property to us. \u201d There is no basis on the record to presume that defendant\u2019s husband will refuse to join with her in the conveyance ordered by the court. <em>Rodman </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>Robinson, </em>134 N.C. 503, 47 S.E. 19 (1904); <em>cf. </em>11 Williston, Contracts s. 1422, at 758 (3d ed. W.H.E. Jaeger 1968 ).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
