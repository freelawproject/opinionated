Between his main course and dessert, he was proceeding to the men\u2019s room which was at the foot of the flight of stairs in question. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>testified that when he approached the top of the stairs to descend to the men\u2019s room his foot slipped and he fell, causing injuries for which he seeks damages. There was a trial by jury with a view, resulting in a verdict for the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the Court\u2019s charge were transferred by <em>Keller, </em>J. During the trial, experts for both parties testified regarding the requirements of the National Building Code relative to internal stairways. The Nashua Building Code required that buildings be provided with \u201c exit facilities in accordance with the requirements set forth in Article VI of the 1955 Edition of the National Building Code ...\u201d which were made part of the Nashua ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The National Code defines an exit way as follows: \u201cExit way means the exit doorway or doorways, or such doorways together with connecting hallways or stairways, either interior or exterior, or fire escapes, by means of which occupants may proceed safely from a room or space to a street or to an open space which provides safe access to a street. \u201d Sec. 601.1( b ).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Internal stairways are required under the National Code to have \u201c a surface designed to limit the danger of slipping thereon. \u201d Art VI, Sec. 604.1(c). The latter provision would apply under the Nashua ordinance only to internal stairways which fall within the National Code definition of \u201c exit ways. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The trial court instructed the jury that he was ruling that the stairway in question was not an exit stairway and that any claim based on a violation of the Building Code was withdrawn from their consideration. He then instructed them on common-law negligence. Plaintiff had requested instructions relating to violations of the code and duly excepted to the court\u2019s failure to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The defendant operates a restaurant with several rooms at ground level. According to a plan which was an exhibit, one enters through a vestibule into a foyer. According to the scale of the plan, the vestibule is about 4' x 6' and the foyer is about 10' x 31'. The plan shows a doorway out of the foyer into the Revere Room where the cashier\u2019s desk is located just inside the doorway. Proceeding forward and turning left, one can pass through an archway into the Heritage Room, so-called, which is the room where plaintiff was seated for his meal. The stairway in question runs from the archway just mentioned to the rest rooms below ground. The stairs are covered with the same kind of nylon carpet as the floor of the room from which they descend. Plaintiff testified that as he approached the stairway to descend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to the men\u2019s room, his foot slipped and he fell. It had been his intention to return to his table to finish his dessert after visiting the men\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">We hold that the trial court committed no error in withdrawing the question of the violation of the Building Code from the jury. Ascending the stairs, one may enter either the Heritage Room to the left or the room where the cashier is located to the right. There is no exit from the Heritage Room except through the Revere Room, and there is no exit from the Revere Room to a street except through the foyer. The stairway therefore does not in our opinion fall within the definition of an \u201cexit way\u201d as defined in the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Plaintiff argues that the stairway must be an exit way because the code requires that every \u201cstory\u201d shall have at least one exit way. Sec. 602.1. Even if an \u201cexit way\u201d were required from this basement, the stairway in question does not meet the test for an exit way, as defined by the code because it does not lead to a \u201cspace which provides safe access to a street. \u201d Sec. 601.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Plaintiff further contends that he was prejudiced because the trial court allowed the jury to hear evidence about the Building Code requirements and then withdrew the issue from them. He contends that this could only confuse and mislead the jury and that they may have decided that the court had exonerated the defendant from liability. We cannot uphold that contention. The court\u2019s charge clearly indicated that the defendant could be held liable for negligence, and we do not believe that the jury could have been misled into believing that the court had exonerated the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
