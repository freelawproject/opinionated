Would any constitutional provision be violated by imposing a tax upon meals and rooms under RSA 78-A at a rate, of 5% of the charge for the meal or room, and by imposing a tax of <em>3% </em>upon the sale of tangible personal property and certain services as listed in House Bill 382, which would specifically exempt any tax on meals and rooms as taxed by RSA 78-A?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">\u201c2. If question No. 1 is answered in the affirmative, would there be any constitutional provision violated by amending RSA 78-A so as to impose a 3% tax on the transactions taxed by the meals and rooms tax law?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">\u201c3. Would any constitutional provision be violated by any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>other provisions of House Bill 382 and the proposed amendment to it accompanying this petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201c Be it Further Resolved, That the speaker transmit seven copies of this resolution, of House Bill 382, and of the proposed amendment to House Bill 382 to the Clerk of the Supreme Court for consideration by the court. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The following answer was returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>To the House of Representatives-.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The undersigned Justices of the Supreme Court reply as follows to the inquiries pertaining to House Bill 382 contained in your resolution adopted March 31, 1971 and filed with this court on April 2, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">House Bill 382, section 3 would enact a new chapter, to be entitled Chapter 78-C, \u201cSales and Use Tax. \u201d It would impose a tax of 3% on retail sales of tangible property and on the gross value of many services enumerated therein (s.3,78-C:2(VI)(d) (1)-( 8 )). It would exempt certain specified sales, some of which are otherwise taxed. <em>S. </em>3, 78-C:9. The exemptions would include services in connection with \u201cMeals and Rooms subject to taxes imposed by RSA 78-A, \u201d if a proposed amendment to section 3 is adopted. While the proposed amendment as submitted with your resolution refers to \u201cRSA 78-C:9 as inserted by section 1 of the bill, \u201d we think it evident that section 3 of the bill is thereby intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Your first inquiry is as follows: \u201cWould any constitutional provision be violated by imposing a tax upon meals and rooms under RSA 78-A at a rate of 5% of the charge for the meal or room, and by imposing a tax of 3% upon the sale of tangible personal property and certain services as listed in House Bill 382, which would specifically exempt any tax on meals and rooms as taxed by RSA 78-A?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">We are in agreement with what was said in <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 97 N.H. 533, 535, 536, 81 A.2d 845, 848 (1951): \u201c It should be noted that the validity of a tax on retail sales is not questioned. That such a tax is constitutional has been declared by this court on former occasions. <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 84 N.H. 559, 576; <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 88 N.H. 500; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. 546. \u2018 The tax being upon \u201c the transmission of property in a distinctive way, \u201d it is immaterial whether it be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>placed upon the seller cr upon the purchaser. \u2019 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>88 N.H. 500, 503. Tangible personal property sold at retail is one of the \u2018other classes of property\u2019 referred to in <em>Art. </em>6 of Part II of the Constitution as being subject to taxation. See also, <em>Havens </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>91 N.H. 115; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N.H. 506.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We also recognize as stated therein that the \u201c Legislature has liberal powers with respect to the classification of taxable property. \u201d <em>Id. </em>536. The exercise of its powers of taxation however is also subject to the requirements of equality and proportionality, (CONST. pt. II, art. 5 ) which operate to require that all subjects of taxation within a given class shall be taxed at a uniform rate. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N.H. 506, 509, 52 A.2d 294 (1947); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 517, 113 A.2d 119 (1955); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>106 N.H. 202, 208 A.2d 458 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Your question presents the issue of whether the services of furnishing rooms for hire, and prepared meals and beverage and accompanying services, which are taxed under RSA 78-A( supp. ), are sufficiently distinguishable from other services which would be taxed under House Bill 382, as to make it apparent that just reason exists to tax them at a higher rate than the services enumerated by section 3, 78-C:9 of the bill. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 517, 518, 113 A.2d 119, 120 (1955); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>97 N.H. 546, 81 A.2d 853 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Services which would be taxed by the bill include \u201cthe service of repairing, altering, mending, pressing, fitting, dyeing, laundering, dry cleaning, or cleaning tangible personal property, \u201d the service of printing, photographing or copying, barber and beauty services to persons and animals, parking services for motor vehicles and boats, and intrastate telephonic and telegraphic services. No doubt each type of the enumerated services has some unique trait not present in the services of providing meals or rooms, but as to all services, the \u201c characteristic event \u201d which justifies imposition of a tax differing from the general property tax is the same \u2014 namely, the furnishing or sale of a service. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>84 N.H. 559, 575, 149 A. 321, 329 (1930); <em>Havens </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, </em>91 N.H. 115, 118-19, 14 A.2d 636, 638 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Whether the right to a prepared meal and the right to occupy a room can reasonably be considered a separate \u201cclass of property \u201d within the meaning of the language inserted in article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>6, part II of the Constitution by the amendment of 1903, which can be distinguished from the right to other services to be taxed under House Bill 382 is a matter as to which we have been furnished no argument or information. On its face and in the abstract such a classification may be of doubtful constitutionality. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 512, 112 A.2d 44 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Comparison of the services to be taxed under House Bill 382 with those of furnishing meals or rooms now taxed under RSA ch. 78-A (supp.) illustrates the \u201cdanger of creating, by narrow classification, a tax upon occupations or privileges \u201d (<em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>97 N.H. 546, 548, 81 A.2d 853, 855 (1951)), which would \u201cfail to promote \u2018equal or honest division of [the] common burden\u2019. <em>Robinson </em>v. Dover, 59 N.H. 521, 528.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although they may exist, no reasons have been presented to us \u201c which may fairly be thought just and in the public interest \u201d (<em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 94 N.H. 506, 509, 52 A.2d 294, 296 (1947)) for the selection of the services taxed by RSA ch. 78-A (supp. ) for taxation at one rate, and those enumerated in House Bill 382 for taxation at another. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 517, 113 A.2d 119 (1955); <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>82 N.H. 561, 138 A. 284 (1927); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. 555, 65 A.2d 876 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">On the basis of the information presently available to us, our answer to your first question is \u201c Yes. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Your second question is as follows: \u201c If question No. 1 is answered in the affirmative, would there be any constitutional-provision violated by amending RSA 78-A so as to impose a 3% tax on the transactions taxed by the meals and rooms tax law?\u201d We assume that the question implies that House Bill 382 would also be enacted if the rate imposed by RSA ch. 78-A should be changed to 3%. Upon this assumption, our answer to your second question is \u201c No. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Your third question with respect to \u201c any other provisions of House Bill 382 and the proposed amendment \u201d is also answered \u201c No. \u201d In view of the complexity of the bill and the absence of adversative argument, \u201c [w]e have not undertaken to consider all the provisions of the bill in every detail to ascertain whether they may be objectionable. . . . \u2018 We do not conceive that it is our province to do so. \u2019 <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>84 N.H. 559, 564. \u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>94 N.H. 510, 512, 52 A.2d 297, 298 (1947); <em>see Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 525, 528, 113 A.2d 547, 548 (1955).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALEg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>pSamuel L.
