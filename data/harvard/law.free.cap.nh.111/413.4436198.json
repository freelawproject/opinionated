The ordinance defines a \u201chome occupation\u201d as \u201c[a]n occupation conducted in a dwelling. \u201d S. 28.48. Plaintiffs, neighbors of one Mackinaw, appealed from the decision of the board granting him a permit to operate a real estate office in his home located in a general residence district where such a business is prohibited unless it can be considered a \u201ccustomary home occup\u00e1tion. \u201d The matter was submitted to the superior court on an agreed statement of facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>exhibits and was transferred here by <em>Flynn, </em>J., without ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\">We hold that the permit was improperly granted. The occupation of a real estate agent has been held to be a business and not a profession. <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>104 N.H. 90, 179 A.2d 451 (1962). It is an occupation which may not readily be carried on within the confines of the home as can all those enumerated in the ordinance. As was the case in <em>Perron </em>v. <em>Concord, </em>102 N.H. 32, 150 A.2d 403 (1959), involving a roofing business, the real estate business involves work outside the home showing the properties of others which are for sale. As such, it is not an occupation \u201csuch as\u201d those described in the ordinance. <em>S. </em>45. We hold that the operation of a real estate business is not an accessory use which is customarily incident to the use of residential premises. Rather it is a business use which if intended to be permitted in a general residence district should be clearly provided for in the ordinance as was \u201c hairdressing. \u201d This ordinance does not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The city relies upon the \u201c supplementary district regulations \u201d of the ordinance pertaining to \u201chome occupations <em>\u201d(s. </em>28.21) and suggests that since these regulations would not be violated by the proposed use, the permit was properly granted. The supplementary regulations, however, do not provide an independent category of permitted uses, but rather consist of restrictions upon the customary home occupations permitted by the \u201ctable of district regulations, \u201d in which they are included as a permitted accessory use. Thus where the proposed use is not a customary home occupation, compliance with the supplementary regulations will not serve to make it one.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Defendant contends that the fact that it found 14 real estate agencies being operated from residences or residence-type buildings shows that it is a customary home occupation. We must dis - agree. The fact that 14 such agencies are carried on from residence-type buildings does not make it a home occupation such as those described in the ordinance. It has been represented to us that only two of the 14 are operating under permits granted for customary home occupations and one of them has ceased operations at the residence location. The balance are either in a business zone or are operating without a permit. If the ordinance is not being enforced in certain instances this cannot alter the meaning of the ordinance. Because some real estate agencies are being operated with or without a permit from homes does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>make the real estate business a customary home occupation such as those enumerated in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We hold that the ruling of the board that the real estate business is a usual home occupation within the meaning of the ordinance was incorrect. <em>Perron </em>v. <em>Concord supra.
