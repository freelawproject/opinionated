Herron, a citizen and resident of the town of Northwood, New Hampshire, petitioned for injunctive relief under RSA 91-A:7 to enjoin the town from holding a closed executive session of the budget committee on January 30, 1971. At a hearing in the superior court on January 28, 1971, the Court <em>(Perkins, </em>J.) denied the injunction, dismissed the petition, and reserved and transferred the plaintiff\u2019s exception thereto. The petition was initiated following the vote of the town\u2019s budget committee, at the second of two public hearings held in accordance with the Municipal Budget Law (RSA ch. 32 ), to exclude the public from the third and final meeting of the committee at which recommendations would be formulated for action by the voters at the annual town meeting. It is the plaintiff\u2019s contention that this action by the budget committee was contrary to the wording and spirit of RSA 91 -A:3( I) ( supp.) as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The 1969 amendment provided that certain executive sessions must be open to the public. Language was added by Laws 1969, 482:2 to the effect that executive sessions might still be held to conduct \u201c deliberations, but, subject to the provisions of paragraph II, all sessions at which information, evidence or testimony in any form is received shall be open to the public. \u201d There is evidence in the legislative history of the 1969 amendment to indicate that its decision to further restrict the holding of executive sessions was in part a response to the refusal of this court to enjoin exclusion of a newspaper reporter from an executive session of the finance committee of the Keene City Council at which information regarding the budget was being received. <em>Selkowe </em>v. Bean, 109 N.H. 247, 249 A.2d 35 (1968); 1969 S. Jour. 1110, 1112-113; see Note, Open Meeting Statutes: The Press Fights For The \u201c Right To Know,\u201d 75 Harv. L. Rev. 1199 (1962); 1 Antieau, Municipal Corporation Law <em>s. </em>4.01, at 173 (1965, Supp. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The 1971 amendment, ch. 327, extended the provisions of the statute to the legislature and all its committees, subject to certain enumerated exceptions. <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:3(II) (e) (supp.). Both amendments indicate a disposition to broaden the statute\u2019s scope and application. 1 Yokley, Municipal Corporations s. 77 (1956, Supp. 1971); 4 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations <em>s. </em>13.07a (rev. vol. 1968, Supp. 1970); <em>Brazer v. Borough of Mountainside, </em>102 N.J. Super. 497, 246 A.2d 170 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>That the meetings of the budget committee of the town of North-wood, the final meeting of which plaintiff sought to attend, are included within the term \u201c public proceedings \u201d as defined by RSA 91-A:l( supp. ), is not contested. Unless subject to qualifications enumerated elsewhere in the statute, the directive of RSA 91-A:2 (supp.), that, \u201cAll public proceedings [as defined by section 1] shall be open to the public . ...\u201d is determinative of this contro - versy.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Defendant relies upon the provisions of RSA 91-A:3(I) ( supp.), to sustain its position that the trial court ruled correctly. In pertinent part, it provides as follows: \u201c Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prevent these bodies or agencies [affected by the provisions of the statute] from holding executive sessions for conducting deliberations, but .... [n]o . . . official actions shall be <em>finally approved </em>in executive session except as provided in paragraph II. \u201d ( Emphasis added ).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">That the statute treats the subject of executive sessions from the standpoint of both subject matter and the taking of final action is settled. <em>See Selkowe </em>v. <em>Bean, supra </em>at 249, 249 A.2d at 37. However, no contention is made by defendant that the subject matter exceptions of section 3(H) apply to this case. Instead, the town asserts that section I applies to sustain the propriety of holding the executive session in question, contending that, \u201c [Fjinal action was taken [on the budget], not by the Committee, but by the voters at the Town and School District meetings. \u201d We disagree with this reasoning. Annot. 38 A.L.R.3d 1070 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The function of the budget committee is to \u201cprepare and submit \u201d for action by the town, a budget for school district and town expenditures after holding \u201c at least one public hearing on each budget.\u201d RSA 32:5. This submission is the final step taken by the committee in accordance with the powers and duties delegated to it under RSA ch. 32. That this action is \u201cfinal \u201d and that it was in this case carried out in executive session is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The construction defendant would have us attribute to the \u201c final approval \u201d provision would frustrate the primary purpose of the statute to permit freedom of access to public records and proceed - ings. Consistent with this purpose, the general term \u201cfinal approval \u201d must be read to connote finality <em>within the scope of the powers delegated </em>to that board, commission, agency or authority subject to the provisions of the statute. This case is squarely in accord with <em>Selkowe </em>v. Bean, 109 N.H. 247, 249 A.2d 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>(1968). The evidence in that case established that \u201c no \u2018 decisions \u2019 were made by the finance committee at the meeting which the plaintiff sought to attend, and no final approval given to the budget, or to any recommendation to be made to the city council at these meetings. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 249 A.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The defendant in its brief argues that the budget committee can perform its functions better in executive session. \u201c The members of the Budget Committee, under the Statute, are carefully selected to represent the interests of property taxpayers in the Town. They devote many hours to public service without compensation. It is the feeling of the majority of the members of the Budget Committee of the Town of Northwood, with all due respect to the petitioner\u2019s desire for improved municipal government, that they can perform their function of preparing budget recommendations for submission to the Town more effectively and in a more orderly manner if they are permitted, under the law, to do so without the participation of those not elected to the task. \u201d While this argument has merit the legislature has decreed otherwise, and has placed a high premium on the public\u2019s right to know. 1 Hardy, Municipal Law and Practice 5. 16 (1971); 54 Cal. L. Rev. 1650 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The defendant directs our attention to the fact that this meeting which plaintiff sought to attend was held in executive session on January 30, 1971, and hence the question presentedis moot. \u201c The question of mootness \u2018is not subject to rigid rules but seems rather, to be regarded as one of convenience and discretion.\u2019 <em>Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>98 N.H. 399, 401. A decision upon the merits may be thought justified where there is a pressing public interest involved ... , or future litigation may be avoided. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>101 N.H. 340, 342, 143 A.2d 114, 116 (1958). <em>See also Hinse </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>108 N.H. 58, 226 A.2d 865 (1967); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>State, </em>109 N.H. 353, 252 A.2d 431 (1970). We think such an interest is presented by this case with particular reference to future meetings. <em>See Sugar Hill Improvement Ass'n </em>v. <em>Lisbon, </em>104 N.H. 40, 42, 178 A.2d 512, 513-14(1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s petition for injunctive relief was presumably drafted under the pressure of time and was not a model of clarity. It may have misled the trial court inasmuch as the plaintiff asked for the right to attend \u201cthe discussion and vote on every line item. \u201d Of course the right to vote was not a right that she had or now demands. Accordingly we give this opinion prospective effect only and do not invalidate the actions of the town meeting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>passing on the budget committee recommendations. <em>Madbury </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>108 N.H. 474, 240 A.2d 760 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
