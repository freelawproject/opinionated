Roy <em>v. </em>Manchester Gas Company</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsE\">July 29, 1971.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-7\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AfG\">The present petition represents another effort by the plaintiff in his unremitting quest for additional compensation for personal injuries he sustained on February 4, 1954 in the course of his employment by the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was litigated and determined in <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Manchester Gas </em>Company, 104 N.H. 318, 185 A.2d 486 (1962), and his subsequent efforts, heretofore, to secure additional compensation by attempting to relitigate his claim and to raise new issues have been denied. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Manchester Gas </em>Company, 108 N.H. 492, 493, 238 A.2d 599, 600 (1968); <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>106 N.H. 179, 207 A.2d 434, 435 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Following the judgment adverse to him in <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Manchester Gas </em>Company, 108 N.H. 492, 238 A.2d 599 (1968), the plaintiff sought vindication of his claim in the federal courts. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued a memorandum and order on September 10, 1968 affirming the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, which had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for lack of jurisdiction. In affirming the district court judgment, the court of appeals said, in part, that \u201c [t]he district court was correct .... The local action between the parties did not involve constitutional rights, but concerned simply a claim arising out of a personal injury. This was a local matter. An erroneous decision \u2014 if it were such \u2014 on such matters does not violate the Constitution. \u201d The court of appeals mandate therein was issued on October 1, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Appearing pro se, the plaintiff entered in this court a \u201c plea for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>payment of claim \u201d which he allegedly based upon the court of appeals mandate. In that plea, he requested this court \u201c to award him his claim . . . against the [Manchester Gas Company] \u201d because [t]he United States Court of Appeals ruled that the decision <em>[Roy </em>v. <em>Manchester Gas </em>Company, 108 N.H. 492, 238 A.2d 599 (1968)] was erroneous \u2014 if it were such. The decision of the judges of the Supreme Court was mistaken .... The United States Court of Appeals ruled in Per Curiam that this decision was wrong. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">As a result of this misconception of the content and significance of the court of appeals\u2019 memorandum and order and the mandate therein, the plaintiff has prepared and submitted to this court, in addition to his \u201cplea of payment of claim,\u201d a \u201cpetition,\u201d two \u201cmotions for writs of execution, \u201d a \u201c writ of execution, \u201d a \u201cpetition for a writ of mandamus, \u201d and many other communications variously styled but uniformly based upon the erroneous premise of the plaintiff that he prevailed in the federal courts. All of these pleadings assume erroneously that this court was obligated to order the Manchester Gas Company to additionally compensate the plaintiff on his claim for personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The petition has no merit, and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
