Do the provisions of House Bill No. 621 change the charter or form of government of the Pelham school district?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">\u201c2. If the answer to question 1 is in the negative is a school district a city or town for the purposes of Article 39, Part First of the Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">\u201c Be It Further Resolved that the Speaker transmit seven copies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>of this resolution and of House Bill 621 to the clerk of the Supreme Court for consideration by said court. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The following answer was returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>To the House of Representatives :</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The undersigned Justices of the Supreme Court submit the following reply to your request for advice included in your resolution adopted March 31, 1971 and filed in this court on April 2, 1971, relating to House Bill No. 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">House Bill No. 621, entitled \u201cAN ACT increasing the authorized debt limit of the Pelham school district \u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u201c 1. Debt Limit Increased. Notwithstanding the provisions of RSA 33:4- a the Pelham school district may incur net indebtedness to an amount at any one time outstanding not exceeding twelve percent of its valuation determined pursuant to RSA 33:4-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u201c2. Effective Date. This act shall take effect upon its passage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">You submitted the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">\u201c 1. Do the provisions of House Bill No. 621 change the charter or form of government of the Pelham school district?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">\u201c2. If the answer to question 1 is in the negative is a school district a city or town for the purposes of Article 39, Part First of the New Hampshire Constitution? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Part I, article 39 of the Constitution of the State of New Hampshire as inserted in 1966 provides that no law changing the charter or form of government of a particular city or town shall become effective except upon approval of the voters of such city or town upon a referendum to be provided for in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">House Bill No. 621 would authorize an increase in the debt limit of the Pelham school district as limited by RSA 33:4-a (supp. ) modified by Laws of 1957, chapter 381. This would not be a law \u201cchanging the charter or form of government\u201d of the Pelham school district but is one which would relieve the school district from the debt limitation of a statute applicable to school districts in general. Thus it does not fall within the requirements of part I, article 39 of the Constitution. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>109 N.H. 396, 400, 254 A.2d 273, 276 (1969). The answer to your first question is therefore in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Since our answer to your first question makes an answer to your second question unnecessary, we respectfully decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>answer it. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>109 N.H. 367, 368, 253 A.2d 492, 493 (1969).</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-3\">Frank R.
