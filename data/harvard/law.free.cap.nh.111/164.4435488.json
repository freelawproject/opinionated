The determination of ownership was transferred without ruling on an agreed statement of facts by Keller, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">The property in question was owned by Frances M. Taylor on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>November 27, 1938, the date of her death. Frances M. Taylor died testate without issue survived by her husband Richard B. Taylor. The second paragraph of her will is as follows: \u201c SECOND I give, bequeath and devise my home on the Daniel Webster Highway in said Bedford, together with the contents thereof to my husband, Richard B. Taylor, for life, with the power to mortgage or sell the same in his discretion if he shall deem it necessary for his comfort and support, with the right at his death to dispose of the same by will among his heirs or my heirs, and in default of appointment equally to my next of kin, if I should then die intestate, and to his next of kin at his death. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Richard B. Taylor did not mortgage or sell the real estate during his lifetime and died without issue on August 17, 1967 survived by his second wife Margaret G. Taylor. The fifth paragraph of his will left the property in question to \u201c my wife, Margaret G. Taylor, if living at my decease. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The next of kin of Frances M. Taylor as of the time of the death of Richard B. Taylor are the plaintiffs John W. McLane, James Robert McLane, Marjorie Stevens and Shirley McLane, her nephews and nieces. The next of kin of Richard B. Taylor surviving him was the defendant Bertha L. Marden.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The will of Frances M. Taylor gave Richard B. Taylor a limited power to dispose of the real estate both during his lifetime and by will. Not having disposed of it during his lifetime the devise to his widow Margaret G. Taylor would not be effective unless the phrase \u201c his heirs \u201d in the will of Frances included his widow. The word \u2018\u201cheirs\u2019 has an ordinary well - accepted legal meaning, viz: those persons who succeed to a decedent\u2019s property at his death if he dies intestate . . . . \u201d <em>Colony </em>v. <em>Colony, </em>97 N.H. 386, 391, 89 A.2d 909, 912 (1952); <em>In re Davis Estate, </em>108 N.H. 163, 165, 229 A.2d 694, 695 (1967). Technically speaking a surviving spouse is not an \u201c heir \u201d and \u201c takes no interest in any New Hampshire real estate as an heir. \u201d <em>Chisholm </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>99 N.H. 12, 15, 104 A.2d 514, 516 (1954); <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Ordway, </em>59 N.H. 378 (1879). Their rights are determined by waiver of dower or homestead under RSA ch. 560 rather than as heirs under the statute of descent and distribution. RSA 561:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Cases in other jurisdictions reaching a different result generally involve statutes of descent and distribution designating surviving spouses as heirs. <em>First Agricultural Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>351 Mass. 1, 217 N.E.2d 779 (1966); Annot., 157 A.L.R. 347 (1945); Annot., 79 A.L.R.2d 1438 (1961); 4 Page, Wills s. 34.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Bowe-Parker ed. 1961); <em>see Linnell v. Smith, </em>153 Me. 288, 137 A.2d 357 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The defendant Margaret G. Taylor concedes that widows are not ordinarily \u201c heirs \u201d but argues that in the light of all the surrounding circumstances she should be considered an heir in this case. The difficulty with this argument is that there are no surrounding circumstances or extrinsic evidence that would permit us to read \u201cinto the will language expressive of an entirely different purpose from that disclosed by the clear language of the will. \u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>78 N.H. 224, 234-35, 99 A. 18, 24 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In disposing of her property in case of default of appointment by her surviving husband\u2019s will, the testatrix provided that it should go in equal shares to her husband\u2019s \u201c next of kin \u201d and to her own \u201c next of kin, \u201d as if she had died intestate at the time of her surviving husband\u2019s death. <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>80 N.H. 225, 116 A. 344 (1921). Nothing in the record suggests that her use of the words \u201c next of kin, \u201d in contrast to the words \u201c his heirs or my heirs \u201d used in the power of appointment, signified an intention that \u201cheirs\u201d should designate a broader class which would include her husband\u2019s second wife. Her use of \u201cnext of kin\u201d appears rather to result from appreciation that if the property were to pass by intestacy it would go to the \u201c next of kin \u201d as provided by RSA 561:1. <em>See Pinkham </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>57 N.H. 226, 244 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The will of Richard B. Taylor was ineffective to exercise the power granted to him by his deceased wife\u2019s will and accordingly at his death the property belonged equally to his and his former wife\u2019s \u201c next of kin \u201d as provided by herwill. So John W. McLane, James Robert McLane, Marjorie Stevens and Shirley McLane each own a one-eighth interest while Bertha L. Marden owns the remaining one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-9\">Griffith, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
