She presents two questions for review, which we have combined and reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">Did the circuit court err in ruling that she was barred from pursuing a claim against the SIF by a settlement of her claim previously approved by the Commission?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Hart suffered a work-related injury on November 30, 1997. On July 2,1998, she filed a claim with the Commission against her employer and its insurer. She was represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">On September 30, 2002, Hart impleaded the SIF. Two months later, on December 3, 2002, she entered into an \u201cAgreement of Final Compromise and Settlement\u201d (\u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). The Settlement Agreement was filed with the Commission on December 10, 2002, and was approved by it (with one modification not here relevant) on January 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Notwithstanding the settlement, Hart attempted to proceed with her claim against the SIF. On July 15, 2004, the Commission held a hearing on the issue whether the settlement barred Hart from proceeding against the SIF. On July 21, 2004, the Commission issued an order ruling that \u201cthe claim against the [SIF] is barred by virtue of the Agreement of Final Compromise and Settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Unhappy with the Commission\u2019s decision, Hart filed an action for judicial review, in the Circuit Court for Kent County. The SIF participated as the respondent. It filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>motion for summary judgment asserting that the material facts were not in dispute and that it was entitled to judgment in its favor, as a matter of law. It attached the Settlement Agreement and related documents. Hart filed an opposition asserting that she was not informed in the Settlement Agreement or in any other way that the settlement would affect her right to proceed against the SIF, and therefore the \u25a0 court should deny the motion for summary judgment and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The court granted the SIF\u2019s summary judgment motion. Hart noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We shall include additional facts as necessary to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The parties to the Settlement Agreement are Hart, her employer, and her employer\u2019s insurer. The Settlement Agreement (which is a form document) states in recitals that Hart filed a claim with the Commission due to a work-related injury suffered on or about November 30, 1997; that the employer and insurer deny the allegations in the claim and have disputed several issues; but that, notwithstanding their disputes, they have reached an agreement \u201cfor a final compromise and settlement of any and all claims which the Claimant ... might now or could hereafter have under the provisions of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] against the Employer and/or the Insurer[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The Settlement Agreement then sets forth its terms. It states the amount the employer and insurer will pay to Hart, in addition to previous compensation already paid, and states by means of release language what Hart is giving up as her consideration for the settlement. The release language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">The Claimant hereby accepts the said agreement and the aforesaid payment(s) in final compromise and settlement of any and all Claims which the Claimant, his or her personal representative, dependents, wife and children or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>parties who might become beneficiaries under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act], might now or could hereafter have under the provisions of the said Law, arising out of the aforesaid injury or disablement or disability resulting therefrom, and does hereby, on behalf of himself or herself and all of said parties, release and forever discharge the Employer and Insurer, their personal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns, from all other claims of whatsoever kind which might or could arise under the said Law from the said injury, disablement or disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Commission prints a \u201cGuide Form\u201d (Form H-07) that is to be made part of a proposed final compromise and settlement agreement. The Guide Form lists a series of questions, to which the claimant or his or her attorney make a written response, and then sign. One of the questions is, \u201cIs there any potential S.I.F. liability in this case?\u201d That question was answered affirmatively on Hart\u2019s Guide Form, which she and her attorney both signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Finally, the Commission prints an \u201cAffidavit\u201d that it requires be made when there has been a request for \u201ctestimony waived\u201d at the hearing to approve the settlement. The Affidavit lists understandings the claimant has about his or her rights with respect to the settlement. Of relevance here, the Affidavit states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">.... If the Final Compromise Agreement is approved by the Commission, the claimant has no right of a hearing or any appeal ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">.... If the Final Compromise Agreement is approved the claimant cannot come back to the Commission and cannot return to the employer and insurer for any additional medical care or treatment, medical fees or expenses, or compensation for permanent disability or temporary total disability for this case will have been considered Finally Settled and Closed excepting the fact that employer and insurer will pay casually [sic] related medical expenses up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the date of the acceptance of the Final Compromise Agreement ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">The claimant fully understands the within Final Compromise and Settlement forever closes his/her case and understanding all of the aforementioned he request [sic] the Commission to Approve the Final Compromise and Settlement Agreement ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In this case, Hart signed the Affidavit before a notary public, but not under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In its summary judgment motion, the SIF argued that Hart\u2019s claim against it is barred by Md.Code (1991, 2002 Repl.Vol.), section 9-722 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d). That statute, which is entitled \u201cClaim settlement,\u201d states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Subject to approval by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, after a claim has been filed by a covered employee ..., the covered employee ... may enter into an agreement for the final compromise and settlement of any current or future claim under this title with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">(1) the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">(2) the insurer of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">(3) the Subsequent Injury Fund; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">(4) the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">(d) <em>Effect. </em>\u2014 (1) When approved by the Commission, a final compromise and settlement agreement is binding on all of the parties to the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">(2) <em>Unless the Commission orders otherwise, a final compromise and settlement agreement between a covered employee ... and the employer or its insurer precludes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>the right of the covered employee ... to proceed against the Subsequent Injury Fund on the claim.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The SIF argued that the material facts were not in dispute and that, under section 9-722(d)(2), Hart\u2019s claim against it was barred unless ordered otherwise by the Commission upon approval of the settlement. The Commission\u2019s approval did not preserve that claim. Therefore, as a matter of law, Hart could not pursue her claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Hart argued that she had informed the Commission in her Guide Form that she had a claim pending against the SIF; that she did not affirmatively or in any other way give up her rights against the SIF; and that it was incumbent upon the Commission itself to \u201ceither insure that the Claimant/Appellant\u2019s right to proceed further against the [SIF] was preserved or to affirmatively inform her that by signing the proposed Agreement she would finally and forever give up her rights against the [SIF].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">On appeal, Hart advances the same arguments she made below.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">We review an order granting a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Tyma v. Montgomery County, </em>369 Md. 497, 504, 801 A,2d 148 (2002); <em>Clarence W. Gosnell, Inc. v. Hensley, </em>156 Md.App. 224, 230, 846 A.2d 469 (2004). Summary judgment should only be granted when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2-501(e); <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>113 Md.App. 603, 610, 688 A.2d 527 (1997). If there is no genuine dispute of material fact, we determine whether the circuit court\u2019s ruling was proper as a matter of law. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Clarence W. Gosnell, supra, </em>156 Md.App. at 231, 846 A.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">At issue in this case is a question of law, specifically the construction of the above mentioned \u201cClaim settlement\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cThe Act\u201d). LE \u00a7 9-722. We construe the Act liberally, resolving all ambiguities in favor of the claimant. Md.Code (1991, 2002 Repl.Vol.); LE \u00a7 9-102 (strict construction not applicable); <em>Philip Elec. N.A. v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 216, 703 A.2d 150 (1997). However, we \u201cmay not create ambiguity or uncertainty in the Act\u2019s provisions where none exists so that a provision may be interpreted in favor of the injured claimant.\u201d <em>Ametek, Inc. v. O\u2019Connor, </em>364 Md. 143, 155, 771 A.2d 1072 (2001) (citation omitted). If the statutory language is \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end. <em>Philip Elec. N.A., supra, </em>348 Md. at 217, 703 A.2d 150. Whether the language of a statute is ambiguous is also a question of law. <em>Wyatt v. State, </em>169 Md.App. 394, 403, 901 A.2d 271 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Finally, the decisions of the Commission are presumed to be correct and will be reversed only upon a showing of an \u201cerroneous construction of the law or facts.\u201d <em>Martin v. Beverage Capital Corp., </em>353 Md. 388, 402, 726 A.2d 728 (1999). Thus, we give due deference to the Commission\u2019s own interpretation of the statute it administers. <em>Clarence W. Gosnell, supra, </em>156 Md.App. at 232, 846 A.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The \u201cClaim settlement\u201d provision of the Act, LE section 9-722, provides a means by which disputed claims can be resolved without further litigation. By requiring the Commission to approve any such settlement agreement, the Act aims to protect a claimant from entering into an \u201cillusory or woefully inadequate compromise.\u201d <em>B. Frank Joy Co. v. Isaac, </em>333 Md. 628, 643, 636 A.2d 1016 (1994) (quoting Richard P. Gilbert and Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook, </em>\u00a7 7.10, at 149-50).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The language of LE section 9-722(d)(2) is not ambiguous. It states expressly that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">[ujnless the Commission orders otherwise, a final compromise and settlement agreement ... precludes the right of the covered employee ... to proceed against the Subsequent Injury Fund on the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>LE \u00a7 9-722(d)(2). The language of the statute thus provides for an automatic waiver of a claim against the SIF upon the Commission\u2019s approval of a settlement agreement, absent an order to the contrary. There is no dispute in this case that the Commission\u2019s order of January 10, 2003, approving the settlement, did not provide any exemption from this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">There is no requirement under LE section 9-722 that the claimant be advised that she is giving up these potential claims. The implementing regulation under this provision merely provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">[T]he Commission may not approve an agreement for final compromise and settlement without a hearing unless the agreement is accompanied by the notarized affidavit of the claimant, on the form prescribed by the Commission, waiving the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Md.Code Regs. \u00a7 14.09.01.19(E). In this case, Hart waived a hearing and, as discussed above, attached a notarized Affidavit using the Commission\u2019s form acknowledging, among other things, that her case would \u201cforever closet ]\u201d as a result of the agreement. Hart argues in her brief that, because the Affidavit form used by the Commission did not explicitly state that she was waiving her claim against the SIF, she \u201cnever properly waived her rights to proceed against the [SIF].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, despite any imprecision in the Affidavit form she signed, Hart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is charged with knowledge <em>of </em>the underlying law. <em>See Allers v. Tittsworth, </em>269 Md. 677, 686, 309 A.2d 476 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Furthermore, Hart\u2019s argument that the Guide Form provided the Commission with notice that she intended to pursue a claim against the SIF is unavailing. The Guide Form merely reflected that \u201cpotential SIF liability\u201d existed; it was not a request by Hart for the Commission to preserve her claim against the SIF. The Guide Form appears to be intended to inform the Commission of the potential claims the claimant is waiving under the settlement agreement to assist the Commission in determining whether the agreement is fair. In this case, the Commission approved the agreement, with slight modification, despite Hart\u2019s affirmative answer to the question about potential SIF liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The plain language of the statute expressly precludes Hart\u2019s claim against the SIF in this case. The circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the SIF and affirming the Commission\u2019s decision was proper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">. The questions presented, as worded by Hart, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">1. Whether in light of the remedial and beneficial nature of the workers' compensation statute the claimant after having impled the fund should be forever barred from exercising her potential rights against the fund when the settlement with the employer alone fails to affirmatively inform the claimant that she would forever lose her rights against the fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">2. Whether in light of the preclusive effect of Labor and Employment Article &amp; 9-722(d)(2) the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission upon reviewing an Agreement of Final Compromise and Settlement wherein the fund has been impled by the claimant must require that the claimant affirmatively waive or reserve their rights to proceed against the fund on the record or by affidavit prior to approving such a settlement.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. In her hrief, Hart notes that in September of 2003, after she signed the \u201cFinal Compromise and Settlement Agreement,\u201d the Commission revised the Affidavit form it uses. The new form, titled \"Claimant\u2019s Affidavit in Support of Settlement\u201d (Form WCCH-05), includes the following language absent from the form signed by Hart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">I ask the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to approve the settlement of my claim and in support of this request state: ... 2. that in so doing I am giving up the following rights: ... c. the right, except as provided, if at all, in this settlement, to be compensated, under certain conditions, by the Subsequent Injury Fund for permanent impairments incurred before the accidental injury or occupational disease which gave rise to my claim[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Hart has included the new version of the form in the record extract, even though it is not in the records of the Commission or the circuit court. It is therefore unclear whether this new form was ever intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>duced into evidence prior to this appeal. In any event, it does not alter the outcome in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
