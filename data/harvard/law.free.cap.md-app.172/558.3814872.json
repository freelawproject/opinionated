At this point in the litigation, appellant presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">1. Did the circuit court err as a matter of law in finding that the law of the case doctrine did not preclude it from granting Garnett\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and to Correct Illegal Sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">2. Did the circuit court err as a matter of law in finding that the imposition of the criminal restitution obligation was illegal within the meaning of Rule 4-345(a)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cno\u201d to each question, and therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit court that a sentence of \u201crestitution\u201d cannot be imposed on a defendant who has been found \u201cnot criminally responsible by reason of insanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">As stated above, the parties have previously been before the Court of Appeals. In <em>State v. Garnett, </em>384 Md. 466, 863 A.2d 1007 (2004) <em>(Garnett I), </em>the Court of Appeals set forth the \u201c[procedural [hjistory\u201d of the case at bar, and it would serve no useful purpose to repeat that history at this point. Suffice it to say that in <em>Garnett I </em>the Court of Appeals came to the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">The order of restitution in favor of the Maryland State Police that was entered as part of criminal proceedings against [appellee] was a penal sanction to which she was subject, despite a finding of guilty but not criminally responsible. Because the restitution ordered in this case was a criminal sanction, it was not dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, the State\u2019s Motion to Allow Garnishment should have been granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 481, 863 A.2d 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Thereafter, (in the words of appellant\u2019s brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">[Appellee] ... filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and to Correct Illegal Sentence\u201d in the circuit court, seeking that the State\u2019s Motion to Allow Garnishment be dismissed and that the money judgment be vacated. [Appellee] claimed that the restitution order was illegal because she was found not criminally responsible and should not be held to account at all for the numerous crimes for which she was convicted. The State opposed the motion. On June 27, 2005, the circuit court granted [appellee\u2019s] motion and dismissed the Motion to Allow Garnishment and vacated the July 25, 2001 money judgment. In spite of the Court of Appeals prior holding that the State\u2019s motion should have been granted, the circuit court held that the imposition of the criminal restitution obligation on [appellee] was illegal as [appellee] alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">This appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Even though Md. Rule 4-345(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time,\u201d appellant argues that \u201cthe law of the case\u201d doctrine prohibited the circuit court from correcting a sentence that it found to be illegal under the circumstances. According to appellant (in the words of its brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">The lower court\u2019s holding simply misapplies the law of the case doctrine and actually misquotes what the doctrine actually provides. As stated <em>infra, </em>the law of the case doctrine bars relitigation between the same parties of issues that were <em>or could have been raised </em>in the prior litigation. As an issue that could have been raised in the prior litigation, the law of the case governs the legality of the judgments under Rule 4-345(a), and hence, the lower court went beyond its authority when it allowed [appellee] to challenge and hence, religitate whether the State was entitled to its wage garnishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">At some point, the litigation must end, and notwithstanding the lower court\u2019s holding, the litigation concerning whether the State was entitled to its wage garnishment actually did end with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision [in <em>Garnett </em>I]. [Appellee] is not entitled to a rematch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">In <em>Scott v. State, </em>379 Md. 170, 840 A.2d 715 (2004), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201conce an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be the law of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 840 A.2d 715 (footnote omitted). While we agree with appellant that there are occasions on which this doctrine precludes a party from asserting a claim that \u201ccould have been raised in prior litigation,\u201d we are persuaded that Md. Rule 4-345(a) permits a defendant to assert an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d argument that was not previously addressed by an appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Obviously, the law of the case doctrine would prevent relitigation of an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d argument that has been presented to and rejected by an appellate court. For example, on December 20,1999, the Court of Appeals considered\u2014 and rejected \u2014 claims of two \u201clifers\u201d who argued that they were serving sentences that had become <em>illegal </em>as a result of Governor Glendening\u2019s \u201cLife Means Life\u201d parole policy. <em>See State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 742 A.2d 508 (1999), and <em>Herrera v. State, </em>357 Md. 186, 742 A.2d 517 (1999). Maryland Rule 4-345(a) would not entitle either of those petitioners to relitigate the \u201cillegal sentence\u201d issue decided by the Court of Appeals. On the other hand, Md. Rule 4-345(a) would be meaningless if the law of the case doctrine were extended to sentences that could have been \u2014 but were not \u2014 challenged as illegal at the time an appellant filed his or her first appellate brief in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The <em>Garnett I </em>Court expressly stated that \u201c[t]he issue of the constitutionality of imposing a criminal sanction upon a person found guilty but not criminally responsible ... is not before us, as Garnett has not raised it.\u201d 384 Md. at 475 n. 10, 863 A.2d 1007. Judge Wilner\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Garnett I </em>concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Garnett has not challenged the validity of the statutory construct that permits a court to enter a criminal penalty against someone who has been found not criminally responsible. That authorization is certainly inconsistent with the conclusion we reached in <em>Pouncey v. State, </em>297 Md. 264, 269, 465 A.2d 475, 478 (1983), however, that a finding of not criminally responsible relieves the defendant of liability for punishment under the criminal law and that \u201c[n]o criminal sentence may even be entered on the guilty verdict____\u201d Indeed, imposition of a criminal penalty upon a person found not criminally responsible would raise serious Constitutional issues. Because those issues have not been raised in this case, the court has not considered them. They most certainly do lurk, however.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 482, 863 A.2d 1007. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine did not prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the circuit court from considering the merits of appellee\u2019s \u201cillegal sentence\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The circuit court filed an OPINION AND ORDER that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">This case comes before this Court on remand from the Court of Appeals and the Defendant\u2019s Motions to Dismiss the Plaintiffs Motion to Allow Garnishment of Wages and Correct an Illegal Sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>The Imposition of a Criminal Penalty Against a Not Criminally Responsible Defendant and the Constitutionality of Sections 11-601 and 11-603 of the Criminal Procedure Article</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">The Legislature has provided that \u201c[a] court may enter a judgment of restitution that orders a defendant ... to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime ... if: (1) as a direct result of the crime ... property of the victim was damaged.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7 11-603 (2001, 2004 Cum.Supp.). Section 11-601 defines a \u201cdefendant\u201d for the purposes of restitution as a person \u201cwho has been found guilty of a crime, even if the defendant has been found not criminally responsible[.]\u201d Ms. Garnett therefore qualifies as a \u201cdefendant\u201d for the purposes of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">Maryland precedent has firmly established that \u201ca defendant may be found both guilty and not criminally responsible for a crime so that the defendant does not stand convicted of a crime, and \u2018no criminal sentence may ever be entered on the guilty verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Garnett, </em>384 Md. 466, 474[, 863 A.2d 1007] (2004) (quoting <em>Pouncey v. State, </em>297 Md. 264, 268-69[, 465 A.2d 475] (1983) (explaining <em>Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 598[, 399 A.2d 578] (1979))). A finding of not criminally responsible \u201crelieves her of liability for punishment under the criminal law,\u201d <em>Pouncey v. State, </em>297 Md. at 269[, 465 A.2d 475] (mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>found guilty of drowning her child); <em>see also Garnett, </em>382[384] Md. at 482[, 863 A.2d 1007]. \u201c[T]he clear legislative intent regarding the successful interposition of a plea of insanity is not that an accused is to be found not guilty of the criminal act it was proved he committed, but that he shall not be punished therefore.\u201d <em>Ford v. Ford, </em>307 Md. 105, 114[, 512 A.2d 389] (1986) (citing <em>Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 598[, 399 A.2d 578] (1979)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">The federal courts have consistently held that defendants found not criminally responsible or insane, cannot be punished either criminally or civilly for their conduct. The notion that we as a society do not punish a person found to be not criminally responsible is \u201cso well-settled that no one questions it----Only the guilty are to be punished.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Overholser, </em>281 F.2d 943, 947 (D.C.Cir.1960) <em>(rev\u2019d Lynch v. Overholser, </em>369 U.S. 705[, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211] (1962) (quoting <em>Blunt v. United States, </em>244 F.2d 355, 367 (D.C.Cir.1957))). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has stated, \u201cTo punish a man who lacks the power to reason is as undignified and unworthy as punishing an inanimate object or an animal. A man who cannot reason cannot be subject to blame. Our collective conscience does not allow punishment where it cannot impose blame.\u201d <em>Holloway v. United States, </em>148 F.2d 665, 666-67 (D.C.Cir.1945).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cCourts [have] recognized that no valid purpose would be furthered by holding the insanity-aequitee accountable for his acts. The insanity defense is a recognition that none of the theories which underlie our criminal law \u2014 prevention, restraint, rehabilitation, deterrence, education, and retribution \u2014 are furthered by punishing the insane.\u201d W. LaFave, A Scott, <em>Handbook on Criminal Law, </em>s 36 pp. 271-272; A. Goldstein, <em>The Insanity Defense, </em>pp. 11-15 (1967). The <em>Garnett </em>Court also expressed its similar view that the purposes of restitution are retributive, deterrent, and rehabilitative, goals which are achieved by forcing the defendant to focus on the harm caused and subjecting her to a monetary detriment which satisfied \u201c \u2018society\u2019s demand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>meaningful justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garnett, </em>384 Md. at 475[, 863 A.2d 1007] quoting <em>Grey v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>363 Md. 445, 459-60[, 769 A.2d 891] (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">The Court is at a loss to determine how the imposition of a penal sanction upon a defendant whose mental state will not permit a finding of criminal responsibility will satisfy any penal goals. Section 12-108(a) of the Health General Article provides that, \u201c[a] defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation, lacks substantial capacity: (1) to appreciate the criminality of that conduct; (2) to conform that conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Health-Gen. I \u00a7 12-108(a) (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">Is retribution proper against those who cannot conform their activities to the strictures of the law or appreciate the criminality of their conduct? How could any person similarly situated and mentally unable to appreciate the criminality of their conduct or conform their conduct to the mandates of the law possibly be deterred by the imposition of such a sanction? There is no deterrence of other mentally ill individuals by punishing another mentally ill individual. <em>Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 668[, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758] (1962) (Douglas, J., concurring) (quoting Dr. Isaac Ray, <em>Treatise on the Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity </em>56 (5th ed.1971)). How can society demand meaningful justice against a person found to be not criminally responsible when society has determined that the criminal punishment of the insane is so entirely unacceptable that it does not even bear reasonable discussion by the federal appellate courts? The punishment of the mentally ill simply cannot serve ... any useful example to the public at large. <em>Robinson, </em>370 U.S. at 676[, 82 S.Ct. 1417] (quoting 6 <em>Coke\u2019s Third Inst. </em>6 (4th Ed. 1797)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">The Defendant therefore reasonably questions, to the extent that the legislature has authorized the Court to impose restitution, a penal sanction, upon persons deemed not criminally responsible, whether that statute is constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tional. Md.Code Ann., Crim. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 11-601, 603 (2001, 2004 Cum.Supp.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">The Court of Appeals unequivocally held the restitution ordered as a \u201ccriminal sanction, not a civil remedy,\u201d <em>State v. Garnett, </em>384 Md. at 475[, 863 A.2d 1007] (quoting <em>Grey v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>363 Md. 445, 451[, 769 A.2d 891] (2001)). The Defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility for the acts in question was adjudicated, and the imposition of a criminal sanction would be equivalent to punishing the Defendant for a crime of which she had been acquitted. <em>See Gordon v. State, </em>707 S.W.2d 626, 629-30 (Tex.Crim.App.1986). This is a clear violation of the principles encompassed by the constitutional guarantees of the due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">Levying a criminal sanction against a Defendant who has been determined to be not criminally responsible would also run afoul of the constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. \u201c[T]he principle that would deny power to exact capital punishment for a petty crime would also deny power to punish a person by fine or imprisonment for being sick ... [w]e would forget the teachings of the Eighth Amendment if we allowed sickness to be made a crime and permitted sick people to be punished for being sick.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>370 U.S. at 676, 678[, 82 S.Ct. 1417]. This the Court simply cannot permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">Therefore, as Judge Wilner foresaw, this Court holds that the imposition of restitution as a criminal sanction on the Defendant, and the portions of the statute authorizing such an imposition, constitute denials of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and violations of the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment mandated by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">It is therefore ORDERED this <em>27 </em>day of June, 2005, by the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, that the Plaintiffs Motion to Allow Garnishment of Wages be and hereby is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>DISMISSED and the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence be and hereby is GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">According to appellant, the holding in <em>Pouncey </em>is no longer controlling because of the legislative changes to the restitution laws that resulted from the passage of the Victims\u2019 Rights Act of 1997 (Chapters 311 and 312 of the 1997 LAWS OF MARYLAND), in which the definition of \u201cdefendant\u201d was expanded to include any person who has been found guilty of a crime, regardless of whether the defendant has been found not criminally responsible. The legislative history shows that when the act was introduced (as Senate Bill 173, and House Bill 768), \u00a7 805A of Article 27 would be amended to include the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">(F) \u201cDEFENDANT\u201d MEANS ANY PERSON WHO HAS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">(1) RECEIVED PROBATION BEFORE JUDGMENT;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">(2) BEEN FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED A DELINQUENT ACT;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">(3) BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF A CRIME, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN FOUND NOT CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE BY REASON OF INSANITY; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">(4) ANY PERSON WHOSE PLEA OF NOLO CONTEN-DERE TO A CRIME HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">In the bills that ultimately passed, however, the words \u201cby reason of insanity\u201d were deleted from \u00a7 805A(f)(3). The following definition appears in Chapters 311 and 312 of the 1997 LAWS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-14\">\u201cDEFENDANT\u201d MEANS ANY PERSON WHO HAS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-15\">(1) RECEIVED PROBATION BEFORE JUDGMENT;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-16\">(2) BEEN FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED A DELINQUENT ACT;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-17\">(3) BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF A CRIME, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DEFENDANT HAS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>BEEN FOUND NOT CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE B-WREASONOF4NSANITY; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">(4) ANY PERSON WHOSE PLEA OF NOLO CONTEN-DERE TO A CRIME HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The Victims\u2019 Rights Act of 1997 contains an extensive \u201cpurpose\u201d clause that does not include a statement of intent to overrule the holding in <em>Pouncey, </em>and nothing in the bill files indicates that the General Assembly intended to take such action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, in which there is an affirmative finding that appellee was not criminally responsible by reason of insanity, we shall (1) follow the holding in <em>Pouncey, </em>under which no sentence of restitution should have been imposed on appellee, and (2) conclude that the illegal sentence of restitution was appropriately corrected pursuant to Md. Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">. We recognize \"that not all legislative history has equal value in the court's exercise of assigning probabilities to various statutory readings.\u201d Jack Schwartz and Amanda Conn, <em>The Court of Appeals at the Cocktail Party: The Use and Misuse of Legislative History, </em>54 Md. L.Rev. 432, 437 (1995). We note, however, that the first statute in which the definition of \"defendant\u201d included \"a person found not criminally responsible for criminal conduct under ... the Health-General Article\u201d was Maryland's \"Son of Sam\u201d statute, enacted in 1987 \"to prevent criminals from profiting from their own crimes through 'notoriety of crimes contracts!)]\u2019 \" <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 154, 638 A.2d 93 (1994). That statute is now codified at Md.Code, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 11-621 through 11-633. There is obviously a distinction between (1) a statute that prohibits a person found \"guilty\u201d but \"not criminally responsible\u201d from realizing a profit from his or her crime, and (2) a statute that imposes a restitution obligation on a person found \"guilty\u201d but \"not criminally responsible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
