In particular, we must decide if a lawsuit by the buyers alleging that the sellers made false or negligent representations in the Maryland Residential Property Disclosure Statement is a dispute arising out of the real estate contract, notwithstanding that the disclosure statement was not made part of the contract. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Mason, J.) concluded that the suit was such a dispute and, pursuant to the contract, awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the sellers as the prevailing parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with the circuit court\u2019s legal conclusion and therefore affirm the fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In December 2000, George Stratakos and Jami Rankin, appellants, purchased from Steven J. Parcells and Harriet Parcells, appellees, a parcel of improved residential property located in Montgomery County, Maryland (\u201cthe property\u201d). The parties entered into a written contract for the sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">In connection with the sale, and in accordance with Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 10-702 of the Real Property Article, appellees provided appellants with a Maryland Residential Property Disclosure Statement (hereafter \u201cdisclosure statement\u201d). The Montgomery County Notice and Disclosure Addendum to the contract of sale referred to the disclosure statement, advising the buyer of the right to receive a disclosure (or disclaimer) statement from the seller unless exempt. The disclosure statement itself, however, was not made part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Appellees stated in the disclosure statement that they were not aware of any defects in the interior or exterior structural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>systems of the property. Appellees further stated that they were not aware of any previous infestations of wood-destroying insects or any repairs made to the property because of a previous wood-destroying insect infestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In August 2003, appellants began renovations on the property. During the renovations, they discovered extensive damage in a covered crawl space, which they alleged was caused by wood-destroying insects.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On December 15, 2004, appellants filed a complaint against appellees alleging fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of warranty. Appellants argued that the factual representations appellees made in the disclosure statement were false, and that appellees made the statements knowing they were false or with reckless indifference to the truth. Appellants alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that they \u201cwould not have purchased the Property had the misrepresentations not been made,\u201d and that \u201cthe House was worth considerably less than [appellants] paid for it in the belief that the House was as it was represented to be in the Disclosure Statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of the complaint, appellants sought $30,000.00 in compensatory damages, $150,000.00 in punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Paragraph 23 of the real estate contract. Paragraph 23 entitles the prevailing party, in any action or proceeding involving a dispute between the parties \u201carising out of\u2019 the real estate contract, to recover costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">On August 29, 2005, appellants filed an amended complaint setting forth essentially the same allegations as those made in the original complaint. Appellants again sought monetary relief, including attorney\u2019s fees \u201cper the contract between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Although appellees were married when they sold the property to appellants, they were separated when suit was filed. Consequently, they separately defended the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>On September 21, 2005, appellee Steven Parcells filed a motion for summary judgment, denying the allegations set forth in the amended complaint. Six weeks later, the motion came on for a hearing. The court granted the motion, reasoning that appellants failed to show that they had incurred actual injury from the alleged misrepresentations, such as increased renovation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The following day, Steven Parcells filed a motion for award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. In the motion, he argued that the real estate contract between the parties provides that, in the event of a dispute, the prevailing party is entitled to receive from the other party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Thereafter, appellants filed a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The court held a hearing on appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration and Mr. Parcells\u2019s motion for award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The court denied the motion for reconsideration, and awarded Mr. Parcells costs and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $14,105.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">On January 13, 2006, appellee Harriet Parcells filed a motion for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the court granted the motion. Ms. Parcells also filed a motion requesting $16,975.00 in .costs and attorney\u2019s fees, which the court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Both awards of attorney\u2019s fees were reduced to judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Appellants\u2019 sole contention on appeal is that the circuit court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to appellees pursuant to Paragraph 23 of the real estate contract. Paragraph 23 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">In any action or proceeding involving a dispute between the Purchaser and the Seller arising out of this Contract, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive from the other party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to be determined by the court or arbitrator(s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Appellants argue that the parties\u2019 dispute relating to the representations made in the disclosure statement does not arise out of the contract; consequently, Paragraph 23 was not triggered and the court committed legal error by awarding attorney\u2019s fees to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Appellees respond that the allegations set forth in appellants\u2019 complaint arose out of the real estate contract; therefore, Paragraph 23 entitles them to recover attorney\u2019s fees. They argue that appellants could bring a suit for misrepresentation and breach of warranty only because the parties had entered into a contract for the sale of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Appellee Harriet Parcells also points out that RP \u00a7 10-702 sets forth the requirements of a disclosure statement in a residential real estate transaction. She argues that, \u201c[b]y virtue of the statute, the disclosure duties it creates are inextricably intertwined with the sales contract.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Appellee Steven Parcells makes the additional argument that the dispute \u201cnot only arose out of the contract, but was based, in part, on a specific provision of the contract.\u201d He refers to appellants\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause of the complaint pursuant to Paragraph 23.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cOrdinarily, in the absence of a statute, rule, or contract expressly allowing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, a prevailing party in a lawsuit may not recover attorney\u2019s fees. This is true whether the action seeking fees sounds in contract or tort.\u201d <em>Chang v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>168 Md.App. 534, 551-52, 897 A.2d 854 (2006) (citation omitted). The parties do not dispute that Paragraph 23 is a valid provision for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in litigation concerning a dispute arising out of the contract. Indeed, such provisions \u201cgenerally are valid and enforceable in Maryland.\u201d <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 198, 892 A.2d 520 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The parties\u2019 debate focuses more narrowly on how Paragraph 23 should be read. As we have said, they disagree about what is meant by a dispute \u201carising out of\u2019 the contract. Resolution of the issue requires us to decide the proper construction of that phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We adhere in Maryland \u201cto the objective theory of contract interpretation, giving effect to the clear terms of agreements, regardless of the intent of the parties at the time of contract formation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 892 A.2d 520. \u201cContract interpretation, including the determination of the ambiguity of a contract, is a question of law and subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 79, 899 A.2d 819 (2006). \u201c[I]n the construction of contracts, words are to be given their ordinary meaning[.]\u201d <em>Auction and Estate Representatives, Inc. v. Ashton, </em>354 Md. 333, 343, 731 A.2d 441 (1999). If the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction. <em>United Services, </em>393 Md. at 80, 899 A.2d 819. In that instance, the \u201ccourt must presume that the parties meant what they expressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">No reported opinion of the Court of Appeals or this Court addresses what is meant in a contract provision for attorney\u2019s fees by \u201ca dispute ... arising out of\u2019 the contract. But both appellate courts have construed other contract clauses containing \u201carising out of\u2019 language. One example is <em>CSX </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>Transp., Inc. v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>111 Md.App. 634, 683 A.2d 1127 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>349 Md. 299, 708 A.2d 298 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>CSX Transportation </em>involved construction of such language in the indemnification provision of a state procurement contract. The contract required the Mass Transit Administration (\u201cMTA\u201d) to indemnify CSX Transportation, which operates the Maryland Rail Commuter Service (\u201cMARC\u201d), for \u201cany and all claims arising out of \u2018Contract Service.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 683 A.2d 1127. CSX Transportation submitted a claim to MTA for indemnification of property damage losses resulting from a collision between a MARC train and a backhoe owned by a third party. <em>Id. </em>CSX Transportation believed that the claim was subject to indemnification because it was one \u201carising out of \u2018Contract Service.\u2019 \u201d The MTA and the Board of Contract Appeals disagreed and denied the claim. The Circuit Court for Howard County affirmed on judicial review of CSX Transportation\u2019s petition. <em>Id. </em>at 636-37, 683 A.2d 1127. CSX Transportation appealed to this Court. We reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In construing the phrase \u201carising out of \u2018Contract Service,\u2019 \u201d we applied the definition of the term \u201carising out of\u2019 that the Court of Appeals had used in <em>Northern Assurance Co. v. EDP Floors, </em>311 Md. 217, 230, 533 A.2d 682 (1987). <em>See CSX Transp., </em>111 Md.App. at 640-41, 683 A.2d 1127. In <em>EDP Floors, </em>a ease involving the duty of an insurance company to defend an insured employer from a tort suit based on an employee\u2019s negligence, the Court concluded that the \u201cwords \u2018arising out of must be afforded their common understanding, namely, to mean originating from, growing out of, flowing from, or the like.\u201d 311 Md. at 220-21, 230, 533 A.2d 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We also noted in <em>CSX Transportation </em>that, although the words \u201carising out of\u2019 require a showing of a causal relationship, \u201crecovery is not limited to ... direct and proximate cause.\u201d 111 Md.App. at 641, 683 A.2d 1127 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Relying on the <em>EDP Floors </em>Court\u2019s definition of \u201carising out of\u2019 and the construction given the term in other contract cases within and outside of Maryland, we held in <em>CSX Transportation </em>that, for the indemnification provision to apply, it was enough that the MARC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>train was a cause of the injury notwithstanding that \u201cthe injury may also have arisen out of other causes further back in the sequence of events[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643-44, 683 A.2d 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><em>CSX Transportation </em>and <em>EDP Floors </em>are cases involving construction of liability insurance contract provisions, whereas the case before us involves a contract provision of a very different sort. Those cases nevertheless are helpful to the present case in that, in both of those cases, construction of the \u201carising out of\u2019 language was based on the common understanding of the phrase. As we construe that phrase in the present case, we shall afford it the same common understanding, that is, \u201cto mean originating from, growing out of, flowing from, or the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Also helpful to our analysis is <em>Marcus v. Fox, </em>150 Ariz. 333, 723 P.2d 682 (1986), a case upon which Steven Parcells relies in support of his position that the dispute between the parties arises out of the real estate contract. In <em>Marcus, </em>the jury found that the plaintiffs were fraudulently induced to enter into a contract to purchase real property. <em>Id. </em>at 683. An Arizona statute provides for attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in any contested action \u201carising out of a eontract[.]\u201d Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 12-341.01(A). The trial court ruled the statute inapplicable and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees as the prevailing party to the suit. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>The Arizona Supreme Court reversed, holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because the cause of action arose out of the real estate contract. <em>Id. </em>at 684-85. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">It was that contract [for the sale of real estate] which prompted this suit and also served as the basis for [the appellants\u2019] claim. Stated otherwise, [the appellants\u2019] cause of action for tort could not have existed but for the fraudulently induced contract. Accordingly, we find the [appellants\u2019] action to invalidate the contract was one \u201carising out of a contract\u201d....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Appellants respond that appellee Steven Parcells misreads <em>Marcus </em>and that, properly read, the case \u201cstrongly supports\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>appellants\u2019 position. They point out the limits of the <em>Marcus </em>court\u2019s holding, as reflected by the following language of the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">While we hold that attorney\u2019s fees are not appropriate based on the mere existence of a contract somewhere in the transaction, we agree with Marcus that the requisite causal link between his claim and the underlying contract is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">As we said in <em>[Sparks v. Republic Nat\u2019l. Life Ins. Co., </em>132 Ariz. 529, 647 P.2d 1127 (1982)], the language of \u00a7 12-341.01(A) clearly states that attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable only in cases \u201carising out of a contract.\u201d We believe this language is not limited to only those cases in which a contract is entered into and subsequently breached <em>[Sparks]. </em>It may also include those cases in which a contract is entered into and later found void due to a claim of fraudulent inducement. For example, in the present case, Marcus was attempting to invalidate the contract with Fox. It was that contract which prompted this suit and also served as the basis for his claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">723 P.2d at 684-85 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Appellants argue that <em>Marcus </em>likely would have been decided differently had the suit not been based on an attempt to invalidate the contract. Appellants point out that their suit alleged three causes of action, none of which alleged a breach of the contract of sale or sought rescission or invalidation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">We concur in appellants\u2019 interpretation of <em>Marcus. </em>Indeed, a subsequent decision of the Arizona Supreme Court reinforces appellants\u2019 reading of that case. <em>See Morris v. Achen Construction Co., Inc., </em>155 Ariz. 512, 747 P.2d 1211, 1213 (1987) (restating the holding of <em>Marcus </em>as \u201cwhere the validity of the contract was challenged on grounds of fraudulent inducement, the claim was one \u2018arising out of the contract\u2019 within the meaning of [Ariz.Rev.Stat.] \u00a7 12-341. 01(A)).\u201d We do not agree, however, that Marcus \u201cstrongly supports\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>appellants\u2019 position and dictates reversal of the fee award in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><em>Marcus </em>is only persuasive authority to which we are not bound. Moreover, the case addresses the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s construction of a statute, not a contract term. We take from the decision only what we find helpful to the analysis of the issue before us. What is helpful to that analysis is the notion expressed in <em>Marcus </em>that a cause of action in tort can be said to arise out of the contract if it could not exist but for the contract. That notion is consistent with the definition of \u201carising out of\u2019 employed by the Court of Appeals in <em>EDP Floors </em>and this Court in <em>CSX Transportation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Appellants ask us to consider two additional cases, <em>Peer v. First Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n of Cumberland, 273 </em>Md. 610, 616-17, 331 A.2d 299 (1975), and <em>Myers, supra. </em>Appellants contend that both cases support their position that the attorney\u2019s fees provision of the real estate contract does not apply to the instant dispute. Neither case advances appellants\u2019 cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In <em>Peer, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether a real estate loan disclosure statement, in which the appellee offered credit life and disability insurance to the appellant, constituted a contract to provide credit life insurance. 273 Md. at 611-12, 331 A.2d 299. The Court found that the disclosure statement did not constitute a contractual relationship, noting that \u201c \u2018the disclosure statement\u2019s function is to exchange information and to give both parties notice prior to the contractual relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ship[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 331 A.2d 299 (quoting <em>Burgess v. Charlottesville Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>349 F.Supp. 133 (1972), <em>remanded by </em>477 F.2d 40 (4th Cir.1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Appellants argue that, pursuant to the Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Peer, </em>the disclosure statement that appellees provided is not a contract. We agree with appellants that the disclosure statement is not a contract. But we are not asked to determine whether the disclosure statement is a contract; rather, we must determine whether a dispute related to misrepresentations made in the disclosure statement arises out of the real estate contract. <em>Peer </em>does not assist us. .</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Appellants also direct us to <em>Myers, supra. </em>In that case, the parties entered into a contract for the sale of real property that contained a provision requiring an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in any dispute that arose out of the contract. 391 Md. at 194, 892 A.2d 520. The parties subsequently executed an addendum to the contract that did not provide for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 208, 892 A.2d 520. For reasons not relevant here, the addendum gave rise to a new contract that incorporated the terms of the original contract. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 208, 892 A.2d 520. The Court thus held that the provision relating to attorney\u2019s fees set forth in the original contract applied to a dispute that arose out of the addendum. <em>Id. </em>at 208, 892 A.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Like <em>Peer, Myers </em>does not assist us in resolving the present case. The disagreement between the parties in <em>Myers </em>centered on whether the prevailing party to a dispute arising out of the addendum was entitled to invoke the fee provision contained in the original real estate contract. It was undisputed that, upon the parties\u2019 execution of the addendum, all other terms and conditions set forth in the contract remained in full force. By contrast, in the present case, the parties do not quarrel about the existence of the fee provision in the real estate contract. They disagree about the proper construction of that provision, in particular, whether their dispute arises out of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>At the February 23, 2006 hearing in the present case, the court heard argument from counsel for appellants and counsel for Steven Parcells regarding the application of Paragraph 23 to the instant dispute. The court stated preliminarily: \u201c \u2018[A]rising out of the contract\u2019 ... is interpreted as broad to the extent the claim ... is predicated upon misrepresentation.\u201d The court added: \u201cThat can only occur in the presence of a duty. The duty arises out of the contract.\u201d The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">[T]he claim could not exist apart from the contract. The proof of the contract is necessary to [prove] the claim, because had there been no contract, you would have no claim. So it arises out of the contract as far as the Court\u2019s concerned, because I believe that that phrase is interpreted more broadly than simply a contract action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Upon our independent review of Paragraph 23, we conclude that the court correctly construed it. The dispute between the parties relating to the alleged misrepresentations in the disclosure statement mandated by RP \u00a7 10-702 \u201cflowed from\u201d or \u201cgrew out of\u2019 the contract. Absent the contract for the sale of real property, appellants\u2019 claims of misrepresentation and breach of warranty simply could not have existed. The provisions of RP \u00a7 10-702, moreover, reflect the extent to which the disclosure statement is intertwined with the real estate contract itself. We have noted the required disclosures by the seller and notices to the buyer. <em>See supra </em>note 1. RP \u00a7 10-702(e) also requires the seller to deliver the disclosure statement to the buyer \u201con or before entering into a contract of sale\u201d by the buyer and seller, and, upon delivery, the buyer must \u201cdate and sign a written acknowledgment of receipt, which shall be included in or attached to the contract of sale.\u201d And RP \u00a7 10-702(g) grants the unconditional right of rescission of the contract of sale to a buyer who does not receive the disclosure statement on or before entering into the contract, so long as the buyer provides timely written notice to the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">We hold that the parties\u2019 dispute, though focused on alleged misrepresentations in the disclosure statement, was nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>less a dispute \u201carising out of\u2019 the real estate contract. The court therefore did not err in determining that appellees were entitled, as prevailing parties to the suit, to attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Our disposition of the case does not require us to reach Mr. Parcells\u2019s additional argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. Appellants brought <em>Morris </em>and a second case, <em>Miller v. Schaefer, </em>80 Md.App. 60, 559 A.2d 813 (1989), to our attention for the first time in oral argument. <em>Morris </em>is instructive for the reason we mention, but is factually distinguishable. The Arizona Supreme Court held in <em>Morris </em>that attorney\u2019s fees should not have been awarded under the Arizona attorney\u2019s fees statute because the dispute was \"wholly an action for damages for fraud where the alleged fraud is claimed to have resulted in one party entering into a contract with a third party.\u201d 747 P.2d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\"><em>Miller </em>is also factually distinguishable from the present case and does not assist us otherwise in deciding this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
