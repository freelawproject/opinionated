Did the trial court err in declining to ask the jury on <em>voir dire </em>whether the nature of the case \u2014 murder with a handgun \u2014 would make it impossible or difficult to render a fair and impartial verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in failing to allow cross-examination of Devon Harrison concerning whether Harrison thought he might be offered a deal on his pending charges if he picked appellant out of a photo array?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">III. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in permitting the State to make unfairly prejudicial comments in rebuttal argument?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We answer appellant\u2019s first question in the affirmative and reverse and remand appellant\u2019s case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a new trial. In light of our decision, we need not address appellant\u2019s remaining questions, nor is it necessary to set forth the evidence presented at trial that supported appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">I. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"AC3\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">At the conclusion of <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court inquired if counsel had any requests for additional <em>voir dire. </em>Defense counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">Yes, Your Honor. I would request that the court ask the question that I propounded in my voir dire, Question Number 5, which asks if the nature of this case, specifically because it involves murder with a handgun, would make it impossible or difficult to render a fair and impartial verdict.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The court declined to ask the additional question, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Well, we\u2019ve asked the jury \u2014 we\u2019ve advised the jury of the nature of the charges. We\u2019ve also advised the jury to ask\u2014 to tell us if there\u2019s \u2014 they\u2019ve been the victim of a weapon\u2019s charge \u2014 or victim of a weapon\u2019s crime or had someone in the family who was accused of a weapon\u2019s crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">We\u2019ve also asked them if they had any reason whatsoever ... that would affect their ability to render a fair and impartial decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">I think when you take all those questions into \u2014 in totality, they have been presented with circumstances that are covered by this question without being asked this question in this form. So we will decline to answer \u2014 ask this question or represent this further question to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Defense counsel excepted to the court\u2019s failure to ask the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">On appeal, appellant asserts that the proposed question was nearly identical in purpose and form to the question at issue in <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002). In <em>Thomas, </em>this Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court should have been asked the proposed question. He also refers us to <em>Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265 (2002), in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The State counters that the rationale of <em>Thomas, </em>which involved a violation of the narcotics laws, and <em>Sweet, </em>which involved assault and sexual abuse charges, should not be extended to encompass all other charges. The State further asserts that the trial court correctly concluded that the questions already propounded would have uncovered any bias the prospective jurors possessed concerning murder with a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">In <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 34-35, 633 A.2d 867 (1993), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The common law of this State vests trial judges with discretion to regulate <em>voir dire. </em>... [T]he scope of <em>voir dire, </em>and the form of the questions propounded rests firmly within the discretion of the trial judge. The trial judge\u2019s discretion regarding the scope of a proposed avenue of <em>voir dire </em>is governed by one primary principle: the purpose of \u201cthe inquiry is to ascertain \u2018the existence of cause for disqualification and for no other purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. State, </em>219 Md. 53, 58, 146 A.2d 194 (1959) (quoting <em>Adams v. State, </em>200 Md. 133, 140, 88 A.2d 556 (1952) (citations omitted))---\u201cQuestions not directed to a specific ground for disqualification but which are speculative, inquisitorial, catechising or \u2018fishing,\u2019 asked in the aid of deciding on peremptory challenges, may be refused in the discretion of the court, even though it would not have been error to have asked them.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>219 Md. at 58-59, 146 A.2d 194.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">(Some citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201c[t]here are two areas of inquiry that may uncover cause for disqualification: (1) an examination to determine whether prospective jurors meet the minimum statutory qualifications for jury service, and (2) \u2018an examination of a juror ... conducted strictly within the right to discover the state of mind of the juror in respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter <em>reasonably liable </em>to unduly influence him.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\"><em>Baker v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 611, 853 A.2d 796 (2004) (quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 35-36, 633 A.2d 867 (citations omitted) (emphasis added in Davis)).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 188, 775 A.2d 406 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>369 Md. 202, 798 A.2d 566 (2002), the defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine and possession of cocaine. We held that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to ask the prospective jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">Does any member of the jury panel have such strong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts at a trial where narcotics violations have been alleged?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A14\"><em>Id. </em>at 195, 775 A.2d 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">We concluded that the question \u201caims directly at biases related to the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal act, which when uncovered, will disqualify a juror if the bias is so strong as to impair the juror\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 775 A.2d 406. We further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">Plainly stated, observing that most citizens have a bias against proscribed criminal acts is not extraordinary. Yet, a bias that is so strong against a particular criminal act that it distorts a juror\u2019s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict must be uncovered. [The proposed question] was reasonably likely to identify jurors with strong feelings toward narcotics laws that could hinder their ability objectively to resolve the matter presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">Such a bias may exist for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, a juror\u2019s own struggle with substance abuse or a juror\u2019s friend or family member whose life had been negatively altered by the influence of drugs in our society. Furthermore, it is important to note that such bias does not readily present itself to the court without the aid of properly phrased voir dire questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 775 A.2d 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In affirming our decision, the Court of Appeals wrote in <em>Thomas, </em>\u201cA question aimed at uncovering a venire person\u2019s bias because of the nature of the crime with which the defendant is charged is directly relevant to, and focuses on, an issue particular to the defendant\u2019s case and, so, should be uncovered.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 214, 798 A.2d 566 (2002) (citation omitted); <em>see also Thomas, </em>139 Md.App. at 207-08, 775 A.2d 406 (the question presented by the defendant was \u201creasonably likely to uncover a bias <em>\u2018directly related to the crime </em>\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 10, 759 A.2d 819 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">In <em>Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 806 A.2d 265 (2002), the defendant was convicted of second-degree assault and third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>degree sexual offense against a minor. The defendant requested that the trial court ask the jury panel: \u201cDo the charges stir up strong emotional feelings in you that would affect your ability to be fair and impartial in this case?\u201d The trial court declined to ask the question. Relying on <em>Thomas, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to pose the question because it was directed at biases specifically related to the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal acts that, if uncovered, would be disqualifying because such a bias would impair the ability of the prospective juror to be fair and impartial. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 806 A.2d 265. <em>But see Uzzle v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 548, 561-62, 832 A.2d 869 (2003) (in a murder trial, defendant\u2019s requested <em>voir dire </em>inquiry into whether jurors had strong feelings about guns or gun owners was \u201ca far-ranging, almost open-ended exploration of juror attitudes, experiences, and philosophies that might have been of immeasurable value in guiding the appellant\u2019s use of his peremptory challenges\u201d and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow this \u201cvery peripheral probing of attitudes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In <em>Newman v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 20, 845 A.2d 71 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>384 Md. 285, 863 A.2d 321 (2004), the defendant was alleged to have conspired with a friend to kill her husband because she believed that he was sexually molesting their two sons. Newman was convicted of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">At trial, Newman wanted the court to ask the following voir dire questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">Has any member of the jury been accused or charged with child abuse, physical abuse, or domestic violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">Is any member of the jury a member of groups advocating fathers\u2019 rights in divorce and custody hearings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The trial court declined to ask the aforementioned questions, and on appeal, Newman alleged that this constituted reversible error. We disagreed and held that the \u201cquestions asked by the trial court were sufficient to identify potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>bias related to child abuse or custody as they relate to [Newman\u2019s] prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 845 A.2d 71 (footnote omitted). We further wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">At the beginning of the voir dire process, the trial court informed the venire of the basic facts of the case, including the fact that the State relied on appellant\u2019s failed attempts to gain custody of her children as the motive for the conspiracy. The court then asked a series of questions designed to draw out possible bias of the venire, including: Does any member of the prospective jury panel feel such sympathy for persons in the defendant\u2019s circumstances that you would be biased in the defendant\u2019s favor? Likewise, does anyone harbor feelings that would bias you in favor of the prosecution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 53, 845 A.2d 71 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">More recently, in <em>Baker v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 853 A.2d 796 (2004), the defendant was alleged to have shot the victim. The trial court declined to ask the prospective jurors: \u201c[D]o you have any bias or prejudice concerning handguns which would prevent you from fairly weighing the evidence in this case?\u201d We concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to so inquire. Judge James Eyler wrote for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">[A]ppellant shot an unarmed man with a handgun, allegedly in self-defense or defense of his girlfriend. One of the facts the jury might have to decide was whether appellant used reasonable force. The trial court should have asked whether any prospective juror had strong feelings about handguns that would have affected his or her ability to weigh the issues fairly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>Baker, </em>157 Md.App. at 613, 853 A.2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The defense\u2019s proposed <em>voir dire </em>in <em>Curtin v. State, </em>165 Md.App. 60, 884 A.2d 758 (2005), <em>aff'd, </em>393 Md. 593, 903 A.2d 922 (2006), inquired: \u201cDoes anyone have strong feelings concerning the use of handguns that would not allow them [sic] to be fair and impartial?\u201d Curtin was charged with armed robbery and related offenses, and relying on <em>Baker, </em>he alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>that the trial court erred in declining to propound this question during <em>voir dire. </em>This Court held that there was no error and distinguished the case from <em>Baker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\">Here, appellant was charged with multiple counts of armed robbery, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and assault. The charges arose from an incident where, according to the State\u2019s evidence, appellant and an accomplice entered a bank armed with a gun. They told everyone to \u201cget down,\u201d jumped over the bank teller\u2019s station, and proceeded to rob the bank. There was no evidence presented at trial that the gun was ever fired. Appellant\u2019s defenses were based on theories suggesting that appellant was not a participant in the bank robbery or, alternatively, that there was no evidence that a real gun was in fact used. Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to ask appellant\u2019s proposed voir dire question regarding attitudes of potential jurors toward guns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">In <em>Baker, </em>jurors were required to consider (1) whether the defendant actually believed he was in immediate danger, and, if this belief was reasonable, (2) whether, by discharging his gun, the defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary. Under those circumstances, a juror who believed that use of a handgun is never appropriate would not be able to give fair and impartial consideration to Baker\u2019s self-defense argument. At the same time, a juror with strong feelings in favor of handguns might have a \u201cshoot first, ask questions later\u201d attitude that would unfairly prejudice the trial process. Therefore, under the circumstances in <em>Baker, </em>and in light of the reasonable use of force argument Baker raised in his defense, a juror\u2019s strong feelings about the use of handguns was an essential area of inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">In this case, however, potential juror bias about handguns does not go so directly to the nature of the crime. Appellant was accused of robbing a bank with an accomplice who was brandishing a gun. Unlike the situation in <em>Baker, </em>no analysis or weighing of issues pertaining to the gun was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>required by jurors in this case, other than accepting or rejecting the State\u2019s evidence demonstrating that a gun was used in the commission of the crime. The proposition that a juror\u2019s strong feelings for or against handguns would necessarily preclude him or her from fairly weighing the evidence in this case \u2014 where there was clearly no question relating to the \u201creasonableness\u201d or \u201cjustifiableness\u201d of the use of the gun under the circumstances \u2014 is based upon a transcendental line of reasoning with which we disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\"><em>Baker </em>makes clear that a proposed voir dire question should not be probing or abstract, but should directly address potential jurors\u2019 biases, prejudices, and ability to weigh the issues fairly. The inquiry should focus on the venire person\u2019s ability to render an impartial verdict based solely on the evidence presented. Appellant\u2019s proposed voir dire question did not directly address a juror\u2019s ability to weigh the issues fairly or render an impartial verdict in this case. Given the nature of the charges against appellant, a juror who had strong feelings for or against handguns could nonetheless be fair and impartial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">Additionally, after balancing the judicial interest of probing into the likelihood of uncovering disqualifying juror partiality or bias with the interests of judicial efficiency and preservation of a court\u2019s limited resources, we are troubled by the precedential consequences of expanding our holding in <em>Baker </em>to effectively require a court to ask whether any prospective juror has \u201cstrong feelings on handguns\u201d in every case in which the jury will receive evidence that a handgun was used in the commission of a crime. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in declining to give appellant\u2019s proposed voir dire question asking whether any potential juror had strong feelings concerning the use of handguns that would make him or her unable to render a fair and impartial verdict based on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 68-70, 884 A.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">In affirming our <em>Curtin </em>decision, the Court of Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>[T]he jury was called upon, as always, to measure whether the State had met its burden of proof as to whether Mr. Curtin was the perpetrator and whether the gun was real, not whether Mr. Curtin was legally in possession of a handgun, or used the handgun in a reasonable or justifiable way, situations which could, conceivably, evoke strong feelings about handguns. Whether a venireman has strong feelings about handguns would not render him or her more or less likely to convict Mr. Curtin of the charges on the evidence presented at trial, and therefore the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to ask the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac3\"><em>Curtin v. State, </em>393 Md. 593, 613, 903 A.2d 922 (2006) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>at the beginning <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court explained to the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">Ladies and Gentlemen of our jury, the Court will be asking you questions regarding your qualifications to serve as jurors in this particular case. This part of the examination is known as the voir dire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">Voir dire examination is used to determine if your decision in this case would in any way be influenced by opinions you \u2014 that you now hold or by some personal experiences or special knowledge that you may have concerning the subject matter which we\u2019re about to try.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">The object of the examination is to obtain 12 persons who will try impartially the issues of this case upon the evidence presented in the courtroom without being influenced by any other external or outside factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">Please understand that this questioning is not for purpose of prying into your affairs for personal reasons of the parties or the Court but is only for the purpose of obtaining an impartial jury to decide the issues in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">We ask that you err on the side of caution. In other words, if you believe that you \u2014 that this question may apply to you but you\u2019re not sure, please volunteer to bring forward your information or unclarity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The court also informed the venire of the nature of the offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">Ladies and Gentlemen, this case is the <em>State of Maryland versus Harold Singfield, Jr. </em>In this case, the State of Maryland has brought charges against Mr. Singfield alleging that on or about May 13, 2003, in the area of the 1500 block of Argyle Avenue in Baltimore City, Mr. Singfield did commit the crime of first-degree murder against Wayne Fisher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The court then asked, <em>inter alia, </em>the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">Have you, or any member of your immediate family, been convicted of a crime that involves violence or a handgun or other weapon? The second part is have you or any member of your immediate family been a victim of a crime of violence or a crime that involved a handgun or a crime that involved a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Is there any member of the jury panel who holds any beliefs, no matter how formed, related to the race, the sex, the religion, the color, or national origin or other personal attributes of either the person who is charged or any of the witnesses who may testify such that it would affect your ability to render a fair and impartial verdict based on the evidence and the law in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">Is there any member of the jury panel who knows of\u2014 who holds any belief, no matter how formed that prevents you or affects your ability to render a judgment in a case of this nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">Does any member of the jury panel know of any reason whatsoever that we might not have discussed but might affect your ability to render a fair and impartial verdict based solely upon the evidence presented in the courtroom and the law that applies to this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>When the trial court described the nature of the case, it failed to inform the jurors that the murder was committed with a handgun or any kind of weapon. As a result, when the court asked the various questions concerning any biases the jurors might have, the prospective jurors were unaware that a .handgun was involved in the offense. They were thus never asked, even in light of the court\u2019s repeated questions designed to uncover potential biases, to consider whether their beliefs concerning the use of a handgun in commission of a murder would prevent them from rendering a fair and impartial verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Further, although the court asked the prospective jurors if they or any member of their immediate family had been convicted of or had been the victim of a crime of violence or a crime that involved a handgun or a weapon, the potential jurors may have had strong beliefs, biases, or feelings concerning the use of a handgun in commission of a murder regardless of how they answered that question. Accordingly, the questions asked by the trial court did not adequately cover the bias Question Number 5 sought to reveal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Nor does appellant\u2019s case fall within the ambit of the <em>Curtin </em>decision. Although, as defense counsel argued in closing, appellant\u2019s defense was that he did not commit the murder, counsel also addressed the offense of voluntary manslaughter and commented on the defense of imperfect self-defense. Moreover, the jury was instructed as to voluntary manslaughter, partial self-defense, and complete self-defense. Therefore, in contrast to <em>Curtin, </em>the jurors had to consider more than whether appellant was the criminal agent who killed the victim. Rather, as in <em>Baker, </em>the jurors might also have had to determine whether appellant used the handgun in a reasonable or justifiable way, might have evoked strong feelings or biases concerning handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Defense Question Number 5 was aimed, as were the questions in <em>Thomas, Sweet, </em>and <em>Baker, </em>directly at biases related to appellant\u2019s alleged criminal act and was reasonably likely to identify jurors with such strong feelings toward the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>handguns to commit murder that it would hinder their ability to render a fair and impartial verdict. Moreover, because we are unable to conclude that the questions actually asked by the trial court would have revealed the potential biases defense Question Number 5 was designed to uncover, the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE CITY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-12\">.
