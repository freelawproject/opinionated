The Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County granted summary judgment on Pope\u2019s claims against Barbre, and dismissed his claims against the State of Maryland and Queen Anne\u2019s County, because Pope mistakenly notified Queen Anne\u2019s County of his claim under the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA), rather than notifying the State Treasurer or one of two specified designees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pope challenges those rulings, arguing that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>complied with the mandatory notice requirements of Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), section 12-106(b) of the State Government Article (SG), and that such notice is not a prerequisite to his claim against Barbre individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We are not persuaded that the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d doctrine under the Maryland Tort Claims Act can be expanded to encompass such defective notice. But we agree that the statutory notice requirement did not apply to Pope\u2019s claim against Barbre individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">On March 17, 2004, Barbre shot Pope in the course of his law enforcement duties, after stopping Pope\u2019s vehicle in Grasonville. Pope was partially paralyzed, between his neck and waist, and now has limited use of his arms and hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Five months after the shooting, on August 12, 2004, Pope\u2019s attorney sent a certified letter to Benjamin F. Casell, Jr., Queen Anne\u2019s County Commissioner. The letter purported to \u201cconstitute the requisite 180 day notice under the Local Government Tort Claims Act, 5-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Act of the Maryland Annotated Code.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel advised that the \u201cletter will be followed by a law suit against Queen Anne\u2019s County alleging that Deputy Barbre acted with malice when he shot my client[.]\u201d Counsel copied the letter to the County Attorney for Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">On April 19, 2005, Pope filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, naming Barbre and the Queen Anne\u2019s County government as defendants. In the caption, Pope served the complaint on Commissioner Cassell, as repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>sentative of Queen Anne\u2019s County (hereafter, the \u201cCounty\u201d). As insurer for the County,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Local Government Insurance Trust (LGIT) entered its appearance on behalf of both Barbre and the County, then moved for dismissal or summary judgment in favor of both defendants. Counsel for LGIT asserted that the County is not a proper party to the lawsuit and that the time for suing under the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA) had expired. Specifically, the LGIT argued: (1) Barbre is classified as \u201cState Personnel\u201d for purposes of tort claims against him, so that (2) the County is not liable for any tort Barbre may have committed; (3) Barbre instead is amenable to suit only under the MTCA, but (4) Pope did not satisfy the MTCA requirement of notice to the State Treasurer, so that (5) Pope failed to obtain the waiver of sovereign immunity that is necessary to sue Barbre and the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On May 13, 2005, fourteen months after the altercation, counsel for Pope hand delivered to the State Treasurer a letter stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Although you may have already received notice of Mr. Pope\u2019s claim via my August 12, 2004 letter to Queen Anne\u2019s County Commissioner Benjamin Cassell, and via my March 7, 2005 Freedom of Information Act Request to Queen Anne\u2019s County Sheriff Charles Crossley ... this letter will ensure that you have received direct notice of Mr. Pope\u2019s intent to pursue his claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Pope twice amended his complaint while the County\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment was pending. The first amendment dropped the County as a defendant, leaving only the individual claim against Barbre. The second amended complaint renamed the County and added the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Maryland as defendants. All three defendants moved to strike the second amended complaint, on the grounds previously asserted in the motion filed by the LGIT.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The circuit court granted the motion to strike the second amended complaint, leaving only Barbre as a defendant. At the same time, the court also granted summary judgment on all claims against Barbre in the first amended complaint. Pope noted this appeal, presenting four issues<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that we reduce to two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">I. Did the notice of claim that Pope sent to Queen Anne\u2019s County satisfy the notice requirement in section 12-106 of the Maryland Tort Claims Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">II. Did the circuit court err in striking Pope\u2019s second amended complaint?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In addition, Pope raises a third issue in his brief, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">III. The circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on the claims against Barbre in his individual capacity because \u201c[t]here is no MTCA requirement to notify a State employee of claims asserted against him or her on an individual basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">We find no error in the ruling that Pope\u2019s failure to provide timely notice to the State Treasurer barred his claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the State. Although we shall affirm the decision to strike the second amended complaint, we reverse the judgment in favor of Barbre on Pope\u2019s individual claim against him, because notice to the State Treasurer is not a prerequisite for suing a sheriffs deputy in his individual capacity for torts allegedly committed with malice or gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Tort Claims Against A Deputy Sheriff</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u201cGrounded in ancient common law, the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars individuals from bringing actions against the State, thus protecting it from interference with governmental functions and preserving its control over its agencies and funds.\u201d <em>Condon v. State of Maryland-Univ. of Md., </em>332 Md. 481, 492, 632 A.2d 753 (1993). \u201cBy waiving the State\u2019s tort immunity, the [Maryland Tort Claims Act has] afforded a remedy for individuals injured by tortious conduct attributable to the State.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Title 12 of the State Government Article (SG) governs immunity and liability of State, local, and municipal entities. Subtitle 1 is the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA), in which the State both defines the extent to which it waives its sovereign immunity and creates statutory immunity for State personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">With respect the State itself, as well as its units,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the MTCA provides that the sovereign \u201cimmunity of the State and of its units is waived as to a tort action,\u201d with certain \u201cexclusions and limitations\u201d specified in this subtitle. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 12-104(a). With respect to individual liability, the MTCA provides that \u201cState personnel shall have the immunity from liability described under \u00a7 5-522(b) of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article\u201d (CJP). <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 12-105. This immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ty extends to the sheriff and deputy sheriff of a county, who are included within the definition of \u201cState personnel.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 12 \u2014 101(a)(6). In turn, CJP (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), section 5-522(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 State personnel, as defined in \u00a7 12-101 of the State Government Article, are immune from suit in courts of the State and from liability in tort for a tortious act or omission that is within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and is made without malice or gross negligence, <em>and for which the State or its units have waived immunity </em>under Title 12, Subtitle 1 of the State Government Article.... (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Through this <em>quid pro quo, </em>the MTCA substitutes State tort liability for an individual State employee\u2019s tort liability. As Judge Greene explained while he was a member of this Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">a party can bring a viable tort action against the State when the tort was committed by a State employee acting within the scope of his or her employment and without malice or gross negligence. Thus, the State has accepted vicarious liability arising from the tortious conduct of State personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">The MTCA also clearly provides that a State employee acting within his or her scope of employment and without malice or gross negligence is immune from suit. If, however, the State employee has acted with malice or gross negligence, or the State employee has acted outside the scope of his or her employment, the State is immune from suit and the injured party may only bring a viable tort claim against the State employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-9\"><em>Ford v. Baltimore City Sheriff\u2019s Ofc., </em>149 Md.App. 107, 120-21, 814 A.2d 127 (2002). Thus, \u201c[t] he purpose of MTCA immunity is not simply to protect judgmental decisions by officials, but to insulate state employees generally from tort liability if their actions are within the scope of employment and without malice or gross negligence!.]\u201d <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 261, 863 A.2d 297 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>One of the statutory \u201cexclusions and limitations\u201d on tort actions against the State and its units is the notice requirement that lies at the heart of this appeal. SG section 12-106(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">(b) <em>Claim and denial required. </em>\u2014 A claimant may not institute an action under this subtitle unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">(1) the claimant submits a -written claim to the Treasurer or a designee of the Treasurer within 1 year after the injury to person or property that is the basis of the claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">(2) the Treasurer or designee denies the claim finally; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">(3) the action is filed within 3 years after the cause of action arises. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Complementing this notice requirement is a service requirement in SG section 12-108(a), which provides that, \u201c[i] n an action under this subtitle, service of the complaint and accompanying documents is sufficient only if made on the Treasurer.\u201d Moreover, by regulation, the State Treasurer has explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">[f]or purposes of the provisions of State Government Article 12-106----[presentation of a purported claim to any unit of State Government other than the State Treasurer\u2019s Office does not constitute proper submission of a claim[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">COMAR 25.02.03.01.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Consistent with this scheme, the definition of \u201cTreasurer\u2019s designee\u201d is limited to specified officials in the State Treasurer\u2019s Office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-14\">(a) \u201cTreasurer\u2019s designee\u201d means only the:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-15\">(i) Chief Deputy Treasurer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-16\">(ii) Director of the Insurance Division of the State Treasurer\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-17\">(b) \u201cTreasurer\u2019s designee\u201d does not mean or include any other person, including, but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-18\">(i) An officer or employee of State government other than those persons identified in \u00a7 B(7)(a), above;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-19\">(ii) The Comptroller of the Treasury, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(iii) A commercial insurer, adjuster, claims administrator, or similar person who provides services to the Treasurer as an independent contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">COMAR 25.02.01.02.B(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The Court Properly Dismissed Pope\u2019s Claim Against The State</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The motion court dismissed the second amended complaint naming the State of Maryland as a defendant, on the ground that Pope did not satisfy the SG section 12-106(b) notice requirement. Pope challenges that ruling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">It is undisputed that Pope did not notify the State Treasurer of his claim within the one year period mandated in SG section 12-106(b). Neither did Pope provide notice to one of the State Treasurer\u2019s two designees. Nevertheless Pope urges us to hold that the August 12 notice to the Queen Anne\u2019s County Commissioner satisfied the MTCA notice requirement, either because the Commissioner qualifies as a Treasurer\u2019s \u201cdesignee\u201d or because such notice substantially complies with section 12-106(b). We cannot legally justify such a holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The County Commissioner Is Not A \u201cTreasurer\u2019s Designee\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">To dispose of Pope\u2019s contention that a county commissioner may serve as the State Treasurer\u2019s \u201cunofficial designee,\u201d we need look no farther than the State Treasurer\u2019s Office itself. By duly promulgated regulation, it has explicitly spelled out who is \u2014 and who is not \u2014 a \u201cTreasurer\u2019s designee\u201d for purposes of accepting notice of tort claims under the MTCA. County commissioners are not on the Treasurer\u2019s short list of two designees (ie., the Chief Deputy Treasurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>and the Director of the Insurance Division of the State Treasurer\u2019s Office), both of whom work within the State Treasurer\u2019s Office. <em>See </em>COMAR 25.02.01.02.B.7(a). To prevent any misunderstanding, the regulation unequivocally states that \u201c \u2018Treasurer\u2019s designee\u2019 does not mean or include any other person[.]\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 25.02.01.02.B(7)(b). Consequently, county commissioners do not qualify as a Treasurer\u2019s designee for MTCA notice purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Pope\u2019s contention that the County\u2019s financial responsibility 10 for any judgment against Deputy Sheriff Barbre renders Queen Anne\u2019s County \u201cthe State\u2019s designee\u201d for MTCA notice purposes is similarly foreclosed by the clear language of the statute and regulations. The insurance provisions in section 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Finance and Procurement Article simply do not authorize a county commissioner or municipal insurer to receive an MTCA notice on the Treasurer\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">To be sure, Title 9 of that article creates a \u201cprogram of purchased insurance and self-insurance against loss, damage, and liability that the State may incur.\u201d Md.Code (1985, 1988, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-102(a) of the State Finance and Procurement Article (SFP). Under SFP section 9-108, which \u201capplies to any sheriff or deputy sheriff engaged in\u201d law enforcement functions such as the altercation at issue here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">(b) <em>Insurance authorized. </em>\u2014 A county or Baltimore City may obtain insurance to provide the coverage and defense necessary under the Maryland Tort Claims Act for personnel covered by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">(c) <em>Failure to obtain insurance. </em>\u2014 (1) If a county or Baltimore City does not obtain adequate insurance coverage to satisfy the coverage and defense necessary under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, an assessment for coverage and for payment of any litigation expenses, other than for compensation for the time spent by any State employee working for the Attorney General, shall be set off from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">(i) any tax which has been appropriated in the State budget to the county or Baltimore City; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>(\u00dc) the subdivision\u2019s share of any income tax collected by the State Comptroller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Yet Pope\u2019s \u201cunofficial insurer\u201d argument fails to address the absence of any reference to the MTCA notice requirement in these or any other provisions of Title 9. It also fails to account for the Treasurer\u2019s unequivocal rejection of notice to persons other than the two identified designees. This is not a mere matter of \u201csemantics\u201d as Pope contends. If neither the Comptroller, nor the Attorney General, nor any other State officer, nor an \u201cinsurer ... who provides services to the Treasurer as an independent contractor\u201d qualifies as a Treasurer\u2019s designee, <em>see </em>COMAR 25.02.01.02.B(7)(b)(i)-(iii), then neither does a county officer such as a county commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Pope Did Not Substantially Comply With The Statutory Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Turning to Pope\u2019s alternative \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d argument, we are constrained by the language of the MTCA, as it has been interpreted by case law. The language of section 12-106(b) has been construed consistently as barring suits in which notice mistakenly was not given at the right time or to the right person. Both the Court of Appeals and this Court have refused to expand the concept of substantial compliance to encompass such situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Recently, in <em>Candelero v. Cole, </em>152 Md.App. 190, 831 A.2d 495 (2003), this Court declined to hold that the claimant substantially complied with SG section 12-106(b) by mailing notice on the deadline, rather than ensuring that it was received by that date as required by statute and regulation. In doing so, we reviewed the narrow circumstances in which the substantial compliance doctrine has been successfully invoked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">The Court of Appeals has recognized the existence of a substantial compliance argument under the MTCA. In <em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 496, 632 A.2d 753 (quoting <em>Conaway v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 234, 246, 600 A.2d 1133 (1992)), the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>accepted our definition of substantial compliance as a \u201ccommunication that provides the State \u2018requisite and timely notice of facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) \u201cThe doctrine of substantial compliance, however, is not license to ignore the clear mandate of the MTCA,\u201d <em>Chinwuba v. Larsen, </em>142 Md.App. 327, 355, 790 A.2d 83 (2002), and cannot serve as a springboard for judicial legislation. Provisions such as this, and the canon of construction favoring a liberal interpretation of remedial legislation, are helpful in resolving ambiguities in statutes, but do not permit us to expand the statute to afford relief where the words of the statute bar that relief. <em>Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 227, 592 A.2d 1090 (1991). Those principles are illustrated in two cases, <em>Simpson, supra, </em>and <em>Conaway, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">In <em>Simpson, </em>the case was dismissed because the claimant failed to file a written claim within 180 days after the accident. The claimant argued that the legislature intended the notice requirement in SG \u00a7 12 \u2014 106(b)(1) to contain the same provision as that contained in Md.Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-306 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), permitting waiver of the notice requirement, under certain circumstances, in a case filed under the Local Government Tort Claims Act. The Court of Appeals declined to incorporate that waiver provision into SG \u00a7 12-106, stating that the legislature could have done so, if it wanted, by amendment. Thus, because there was an \u201coutright failure\u201d by the claimant to file a written claim, and compliance was \u201ca condition precedent to the maintenance of a claim against the State,\u201d the doctrine of substantial compliance was not applicable. <em>Simpson, </em>323 Md. at 228-29, 592 A.2d 1090.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">In <em>Conaway, </em>a prisoner filed a timely claim with the Treasurer, but did not demand specific damages as required by SG \u00a7 12-107(a). Applying the doctrine of substantial compliance, we held that while the claim \u201cdid not literally comply with all of the requirements of [SG] \u00a7 12-107(a),\u201d it provided the State with \u201csufficient written notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>circumstances\u201d of the accident to allow it to \u201cinvestigate the claim and respond either by settlement or defense.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 250, 600 A.2d 1133 (quoting <em>Adams v. United States, </em>615 F.2d 284, 289 (5th Cir.1980)). In so holding, we distinguished <em>Simpson, </em>stating that the claimant in that case had \u201cprovided no notice to the State.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 241, 600 A.2d 1133.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 197, 831 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The situation presented in <em>Candelero </em>differed from <em>Simpson </em>in that notice was provided, albeit late, and from <em>Conaway, </em>in that the notice included a specific claim for damages. This Court held that the claimant nonetheless failed to substantially comply with the notice requirement because the notice was not timely.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">As in <em>Simpson, </em>the doctrine of substantial compliance is not applicable in this case. The notice requirement contained in SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(1) is a \u201ccondition precedent to filing suit against the State.\u201d <em>Conaway, </em>90 Md.App. at 240, 600 A.2d 1133. The primary purpose of that requirement is to permit the State to timely investigate the incident and to respond to the claim. The legislature has set the notice period at one year. Because the Treasurer received Candelero\u2019s written claim more than one year after the date of injury, the claim was not timely submitted. Although the claimant in <em>Simpson </em>failed to file any claim, we see little difference between that scenario and this case. If the purpose of the required notice is to permit a timely investigation and the legislature has determined that a timely claim is a claim submitted within one year, a claim that is not received within that time frame is untimely and, in effect, \u201can outright failure to comply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 831 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">As we recognized in <em>Candelero, </em>our decision in <em>Conaway </em>did not address whether notice given to someone other than the State Treasurer or designee could \u201csubstantially comply\u201d with section 12-106(b). No Maryland court has held that such substituted notice is satisfactory. To the contrary, in <em>Chinwu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>ba v. Larsen, </em>142 Md.App. 327, 357, 790 A.2d 83 (2002), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>377 Md. 92, 832 A.2d 193 (2003), we held that the language of the MTCA precluded the claimant\u2019s argument that notice given to the Attorney General substantially complied with section 12-106(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">The doctrine of substantial compliance ... is not license to ignore the clear mandate of the MTCA. In <em>Condon, </em>the Court of Appeals warned that courts may not \u201cinfer an intent where the legislature has clearly indicated the contrary.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Simpson, </em>the Court ____ explained that \u201c[provisions such as this, and the canon of construction favoring a liberal interpretation of remedial legislation, are helpful in resolving ambiguities in statutes, but do not permit us to expand the statute to afford relief where the words of the statute bar that relief.\u201d We may not \u201c \u2018judicially place in the statute language which is not there\u2019 in order to avoid a harsh result.\u201d Thus, \u201cwe will not extend or suspend the filing requirements when they are so clear and unambiguous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">We find no ambiguity in subsections 12-106(b) and 12-108(a), either when they are considered alone or <em>in pari materia. </em>Both subsections unambiguously state that notice of any MTCA claim must be directed and delivered to the Treasurer. In fact, the sole purpose of subsection 12-108(a) is to instruct claimants that the one and only method of satisfying this notice requirement is to serve the claim on the Treasurer. If we were to accept Chinwuba\u2019s contention that notice to the Attorney General constitutes substantial compliance with subsections 12-106(b) and 12-108(a), we would be judicially legislating subsection 12-208(a) out of the MTCA. We will not ignore its clear language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 790 A.2d 83 (citations omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">This reasoning is equally applicable to Pope\u2019s contention that substitute notice to a county commissioner satisfies the Treasurer notice requirement in section 12-106(b). The clear language of the MTCA controls our conclusion that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>notice does not satisfy the statutory requirement of notice to the State Treasurer or designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We recognize that there is equitable appeal to Pope\u2019s contention that this case is unlike any other \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d case, in that the County, which was the recipient of the timely notice, is precisely the entity that will bear ultimate financial responsibility for any judgment entered against the State under the MTCA. Thus, the ultimate payor was in a position to do financial planning necessary in connection with the claim. Moreover, although the State might have to \u201cfront\u201d the money to pay the County, there is a fool-proof mechanism for State recovery of that money from Queen Anne\u2019s County through the funding withholding provisions of SPP section 9-108(c). Also, the County likely stood in a good position to investigate the claim while memories were fresh, because a County deputy sheriff committed the alleged misconduct. With a claimant who may have suffered serious injury from wrongful acts of a law enforcement officer, it is somewhat tempting to let him have his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">To do so, however, would be to improperly substitute these alternate policy considerations, for the judgment of the legislature enunciated in SG section 12-106(b). <em>See Simpson v. Moore, </em>823 Md. 215, 227, 592 A.2d 1090 (1991) (\u201c \u2018A court is not wholly free to rewrite a statute merely because of some judicial notion of legislative purpose\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Moreover, were we to decide that these considerations justify the conclusion that Pope \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the statutory notice requirement, we would be expanding the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d doctrine beyond that recognized in any Maryland appellate decision. Even though Pope\u2019s notice may have gotten to the persons who might be in the best position to investigate, and to do the necessary financial planning, it is not up to us to decide whether that satisfied the statute when these are not the criteria for determining \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with SG section 12 \u2014 106(b). Our duty is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>decide whether there was substantial compliance with the requirement that the <em>Treasurer </em>receive the notice. Following the appellate decisions discussed above, service on the County is not substantial compliance with section 12-106(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by any of the cases cited by Pope concerning substantial compliance with the notice requirements of the Local Government Tort Claims Act. In <em>Johnson v. Maryland State Police, </em>331 Md. 285, 291, 628 A.2d 162 (1993), \u201c[t]he plaintiffs point[ed] out that the State created several reports of the accident, that the State interviewed the plaintiffs immediately after the accident, and that the State unsuccessfully prosecuted Johnson for an alleged traffic violation.\u201d The Court of Appeals, however, rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they substantially complied with the MTCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APZ\">The facts relied on by the plaintiffs might show that the State suffered no prejudice as a result of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the administrative claim requirement. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument confuses \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with \u201clack of prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Thus, the Court of Appeals made it clear that the \u201clack of prejudice\u201d concept contained in the LGTCA waiver of notice provision, was not applicable in a MTCA action. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 5-304(d) In LGTCA action, (\u201cunless the defendant can affirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced by lack of required notice, upon motion and for good cause shown the court may entertain the suit even though the required notice was not given\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Pope\u2019s reliance on <em>Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002), is similarly misplaced. In that case, notice of the car accident for which the town of Easton might be liable was given to the town\u2019s insurer rather than the town itself. The Court of Appeals held that this constituted substantial compliance with the LGTCA notice requirements. <em>See id. </em>at 288, 808 A.2d 1262. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">This Court concluded in <em>Moore </em>and <em>Mendelson </em>that, due to the nature of [the third party claims administrator\u2019s] and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the County\u2019s intertwined and extensive claims administration systems and the high degree of control the County exercised over [the third party claims administrator\u2019s] activities, substantial compliance with the statutory notice requirement owed to Montgomery County resulted by virtue of the dealings between the claimants, their representatives, and [the third party claims administrator\u2019s]. <em>Moore [v. Norouzi], </em>371 Md. [154] at 169, 807 A.2d 632. \u201cSubstantial compliance turns on ensuring that the County [or local government] has sufficient actual notice to perform a proper and timely investigation.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 178, 807 A.2d 632. We stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">Consequently, where the tort claimant provides the local government, through the unit or division with the responsibility for investigating tort claims against that local government, or the company with whom the local government or unit has contracted for that function, the information required by \u00a7 5 \u2014 304(b)(3) to be supplied, who thus acquires actual knowledge within the statutory period, the tort claimant has substantially complied with the notice provisions of the LGTCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\"><em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 178, 807 A.2d 632.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 301-02, <em>808 </em>A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In contrast, Queen Anne\u2019s County has no contractual obligation to the State Treasurer to conduct an immediate investigation of the accident and the State\u2019s potential liability for it, while the evidence was still fresh. <em>See id. </em>at 288, 808 A.2d 1262. Nor does Pope suggest that the county has an \u201cintertwined and extensive claims administration systems\u201d as was maintained by Montgomery Country with its claims administrator. <em>See id. </em>Nor does the State Treasurer exercise a high degree of control over Queen Anne\u2019s County, like the control Montgomery County exercised over the claims administrator\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">More recently, in <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 877 A.2d 1129, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 Md. 401, 885 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>A.2d 825 (2005), this Court recognized the limited scope of the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in <em>Moore:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">The Court recognized that \u201cstrict compliance with the notice provisions of the LGTCA is not always required; substantial compliance may suffice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 171, 807 A.2d 632, \u201ceven though not all of the details prescribed have been complied with.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, of import here, the Court underscored that \u201c[t]here must be some effort to provide the requisite notice and, in fact, it must be provided, albeit not in strict compliance with the statutory provision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABb\">There, we held that filing a complaint with the police department\u2019s internal affairs division about police brutality was not substantial compliance with the statutory notice requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 147, 877 A.2d 1129. <em>See also Wilbon v. Hunsicker, </em>No. 779, Sept. Term 2005, 172 Md.App. 181, 913 A.2d 678, 2006 WL 3821398, *8-9 (2006) (following <em>White </em>in holding that notice to the police department\u2019s \u201ccivilian review board\u201d was not compliance with the LGTCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The Court Did Not Prejudicially Err In Striking Pope\u2019s Second Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Pope complains that the court erred in striking his second amended complaint, because leave was not required to file that complaint, given the procedural posture of the case <em>(i.e., </em>no trial date had been scheduled) and because the complaint alleges compliance with the notice provisions of the MTCA. Any error in striking that complaint was harmless given that lack of compliance with the notice requirements of the MTCA was apparent on the face of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Pope concedes that he has no claim against the County. We have ruled in section I that he has no claim against the State due to his failure to provide the requisite MTCA notice. The claims asserted against Barbre in the second amended complaint are substantially similar to those Pope asserted against Barbre in his first amended complaint. The circuit court considered and ruled on those claims, and we address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>them in this opinion. Thus, Pope was not prejudiced by the decision to strike the second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Pope\u2019s Failure To Give The State Treasurer Notice Does Not Bar His Individual Claim Against Barbre</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Pope argues that \u201cthe Circuit Court had no legal basis to grant judgment to Sheriff Barbre on the battery claims against him in his individual capacity,\u201d because \u201c[t]here is no MTCA requirement to notify a State employee of claims asserted against him or her on an individual basis. Any such claims would have survived summary judgment.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The motion court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the claims against Barbre in his individual capacity rests on the premise that the notice required under SG section 12-106(b) is a prerequisite to suing not only the State, but also any individual who is classified as State personnel. In <em>Chinwuba v. Larsen, </em>142 Md.App. 327, 355-56, 790 A.2d 83 (2002), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>377 Md. 92, 832 A.2d 193 (2003), we held that such notice was not necessary to sue an individual State officer in his individual capacity for torts allegedly committed with malice or gross negligence, or outside the scope of employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In doing so, we \u201caeknowledge[d] that there is a surprising lack of language in our case law directly addressing whether a claimant may assert a tort claim against an individual State employee without notifying the Treasurer in accordance with sections 12-106 and 12-108.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 358, 790 A.2d 83. Nevertheless, we observed that the Court of Appeals \u201chas not treated a plaintiffs failure to give notice to the Treasurer as a bar to such a claim against an individual State employee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In <em>Chinwuba, </em>we followed the result in <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 587 A.2d 467 (1991), a suit against an off-duty state trooper who allegedly beat up another motorist. In <em>Sawyer, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to give notice under SG section 12-106 barred a suit against both the State and the State Police, but did not bar a suit filed directly against the individual state trooper. <em>See id. </em>at 357-58, 587 A.2d 467. The <em>Sawyer </em>Court allowed the claim against the officer in his individual capacity to proceed on the ground that the complaint alleged conduct that could have been either malicious or outside the scope of employment, resulting in the loss of the governmental immunity provided by SG section 12-105. <em>See id. </em>at 260-61, 587 A.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The outcomes in <em>Sawyer </em>and <em>Chinwuba </em>differ instructively from a case decided shortly after <em>Sawyer. </em>In <em>Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 231, 592 A.2d 1090 (1991), the Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of negligence claims arising from the crash of a Maryland State Police helicopter, in which the plaintiffs wife was killed while working as a state trooper. Focusing on the MTCA claim against the State, the <em>Sawyer </em>Court held that the surviving spouse failed to substantially comply with section 12-106(b) because his claim was not received by the State Treasurer before the deadline.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 228-29, 592 A.2d 1090. In doing so, the Court rejected the claimant\u2019s suggestion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">[t]he State waived its immunity, but imposed certain procedural requirements for the successful maintenance of a claim or action against it. The failure of the claimant to follow the procedural requirements established by the Act may result in the loss of the claim, but it does not have the effect of rescinding the grant of statutory immunity to State personnel accomplished by \u00a7 12-105. If this were not the case, a plaintiff could control the relative immunities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>liabilities of the State and its personnel. A plaintiff could, for instance, choose to comply with \u00a7 12-106 and sue the State if he felt it would be to his advantage, or he could deliberately delay filing his claim and deprive the State employees of their entitled immunity under \u00a7 12-105. The legislature clearly could not have intended such a result. The plaintiffs claims against the State were not lost because of sovereign immunity, but because the plaintiff failed to comply with a legislatively created condition precedent to the maintenance of a claim against the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 592 A.2d 1090 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The <em>Simpson </em>Court\u2019s dismissal of the negligence claims against individual officers involved in the helicopter crash does not contradict the <em>Sawyer </em>Court\u2019s decision to proceed on the battery claim against the off duty officer involved in the \u201croad rage\u201d incident. While there was evidence in <em>Sawyer </em>that raised a triable issue as to whether the officer acted with malice or gross negligence, the claims arising from the police helicopter crash in <em>Simpson </em>were pleaded as simple negligence claims. As discussed above, SG section 12-105 immunizes State personnel for \u201cmerely\u201d negligent acts committed within the scope of employment and without malice or gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In <em>Simpson, </em>the negligence claims against the individual officers were dismissed due to the section 12-105 immunity covering negligence actions, not because the plaintiff failed to comply with the section 12-106 notice requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 230, 592 A.2d 1090. Thus, the <em>Simpson </em>Court did not address whether the plaintiff was obligated to give the State Treasurer notice as a condition precedent to asserting claims against the officers in their individual capacities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Moreover, applying section 12-106(b) solely to claims made against the State and its units is consistent with the \u201cthe statutory purpose of SG \u00a7 12-106(b)(1), which is to \u2018give the State early notice of claims against it\u2019 \u201d so that the Treasurer has adequate \u201copportunity to \u2018investigate the claims while the facts are fresh and memories vivid, and, where appropriate, settle them at the earliest possible time.\u2019\u201d <em>Candelero, </em>152 Md.App. at 195-96, 881 A.2d 495 (quoting <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 470, 667 A.2d 179 (1995)). Notice of a claim against an individual officer does not advance either of these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In sum, when the claimant alleges simple negligence, as in <em>Simpson, </em>section 12-105 immunity bars suit against the individual deputy sheriff. The claimant\u2019s sole remedy in that case would be against the State, but any such relief is precluded by the claimant\u2019s failure to give the State notice under SG section 12-106(b). When, as in this case, the claimant pursues tort remedies against an individual classified as State personnel, based on acts allegedly committed with malice or gross negligence, a requirement of notice to the State would not serve the investigation and settlement purposes underlying section 12-106(b). Nor would notice to individual State personnel serve such purposes. Thus, the State Treasurer does not require early notice of a claim against an individual officer alleging a malicious or grossly negligent tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED AS TO THE STATE OF MARYLAND AND QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY.
