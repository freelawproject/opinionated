Later, at about 2:30 p.m., the police transported Wilbon to the emergency room because his behavior was bizarre and indicated that he required medical attention. Wilbon suffered a seizure while waiting for treatment in the emergency room and was pronounced dead at 3:30 p.m. The cause of death was a cardiac arrhythmia.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Wilbon\u2019s daughter, Nicole Wilbon, then filed suit, individually and as the personal representative of Wilbon\u2019s estate, against the officers who arrested and transported her father to the hospital. Plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the officers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>delay in obtaining medical attention caused Wilboris death. The case proceeded to trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and resulted in a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff. Plaintiff and defendants appeal that judgment for multiple reasons. We will summarize the factual and procedural background in this case before identifying the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">On June 5, 2000, at about 1:06 p.m., Officer Jeffrey E. Mathena, Jr. and Officer Trainee Franklin Hunsieker were dispatched to an alley behind a home at 757 Bartlett Avenue to investigate a man who allegedly was \u201ctrying to get into several [cars]\u201d and appeared to be homeless. The officers arrived at the scene three minutes later and found Wilbon sitting in a car. According to Officer Mathena, Wilbon responded to police questions that he did not own the vehicle and did not have permission to be in the vehicle. Officer Hunsieker assisted Wilbon out of the car and, at around 1:15 p.m., the officers placed him under arrest for attempted theft of the vehicle. There was evidence that Wilbon had urinated and defecated on himself, and that he was not wearing shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Officers Mathena and Hunsieker then returned to the Eastern District police station to process Wilbon\u2019s charging documents, while Wilbon was transported by Officer Mark Greeff to the Central Booking and Intake Facility (\u201cCBIF\u201d). Wilbon arrived at CBIF at about 1:30 p.m. At CBIF, the posted officers noticed that Wilboris toe was bleeding, his face was discolored, he was soiled, and he was unresponsive. The EMT on duty evaluated Wilbon and directed that he receive medical attention at a hospital. The EMT signed an \u201cEMT Send Out Sheet\u201d at 2:02 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Officer Mathena was notified at 2:25 p.m. by a police dispatcher to respond to CBIF to take Wilbon to the hospital. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Officers Mathena, Hunsieker, and Greeff complied and arrived at CBIF sometime before 2:30 p.m. Upon arrival, Officer Mathena apparently told the booking officer, Lieutenant Reginald Street, that he did not want to take Wilbon to the hospital and then tried to convince Lieutenant Street to keep Wilbon at CBIF. At 2:30 p.m., Officer Mathena called his supervisor, Lieutenant Michael J. McKnight, about the \u201cproblem\u201d at CBIF. Lieutenant McKnight spoke with the duty EMT, who told him that Wilbon \u201cwas under the influence of cocaine and needed to be taken to the hospital for a shot of narean.\u201d Lieutenant McKnight advised Officer Mathena to transport Wilbon to the hospital, and Wilbon arrived at the emergency room of Mercy Hospital at approximately 2:50 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Officer Mathena began to fill out the necessary paperwork to register Wilbon, who sat in the waiting room. Wilbon yelled and went into a seizure. He was taken to the treatment area, where he was pronounced dead at 3:30 p.m. The medical examiner determined that Wilbon died of \u201ca cardiac arrhythmia associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and past cocaine use.\u201d The examiner found \u201csignificant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\u201d and \u201cthe presence of cocaine and cocaine metabolites in the urine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">On June 2, 2003, almost three years after Wilbon\u2019s death, plaintiff filed her complaint in the circuit court. She named Officers Hunsieker and Mathena as defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and alleged battery, false arrest and imprisonment, gross negligence, negligence (based on a theory of <em>respondeat superior), </em>and violation of Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Plaintiff also sued defendants in survival and wrongful death actions. She sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">As set forth more fully in the discussion section herein, defendants responded to the complaint with a motion to dismiss, in which they argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiff had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>complied with the notice requirement of the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol., Supp.2006), \u00a7 5-304 of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court denied this motion, as well as defendants\u2019 later attempts, by motions for summary judgment and a post-trial motion, to have the case dismissed for lack of compliance with the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">A trial began on April 18, 2005, and concluded on April 27, 2005. On April 22, 2005, at the close of plaintiffs case, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on plaintiffs claims of gross negligence, negligence, and wrongful death. The jury returned a verdict on April 28, 2005, in favor of plaintiff on the claims of battery, false arrest and imprisonment, and violations of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury awarded plaintiff compensatory damages of $83,000.00 on each claim against each officer. Two judgments of $249,000.00 were entered, one against Officer Mathena and the other against Officer Hunsicker.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Plaintiff then appealed the court\u2019s dismissal of the negligence and wrongful death claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants cross-appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the court\u2019s decision that plaintiff complied with the notice requirement of the LGTCA, as well as the court\u2019s alleged award of multiple satisfactions for a single injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that plaintiff did not strictly or substantially comply with the notice requirement under the LGTCA and that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that plaintiff demonstrated good cause to justify a waiver of the notice requirement. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case to that court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of defendants. In light of our decision, we need not address the other issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>Compliance with the LGTCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">A. The Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Defendants argue in their cross-appeal that plaintiffs complaint never should have gone to trial because plaintiff did not comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the LGTCA provides that \u201can action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government or its employees unless the notice of the claim ... is given within 180 days after the injury.\u201d \u00a7 5-304(b). \u201cThe notice shall be in writing and shall state the time, place, and cause of the injury.\u201d \u00a7 5-304(c)(3). In Baltimore' City, the notice must be provided in person, or by certified mail, to the City Solicitor. \u00a7 5-304(c)(1)(i). This notice requirement is \u201ca condition precedent to maintaining an action against a local govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ment or its employees.... \u201d <em>Rios v. Montgomery County, </em>386 Md. 104, 127, 872 A.2d 1 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Under certain circumstances, however, \u201ca litigant is excused from strict compliance with the notice obligation, so long as \u2018the purpose of the notice statute was fulfilled by substantial compliance with the statutory requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 144, 877 A.2d 1129 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 Md. 401, 885 A.2d 825 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cSubstantial compliance \u2018requires some effort to provide the requisite notice and, in fact, it must be provided, albeit not in strict compliance with the statutory provision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 877 A.2d 1129 (citation omitted). \u201cHowever, when the notice does not apprise the proper officials that the Plaintiff is pursuing a claim, there is not substantial compliance.\u201d <em>Bibum v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>85 F.Supp.2d 557, 564 (D.Md.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">A litigant who has not complied, or substantially complied, with the notice provision of the LGTCA may seek relief in the waiver provision of section 5-304(c), which states: \u201cNotwithstanding the other provisions of this section, unless the defendant can affirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced by lack of required notice, upon motion and for good cause shown the court may entertain the suit even though the required notice was not given.\u201d The court first considers whether good cause exists, and only if it does so exist, should the court consider whether the defendant suffered prejudice. <em>See Hargrove v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>146 Md.App. 457, 463, 807 A.2d 149 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">B. The Notice in this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Wilbon\u2019s mother, Mary Jackson, submitted a \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d to the Civilian Review Board<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (\u201cCRB\u201d) on June 9, 2000, four days after Wilbon died. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In the space on the form that requested a \u201c[b]rief statement of allegation,\u201d Jackson wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">My son who owned a car repair garage at 2401 Brentwood, was accused of stealing a car that was actually in his care to be repaired. He was arrested[,] taken to Central Booking, then to Mercy Hospital[,] w[h]ere he was pronounced dead. Rumors in the neighborhood] state that he was beaten.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABL\">Jackson also identified the date and place of the incident, signed the statement, and had it notarized. Jackson\u2019s statement sparked an investigation by the Internal Investigative Division (\u201cHD\u201d) of the Baltimore City Police Department (\u201cBCPD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Next, in a letter dated January 1, 2001, more than 180 days after Wilbon\u2019s death, Jackson mailed, by certified mail, a \u201cNotice of Intent to File Suit\u201d to the Maryland State Treasurer, the Comptroller of the Treasury, and the Commissioner of the BCPD. The record does not indicate the precise date that the letter was mailed, but does establish that the letter was not received by the Commissioner until January 18, 2001. Jackson wrote in the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Please be advised pursuant to the Maryland Code that the undersigned Plaintiff/Claimant intends to file a lawsuit alleging several Federal and State Constitutional rights violations and certain common law violations arising out of an incident occurring June 5, 2000, in Baltimore, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">FACTS: On June 5, 2000, in Baltimore, Maryland at 3:30 p.m. in or about the 700 blk of Bartlett Street, Claimant was assaulted &amp; battered, falsely arrested, imprisoned, defamed, humiliated, disgraced and wrongfully deceased in violation of his/her civil and other rights afforded through the federal and state laws of Maryland by Baltimore City Police Officers ... Mathena [and] Hunsicker ... acting under color of State law as Maryland State Police Officers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>This Notice is written pursuant to the Maryland/Loeal Government Tort Claims Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">A claims adjuster from the Maryland State Treasurer, Insurance Division, responded to this notice with a letter dated March 9, 2001, stating that the State was \u201cnot at fault in this incident\u201d and directing Jackson to pursue her claim with the BCPD, as \u201cthe appropriate entity involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Finally, on June 5, 2001, one year after Wilbon\u2019s death, the attorney for Wilbon\u2019s estate mailed, by certified mail, and hand-delivered a \u201cNotice of Claim Form\u201d to the City Solicitor for Baltimore City. The document purported to give notice of a claim pursuant to section 5-304. It alleged that \u201c[t]he deceased was brutally and fatally injured by Baltimore City Police Officers during an alleged detention and arrest[.]\u201d On September 10,2001, the BCPD responded by letter that it was \u201cnot considering any settlement of [the] claim at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">C. Litigation of the Notice Issue in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Defendants challenged plaintiffs compliance with the notice requirement of the LGTCA on three separate occasions. First, on July 2, 2003, they filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for, among other things, failure to comply with the LGTCA. In the pleadings supporting this motion, defendants argued that, because the January 1, 2001 letter was sent more than 180 days after the alleged injury, it did not constitute actual or substantial compliance with the notice requirement. Furthermore, defendants argued against good cause to waive the notice requirement, because plaintiff had not \u201cpresented any facts to establish good cause for [her] failure to give timely notice.\u201d According to defendants, plaintiffs only explanation for the untimely notice was Jackson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, and \u201c[i]gnorance of the statutory notice requirement does not constitute good cause for failing to comply with the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">In her response, plaintiff argued that the letter of January 1, 2001, served on the Commissioner of the BCPD, constituted substantial compliance with the LGTCA, because it \u201ccomplie[d] in every respect with the requirements of notice (ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>cept for the person upon whom the notice is to be served).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Regarding the error of service on the Commissioner of the BCPD, rather than the City Solicitor, plaintiff argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">This notice was filed pro se. Any errors with regard to the person to be served (the City Solicitor) can be cured pursuant to the waiver of notice provisions in the LGTCA. <em>See, </em>\u00a7 5-304[ (d) ] of the LGTCA____In any event, notice served on the then-police commissioner served to put the police department on notice. It is unknown to Plaintiff ] whether such notice triggered an investigation, since no discovery has been completed in this case____ Plaintiff] substantially complied with the LGTCA in that notice was given to an authority in a position to investigate Plaintiff\u2019s] claims^</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Defendants filed a supplemental reply memorandum on September 10, 2003. Beyond repeating their earlier arguments, defendants argued that the June 9, 2000 Statement of Incident to the CRB also did not constitute substantial compliance with the notice requirement. Defendants explained that the CRB is an independent agency tasked with investigating complaints from the public regarding police misconduct. It is not an agency of the BCPD, so that, according to defendants, \u201cnotice to the CRB of a complaint is not notice to the BCPD of a claim for damages.\u201d Indeed, defendants noted that \u201cthe CRB\u2019s consideration of a complaint is focused solely on determining the facts of the occurrence and on reaching a recommendation as to whether and to what extent an officer should be disciplined for the acts alleged in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on September 26, 2003. At the hearing, defendants argued that plaintiff did not file a timely notice because the letters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>January 1, 2001, and June 5, 2001 fell beyond the 180-day deadline of section 5-304(b), and the \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d of June 9, 2000 was not a notice of claim and was not submitted to the proper authorities. Defendants\u2019 counsel argued that it would be inappropriate for the court to consider as grounds for substantial compliance or good cause that Jackson acted <em>pro se </em>when she submitted the \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d and the letter of January 1,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Focusing on the \u201cStatement of Incident,\u201d defendants\u2019 counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">You\u2019re trying to impute notice of a claim to the police department based on notice of an incident. If the police department has to investigate as a claim every complaint that\u2019s made to the CRB, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a lot of work. That\u2019s a lot of unnecessary work and that\u2019s an awfully large burden to put on the police department or any local government to say that these are a notice of a claim. When they get a notice of a claim, yes, they, at least they have the opportunity to investigate, but, but to say that if you just find out through other channels that something bad happened that somebody might sue you about and you\u2019re under, you\u2019ve got the burden of investigating that. I think that\u2019s too much of a burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Plaintiff responded that she substantially complied with the notice requirement when Jackson submitted the \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d on June 9, 2000. She asserted that Baltimore City surely was prepared for her claim, because Wilbon\u2019s death received media coverage, sparked public protests, and caused an internal investigation by BCPD. Plaintiffs counsel argued to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">In this case, Your Honor, on June 5th, the day of his death, three of the officers, two of whom are defendants, filed reports and listed as a questionable death. I mean, they\u2019re talking about it the day he dies. His mom is there four days later. She\u2019s there again because she\u2019s either been to the library or she\u2019s been somewhere and she knows now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>a notice of intention. This ... is the Christmas holiday. She\u2019s lost a son____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">I think we begin all of this, or there\u2019s a basic concept in our legal system that we try things on merit or we attempt to, and I respectfully submit that ... the City has received notice from so many different sources[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Plaintiffs counsel did not mention the necessity of good cause to waive the notice requirement except to state that Jackson was a \u201clay person\u201d who \u201cgoes to the people [and] says, my son died in your custody. Please investigate and tell me why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Relying on the federal case of <em>Downey v. Collins, </em>866 F.Supp. 887 (D.Md.1994), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">[T]he determination of the existence or nonexistence of prejudice [and] good cause for the purposes of the notice requirement have been clearly committed to the discretion of the court. A failure to notify does not mandate dismissal,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">I have not read <em>Mendelson [v. Brown, </em>371 Md. 154, 807 A.2d 632 (2002) ] but I have read <em>Moore [v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 807 A.2d 632 (2002) ] and I have read <em>Faulk [v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002) ] and I think under the circumstances in this case there has been substantial compliance. I do find that good cause has been shown by [] plaintiff. I think there\u2019s been substantial compliance in the showing by the plaintiff in the notice that was given. In <em>Faulk[,] </em>the statement is made that, ... the claimant substantially complies with Sections [ (b) ] and [(c)] ... where the claimant complies with their purpose furnishing the municipal body with sufficient information to permit it to make a timely investigation. I understand [defense counsel\u2019s] points, but I do find that there is good cause. I find that there is no prejudice at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">On October 8, 2003, the court issued an order denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Defendants again raised their notice challenge in motions for summary judgment, filed on November 24, 2004.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff filed a responsive pleading on January 7, 2005. The court, per a different judge than the one who denied the motion to dismiss, held a hearing on January 24, 2005. At the hearing, the parties disputed whether Jackson provided actual notice of the claim, and whether she substantially complied with the notice requirement of the LGTCA. There was no mention of whether good cause existed to waive the notice requirement. Ultimately, the court denied defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions, stating that \u201cthe issue of notice has already been ruled upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Defendants then raised the notice issue for the third time, after trial, in \u201cDefendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or Alternatively, Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, or Alternatively, Motion for New Trial,\u201d filed on May 16,2005. Defendants attached to their motion an affidavit of the assistant city solicitor who stated therein that she was assigned by the Office of the City Solicitor to attend the meetings of the CRB at all times relevant to plaintiff's claims, that she never received notice of plaintiffs claim, and that she had no duty to receive such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">As with defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, plaintiff responded that there was no new evidence to justify reconsideration of the notice issue. In her view, the court\u2019s prior rulings on the motion to dismiss and the motions for summary judgment constituted the law of the case. Nonetheless, plaintiff attached to her responsive pleading a transcript of a radio interview conducted with the Commissioner of the BCPD on September 7, 2000, and a newspaper article. During the interview, Wilbon\u2019s fianc\u00e9e telephoned the radio station and asked the Commissioner on the air how \u201cto make a complaint on the police officer when they are doing wrong.\u201d The Commissioner advised her to direct complaints to his \u201coffice.\u201d He stated that an investigation into Wilbon\u2019s death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>was \u201congoing,\u201d which limited his ability to talk about the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The court, per the trial judge, denied defendants\u2019 motion on August 11, 2005, noting that the notice issue had been twice reviewed and denied by the court. The court held that defendants\u2019 request to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and enter judgment in favor of defendants because of plaintiffs alleged failure to comply with the LGTCA was \u201cbeyond the scope of the trial court\u2019s authority under MD. RULE \u00a7 2-532.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Thus, although defendants raised the notice issue three times to three different circuit court judges, only the first judge, who decided the motion to dismiss, considered the notice requirement on its merits. Nevertheless, we will review the circuit court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motions as a whole, based upon the entire record developed below. Because the facts surrounding the notice issue are essentially undisputed, we will review the circuit court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>to determine if it was legally correct. <em>See Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 73, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">D. Strict Compliance with Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Plaintiff first argues that she strictly complied with the notice requirement when Jackson submitted the June 9, 2000 \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d to the CRB. Plaintiff is correct that the statement included information pertaining to the \u201ctime, place, and cause of the injury,\u201d as required by section 5-304(c)(3). However, the letter was not a claim for damages or a notice of intent to file suit. It only stated a complaint of police misconduct. In other words, Jackson\u2019s \u201cStatement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Incident\u201d was a notice of an occurrence involving alleged police brutality, not notice of tort claims arising out of that occurrence. <em>See White, </em>163 Md.App. at 147, 877 A.2d 1129 (stating that \u201c[t]he content of that complaint pertained to White\u2019s allegation of police brutality, not to tort claims arising from such conduct\u201d). Moreover, Jackson did not submit the statement to the City Solicitor, as required by section 5-304(c)(1)(i). This meant that plaintiff did not satisfy \u201ca condition precedent to maintaining an action against a local government or its employees____\u201d <em>Rios, </em>386 Md. at 127, 872 A.2d 1. Thus plaintiff did not strictly comply with the notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject plaintiffs argument that she strictly complied with the notice requirement because an assistant city solicitor was assigned as staff to the CRB, so that any notice to the CRB was notice to the City Solicitor. The CRB is not an agency of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City or the BCPD. It is an independent entity created by the General Assembly to advise the Police Commissioner on matters of police discipline arising from complaints of abusive language, harassment, and use of excessive force. <em>See </em>Pub. Local Laws of Md., Art. 4, \u00a7 16-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">In addition, the assistant city solicitor assigned to the CRB stated in her affidavit that she \u201c[did] not receive copies of the Complaints filed with the [CRB] and [she was] not involved in the review of Complaints.\u201d Her function on the CRB was \u201climited to providing legal advice requested by, and answering particular legal questions posed by, the [CRB].\u201d The assistant city solicitor did not \u201cserve as a repository or an agent, on behalf of the City of Baltimore, the [BCPD], or any of the [BCPD\u2019s] employees.\u201d The assistant city solicitor also noted that the complaints filed with the CRB are assigned a number, which is how the case is discussed and reviewed. As a result, if Jackson\u2019s complaint was discussed at a CRB meeting, the assistant city solicitor would not have known the names of the officers or persons involved in the incident. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Jackson\u2019s filing of a complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>with the CRB did not constitute notice to the City Solicitor under section 5 \u2014 304(c) (1) (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">E. Substantial Compliance with Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">1. January 1, 2001 \u201cNotice of Intent to File Suit\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Plaintiff argued in the circuit court that Jackson\u2019s January 1, 2001 \u201cNotice of Intent to File Suit\u201d constituted substantial compliance with the notice requirement under the LGTCA. This letter did constitute a notice of claim, but Jackson sent it to the Commissioner of the BCPD, not to the City Solicitor. More problematic for plaintiff, however, is that Jackson sent this letter between a month and six weeks beyond the 180-day statutory period. Substantial compliance requires \u201c \u2018requisite and <em>timely </em>notice of facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faulk v. Ewing, </em>371 Md. 284, 299, 808 A.2d 1262 (2002) (citations omitted)(emphasis added). As defendants correctly write in their brief, although \u201ca claimant may comply substantially with a notice requirement by giving notice to a person not specified in the statute or by regular rather than certified mail, the courts have not held that a claimant may submit the notice beyond the time for giving such notice.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">2. June 9,2000 \u201cStatement of Incident\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Alternatively, plaintiff argues that Jackson\u2019s \u201cStatement of Incident,\u201d submitted to the CRB within the 180-day statutory period, constituted substantial compliance. The circuit court first considered this argument on September 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>2003. Almost two years later, this Court issued <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 877 A.2d 1129, which soundly rejected a similar argument of substantial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>White </em>concerned a claim of police brutality against Prince George\u2019s County and four of its officers. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 877 A.2d 1129. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to provide the requisite notice under the LGTCA. <em>Id. </em>The trial court accepted the defendants\u2019 argument and dismissed the complaint, prompting the claimant to appeal to our Court. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 877 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">As in this case, the claimant argued on appeal that he had substantially complied with the LGTCA because, within 180 days of the alleged police brutality, he submitted a written complaint of excessive force to the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 877 A.2d 1129. The police department began an investigation of the complaint and met twice with the claimant during the 180-day statutory period. <em>Id. </em>Proper notice was not given until approximately two years after the incident in question. <em>See id. </em>at 138, 877 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq\">This Court rejected the claimant\u2019s argument. We reasoned: [Ajppellant did not provide notice to an entity with responsibility for investigating tort claims lodged against the County. Instead, appellant sent notice to the Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Division [\u201cI.A.D.\u201d]. The content of that complaint pertained to White\u2019s allegation of police brutality, not to tort claims arising from such conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Moreover, the investigation that ensued was conducted by and for I.A.D., under a wholly separate procedure. Indeed, as the Department\u2019s letter of July 18, 2001 reflects, the Department indicated that appellant\u2019s brutality claim was governed by the statute pertaining to the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.... Notice to I.A.D. simply was not notice to the County Attorney or County Solicitor, as required by C.J. \u00a7 5-304(b)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 147, 877 A.2d 1129 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In reaching our decision, we distinguished the circumstances of <em>White </em>from those in <em>Moore v. Norouzi, </em>371 Md. 154, 807 A.2d 632 (2002), whsich involved two separate claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tort damages against employees of Montgomery County, arising from car accidents. The claimants in <em>Moore </em>did not give notice of their claims as prescribed by the LGTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 807 A.2d 632. However, they did give notice of their claims to the county\u2019s claims administrator, Trigon, which was a private company that had contracted with the county to administer all torts claims. <em>Id. </em>at 163-65, 807 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the claimants had substantially complied with the LGTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 807 A.2d 632. Instrumental to the Court\u2019s decision was Trigon\u2019s contractual relationship with the county, which gave the county a high degree of control over Trigon\u2019s activities and gave Trigon extensive powers (1) to investigate, appraise, and adjust all claims, (2) to settle claims of $2,500.00 or less, and (3) to access directly the county\u2019s risk management information system. <em>See id. </em>at 176-77, 807 A.2d 632. The Court concluded that the contractual relationship, \u201cits comprehensiveness and the degree of control that the County maintains,\u201d meant \u201cthat actual notice to the County results when notice is given to Trigon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 807 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Consequently, where the tort claimant provides the local government, through the unit or division with the responsibility for investigating tort claims against that local government, or the company with whom the local government or unit has contracted for that function, the information required by \u00a7 5-304[ (c) ](3) to be supplied, who thus acquires actual knowledge within the statutory period, the tort claimant has substantially complied with the notice provisions of the LGTCA. This test is fair and has the advantage of taking account of the reality of how tort claims actually are handled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 178, 807 A.2d 632.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">This Court in <em>White </em>noted that <em>Moore </em>stood for the proposition that \u201csubstantial compliance may be found when notice is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>provided to the entity responsible for investigating the tort claim, rather than to the party named in the statute.\u201d 163 Md.App. at 147, 877 A.2d 1129. In <em>White, </em>however, the claimant gave notice of his claim to the internal affairs division of the local police department, and there was \u201cno indication of a relationship between I.A.D. and the County Attorney or County Solicitor, akin to the working relationship between Montgomery County and Trigon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 877 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">We wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">To the contrary, there was no evidence that the Department actually communicated with the County Attorney or County Solicitor, so as to apprise the County of its potential liability and enable it to conduct a thorough investigation while memories were still fresh. Moreover, unlike in <em>Moore, </em>the Department was not charged with the duty to investigate tort claims against the County, nor did the Department construe appellant\u2019s complaint of police brutality as a tort claim against the County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 877 A.2d 1129; <em>see also Bibum, </em>85 F.Supp.2d at 565 (holding that claimant did not substantially comply with the LGTCA when he sent an excessive force complaint to the local police department, but did not send notice of a tort claim to the county attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>we, unlike the circuit court, have the guidance of <em>White </em>to determine whether plaintiff substantially complied with the notice requirement. We find that the facts of this case are virtually indistinguishable from the facts in <em>White. </em>Within the statutory notice period, Jackson filed a complaint of alleged police misconduct. As in <em>White, </em>\u201c[t]he content of [the] complaint pertained to [an] allegation of police brutality, not to tort claims arising from such conduct.\u201d 163 Md.App. at 147, 877 A.2d 1129. More importantly, Jackson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>did not provide notice of her claim \u201cto an entity with responsibility for investigating tort claims lodged against the County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As previously stated, the CRB is not an agency of the City of Baltimore or the BCPD and is charged with the responsibility of advising the Police Commissioner regarding matters of police discipline arising out of alleged misconduct. The assistant city solicitor assigned as staff to the CRB is not an agent of the City or the BCPD authorized to receive notice of tort claims and, in fact, has never received any such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Finally, as in <em>White, </em>Jackson\u2019s complaint prompted an investigation that was vastly different from an investigation of a tort claim for damages. The BCPD conducted a dual-natured investigation, involving both the Homicide Unit and the IID. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a crime had been committed and whether the officers had violated departmental rules and standards of behavior. By contrast, an investigation into a tort claim for damages involves different issues, including, among other things, legal defenses, the nature and extent of the actual injuries sustained, the causal relationship of the injuries to the alleged misconduct, the likelihood of an award of compensatory and/or punitive damages, the necessity and cost of expert testimony, and litigation strategy. Therefore, as defendants properly state in their brief, \u201c[j]ust as the investigation in <em>White </em>did not suffice as a claim investigation, the investigation in the present case did not fulfill all of the purposes of the LGTCA\u2019s notice requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We recognize that the IID of the BCPD responded to the complaint with an investigation, and the case received significant media attention. Moreover, we are aware that three months after Wilbon\u2019s death, the Commissioner of the BCPD indicated that he was familiar with the case and recognized that it might lead to a lawsuit. Internal investigations and media attention, however, do not mean, necessarily, that a complainant will sue the police officers involved for tort damages. Not every excessive force complaint develops into a civil action. Indeed, in his radio interview, the Commissioner recognized only the <em>possibility </em>of a future lawsuit. It would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>a totally unreasonable burden to require a local police department or other governmental agency to conduct a tort claim investigation on every complaint of police misconduct because of the mere possibility that the complainant may file a lawsuit for tort damages based on that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that Jackson\u2019s complaint to the CRB did not substantially comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">F. Good Cause to Waive Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Without plaintiff having strictly or substantially complied with the notice requirement of the LGTCA, her case could proceed only if good cause existed to waive that requirement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-304(d). The circuit court ruled that good cause existed, and we must review that decision to determine whether the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Whether good cause exists is a discretionary matter for the trial court. We have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">The discretion with which all courts determine whether good cause has or has not been shown is broad. It involves the exercise of one of the most important judicial functions. A ruling made in the exercise of that discretion is entitled to the utmost respect. It should not be overturned by an appellate court unless there is a clear showing that the discretion has been abused \u2014 that the result falls outside its broad limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"><em>Madore v. Baltimore County, </em>34 Md.App. 340, 346, 367 A.2d 54 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Good cause exists when a claimant prosecutes a claim \u201cwith that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Heron v. Strader, </em>361 Md. 258, 271, 761 A.2d 56 (2000) (citation omitted). We noted in <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. 129, 877 A.2d 1129, that courts have considered the following factors that generally have been found to constitute good cause: \u201c \u2018[1] excusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>serious physical or mental injury and/or location out-of-state, [3] the inability to retain counsel in cases involving complex litigation, ... [4] ignorance of the statutory notice requirement[,]\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or (5) misleading representations made by representative of the local government. 163 Md.App. at 152, 877 A.2d 1129 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court gave no reasons for its ruling that good cause existed to justify waiving the notice requirement. The court stated: \u201cI do find that good cause has been shown by the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Consequently, we shall review the record to ascertain what basis, if any, exists for such determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">There is no evidence in the record (1) that Jackson suffered from a physical or mental condition that impaired her ability to give timely notice of the claim, (2) that Jackson did not know about the statutory notice requirement, or (3) that misleading representations were made by a representative of Baltimore City. In addition, the record shows that Jackson consulted with an attorney less than a month after Wilbon\u2019s death. In the memorandum of law in support of her opposition to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, plaintiff stated in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">On June 27, 2000, Ms. Jackson sought the counsel of a local Baltimore attorney who requested a copy of the 911 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>plaint and KGA Tape from both the Baltimore City Police . Communications Division and the Central Records Department. It is not clear from the record whether the Baltimore attorney ever contracted to represent Ms. Jackson in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Therefore, the only recognized factor remaining to support the trial court\u2019s finding of good cause is \u201cexcusable neglect or mistake (generally determined in reference to a reasonably prudent person standard).\u201d <em>White, </em>163 Md.App. at 152, 877 A.2d 1129 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>White, </em>the claimant asserted that he had good cause to waive the notice requirement, because he filed a complaint with the police department and an internal affairs officer advised him to take no action while the matter was being investigated. 163 Md.App. at 137, 877 A.2d 1129. The claimant also stated that the same officer visited him and assured him that the matter was being investigated. <em>Id. </em>The trial court rejected the claimant\u2019s argument, finding that good cause did not exist. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 877 A.2d 1129. The court reasoned that even though he relied on the officer\u2019s advice, the claimant offered no evidence of any communication with that officer or of an ongoing police investigation. <em>Id. </em>Because the notice was not given until approximately two years after the incident, the court concluded that \u201can \u2018ordinarily prudent person\u2019 would have, and should have, done more to ensure that his action was proceeding in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">On appeal, we concluded that there was no abuse of discretion because, even if the internal affairs officer told the claimant to take no action during the course of the police investigation, \u201cit may have been reasonable for appellant to delay any action for a period of months, but not years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 877 A.2d 1129. The claimant\u2019s \u201cinaction did not amount to the requisite diligence of any ordinarily prudent person.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Plaintiff argues that the facts of the instant case are sufficiently distinguishable from those in <em>White </em>to justify the court\u2019s finding of good cause. First, plaintiff claims that here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>there was \u201cactual notice to the properly designated city representative,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the assistant city solicitor assigned as staff to the CRB. As previously stated, that argument is without merit. Second, plaintiff asserts that in <em>White </em>there was a factual dispute regarding whether the internal affairs officer told the claimant not to take any action while the police investigation on his complaint was taking place. Thus, according to plaintiff, in <em>White, </em>\u201ca material portion of the [claimant\u2019s] good cause basis for not providing actual notice was contested.\u201d Plaintiff, however, overlooks the fact that in <em>White </em>both the circuit court and this Court assumed, for the purpose of analyzing the good cause issue, that the internal affairs officer had told the claimant not to take any action during the police investigation. <em>See White, </em>168 Md.App. at 138, 157-58, 877 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Lastly, plaintiff claims that <em>White </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because in <em>White </em>the claimant \u201coffered no evidence of an ongoing police investigation that would warrant excusing his lack of diligence,\u201d while here there was ample evidence of an ongoing investigation of Jackson\u2019s complaint. Plaintiff states in her brief: \u201cUnlike the <em>White </em>case, the plaintiff[ ] in this case had been assured by the Deputy Police Commissioner, the City Counsel, and the Police Commissioner that an investigation was going forward. This investigation was being pursued by the Police Commissioner with the knowledge of a potential lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Contrary to plaintiff\u2019s argument, the circuit court in <em>White </em>did not base its finding of no good cause <em>solely </em>on a lack of evidence of an ongoing police investigation. 163 Md.App. at 138, 877 A.2d 1129. The court suggested that the advice of the internal affairs officer not to take any action during the investigation, coupled with evidence of an ongoing police investigation, \u201cwould warrant excusing his lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We observe that there was no such advice given to the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The bottom line in the case <em>sub judice </em>is that, within four days after Wilbon\u2019s death, Jackson filed a complaint of alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>police misconduct with the CRB and, within a month after his death, Jackson sought the advice of a local attorney. No other action was taken by Jackson, or anyone else on behalf of Wilbon\u2019s survivors or estate,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> until four to six weeks after the expiration of the 180 day statutory period, when Jackson submitted written notice of a tort claim to the police commissioner (instead of to the City Solicitor, as required by Section 5-304(c)(1)(i)).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In other words, nothing was done to advance any tort claim arising out of Wilbon\u2019s death for over six months after Jackson consulted with an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The only \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d for this inaction suggested by plaintiff is the ongoing police investigation of the alleged misconduct of the officers involved.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Moore, </em>the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>We have stated that the purpose of the LGTCA is to have the claimant furnish the municipal body with sufficient information to permit it to make an investigation in due time sufficient to ascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it. When that purpose has been achieved, we have already held, substantial compliance with the statute is the result. <em>The same acts and conduct that establishes that the purpose of the statute has been satisfied may also constitute a waiver of notice or create an estoppel.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 179-80, 807 A.2d 632 (citations and quotations omitted)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">As we stated in <em>White, </em>and have reiterated here, an investigation by a police department of a complaint of misconduct by one or more of its officers is simply not the same as an investigation of alleged tort claims arising from such conduct. Consequently, an investigation of police misconduct will not furnish the local government with sufficient information to \u201cascertain the character and extent of the injury and its responsibility in connection with it\u201d and thus will not achieve the purpose of the LGTCA. <em>Moore, </em>371 Md. at 180, 807 A.2d 632. Accordingly, the presence of an ongoing police investigation into Jackson\u2019s complaint of police wrongdoing cannot constitute \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d for failing to comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Finally, plaintiff contends that Jackson\u2019s notice of claim, dated January 1, 2001, which was sent four to six weeks after the expiration of the 180-day period, exhibited diligence of an ordinarily prudent person in pursuing a tort claim. Plaintiff has not cited to any cases in support of the proposition that notice of a tort claim sent shortly after the expiration of the 180 day period constitutes good cause to justify a waiver of the notice requirement. Indeed, the concept of diligence of an ordinarily prudent person must relate to actions taken during the 180-day period, not afterwards. Notice of a tort claim sent shortly after the expiration of the 180-day period, without sufficient explanation as to why such notice could not have been given within 180 days, cannot support a finding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>requisite diligence of an ordinarily prudent person. Here, no explanation, much less a sufficient explanation, was given as to why Jackson\u2019s January 1, 2001 notice of claim could not have been given on or before December 2, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We are mindful of the broad discretion accorded to trial judges in the determination of whether good cause exists to waive the notice requirement under the LGTCA. We also recognize that almost all of the appellate decisions in Maryland on the issue of good cause have held that the trial judge did not abuse his or her discretion. Nevertheless, under the circumstances of this case, where Jackson filed a complaint of alleged police misconduct with the CRB within four days of Wilbon\u2019s death, but failed to give notice to the City Solicitor of a tort claim arising out of that misconduct within 180 days and did not provide a sufficient explanation for such failure, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s finding of good cause under the LGTCA falls outside of the broad limits of a trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Therefore, we conclude that plaintiff failed to comply with the notice requirement of the LGTCA, either strictly or substantially, and that the trial court abused its discretion in finding good cause to waive the notice requirement. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLEES ON ALL COUNTS OF APPELLANT\u2019S COMPLAINT.

Did the lower court err in ruling that [] [pjlaintiff demonstrated that there was good cause for the lack of proper notice, when [] [pjlaintiff submitted no evidence to show good cause, and in ruling that there was no prejudice to the defendants, when there had been no prior showing of good cause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">3. Did the lower court err in awarding multiple satisfactions for a single injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">4. Did the lower court correctly enter judgment in favor of the officers as to the claims for negligence and wrongful death, when the officers were immune from liability, when [] [pjlaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence of causation, of a wrongful act or of a risk of foreseeable harm, and when the decedent assumed the risks associated with cocaine use or was guilty of contributory negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">5. Did the lower court properly limit the testimony of [] [pjlaintiff\u2019s expert, Dr. Micozzi, to the area of expertise in which the witness had been qualified to testify, especially when there was no prejudice to [ ] [pjlaintiff?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\">.

Actually, Jackson submitted her statement to the \u201cComplaint Evaluation Board,\u201d the predecessor to the Civilian Review Board.

Initially, plaintiff also argued that the LGTCA did not apply to Baltimore City police officers, because these officials were \"agents and employees of the State of Maryland.\" She has since abandoned this argument. <em>See Baltimore Police Dep't v.

We express no opinion on the correctness of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of its authority under Md. Rule 2-532.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\">. The closest Maryland case on this issue that we are able to identify is <em>Grubbs v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>267 Md. 318, 297 A.2d 754 (1972). In <em>Grubbs, </em>notice was sent by registered mail on the 180th day and received by the proper recipient the next day. <em>Id. </em>at 319-20, 297 A.2d 754. The Court of Appeals held that there was substantial compliance with the notice requirement, but based its holding on a construction of the statute that notice by registered mail means mailing \"on or before the one-hundred-eightieth day without regard ... to whether receipt occurs before or after the expiration of one hundred eighty days following injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 297 A.2d 754. Thus <em>Grubbs </em>is factually and legally inapposite to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\">. <em>Moore </em>overruled <em>Loewinger v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>266 Md. 316, 292 A.2d 67 (1972), in which the Court of Appeals held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>claimant did not substantially comply with the notice provision even though, within the 180-day period, (1) county employees knew of the alleged injuries, investigated the injuries, and spoke with the claimant, and (2) the claimant submitted a written notice of claim to the county\u2019s insurance company. <em>See id. </em>at 317, 292 A.2d 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\">. Judge Hollander, writing for this Court in <em>White, </em>pointed out that the Court of Appeals has not decided whether ignorance of the law may constitute good cause for noncompliance with the notice provision. <em>See White, </em>163 Md.App. at 157, 877 A.2d 1129. In <em>Williams v. Montgomery County, </em>123 Md.App. 119, 134, 716 A.2d 1100 (1998), this Court specifically rejected ignorance of the statutory notice requirement as good cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\">. It is evident from our review of the pleadings and the hearing transcripts that the parties and the court focused on the issue of whether plaintiff substantially complied with the notice requirement. In other words, the good cause issue did not command the center of their attention. Nevertheless, because we disagree with the court\u2019s decision on substantial compliance under the teachings of <em>White, </em>our focus must be on the evidentiary underpinning for the court's determination of good cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">. Defendants do not challenge the standing of Jackson as \"the claimant or the representative of the claimant\u201d under Section 5-304(c), even though she is not named as a plaintiff in this action.

In her brief, plaintiff asserts that she sent the January 1, 2001 notice of claim to Police Commissioner Ed Norris, because he had advised Wilbon\u2019s fiancee to do so in his radio interview. Plaintiff, however, overlooks the fact that Commissioner Norris advised Wilbon\u2019s fianc\u00e9e to send a complaint to his office in response to her question: \"[W]hat do normal people do if <em>they want to make a complaint on the police officer when they are doing wrong.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Nothing in the question suggests that Wilbon\u2019s fianc\u00e9e wanted to know where to send a notice that she, or anyone else, intended to file a tort claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">. Plaintiff also asserts \"excusable neglect\u201d justifying a finding of good cause, because, according to her, Baltimore City was actually aware of her tort claim from June of 2000. Specifically, on September 10, 2001, Jackson received a letter at her home address from BCPD\u2019s legal counsel, which stated that the BCPD was not considering settlement of her claim \u201cat this time.\u201d According to plaintiff, Jackson\u2019s home address was provided to the City only in her June 9, 2000 Statement of Incident to the CRB, and thus the City was actually aware of her claim from the Statement of Incident. This argument is without merit, because there is no evidence in the record of how and when, if at all, the Statement of Incident came into the possession of BCPD\u2019s legal counsel. The September 10, 2001 letter was over nine months after the expiration of the 180-day period and over three months after notice of plaintiff's tort claim was given to the City Solicitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
