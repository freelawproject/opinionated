At a retrial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Scrivener, J.), held on December 13-17 and 20-21, 2004, he was convicted of first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense and two counts of third-degree sexual offense. On February 17, 2005, Baby was sentenced to a term of fifteen years imprisonment, with all but five years suspended and five years probation upon his release. From the convictions and sentences, appellant files this appeal presenting the following three issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">I. Whether the circuit court erred by refusing appellant\u2019s request to instruct the jury that it should return a verdict of not guilty of rape if it was persuaded by the evidence that the complaining witness consented to sexual intercourse, but withdrew her consent after penetration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">II. Whether the circuit court erred by denying appellant\u2019s request to remove a juror who indicated that he had read a newspaper article about the case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">III. Wfiiether the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude expert testimony in reference to \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">For the reasons set forth, <em>infra, </em>we shall reverse the judgments of conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">At trial, the complaining witness, J.L., testified that, at the time of the incident at issue, she was an eighteen-year-old student at Montgomery College. On the night of December 13, 2003, accompanied by her best friend, Lacey, she went to the McDonald\u2019s Restaurant located in Montgomery Village. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Appellant, Lacey\u2019s younger brother and her boyfriend at the time were all friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">When J.L. and Lacey were about to leave, appellant, who was sixteen years old at the time, prevailed upon J.L. to give him and a friend, Mike, a ride in her Chevrolet Cavalier, which she had owned for approximately seven months. Mike and another person identified as a \u201cHispanic boy\u201d were passengers in the back seat of the car. When the group arrived at its destination, a community center believed by them to be the site of a party, they discovered there was no party. The Hispanic boy alighted from the vehicle and left the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">During the return trip to McDonald\u2019s Restaurant, the complainant complied with appellant\u2019s request to park briefly near an apartment complex, thereafter proceeding back to the restaurant. The complainant complied with appellant\u2019s second request to stop at another location in a townhouse development near the McDonald\u2019s Restaurant, where all of the passengers alighted from J.L.\u2019s car and proceeded toward a clearing between two townhouses. As appellant and Mike smoked marijuana, they discussed the possibility of getting a hotel room, noting that the boys were too young, but the girls could get a room.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Upon their arrival at McDonald\u2019s, Lacey left the group to join a friend, after which the complainant agreed to drive appellant and Mike to a residential neighborhood where she parked her car. The complainant complied with the request of appellant and Mike to sit between them on the back seat of her car. Mike put her hand down in his pants and asked her \u201cto lick it.\u201d Appellant then asked her to expose her breasts; when she did not comply, he fondled her breast with his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">After J.L. acquiesced to the boys\u2019 insistence that they stay ten more minutes, she found herself on her back with appellant removing her jeans and Mike sitting on her chest, attempting to place his penis in her mouth. After she told them to stop, the pair moved her around so that her body was up in appellant\u2019s lap as he held her arms and Mike tried to insert his penis in her, but briefly inserted it into her rectum by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>mistake. After Mike again tried to insert his penis in the complainant\u2019s vagina, appellant inserted his Angers in her vagina. After appellant exited the car, Mike inserted his Angers, then his penis into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Mike then got out of the car and appellant got in. Appellant told J.L. that it was his turn and, according to the complainant, the following transpired:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Q. [ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And what else did he say?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">A. He, after that we sat there for a couple seconds and he was like so are you going to let me hit it and I didn\u2019t really say anything and he was like I don\u2019t want to rape you.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Q. So when [appellant] said I don\u2019t want to rape you, did you respond?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">A. Yes. I said that as long as he stops when I tell him to, then\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Q. Now, that he could?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Q. Did you feel like you had a choice?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">A. Not really. I don\u2019t know. Something just clicked off and I just did whatever they said.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Q. Now when you told [appellant] if I say stop, something like that, you have to stop. What did he do after you spoke those words?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">A. Well he got on top of me and he tried to put it in and it hurt. So I said stop and that\u2019s when he kept pushing it in and I was pushing his knees to get off me.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">Q. You were on your back and he was on top of you?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">Q. Did he stop pushing his penis into your vagina?</p>\n<p id=\"b617-19\">A. Not right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Q. About how long did he continue to put his penis into your vagina?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">A. About five or so seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Q. And then what happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">A. And that\u2019s when he just got off me and that\u2019s when Mike got in the car....</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">J.L. testified that appellant continued for five or ten seconds, but she did not believe that he had ejaculated. She testified that, as the trio proceeded back to McDonald\u2019s, appellant asked her to \u201cjack him off,\u201d but, although she refused, she did give him her telephone number. After obtaining Lacey\u2019s cell telephone number from appellant, J.L. called her and said she was okay and would be there (at McDonald\u2019s) in a couple of seconds. Mike parked the car across the street from McDonald\u2019s and hugged J.L. before he and appellant departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Thereafter, the complainant drove Lacey to Shoppers Food Warehouse, where they met J.L.\u2019s mother and then proceeded to Lacey\u2019s house after helping J.L.\u2019s mother to shop. Upon arriving at Lacey\u2019s house, the complainant responded in the negative to inquiries about what was wrong from Lacey\u2019s brother, but related what had happened to Lacey\u2019s mother. After the police were called, J.L. went to the hospital to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Testifying on behalf of the State was Boston College Professor of Nursing Ann Burgess, whose expert testimony was offered to explicate to the jury the rape trauma syndrome, a condition associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. Appellant had filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The following hypothetical was presented to Burgess by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">Here\u2019s the hypothetical. Please, Doctor, assume that you have a young woman who was socializing with her best friend and she met two male acquaintances through other social contacts and she thought both of these people were harmless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Assume now that she found herself alone in a parked car with these two young men. Assume please that she was tricked into going into the backseat of the car, supposedly to have a conversation, look at a book or a magazine. However, assume that instead of having that conversation, the two men grabbed her, held her down and forced her to submit to multiple sexual acts, including sexual intercourse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Dr. Burgess attributed complainant\u2019s failure to resist and failure to immediately report the incident and giving her home telephone number to her assailant to behavior consistent with the rape trauma syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Lacie S. testified that she and J.L. dismissed the suggestion by appellant and Mike that they get a hotel room as \u201cnormal teen talk\u201d and that J.L. had said that she told them to stop and they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Forensic nurse examiner Tracey Eichelberger testified that her examination of the complainant on the morning after the alleged rape revealed a small laceration in the vaginal and in the anal area. Dr. Julia Lojoie, upon examination of medical photographs, described one of the lacerations as a centimeter long and the other as one and one half centimeters. Karolyn Tomarksky found no semen or sperm on vaginal and anal swabs taken from the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellant\u2019s testimony, although at variance in material respects from that of complainant, was surprisingly consistent. He was sixteen years old and a student in the eleventh grade at the time of the incident. The complainant agreed to drive appellant, Mike and a Spanish boy to a party. After the Spanish boy left them, they discovered there was no party. On their return trip, the complainant parked her car in a residential neighborhood and they all got out. Appellant and Mike smoked marijuana and suggested getting a hotel room, given that the girls were old enough to rent a room. When they began discussing sex, appellant produced three condoms. Lacey told the others that she did not want to accompany them.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>After driving Lacey back to the McDonald\u2019s Restaurant, the complainant drove to a residential area and parked her car. J.L. climbed into the back seat between appellant and Mike, whereupon the latter put the complainant\u2019s hand in his pants. After the complainant refused appellant\u2019s request to expose her breasts, Mike asked appellant for a condom and told him to get out of the car. After waiting outside of the car for approximately fifteen or twenty minutes, Mike emerged from the car and said that he \u201cjust hit that,\u201d an expression connoting that he had had sex with the complainant. Appellant then related his version of what occurred when he entered the complainant\u2019s car:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Q. When you got in the car, what, if anything, did you say or do?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">A. I asked her if she was going to let me have sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Q. What exactly did you say?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">A. I said, \u201cAre you going to let me hit that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Q. And what does that mean to you, \u201cCan I hit that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">A. Have sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">Q. What, if anything, did she say?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">A She said yes, as long as I stop when she says to. And then I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to rape you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">Q. Did you feel that was permission?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">A. Yeah, I thought that that was permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">Q. Why did you say \u201cI don\u2019t want to rape you\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">A. Just to, because she said, \u201cStop when I say to,\u201d just to tell her that. It\u2019s kind of like to confirm the permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">Appellant took out a condom and put it on. J.L. laid down on the back seat. Appellant placed himself between her legs and tried to put his penis in. He testified that the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">Q. What did you do with your penis?</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">A. I tried to put it in.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">Q. Do you know where it was touching or what happened to it?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>A. No. After I tried to put it in once, it wouldn\u2019t go in. I didn\u2019t feel nothing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Q. What happened? What did she say or do?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">A. And then she sat up. She was like, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go in,\u201d and that\u2019s when, after she sat up and said \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go in,\u201d that\u2019s when I took off the condom and I put it in my pocket and then knocked on the window for Michael to come in.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Q. Who said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to go in?\u201d You or her?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">A. She did.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Q. When she sat up, what did that mean to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">A. That meant stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Q. Did she say \u201cStop\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">A. No, she didn\u2019t. She just sat up.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Q. And you took that to mean stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">A. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Q. When she sat up, did you try to put it in again?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">A. No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">According to appellant, he stopped immediately and never ejaculated when the complainant sat up.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">According to appellant, after Mike drove J.L.\u2019s car back to McDonald\u2019 s, she gave appellant her telephone number and hugged Mike as she got out of the car. Thereafter, J.L. and Lacey drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows regarding evidence of \u201cconsent\u201d to negate a charge of sexual assault and the force required to sustain a conviction for rape:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-20\">The amount of force necessary depends upon the circumstances, and no particular amount of force is required but it must be sufficient to overcome the resistance of the victim. You must be satisfied that the victim either resisted and that this resistance was overcome by force or threat of force or that the victim was prevented from resisting by force or threat of force. The victim must have resisted to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of her ability at the time unless her resistance or will to resist was overcome by force or fear that was reasonable under the circumstances. Finally, \u201cconsent\u201d means actually agreeing to the sexual act rather than merely submitting as a result of force or threat of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">After the jury began its deliberations, it submitted two notes which read, \u201cWe\u2019re not close but would like to stay\u201d and \u201cCan we have until 10:30?\u201d Shortly thereafter, a third note was read into the record: \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind and the,\u201d I think it is, \u201cman continues until climax, does the result constitute rape?\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the court should respond in the negative whereupon the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes. To me, the clear answer, the unequivocal answer to this question is no. Why? Because they ask, \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented \u2014 \u201d That means that the woman consented to the penetration. She consented to the penis going into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The State argued that any slight intrusion into the vagina is rape. Here, this woman in the note consented to sex and allowed a penis to go into her vagina. This is during the sex act. During the sex act, the man ejaculates, but the penis is inside of her when you read the note. To me, the clear answer to this question is no because she consented to the male penetration. It is in her by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">THE COURT: Let me say this. That is what you are assuming this note means, but I don\u2019t know that that is what it means. That is the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, it says\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 she consents to sex initially\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">THE COURT: What does that mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 and during the course of the sex act, she changes her mind, which means she is having sex\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">THE COURT: That is what you think it means, but I don\u2019t know that that is what it means\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">THE COURT: \u2014 that is the problem. I am going to have to, I think, respond that I am unable to answer their question as posed and that they should reread the instructions as to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: The elements, read the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 as to the element of each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, and \u201cconsent,\u201d Your Honor, is specifically defined in that instruction. It means actually agreeing rather than merely submitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">THE COURT: To an extent, it is almost like it is a factual question that they want us to answer for them. It is really a factual question as opposed to a legal question, it seems to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">All right. How is this: \u201cI am unable to answer this question as posed. Please reread the instructions as to each element and apply the law to the facts as you find them\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Judge, it seems to me the note indicates that the female in the note consented to penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">THE COURT: I hear you, but I don\u2019t think that is an absolute. I don\u2019t think you can necessarily know what they mean by that note. That is the problem. They have to decide the facts, apply the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Another note was submitted on the following morning which read, \u201cIf at any time, the woman says stop, is that rape?\u201d In response to the request of appellant\u2019s counsel to give \u201cthe exact answer that you gave to the note last night,\u201d the court said, \u201cRight. This is the same question in simplest or at least a variation of the same question.\u201d It then instructed the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u201cThis is a question that you as jury must decide. I have given the legal definition of rape which includes the definition of consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AEA\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Appellant initially contends that the trial court erred by refusing to answer the questions submitted by the jury regarding whether a sex act initially engaged in with the consent of the prosecutrix constitutes rape if the defendant continues after the victim changes her mind. Citing <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 683-85, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980), Maiyland law, he asserts, holds that rape does not occur under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The State counters that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">... the jury question was ambiguous and trial court properly exercised its discretion in not hazarding its own interpretation of the inquiry, and referring the jurors to the instructions they had already been given. Moreover, even if the question had clearly asked whether a man is guilty of rape if the woman withdraws consent after vaginal penetration has taken place, there is no Maryland authority holding that consent cannot be withdrawn after penetration. On the contrary, a person may be convicted of rape if consent is withdrawn after the initial penetration but intercourse continues by force or threat of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">The State thus concludes that the court\u2019s instructions to the jury that \u201crape is the unlawful intercourse with another by force, or threat of force, and without consent, were therefore entirely proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">In initially arguing that the question posed by the jury was ambiguous, the State relies on the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Battle, supra. </em>There, the question posed by the jury was, \u201cWhen a possible consensual relationship becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>non-consensual for some reason, <em>during the course of the action </em>can the act then be considered rape?\u201d Battle\u2019s counsel believed \u201cduring the course of the action\u201d referred to \u201cduring coitus,\u201d whereas the prosecutor was of the mind that the phrase referred to \u201ca whole chain of events\u201d or after the parties \u201cgot in the bedroom or maybe after they had sex.\u201d The trial judge, uncertain as to its meaning, nevertheless understood the jury\u2019s inquiry to be \u201cWhere the original act of sex is by consent whether it is then possible the circumstances could change because of victim\u2019s lack of consent after the original situation began as a consensual one.\u201d The court\u2019s response, in <em>Battle, </em>was \u201cYes, that it is possible for a situation to start out as consensual then become a non-consensual one in the course of the event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 414 A.2d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"AGO\">In reversing the trial court, the <em>Battle </em>Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">It is next urged by the defendant that the trial court committed reversible error in not charging the jury that in the commission of a rape, consent may not be withdrawn during the act of intercourse. The Court fully and correctly charged all of the elements constituting the crime of rape. The jury was further instructed that consent could be withdrawn at any stage \u201cduring the preparatory acts.\u201d The general rule may be summarized as follows: Consent must precede the penetration. Burdick, The Law of Crime, Vol. 2 s 484, at p. 235. <em>See </em>44 Am.Jur., \u201cRape,\u201d s 8, p. 906; 52 C.J., s 26, p. 1017, and <em>State v. McCaffrey, </em>63 Iowa 479, 19 N.W. 331 (1884). <em>(Id. </em>at 435-36, 67 A.2d at 180.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">In <em>State v. Allen, </em>163 Kan. 374, 183 P.2d 458 (1947), the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">Appellant argues the evidence failed to disclose force was employed. It will serve no useful purpose to narrate the detailed facts of the episode. It may be conceded, as contended by appellant, the episode started in what appellant has seen fit to denominate a mutually desirable \u201cpetting party.\u201d It also frankly should be stated the woman admitted that at one time during the episode she contemplated sexual intercourse. The trouble is, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>evidence also discloses that it ceased to be a mutually desirable affair, the woman resisted and thereafter appellant resorted to force. The reason, or reasons, for her change of mind are not controlling. The fact she did change her mind, so advised appellant, and thereafter resisted his efforts is controlling. There was ample evidence on the subject of force to make that distinctly a jury question. <em>(Id. </em>at 375-76, 183 P.2d at 460.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">(1) Given the fact that consent must precede penetration, it follows in our view that although a woman may have consented to a sexual encounter, even to intercourse, if that consent is withdrawn prior to the act of penetration, then it cannot be said that she has consented to sexual intercourse. On the other hand, ordinarily if she consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">The question and the answer here were confusing. In <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 139 A.2d 209 (1958), since there was to be reversal and remand for a new trial, the Court \u201cdeem(ed) it to be necessary and desirable for the guidance of the lower court and to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal to this Court to decide the points or questions of law raised by the objection to the instructions on the law applicable to the charge of kidnapping____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 139 A.2d at 215. The Court said it was \u201cclear that the instructions were not only misleading and confusing, but were particularly ambiguous with respect to the distinction between kidnapping and false imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The discussion by Judge Horney for the Court is instructive:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q\">In ... <em>Wintrobe (v. Hart, </em>178 Md. 289, 13 A.2d 365 (1940)), we distinguished between an instruction which is merely erroneous but at least instructs and a misleading and confusing instruction which does not instruct at all. The erroneous though instructive instruction may not be reversible when it appears that the opposite party was not injured. But, as we said, at p. 296(, 13 A.2d 365): \u201c... instructions which are ambiguous, misleading, or confusing to jurors can never be classed as noninjurious.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>We hold that this is especially true in a criminal case where the jury is the judge of both the law and the facts and the instruction is merely advisory. <em>(Id. </em>at 41, 139 A.2d at 217.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">We hold that the combination of the ambiguous question, ambiguously clarified by the trial judge, and the answer create sufficient confusion in this case to warrant reversal and a remand for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In the case at hand, the question posed by the jury was, \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, <em>during the course of the sex act </em>to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind, and the ... man continues until climax, does the result constitute rape?\u201d Factually equating the parties\u2019 \u201cdifferent interpretations of the jury\u2019s question\u201d to <em>Battle, </em>the State points out that counsel for appellant urged the court to respond that no rape, under the hypothetical, occurred because the prosecutrix had consented to the \u201cmale penetration\u201d and the prosecutor was under the impression that the jury was asking whether consent could be withdrawn. The court, expressing the view that the question, as posed, \u201cwas a factual hypothetical that the jurors wanted the court to answer, rather than finding the facts for themselves.\u201d \u201cI am unable to answer this question as posed,\u201d was the trial judge\u2019s response. \u201cPlease reread the instructions as to each element and apply the law to facts as you find them.\u201d The State, in its brief, urges that \u201cthis phrase is remarkably similar to the ambiguous phrase \u2018during the course of the action\u2019 that the Court of Appeals found ambiguous in <em>Battle.\u201d </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The plain meaning of the jury\u2019s words, \u201cduring the sex act,\u201d leads one ineluctably to conclude that the reference was to the act of intercourse. By contrast, a much broader connotation is conveyed by \u201cduring the course <em>of the action.\u201d </em>More importantly, if there had been initially any cause for confusion, it certainly should have been cleared up when the jury submitted the second note the following morning: \u201cIf at any time, the woman says stop, is that rape?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The victim\u2019s change of mind, posits the State, could have just as probably referred to the \u201cvarious sexual acts that took place prior to vaginal penetration by Baby, which included attempted fellatio, anal penetration, and the touching of her breasts and vagina; just prior to penetration by Baby; or after penetration.\u201d The State then argues that the jury\u2019s query regarding \u201cthe man continuing until climax\u201d and the facts that neither appellant nor the prosecutrix testified that appellant had ejaculated or that he had engaged in any sort of \u201cback and forth motion\u201d during the penetration is support for the court\u2019s duty to reply to the jury\u2019s question because reaching a climax was not part of the evidence in the case. (Citing <em>Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 866 A.2d 129 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The State appears to suggest that lack of absolute certitude regarding the jury\u2019s inquiry renders it ambiguous. We are not persuaded that the law imposes such a standard as a condition of requiring a response to the jury\u2019s inquiry. The mere fact that the initial question referred to \u201cthe sex act,\u201d rather than, as premised by the State, \u201cduring the various sexual acts,\u201d would certainly indicate that the jury was not referring to foreplay or other acts incidental to coitus or anal intercourse. Moreover, the State\u2019s argument that absence of testimony that appellant engaged in any sort of \u201cback and forth\u201d motion or ejaculated is \u201cnot part of the evidence in the case\u201d misses the point. The question, as posed by the jury, did not assume, as a fact in evidence, that appellant had achieved a climax. A fair interpretation of the jury\u2019s question is that it was an inquiry as to the legal effect of a withdrawal of consent <em>subsequent to </em>penetration, and prior to climax.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Regarding the ambiguity of the jury\u2019s questions, the State\u2019s final argument is that \u201cit was not related to either party\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d According to the State, appellant\u2019s closing argument to the jury was that he had stopped prior to penetration when the prosecutrix sat up and said it wouldn\u2019t fit. The theory of the State\u2019s case was that J.L. had not consented to the initial penetration and that appellant \u201ccontinued to force his penis into her injured vagina, despite her resistance.\u201d Seizing upon the reference to \u201canytime\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>second question submitted by the jury, the State asseverates that \u201c[t]his question makes evident that the jury was not focusing on the withdrawal of consent after penetration....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">At the outset, it is axiomatic that closing argument is not evidence in the case. Thus, the jury was not bound by the closing argument of either counsel. The jury may believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness. <em>Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 498 A.2d 666 (1985). Accordingly, the jury was free to credit the testimony of the prosecutrix that appellant had pushed his penis into her vagina, but not all the way, as well as appellant\u2019s testimony that J.L. had given her prior consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In <em>Battle, </em>the Court\u2019s affirmative response to the jury\u2019s question regarding a \u201cpossible consensual relationship becoming] non consensual\u201d was found to be error because of the vague temporal premise, \u201cduring the course of the action.\u201d The <em>Battle </em>Court concluded that the jury\u2019s question was ambiguous, then it was ambiguously clarified by the trial judge and the answer created sufficient confusion to warrant reversal and remand for a new trial. No such confusion was presented by the question submitted by the jury in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Stripped of any hypertechnical interpretation, the jury in this case simply wanted to know if consent could be withdrawn after commencement of the \u201csex act,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>penetration. The fact that there was testimony that appellant had ceased his attempt to penetrate the prosecutrix within seconds after she told him to stop leaves little doubt that the jury sought to determine when, in point of time, a withdrawal of consent would sustain a conviction for rape. The jury, in the discharge of its responsibilities to apply the law to the facts as it found them to be, was entitled to a proper response to its inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The Supreme Court put it aptly in <em>Bollenbach v. U.S., </em>326 U.S. 607, 612-13, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">The jury was obviously in doubt as to Bollenbach\u2019s participation in the theft of the securities in Minneapolis and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>transportation to New York. The jury\u2019s questions, and particularly the last written inquiry in reply to which the untenable \u201cpresumption\u201d was given, clearly indicated that the jurors were confused concerning the relation of knowingly disposing of stolen securities after their interstate journey had ended to the charge of conspiring to transport such securities. <em>Discharge of the jury\u2019s responsibility for drawing appropriate conclusions from the testimony depended on discharge of the judge\u2019s responsibility to give the jury the required guidance by a lucid statement of the relevant legal criteria. When a jury makes explicit its difficulties a trial judge should clear them away with concrete accuracy. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The State alternatively argues that, \u201cEven if the jury had clearly posed the question whether post penetration withdrawal of consent is rape, the instructions given accurately reflected the law in Maryland that rape is vaginal intercourse by force and without consent, regardless of whether consent is withdrawn before or after penetration.\u201d The correct answer to the jury\u2019s question, it avers, is \u201cyes,\u201d withdrawal of consent after penetration constitutes rape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The State, in an attempt to demonstrate that the statement in <em>Battle </em>is out of step with the weight of authority, provides us with a compendium of state decisions in which, it asserts, \u201c[a]ll but one have held a woman who initially gives consent to vaginal intercourse, withdraws consent during intercourse, and then is forced to continue intercourse, is a victim of what has been termed post penetration rape.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The State next offers a series of arguments in support of the proposition that Maryland law holds that post penetration withdrawal of consent does not vitiate the criminal character of the subsequent intercourse. It points out that many of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>decisions are dated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rationale undergirding the principle that consent, once given, cannot be retracted, it maintains, is rooted in the historical notion that, because women were, in legal contemplation, chattel, loss of chastity was considered to be a devaluation of a man\u2019s property; and that the more enlightened view espoused by feminist scholars, medical practitioners and victims militates against a legal theory that a defendant is entitled to persist in intercourse once consent is withdrawn. Finally, although the Pattern Jury Instructions make no mention of whether rape occurs when consent is withdrawn, the State relies on the definition found therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Appellant, citing <em>Hazel v. State, </em>221 Md. 464, 157 A.2d 922 (1960), argues that the testimony of the complainant that he asked her permission to \u201cdo sex -with her,\u201d to which she responded, \u201cyes,\u201d and his cessation of his attempts to penetrate her within five to ten seconds after she said \u201cstop,\u201d provides the evidentiary basis for a finding that no rape was committed. Appellant had testified that the complainant indicated that she wanted him to stop as he was trying to insert his penis into her vagina and that he withdrew \u201cwithout any delay in all.\u201d The language upon which appellant relies in <em>Hazel </em>is \u201cWith respect to the presence or absence of the element of consent, it is true, of course, that however reluctantly given, consent to the act at any time prior to penetration deprives the subsequent intercourse of its criminal character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 157 A.2d 922. The <em>Hazel </em>Court continues, noting that there is a wide difference between consent and submission to the act. <em>Id. </em>Submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Notwithstanding the language that prior consent negates the criminal character of the subsequent intercourse, the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hazel, </em>as the State points out, devolves principally upon the distinction between consent and submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>sion to a sexual assault. Nor does the decision specifically address post penetration withdrawal of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">More problematic for the State\u2019s position, however, is the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Battle, </em>wherein the Court said, \u201cOn the other hand, ordinarily if she consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 414 A.2d 1266. The State dismisses the statement on two grounds: (1) that it was articulated as a mirror image of the precept that consent withdrawn prior to penetration constitutes rape and that it was unnecessary to the holding in <em>Battle </em>and therefore dicta; and that the opinion cited to no controlling authority<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and has not been repeated in any other Maryland decision or incorporated into the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In arguing that neither <em>Hazel </em>nor <em>Battle </em>stand for the proposition that post penetration withdrawal of consent deprives subsequent intercourse of its criminal character, the State merely asserts that the Court never said that consent must be withdrawn prior to penetration for it to be effective or that consent withdrawn after penetration vitiates the criminal character of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">With respect to the State\u2019s interpretation of <em>Battle, </em>a review of the pertinent passage, in its entirety, is instructive: The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">Rape was a common law crime in Maryland prior to the enactment of this section by Chapter 573 of the Acts of 1976 pertaining to sexual offenses. Thus, it was the common law crime of rape which was before the Court in <em>Hazel. </em>However, the present statutory requirement of \u201cvaginal intercourse with another person by force against the will and without the consent of the other person\u201d is an outgrowth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>the definitions of rape at common law as set forth in <em>Hazel. </em>For example, 2 J. Bishop, if Criminal Law s 1113 (8th ed. 1892) states, \u201cRape is the having of unlawful carnal knowledge, by a man of a woman, forcibly and against her will.\u201d Professor Bishop refers by footnote to statements on this subject by such learned authors as East, Coke, Hale, Hawkins, Blackstone, and Russell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">Regarding post-coitus consent, the Court elucidated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">The authorities are unanimous in the view that consent subsequent to the act of intercourse will not prevent its being rape. For instance, 2 J. Bishop, op. cit. s 1122, states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5a\">We have intimations that a consent <em>given during any part of the intercourse will prevent its being rape. </em>And certainly a consent after the assault, before the penetration, will have this effect. But as to the other question, the true view is believed to be that when the offense has been made complete by penetration, no remission by the woman or consent from her, however quickly following, can avail the man. And the Statute of Westm. 2 is express, that the liability to punishment shall remain \u201calthough she consent after.\u201d (Id. at 649.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">To like effect see, <em>e.g., </em>F. Bailey and H. Rothblatt, Crimes of Violence: Rape and Other Sex Crimes s 433 at 279 (1973); 2 W. Burdick, The Law of Crime s 484 at 235-36 (1946) (\u201c(I)n any case there can be no consent after the act, and the crime cannot be condoned by excusing or forgiving it.\u201d); Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes s 5.14 at 356 (7th ed. 1967) (\u201c(S)ubsequent consent to intercourse will not purge an assault or attempt to commit rape.\u201d); R. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure s 309 at 643 (12th ed., 1957) (\u201cConsent, to bar the commission of the offense, must precede the penetration.\u201d); 65 Am.Jur.2d Rape s 7 at 766 (1972)(\u201cAfter the offense has been completed by penetration, no submission or consent of the woman will avail the defendant.\u201d); and 74 C.J.S. Rape s 11 at 474 (1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Regarding condonation after the act of intercourse, the <em>Battle </em>Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Dean Burdick further comments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">It is said or intimated by some that consent may be given during any part of the intercourse, that is after the penetration but before completion of the coitus. However, an examination of the cases sometimes cited in support of such a doctrine shows that such comments are dicta or else made in connection with evidence relating to the alleged nonresistance of the woman and tending to show that she consented before the act. If penetration alone completes the act, it is illogical and unsound to say that consent may follow the penetration. <em>(Id. </em>at 236.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">The reason for this view is expressed by W. LaFave and A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law s 57 (1972), in discussing consent of the victim as a defense to crimes generally:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Condonation, the forgiveness of a criminal offense by the victim, is no defense. Sometimes this is explained on the ground that condonation is after-the-fact consent by the victim and thus cannot be any more effective than before-the-fact consent. This, however, might suggest that condo-nation is a defense in those circumstances where before-the-fact consent would bar conviction, but this is not the case. <em>While before-the-fact consent may negative an element of the offense or preclude infliction of the harm to be prevented by the law in question, this is not true of subsequent condonation. </em>Such forgiveness \u201chas no proper place in the criminal law. The interest of the state is paramount and controls prosecutions ... (f)or it is the public, not a complainant, that is injured by the commission of a crime.\u201d Acts by the victim alleged to constitute ratification (formal sanction, not necessarily involving forgiveness) are for the same reason no defense. <em>(Id. </em>410-11, <em>quoting People v. Brim, </em>22 Misc.2d 335, 1199 N.Y.S.2d 744 (1960).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Citing <em>Wright v. State, </em>23 Tenn. (4 Hum.) 194 (1843), the <em>Battle </em>Court concluded that there was little discussion in the cases on the effect of a withdrawal of consent prior to penetration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>It is contended, that the charge of the Judge is erroneous in this, that he said to the jury, \u201cIt is no difference if the person abused consented through fear, or that she was a common prostitute, or that she assented after the fact, or that she was taken first with her own consent, if she were afterwards forced against her will.\u201d This charge is correct in every particular, and fully sustained by authority. <em>(Id. </em>at 198.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\"><em>State v. Auld, </em>2 N.J. 426, 67 A.2d 175 (1949), is cited in 75 C.J.S. Rape, s 11, supra, along with 52 C.J. p. 1017 n. 86 for the proposition that \u201cwhere the female consents, but then withdraws her consent before penetration, and the act is accomplished by force, it is rape....\u201d (52 C.J. p. 1017 n. 86 in turn cites Wright.) In <em>Auld, </em>the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\"><em>It is next urged by the defendant that the trial court committed reversible error in not charging the jury that in the commission of a rape, consent may not be withdrawn during the act of intercourse. </em>The Court fully and correctly charged all of the elements constituting the crime of rape. The jury was further instructed that consent could be withdrawn at any stage \u201cduring the preparatory acts.\u201d The general rule may be summarized as follows: Consent must precede the penetration. Burdick, The Law of Crime, Vol. 2 s 484, at p. 235. See 44 Am.Jur., \u201cRape,\u201d s 8, p. 906; 52 C.J., s 26, p. 1017, and <em>State v. McCaffrey, </em>63 Iowa 479, 19 N.W. 331 (1884). (Id. at 435-36, 67 A.2d at 180.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The <em>Battle </em>Court, concluding that there was ample evidence on the subject of force to make the distinction between consent and submission a jury question in <em>State v. Allen, </em>163 Kan. 374, 183 P.2d 458 (1947), held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">Given the fact that consent must precede penetration, it follows in our view that although a woman may have consented to a sexual encounter, even to intercourse, if that consent is withdrawn prior to the act of penetration, then it cannot be said that she has consented to sexual intercourse. On the other hand, ordinarily if she consents prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 680-84, 183 P.2d 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The in-depth analysis engaged in by the Court of Appeals in <em>Battle </em>negates any notion that the pronouncement that prior consent vitiates the criminal character of the post penetration sexual act was inadvertent or mere dicta. Nor have law review articles and other scholars so dismissed the decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Whether the statement at issue in <em>Battle </em>is dicta, however, is not the relevant question. Having decided that the trial court was obliged \u201cto give the jury the required guidance by a lucid statement of the relevant legal criteria\u201d once the jury expressed a need for such guidance, <em>Bollenbach, </em>326 U.S. at 613, 66 S.Ct. 402, the relevant question \u2014 dicta or not \u2014 is whether the statement accurately represents Maryland law. More specifically, citing such \u201clearned authors\u201d as East Coke, Hale, Hawkins, Blackstone, Russell and Bishop, the passage succinctly discusses the common law roots of the issue at hand. Simply put, assume that the statement, as an utterance of the converse of a proposition essential to the decision, is arguably dicta. The pertinent question is whether that pronouncement is an accurate statement of the English common law which is, conceptually, the genesis of the notion that there is no rape where the prior consent is followed by penetration and then withdrawal of consent. <em>Battle </em>says that it is. The concept, undergirding the <em>Battle </em>holding, rooted in ancient laws<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>adopted by the English common-law, views the initial \u201cdeflowering\u201d of a woman as the real harm or insult which must be redressed by compensating, in legal contemplation, the injured party \u2014 the father or husband. This initial violation of the victim also provided the basis for the criminal proceeding against the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">But, to be sure, it was the act of penetration that was the essence of the crime of rape; after this initial infringement upon the responsible male\u2019s interest in a woman\u2019s sexual and reproductive functions, any farther injury was considered to be less consequential. The damage \u2014 viewed from the perspective of the husband\u2019s or father\u2019s interest in the reproductive functions of the victim \u2014 was done. It was this view that the moment of penetration was the point in time, after which a woman could never be \u201cre-flowered,\u201d that gave rise to the principle that, if a woman consents prior to penetration and withdraws consent following penetration, there is no rape. Maryland adheres to this tenet, having adopted the common law, which remains the law of the Land until and unless changed by the State\u2019s highest court or by statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Battle </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>has not been overruled or commented upon by Maryland authorities on the question of whether withdrawal of consent after penetration constitutes rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The Court of Appeals of Kansas, however, in <em>State v. Bunyard, </em>31 Kan.App.2d 853, 857, 75 P.3d 750, 755 (Kan.App.2003), has commented upon the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Battle, </em>observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">The issue of whether consent may be withdrawn after penetration is one of first impression in this State; therefore, case law from other jurisdictions is instructive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">In <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 683-84, 414 A.2d 1266 (1980), the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that consent must precede penetration. In other words, if a woman consented to a sexual encounter, even to intercourse, and consent is withdrawn prior to penetration, she did not consent to sexual intercourse. However, if she consents prior to penetration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">In reviewing case law from jurisdictions other than Maryland, we conclude that the <em>Battle </em>holding has not been adopted by other courts. In fact, the Appellate Court of Connecticut specifically rejected an argument identical to Bunyard\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The <em>Bunyard </em>Court, in specifically repudiating <em>Battle, </em>concluded: \u201cIt does not matter if the force or fear exists at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>initiation of the act or whether it comes after consent is withdrawn. The continuation of sexual intercourse after consent has been withdrawn and the presence of force or fear, is rape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">One of the decisions discussed in <em>Bunyard </em>is <em>State v. Siering, </em>35 Conn.App. 173, 644 A.2d 958 (1994), in which the jury asked, \u201cIf a person agrees to sexual intercourse, then changes her mind, withdraws her consent but is compelled to continue intercourse by use of force, does this constitute sexual assault?\u201d The court\u2019s response was \u201c[i]f there exists consensual sexual intercourse and the alleged victim changes her mind and communicates the revocation or change of mind of consent and the other person continues the sexual intercourse by compelling the victim through the use of force, then it would be sexual assault in the first-degree. This is not just someone withdrawing their consent, but it\u2019s a withdrawal of consent communicated to the other and then the sexual intercourse continues by compelling the victim through the use of force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The <em>Siering </em>Court, describing as \u201cabsurd\u201d the defendant\u2019s argument essentially requiring, to establish rape, a dislodging of the male organ where consent is withdrawn, noted that a review of limited case law from other jurisdictions reveals only three decisions which appear to hold that prior consent vitiates post penetration withdrawal of consent. Although the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Battle </em>is one of the three decisions, the Court chose not to include it in its analysis, stating, \u201cIn one of those cases, however, the discussion of this issue is arguably dicta and thus will not be discussed here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Another decision discussed in <em>Siering, </em>recognizing that post penetration withdrawal of consent constitutes rape, is <em>State v. Robinson, </em>496 A.2d 1067 (Maine 1985). There, the question submitted by the jury was, \u201cConcerning the law \u2014 if two people began consenting to an act, then one person says no and the other continues \u2014 is that rape?\u201d The Court\u2019s response was, \u201cIf a couple consensually engages in sexual intercourse and one or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the other changes his or her mind, and communicates the revocation or change of mind of the consent, and the other partner continues the sexual intercourse by compulsion of the party, who changes her mind, then it would be rape. The critical element in there is the continuation under compulsion.\u201d Finding that the trial judge\u2019s supplemental instruction was a correct statement of the law, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that \u201c... [i]f the jury credited the defendant\u2019s story to the extent of his claim that the prosecutrix changed her mind in the middle of their consensual sexual intercourse, it could, under the court\u2019s instruction, have returned its guilty verdict <em>only </em>if it found as a fact that the defendant compelled the woman to submit to his continued intercourse with her <em>for a period, </em>after she had revoked her original consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">With respect to <em>People v. Vela, </em>172 Cal.App.3d 237, 218 Cal.Rptr. 161 (1985), <em>Siering </em>describes as archaic and unrealistic the underlying reasoning that no rape occurs if a woman, who initially consents, later withdraws her consent and the male forcibly continues the act without interruption on the theory that \u201cthe outrage experienced by a female who has withdrawn her consent is not of the same magnitude as that resulting from the initial non-consensual violation of [the victim\u2019s] womanhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The other decision decried by <em>Siering </em>is <em>State v. Way, </em>297 N.C. 293, 254 S.E.2d 760 (1979). In <em>Way, </em>the trial judge had instructed the jury that intercourse continued by force after withdrawal of consent became rape from the point that it was no longer consensual. The North Carolina Supreme Court, however, reversed the trial judge, holding that consent could be withdrawn only if there was more than one act of intercourse and the consent was withdrawn between the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Although <em>Siering, </em>as does the State, denominated the language at issue in <em>Battle </em>as \u201carguably\u201d dicta, <em>Bunyard </em>refers to it as \u201cthe holding of Battle.\u201d As noted, whether the <em>Battle </em>pronouncement is dicta is immaterial to the trial court\u2019s obligation to inform the jury of the current status of Maryland law. It is currently a statement of Maryland law, that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>neither been overruled nor commented upon negatively. Whether it should be revisited in light of the weight of authority to the contrary<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is a matter for the Maryland legislature or the Court of Appeals. Under <em>Battle, </em>no rape occurred if the jury found that the prosecutrix withdrew her prior consent after penetration. The trial judge was obliged to answer the jury\u2019s questions and it should have been advised that, under Maryland law, the answer is \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind and the ... man continues until climax, does the result constitute rape?\u201d The holding in <em>Battle, </em>of course, would not have been a bar to a conviction for common law assault for any continuation of the sexual act against the complainant\u2019s will after the withdrawal of consent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Because appellant\u2019s second issue may recur at a retrial, we shall address it. He contends that the circuit court \u201cerred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>refusing to remove a juror from the jury at the point when the juror admitted that he had read a newspaper article about the appellant\u2019s case.\u201d \u201cBy allowing the juror to remain on the jury,\u201d he avers, \u201cthe court subjected appellant to the risk that the juror would unfairly influence one or more of his fellow jurors by communicating to them information prejudicial to appellant that was learned outside the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">At the beginning of the afternoon session of the third day of appellant\u2019s trial, a newspaper article reporting the proceedings appeared in the Weekly Gazette newspaper located in the lobby of courthouse. In addition to the facts that he had previously been tried on the same charges, and that he was facing life imprisonment on his retrial, the article disclosed that his co-defendant, Michael Wilson, had entered a plea of guilty. The court, pursuant to the request of counsel for appellant, inquired of the jurors whether they had read the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether any of the jurors \u201chad seen any press coverage of this case,\u201d juror No. 100 indicated that he had read the article. The court then reminded jurors to ignore media coverage whereupon the court directed the jurors to leave the courtroom. After appellant\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss juror No. 100, the juror was recalled to the courtroom and asked whether having read the article would affect his ability to be fair and impartial. His reply was that it would not. \u201cI didn\u2019t give any additional information. I was just intrigued with the fact that it was not the first time the case was tried.\u201d Although he had mentioned the article to two fellow members of the jury, he did not tell them what was in the article and, to his knowledge, they did not read the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Concerned that, although the juror had not mentioned that the co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea was reported in the article and that the juror might bring up the subject during jury deliberations, the court ruled that it would grant the motion to strike the juror. In consideration of the State\u2019s assurances that it had not decided whether to call Wilson as a witness, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>judge reversed herself and decided not to excuse the juror, ruling:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">THE COURT: All right. Well, what I am going to do at this point is reserve. I am going to reserve on this issue until the end of the trial and see whether, has Michael Wilson testified or not and how many jurors I have at the end of the trial, just in case there is a problem. I will admonish the jury they are not to discuss anything about the case, then not to read any press coverage, they are not to discuss\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Well, what may happen is, he ends up being the alternate that is excused. That is my point.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Right, well, at this point, I am just going to reserve. He is still on the jury, but he may or may not be, actually, one of the jurors that deliberates.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The trial judge had instructed the jury pursuant to Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions-Cr. 1:02, regarding publicity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The decision to remove a juror is discretionary and will not be reversed on appeal \u201cabsent a clear abuse of discretion or a showing of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>338 Md. 598, 607, 659 A.2d 1313 (1995); accord <em>Diaz v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 51, 740 A.2d 81 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 482, 745 A.2d 436 (2000); <em>see also Bruce v.

Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 351, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966). See generally W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 22.1 to 22.3 (1985 &amp; Supp.1989). Publicity may be so prejudicial as to constitute a denial of due process. <em>See, e.g., Basiliko v. State, </em>212 Md. 248, 129 A.2d 375 (1957); <em>Barber v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 235, 240, 295 A.2d 814 (1972) (\u201cwhere the publicity was so \u2018massive, pervasive and prejudicial\u2019 that it \u2018inflamed and prejudiced the public,\u2019 jury prejudice presumed).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The appropriate safeguard against such prejudice \u201cis the defendant\u2019s right to demonstrate that the media\u2019s coverage of his case \u2014 be it printed or broadcast \u2014 compromised the ability of the particular jury that heard the case to adjudicate fairly.\u201d <em>See Chandler v. Florida, </em>449 U.S. 560, 575, 101 S.Ct. 802, 66 L.Ed.2d 740 (1981). The burden is on the party alleging prejudice to prove (1) that the publicity is prejudicial, (2) that a juror has been exposed to the prejudicial material, and (3) that the juror\u2019s decision was influenced by the prejudicial material. <em>Presley v. State, </em>224 Md. 550, 555, 168 A.2d 510 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 957, 82 S.Ct. 399, 7 L.Ed.2d 389 (1962); <em>cf. Mu'Min v. Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 111 S.Ct. 1899, 114 L.Ed.2d 493 (1991) (although eight of the twelve jurors had familiarity with the case, there was no prejudice because none had formed an opinion). The injured party\u2019s remedy is a mistrial or a reversal on appeal. <em>See Barber, </em>16 Md.App. 235, 295 A.2d 814. <em>See generally, </em>Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 303.3, at 250 n. 1 (1987 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s attorney moved to dismiss juror No. 100 upon discovering that he had read a newspaper article about the case. The court initially ruled: \u201cI am going to grant the motion to strike the juror.\u201d The prosecutor, seeking to convince the trial court to reverse her ruling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>informed her that the State had not made a final decision as to whether it would call Michael Wilson as a witness. Should the State decide not to call the witness, averred the prosecutor, the jury would never learn about the plea previously entered by the witness. The prosecutor, in requesting that the court \u201chold this juror,\u201d pointed out that he had not discussed the article with other jurors, and suggested that the court \u201cadmonish him again to make sure he does not say anything to any jurors, and if and when we do or don\u2019t put Michael Wilson on the stand, then you make a final decision.\u201d The court adopted the State\u2019s suggestion and reversed itself, stating that it would \u201creserve on this issue until the end of the trial\u201d and admonish the jury not to discuss or read anything related to the case. Pellucidly, the overriding concern of the trial judge in this case was the number of alternate jurors available should, for some reason unforeseen, one or more members of the jury be removed or become incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Baby seeks solace in our opinion in <em>Wright v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 243, 748 A.2d 1050, <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 335, 753 A.2d 1032 (2000). There, the appellant, at his trial for first-degree murder, robbery, sodomy and assault and battery, had made a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude disclosure to the jury of his previous conviction of sodomy and evidence of other bad acts, including bruises and rough treatment of his prior girlfriends. As exhibits in support of the motion, the appellant submitted newspaper articles reporting that appellant had been charged with the murder, the charges later having been dropped for lack of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The article also recounted that appellant had been charged with two counts of statutory rape and indecent liberties with a 15-year-old; that he had been found guilty of committing lewd and lascivious acts on a person under the age of sixteen in North Carolina; and that appellant had previous convictions for fourth-degree sex offense and perverted sex practice. A second article related that the appellant had previously been charged with the crimes for which he was being tried, but the charges had been dropped because of insufficient evidence. The trial court granted the motion <em>in limine, </em>but, during jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>deliberations, a note was submitted to the court asking if \u201cthe jury would be wrong to consider defendant\u2019s Evidence 1 and 2,\u201d the articles that had been appended to the motion <em>in limine </em>and inadvertently sent to the jury room with the other evidence admitted during the trial. In holding that perusal of these articles by the jury required a mistrial, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">The present case is a difficult one because of the similarity of appellant\u2019s prior offenses and those for which he was being tried, and because of the inflammatory nature of the evidence and the emotional nature of the crimes. According to the article printed in <em>Ocean City Today, </em>appellant had . previously been convicted of an \u201cindecent liberties\u201d charge, a fourth degree sex offense charge, and a perverted practice charge. In addition, the article alleged that he had been charged -with, but not convicted of, rape and a sex offense by suffocation. Further, the information was read by all of the jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">The evidence against appellant was strong, but not overwhelming. He was the last person seen with Ruggles on the day most likely to have been the day of her death. Her body was found in an area between Ocean City and appellant\u2019s home, in a remote area not likely to be known to someone unfamiliar with the area. In addition, there was evidence that appellant gave Corporal McQueeney a false explanation of what had occurred and that he had made inconsistent statements to Corporal McQueeney and Dolch. The jury was also entitled to believe or disbelieve the testimony of Lewis, that appellant had confessed to killing Ruggles. Absent the confession, the evidence was circumstantial and the jury could have found appellant not guilty. On the other hand, the trial court inquired of the jurors after they had read the article. <em>Each juror indicated that he or she could decide appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence solely on the basis of the evidence presented at trial. The trial court was able to observe the demeanor of the jurors and believed their assurances. In addition, he instructed the jurors that they were not to discuss the information in the articles during their deliberations. It is also clear that the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>jurors took seriously their responsibility to decide the case based on appropriate evidence, as indicated by the fact that they notified the trial court when they questioned the admissibility of the newspaper articles.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">In our view, however, the dispositive factor in this case is the similarity of the offenses alleged against appellant in the prior cases to those for which he was on trial. As <em>Williams, supra, Hryciuk, supra, </em>and <em>Keegan, supra, </em>point out, <em>exposure to extrajudicial reports on a juror\u2019s deliberations may be substantial even though it is not perceived by the juror himself or herself. </em>Although the jurors may have honestly thought that they could disregard the information in the articles, in our judgment, any doubts the jurors may have had, reasonable or otherwise, would have been resolved against appellant \u2014 even if only subconsciously \u2014 as a result of the information contained in the articles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 748 A.2d 1050 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In <em>Wright, </em>we considered the relevant factors in a determination of whether exposure to inflammatory and prejudicial news articles requires the grant of a mistrial. It is uniformly recognized that such cases must be decided on their own facts. <em>Marshall v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 310, 79 S.Ct. 1171, 3 L.Ed.2d 1250 (1959). Moreover, the trial judge has broad discretion in ruling on the issue of prejudice resulting from the reading by jurors of news articles concerning the trial. <em>Id. </em>We begin our analysis, however, with the fact that, unlike many of the landmark cases, only one juror was found to have read the article. <em>Wright </em>further instructs that, except where prejudice is manifest, a trial court is entitled to rely on the assurances of jurors that they would be able to reach a verdict based only on the evidence at trial even in cases where jurors possessed knowledge of extraneous extrajudicial information about the case being tried. <em>See Wright, </em>131 Md.App. at 260, 748 A.2d 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">It logically follows, then, that a trial judge may rely on assurances where, as here, such assurances relate to whether juror No. 100 told the other jurors about the contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>article and his assurance that \u201cthey [the other jurors] didn\u2019t read the article.\u201d Of course, the factor most troubling is that the article contained information that the co-defendant had entered a plea of guilty. It is a very short leap from knowledge of the accomplice\u2019s guilt and the guilt of appellant by association, particularly where appellant may have been convicted on a theory that he aided or abetted Wilson as to certain offenses. We are satisfied, however, that the potential undue prejudice is ameliorated by the fact that, in the first instance, the record discloses no evidence that the information contained in the article was ever imparted to the members of the jury who ultimately deliberated and found appellant guilty. In the final analysis, dispositive of appellant\u2019s claim is the fact that, notwithstanding the four-day interval that juror No. 100 continued to sit on the jury, the court did ultimately excuse him. In the absence of evidence that the juror imparted to the other jurors the information contained in the article, appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">For guidance of the circuit court, on remand, we consider appellant\u2019s final assignment of error. He argues that the circuit court\u2019s denial of his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Dr. Ann Burgess, a professor of psychiatric nursing and a nurse practitioner with a doctorate in nursing science was reversible error. She was offered by the State as an expert witness to explain how aberrant behavior of victims of sexual assault can be attributed to the \u201crape trauma syndrome,\u201d asserted to be a subset of post-traumatic stress disorder. The basis of appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was that Dr. Burgess\u2019s testimony should be excluded because she had not interviewed or examined the prosecutrix and that a \u201cgeneral explanation of post traumatic stress disorder, and how the psychological symptoms are manifested in their reactions of rape victims\u201d was not specific to the case. Additionally, appellant claimed that testimony \u201cwould be hearsay, irrelevant, highly, highly, highly prejudicial, then goes beyond the boundaries of the testimony and the areas that this the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>should consider.\u201d In denying appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">It is my belief that the case law does specifically authorize testimony on this issue, so long as [sic] is used to explain the syndrome and the behavior that\u2019s part of the syndrome, as opposed to saying \u201cThis victim was raped because she did this.\u201d That\u2019s what they can\u2019t do---- But they can offer testimony as to what Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is, what Rape Trauma Syndrome is, when it\u2019s relevant to certain issues in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Prior to the commencement of appellant\u2019s second trial, the trial judge reasserted her earlier ruling: \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to deny the defense motion with respect to Dr. Burgess for the same reasons I denied it in the last trial. Just as you all incorporated your arguments, I\u2019ll incorporate my rulings.\u201d Preliminarily, Dr. Burgess testified that prior to trial, she had reviewed the police statement, the indictment, the forensic nurse examiner report and an audio cassette. As noted, <em>supra, </em>Dr. Burgess was presented with a hypothetical based on testimony in this case, with special reference to the State\u2019s theory that J.L. believed that appellant and his cohort were harmless and that she was tricked into joining them in the back seat of her vehicle. Dr. Burgess attributed the victim\u2019s failure to resist, her failure immediately to report the incident and her voluntarily giving her home telephone number to the alleged assailant to the rape trauma syndrome. More specifically, Dr. Burgess testified that there were three stages of rape trauma syndrome, the initial impact phase, the acute phase of disorganization and the reorganization phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The State initially asserts that the issues presented in appellant\u2019s third argument are unpreserved, including whether he may challenge \u201cfor the first time on appeal\u201d the use of the term, citing language in <em>State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 517 A.2d 741 (1986), that \u201cthere are inherent implications from the use of the term \u2018rape trauma syndrome\u2019 for it suggests that the syndrome may only be caused by rape.\u201d We think appellant\u2019s objection to admission into evidence of the concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>subsumes and is part of the challenge to the use of the term. The issues presented were vigorously opposed in the trial court at two separate proceedings; we shall therefore consider the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Denominating it as \u201ccareless dictum,\u201d appellant acknowledges that the Court of Appeals, in <em>Hutton v. State, </em>339 Md. 480, 504, 663 A.2d 1289 (1995), stated that ... expert testimony on post traumatic stress syndrome or on \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d may be admissible when the issue was consent. He hastens to add, however, that the Court of Appeals reversed Hutton\u2019s conviction because \u201cthe PTSD evidence was offered to prove that the alleged sexual abuse had occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In <em>State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 109-10, 517 A.2d 741 (1986), the Court of Appeals reviewed our decision in <em>Allewalt v. State, </em>61 Md.App. at 505, 487 A.2d 664 (1985), and set forth the parameters for admission of evidence of the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">We hold only that in this case the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of Dr. Spodak. We emphasize that admissibility is a matter of trial court discretion based on the facts. When a trial judge admits PTSD evidence because <em>he believes that the existence of the disorder coupled with the absence of any triggering trauma, other than the evidence of rape, will aid the jury the ruling necessarily carries certain baggage with it. </em>Cross-examination can include not only cross-examining the expert about PTSD in general, but also cross-examining the expert and the prosecutrix about possible causes of the disorder other than the assault charged in the criminal case. In addition, we can foresee cases where the defendant will seek to counter the State\u2019s PTSD evidence with his own expert testimony. That can, in turn, lead to issues concerning compulsory psychiatric examination of the complainant by an expert for the defense. Lurking in the background is the nice question of whether the absence of PTSD is provable by the accused in defense of a rape charge, as tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>prove that there was consent. <em>See, </em>as to RTS generally, Massaro, <em>Experts, Psychology, Credibility, and Rape: The Rape Trauma Syndrome Issue and its Implications for Expert Psychological Testimony, </em>69 Minn.L.Rev. 395 (1985); Comment, <em>Expert Testimony on Rape Trauma Syndrome: Admissibility and Effective Use in Criminal Rape Prosecution, </em>33 Am.U.L.Rev. 417 (1984); Note, <em>Checking the Allure of Increased Conviction Rates: The Admissibility of Expert Testimony on Rape Trauma Syndrome in Criminal Proceedings, </em>70 Va.L.Rev. 1657 (1984). When ruling on whether to receive State proferred evidence of PTSD a trial judge will have to weigh the benefit of the evidence not only against potential unfair prejudice, but also against the complexity of possibly accompanying issues and against the time required properly to try the expanded case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAtp\"><em>Id. </em>109-110, 517 A.2d 741 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In <em>Hutton, </em>the Court further clarified the trial issues which could be properly explicated by the introduction of the rape trauma syndrome into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the admission of PTSD testimony to prove sexual abuse occurred was inadmissible and clearly error. Testimony by an expert that the alleged victim suffered from PTSD as a result of sexual abuse goes beyond the limits of proper expert expression. Expert testimony describing PTSD or rape trauma syndrome may be admissible, however, when offered for purposes other than simply to establish that the offense occurred. The evidence might be offered, for example, to <em>show lack of consent or to explain behavior that might be viewed as inconsistent with the happening of the event, </em>such as a delay in reporting or recantation by the child. <em>See Taylor, </em>552 N.Y.S.2d at 888-90, 552 N.E.2d at 136-38. This case does not fit within any such exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\"><em>Hutton v. State, </em>339 Md. at 504, 663 A.2d 1289 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Pellucidly, the facts presented in the case <em>sub judice </em>are quintessential^ the circumstances contemplated by Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>authorities which have considered the rape trauma syndrome. Obviously, it strains credulity that one who later claims to have been raped would be compliant during the sexual encounter, fail to immediately report the sexual assault and, most confounding, give her alleged attacker her home telephone number. Unlike <em>Bohnert v. State, </em>812 Md. 266, 539 A.2d 657 (1988) and <em>Hutton, </em>the evidence was neither employed to establish the happening of the criminal event or the victim\u2019s credibility, nor was it outside the bounds of the expert\u2019s area of expertise, nor did it invade the province of the jury. Finally, as approved by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hutton, Acuna </em>and <em>Allewalt, </em>Dr. Burgess properly relied on material supplied by the court and statements as part of the hypothetical foundation upon which she based her opinion. The court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Dr. Burgess.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. The State maintained throughout that J.L.\u2019s apparent consent was never volitional. Had the jury accepted the State\u2019s major premise, the issue of withdrawal of consent would never have been considered during the deliberations. The issue of post penetration consent, was, to be sure, injected into the case, not by the appellant or the State, but rather by the jury in its consideration of the evidence during its deliberations. Although we cannot know precisely the thought processes of the jurors, the evidence was that appellant and Mike had suggested that J.L. and Lacey S. get a hotel room because the girls were older and that, when appellant and Mike began discussing sex and the former produced three condoms, Lacey, apparently uncomfortable with the turn of events, made it clear that she did not want to accompany the trio. After complying with Lacey\u2019s request to drive her back to the restaurant, J.L. drove the two boys, at night, to a residential area and parked her car on the street. She then climbed into the back seat of the car between appellant and Mike. Notwithstanding the State's theory that J.L. was tricked into joining appellant and his accomplice on the back seat of the car, the evidence presented to the jury provided at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>a rational inference that (1) Lacey sensed that a sexual <em>encounter </em>was contemplated by the two boys and chose to leave the trio; (2)that, although J.L. certainly did not relinquish her right to refuse appellant's sexual advances by climbing into the back seat of the car, by agreeing to remain with the two boys, she had abandoned the security provided by Lacey\u2019s presence; and (3) the earlier conversations about sex and appellant\u2019s production of three condoms should have been indicia of their intentions. All of the foregoing evidence was before the jury for its consideration in contradistinction to the State\u2019s theory that J.L., an eighteen-year-old college student, was tricked by two sixteen-year-old high school students. The rape trauma syndrome, discussed, <em>infra, </em>was competent evidence to explain the unusual behavior of J.L. subsequent to the sexual encounter, but would have no bearing on her actions preceding the alleged rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">.

Under Baby's view, however, if intercourse is continued by force after the victim withdrew consent, it would not constitute rape unless the victim is able to struggle against her attacker and manages to displace the male organ, however briefly, followed by an act of re-penetration by the defendant. <em>See Robinson, 496 </em>A.2d at 1070-71 (discussed in Comment, <em>Antiquated Notions of Womanhood and the Myth of the Unstoppable Male: Why Post-Penetration Rape Should Be a Crime in North Carolina, </em>82 N.C.L.Rev. 1258, 1271-72 (2004)). The victim\u2019s ability to fight off her attacker is not, of course, an element of rape under Maryland law. <em>See also Siering, 644 </em>A.2d at 962-63 (noting \"absurdity of this construction\u201d and fact that it protects a defendant whose physical force is great enough to avoid a momentary displacement of the male organ).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\">. <em>See State v.

Two state courts have issued opinions unequivocally rejecting the concept of post-penetration rape \u2014 Maryland and North Carolina. Of the forty-eight remaining states, seven have unequivocally supported it\u2014 Maine, Connecticut, California, South Dakota, Minnesota, Alaska, and Kansas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">A. Courts Limiting Women\u2019s Right to Say \"No\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">Only two courts have found that once sex has begun, a woman cannot withdraw her consent. In 1979, the Supreme Court of North Carolina became the first state court to decide the issue in <em>State v. Way, </em>254 S.E.2d at 761-62 holding that consent cannot be withdrawn. The following year, in <em>Battle v. State, </em>287 Md. 675, 683-84, 414 A.2d 1266 the Maryland Court of Appeals followed suit by holding that once given, consent is absolute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-11\">The facts of each case are very similar. In both cases, the defendant tricked the victim into accompanying him to a secluded area, where he attacked and raped her. Also in both cases, the jury sent a note to the judge during deliberation, inquiring as to whether a woman can withdraw consent once penetration has occurred. Both judges responded in the affirmative, and both were overruled on appeal. In <em>Way, </em>the North Carolina Supreme Court admitted that consent can be withdrawn, but only when the victim gives consent for a sexual act and then withdraws it regarding independent subsequent acts. If, however, within the same sexual act \"actual penetration is accomplished with the woman\u2019s consent, the accused is not guilty of rape.\u201d The court reasoned that if a jury instruction such as the one at issue were allowed, \"the jury could have found the defendant guilty of rape if they believed [the victim] had consented to have intercourse with the defendant and in the middle of that act, she changed her mind. This is not the law.\u201d In <em>Battle, </em>the Maryland Court of Appeals explained that once a man has penetrated a female without consent, it is rape, and \"no remission by the woman or consent from her, however quickly following, can avail the man.\u201d The court argued that the opposite must also be true \u2014 \"if she consents prior to pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>etration and withdraws the consent following penetration, there is no rape.\u201d The court implied that post-penetration rape does not exist. While the overruling courts\u2019 reasoning in each case differed from one another, the main underlying premise was the same. Once sex begins with the woman\u2019s consent, her rights disappear and her partner\u2019s subsequent behavior, however forceful or violent, is justified. His actions are beyond the purview of rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"><em>No Means No: Weakening Sexism in Rape law By legitimizing Post-Penetration Rape, </em>49 St. Louis U.L.J. 1229, 1231-33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">.

If the rapist was married, the virgin still had to marry her rapist; however, the rapist\u2019s property, his wife, also was factored into the compensation.
