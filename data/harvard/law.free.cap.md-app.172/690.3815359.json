Runkles, III.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees are Elm Street Development, Inc. (\u201cElm Street\u201d) and Baltimore County. The Baltimore County Board of Appeals approved Elm Street\u2019s development plan for a parcel of land known as the \u201cMiller-Tipper property,\u201d based in part on two County agencies\u2019 recommendations that the plan complied with the relevant zoning regulations. When the Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed the decision, appellants noted this appeal, arguing that the Board erred in not requiring the County agencies to lay out the \u201cfacts and reasons\u201d behind their recommendations. Appellants also noted an appeal regarding a related development plan from Elm Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">To fully understand the questions raised on appeal, a brief review of the Baltimore County plan approval process is required before we proceed with our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">In Baltimore County, the process of obtaining approval for a development plan begins with the filing of a concept plan which, among other things, \u201c[generally complies] with county regulations and standards\u201d and which will be reviewed at a Concept Plan Conference involving the developer and the relevant County agencies. Baltimore County Code (2003) \u00a7\u00a7 32-4-211 \u2014 32-4-216. After that review, the Department of Permits and Development Management (\u201cPDM\u201d) holds a Community Input Meeting to allow \u201cResolution of community concerns and developer constraints within the context of ... county regulations and policies.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-217. Participants may include \u201crepresentatives of the county, the [developer], owners of adjacent property, and representatives of local community associations or umbrella groups.\u201d Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u00a7 32-4-101(l). Any relevant comments raised or conditions proposed that are not resolved at the Community Input Meeting must be \u201c[a]ddress[ed]\u201d by the appropriate agency and submitted to the hearing officer. Code \u00a7 32-4-217(e)(3). Only after participating in the Community Input Meeting can the developer file a development plan. Code \u00a7 32-4-221.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The development plan must not be \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the concept plan unless the inconsistencies are \u201crelated to the outcome of the [CJommunity [IJnput [MJeeting.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-225. Otherwise, another Community Input Meeting must be held on the plan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The development plan, too, must undergo a process of review. As part of that review, County representatives must visit the property involved. Code \u00a7 32-4-226(a). And County agencies, such as PDM, the Office of Planning, and the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management (\u201cDEPRM\u201d), must review the plan for compliance with County regulations. Code \u00a7 32-4-226(b). After that has occurred, the developer and the relevant County agencies attend a Development Plan Conference, which the Community Input Meeting participants may also attend. Code \u00a7 32-4-226(c)(1). The Development Plan Conference provides the parties with an opportunity to resolve \u201cany conflict between agency comments\u201d and \u201cany comments raised or conditions proposed at the [CJommunity [IJnput [MJeeting.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-226(c)(2). These comments and conditions are available to the public upon request. Code \u00a7 32-4-227(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Finally, after the Development Plan Conference is held, the plan goes before a hearing officer for a \u201cpublic quasi-judicial hearing.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-227(a). Before the hearing, the County agencies must submit, among other things, any agency comments on the development plan as well as agency responses to any \u201cunresolved comments raised or conditions proposed or requested\u201d at the Community Input Meeting. Code \u00a7 32-4-226(d). During the hearing, the hearing officer is required to \u201cconsider any comments and conditions submitted by a county agency,\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-227(e)(1), and to \u201ctake testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>and receive evidence regarding any unresolved comment or condition,\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-228(a)(1). But, \u201c[i]f no comments or conditions are received by the [h]earing [ojfficer,\u201d the development plan \u201cshall be considered to be in compliance with county regulations.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-227(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The hearing officer then issues a \u201cfinal decision\u201d on the development plan. Code \u00a7 32-4-229(a)(1). The hearing officer \u201cshall grant approval\u201d of a development plan which \u201ccomplies with these development regulations and applicable policies, rule and regulations.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-229(b)(1). The hearing officer\u2019s final decision may be appealed to the Board. Code \u00a7 32-4-227(b)(2). The Board\u2019s decision, in turn, may be reviewed by the circuit court. Maryland Rule 7-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">ELM STREET\u2019S REVISED RED-LINED DEVELOPMENT PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Elm Street sought to develop the approximately 72.47 acre Miller-Tipper property into a residential subdivision of 14 single-family dwellings. Because the property was zoned RC-4 under the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (1998) (\u201cBCZR\u201d), the development plan for the property had to designate a \u201cminimum of 70%\u201d of the property as a \u201cconservancy area.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A03.5. The conservancy area was to include certain \u201cfeatures,\u201d such as wetlands and steep slopes, to be developed \u201cas determined by the standards contained in the Comprehensive Manual of Development Policies;\u201d the Director of the Office of Planning and the Director of DEPRM were to determine whether these requirements were met. BCZR \u00a7 1A03.5(A). Under the BCZR, the property was also required to be \u201cheld in unified ownership and control.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A03.5(C). Before work could commence on the property, Elm Street had to obtain the County\u2019s approval of its development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In accordance with the County\u2019s procedures, Elm Street filed a concept plan for the property. After it was reviewed at the Concept Plan Conference, a Community Input Meeting was held which allowed residents of the locality to review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>comment on the proposal. Elm Street then submitted a development plan to PDM, which was reviewed by the County agencies and discussed at the Development Plan Conference. Finally, the plan was submitted to the hearing officer \u2014 the County Zoning Commissioner \u2014 for a decision. During the ensuing three-day hearing before the hearing officer, County agencies and members of the community had the opportunity to comment on the plan and suggest conditions to be imposed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">At that time, PDM, the Office of Planning, and DEPRM expressed concern that the property had two conservancy areas with two different owners, which they claimed was prohibited in an RC-4 zoned property. The hearing officer agreed and determined, among other things, that the \u201ctwo conservancy areas proposed in this case, under different ownership, are simply not permitted,\u201d absent \u201ccompelling factors,\u201d under \u00a7 1A03.5(C). He therefore denied approval of the development plan as well as Elm Street\u2019s subsequent request that he reconsider that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Elm Street appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Board. The Board reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision and approved the plan, finding that the proposed conservancy area satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 1A03.5(C) because the regulation permitted dual ownership of the conservancy area even without there being any \u201ccompelling interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Challenging that decision, appellants petitioned the circuit court for judicial review. The circuit court found that, while the Board was correct in holding that \u201cseparate ownership\u201d of the conservancy area was \u201cpermissible,\u201d the two parcels in the plan still had to be \u201cunder the control of one entity, that is, there must be \u2018unified control\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7 1A03.5(C). Moreover, because the record was also silent as to \u201cwhether the proposed conservancy area include[d] the features set forth in [\u00a7 1A03.5(A) ],\u201d the circuit court found that there was a lack of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Elm Street had satisfied the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) and (C). It therefore remanded the case for the Board to determine two matters: whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM determined that \u201cthe proposed area complie[d] with the regulation and standards\u201d under \u00a7 1A03.5(A), and whether the conservancy-area would be held under \u201cunified control,\u201d as required under \u00a7 1A03.5(C). The Board, in turn, remanded the case to the hearing officer for him to first address those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">After the circuit court issued its decision, Elm Street submitted a revised red-lined development plan to the Office of Planning and DEPRM, showing the conservancy area now to be a single area under the sole ownership of Glen Arm Homes, LLC. Upon review of this plan, the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM informed the hearing officer, in their written \u201crecommendations,\u201d that they had determined that the sole ownership of the conservancy area by Glen Arm Homes, LLC made the plan \u201cacceptable\u201d under the requirements of \u00a7 1A03.5(C). The Directors also determined that the conservancy area met the \u201c[performance standards for rural cluster development\u201d as required under \u00a7 1A03.5(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">After a hearing, the hearing officer found that the circuit court\u2019s remand order was satisfied by the revised red-lined development plan and the written recommendations of the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM, which \u201cclearly and unambiguously set out the positions of the two County Departments, and resolved the issues identified by [the circuit court].\u201d Having so found, he determined that \u201coral testimony was ... unnecessary,\u201d further pointing out that the recommendations \u201cwere offered into evidence and received without objection\u201d and that \u201crepresentatives of the[] two County agencies were present at the hearing to address any concerns or questions by any party.\u201d Since the revised red-lined plan satisfied the circuit court\u2019s order and complied \u201cwith all applicable requirements and standards\u201d of the \u201cdevelopment review regulations\u201d of the \u201cCounty Code, the BCZR and all other [relevant] policies, standards and requirements,\u201d the hearing officer approved the development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellants appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Board. The Board agreed with the hearing officer and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that the circuit court\u2019s remand order had been satisfied by the revision to the development plan creating \u201cone single lot which was owned by Glen Arm Homes, LLC\u201d and by the recommendations submitted by the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM. The Board observed that appellants could have \u201cpresented witnesses\u201d or questioned the agency representatives, who were present at the hearing. By failing to do so, \u201cthey accepted,\u201d the Board found, \u201cthe recommendations of the two agencies.\u201d The Board concluded that, since neither the County agencies nor anyone present \u201craised [any] issues with respect to the property,\u201d it had \u201cno basis for overturning or remanding\u201d the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Appellants then petitioned the circuit court for review of the Board\u2019s decision. Agreeing with the Board\u2019s conclusion, the circuit court found that the revised red-lined development plan \u201cresolved\u201d the issue of \u201cunified ownership and control\u201d under \u00a7 1A03.5(C),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the recommendations issued by the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM resolved the issue of compliance with the conservancy area requirements of \u00a7 1A03.5(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In so ruling, it rejected appellants\u2019 argument that the agencies had to provide \u201creasons for determining that the conservancy area [met] the applicable standards,\u201d stating that \u201c[n]o case law, statute or regulations requires that reasons for such approvals be stated.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And, since \u201c[n]o evidence was presented to the [h]earing [o]fficer\u201d that the recommendations from the Office of Planning and DEPRM \u201cwere not reasonably based on facts proven,\u201d the circuit court held that \u201cthe [h]earing [o]fficer and [the Board\u2019s] approvals] of the [revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>red-lined] development plan [were] reasonably based on the facts proven.\u201d It therefore affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">ELM STREET\u2019S REFINED DEVELOPMENT PLAN</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">While appellants\u2019 petition for judicial review regarding the original plan was pending in the circuit court, Elm Street filed a request for approval of a \u201cPlan Refinement\u201d of the original plan with the Development Review Committee (\u201cDRC\u201d). The refinement involved the \u201cremoval of a lot line in the proposed conservancy area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Upon review, DRC recommended approval of the refinement. PDM adopted the DRC\u2019s recommendations, a decision which appellants appealed to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The Board addressed appellants\u2019 appeal regarding the revised red-lined development plan together with their appeal regarding the refined development plan. It dismissed the latter appeal, concluding that the appeal was moot. The circuit court reached the same conclusion, finding that, because \u201cthe case ha[d] gone forward on the [revised] \u2018red-lined\u2019 development plan,\u201d the \u201cneed for the exemption [was] no longer operative\u201d and the petition on the refined plan was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">In reviewing the decision of an agency, our role \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whple to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Md. State Police v. Warwick Supply &amp; Equip. Co., Inc., </em>330 Md. 474, 494, 624 A.2d 1238 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">In making such a determination, we \u201cmay not substitute our judgment for that of the Board ... unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>agency\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence or were premised on an error of law.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Rotwein, </em>169 Md.App. 716, 727, 906 A.2d 959 (2006). Moreover, in deciding \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s conclusions were premised on an error of law, we ordinarily give \u2018considerable weight\u2019 to \u2018an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Appellants contend that the recommendations by the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM that the revised red-lined development plan complied with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) and (C) were \u201cwithout legal effect\u201d because they were \u201cnot supported by facts and reasons.\u201d Hence the Board erred, they claim, in \u201caccepting]\u201d and relying on these recommendations in affirming the hearing officer\u2019s approval of the development plan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The circuit court ordered two issues to be considered by the Board on remand: first, whether the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM determined \u201cthat the proposed area complie[d] with the regulation and standards\u201d under \u00a7 1A03.5(A) and second, \u201cwhether the proposed conservancy area [would] be under unified control,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1A03.5(C). On remand, the Directors determined that Elm Street\u2019s revised red-lined development plan complied with the regulations and standards of \u00a7 1A03.5(A) and that the entire conservancy area was now under the sole ownership of Glen Arms Homes, LLC, and thus under its unified control, as called for by \u00a7 1A03.5(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">And that was all the agencies were required to do. Neither the BCZR nor the Code demand anything more. Nor can we read a requirement into the BCZR or the Code that the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM must articulate the \u201cfacts and reasons\u201d underlying their decisions. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>fact, it is clear that, when either the BCZR or the Code requires that the basis of an agency\u2019s opinion be set forth, it plainly imposes such a requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">For example, under BCZR \u00a7 1A07.4(A), before any development plan concerning property in an area zoned RC-6 can be approved, the Director of Planning \u201cmust certify in a <em>written finding </em>that the plan ... is consistent with the spirit and intent of\u2019 the relevant regulations, (emphasis added). Similarly, under Code \u00a7 32-3-232, the Director of the Office of Planning is required \u201c[u]pon notification by an owner of an error in the zoning map ... [to] [investigate ... and ... [s]end the [D]irector\u2019s <em>findings </em>to the owner\u201d (emphasis added). Moreover, under Code \u00a7 33-2-202, the Director of DEPRM \u201cmay grant ... approval\u201d of development in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area \u201cafter making <em>written findings </em>that the [development] is consistent with the purposes stated under \u00a7 33-2-103 of this title and the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area criteria\u201d (emphasis added). Furthermore, under Code \u00a7 32-4-254, DEPRM and the Office of Planning are required to \u201ceither approve the site analysis plan or <em>specify the revisions or additional information necessary for obtaining approval of the site analysis plan\u201d </em>for property in an RC-6 zoned area (emphasis added). And, finally, under Code \u00a7 32-4-272, PDM and DEPRM must either approve a plat or <em>\u201cnotify the applicant in writing of the reasons for modification or disapproval </em>[of the plat]\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">But neither the BCZR nor the Code requires that \u201cfindings\u201d be made or reasons be given by the Office of Planning or DEPRM in its review of Elm Street\u2019s development plan. All that is required, under the BCZR, is that the Office of Planning and DEPRM \u201cdetermine\u201d that the plan meets the requirements of \u00a7 1A03.5(A) and possibly \u00a7 1A03.5 (C) and, under the Code, that they submit any \u201ccomments,\u201d \u201cresponses\u201d and \u201crecommendations\u201d from the agencies or the Community Input Meeting to the hearing officer at least five days before the hearing, Code \u00a7 32-4-226(d)(1). Hence, we conclude that, had the County wanted the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM to state \u201cfacts and reasons\u201d in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>recommendations regarding the development plan\u2019s compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) and (C), the BCZR would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">And, contrary to appellants\u2019 argument, once the Directors had made their recommendations, it was not necessary for Elm Street or the agencies to produce evidence supporting those decisions. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 32-4-227(e) and 32-4-228(a)(1); <em>Gough v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>21 Md.App. 697, 704, 321 A.2d 315 (1974). Instead, it was then up to appellants to produce evidence rebutting the Directors\u2019 recommendations. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Under the County\u2019s lengthy development plan review process, Elm Street\u2019s duty to demonstrate its plan\u2019s compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) and (C) ended when the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM determined there was such compliance. Once that occurred, Elm Street could, according to Code \u00a7 32-4-227(e), simply accept those recommendations and choose not to submit any comments or conditions to the hearing officer. And this is what it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Moreover, the Code requires the hearing officer to consider the development plan \u201cto be in compliance with county regulations\u201d if \u201cno comments or conditions are received\u201d by him. Code \u00a7 32-4-227(e)(2). In other words, at this stage of the development plan review process, the development plan is deemed Code-compliant in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Although appellants had the opportunity to question the agencies as to their recommendations and to point out any failings, omissions or errors, they declined to do so. Nor did appellants present any evidence regarding the plan\u2019s lack of compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) or (C). Therefore, the hearing officer had to accept as established the revised red-lined plan\u2019s compliance with county regulations and approve the plan. <em>See also People\u2019s Counsel v. Mockard, </em>73 Md.App. 340, 349, 533 A.2d 1344 (1987) (where the Board\u2019s decision is \u201cuncontradicted from other sources and only one conclusion [can] be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>reached\u201d from the evidence presented, \u201ca lack of findings will not warrant remand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">While the circuit court did remand the case for lack of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as to the property\u2019s compliance with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) and (C), \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in this context does not necessarily require, as appellants claim, an articulation of the underlying \u201cfacts and reasons.\u201d Substantial evidence is merely \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Warwick Supply &amp; Equip. Co., Inc., </em>330 Md. at 494, 624 A.2d 1238. The revised red-lined development plan and the recommendations submitted by the Directors of the Office of Planning and DEPRM were such relevant evidence, and the hearing officer properly accepted that evidence as sufficient to meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1A03.5(A) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Nor did the Board err in upholding the hearing officer\u2019s decision. In reviewing the hearing officer\u2019s approval of a development plan, the Board is \u201cnot vested with broad visitorial power ... but acts rather as a review board, to assure that lower agency decisions are in conformance with law and are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Monkton Preservation Ass\u2019n v. Gaylord Brooks Realty Corp., </em>107 Md. App. 573, 580, 669 A.2d 195 (1996). And there is no indication that it did not properly carry out that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We dispose of appellants\u2019 argument that the Board erroneously deferred to the \u201cexpert opinions\u201d of the Office of Planning and DEPRM, without scrutiny, by simply noting that the recommendations of the County agencies were rendered, without explanation, as the law permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We further note that appellants rely heavily on zoning cases \u2014 principally <em>Mockard </em>and <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Beachwood I. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>107 Md.App. 627, 670 A.2d 484 (1995) \u2014 to support their claims that the Office of Planning and DEPRM should have articulated the \u201cfacts and reasons\u201d for their recommendations and that the Board thereby erred in relying on those recommendations. But these cases are not applicable here. Even though, as appellants argue, Code \u00a7 32-4-114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>requires compliance with \u201call other applicable laws and regulations of the county,\u201d Maryland courts treat the review of zoning matters and of development plans as separate matters which \u201cmay be subjected to a separate development and approval procedure\u201d because they each have \u201can independent purpose.\u201d <em>Wesley Chapel Bluemount Ass\u2019n v. Baltimore County, </em>847 Md. 125, 129, 699 A.2d 434 (1997). This is why \u201c[i]n most jurisdictions, including Baltimore County, subdivision regulations are enacted and codified separately.\u201d <em>Friends of the Ridge v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>352 Md. 645, 649 n. 4, 724 A.2d 34 (1999). In fact, the Court of Appeals has stressed that \u201c[t]he approval or disapproval of a development plan is simply not a \u2018zoning matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Finally, we observe that underlying all of appellants\u2019 arguments is the implication that Office of Planning and DEPRM failed to conduct a proper review of the property\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 1A03.5(A) and \u00a7 1A03.5(C). Appellants in effect claim that the County officials acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in making their recommendations. But, \u201cin the absence of evidence to the contrary, administrative officers ... [are] presumed to have properly performed their duties and to have acted regularly and in a lawful manner.\u201d <em>Md. Securities Com\u2019r v. U.S. Securities Corp., </em>122 Md.App. 574, 588, 716 A.2d 290 (1998). And, since appellants chose not to produce any evidence or even question the County representatives as to the basis for their recommendations, we must conclude that the agencies carried out their duties properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Appellants claim that the Board should have held as \u201cinvalid\u201d PDM\u2019s approval of the refined plan because \u201cit was procedurally irregular and not approved in a legal way.\u201d They argue that Elm Street took a \u201cquasi-e* <em>parte </em>approach\u201d at the DRC, which they describe as \u201ca kind of star chamber which caters to developers.\u201d They also claim that the approval of the plan was in any event \u201cnull and void\u201d because it involved \u201cthe amendment of a plan subsequently invalidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>by the circuit court.\u201d They further claim that the proposed change was \u201cmaterial\u201d in nature. Finally, they maintain that, if this Court agrees that the approval of the revised red-lined plan must be reversed, then the refined plan is \u201clikewise unsustainable for failure to prove satisfaction of conservancy area standards.\u201d We find no merit to appellants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Appellants fail to address the most important point here. The circuit court dismissed their case, not on the merits, but because it was moot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because \u201c[t]he failure of an appellant to raise an issue in the appellate court is usually deemed a waiver as to the issue,\u201d <em>Moats v. City of Hagerstown, </em>324 Md. 519, 525, 597 A.2d 972 (1991), appellants, we believe, have waived this issue. <em>See also Greenfield v. Heckenbach, </em>144 Md.App. 108, 120-21, 797 A.2d 63 (2002). As it is the basis of the circuit court\u2019s ruling, we need not proceed any further, but we nonetheless feel impelled to point out that even if the appeal were not moot, appellants\u2019 arguments have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">There was nothing in the County Code which prevented Elm Street from requesting, DRC from recommending, or PDM from granting approval of changes, material or otherwise, to the plan while an appeal, based on the original plan, was pending. The only restriction imposed by the Code, while such an appeal is pending, is that \u201ca permit may not be issued and a plat may not be recorded in connection with a Development Plan that is the subject of the appeal.\u201d Code \u00a7 32-4-281(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Appellants\u2019 claim that the refined plan was \u201cnull and void\u201d because \u201cit involved the amendment of a plan subsequently invalidated\u201d by the circuit court also fails, because the original plan was not \u201cinvalidated\u201d by the circuit court. The circuit court actually affirmed the Board\u2019s approval of the rest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>original development plan, only remanding two specific issues for approval. And the Code specifically allows the County to exempt certain changes to a development plan, such as \u201clot line adjustments\u201d and other amendments to an approved development plan which \u201cdo not materially alter the proposed development,\u201d from the requirement of a Community Input Meeting and hearing before the hearing officer. Code \u00a7 32-4 \u2014 106(b)(1)\u2014(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">We will not consider appellants\u2019 bald claim that \u201c[t]he proposed change here was material\u201d and hence that the refined plan, pursuant to Code \u00a7 32-4-262, had to be reviewed \u201cin the same way as the original plan\u201d because appellants present no argument as to why the change is material. <em>See, e.g., Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 552, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (\u201carguments not presented in a brief or not presented with particularity will not be considered on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">As for appellants\u2019 argument that \u2014 if we agree that the approval of the revised red-lined plan must be reversed, then the refined plan is \u201clikewise unsustainable for failure to prove satisfaction of conservancy area standards\u201d \u2014 we will not consider it as it was not argued below. Maryland Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">. The circuit court also rejected appellants' claim that they were \u201centitled to know what Glen Arm Homes, LLC intended] to do with the property in the future so they will know who will be in control of the property if it is transferred\u201d because appellants presented \"[n]o statutory authority nor case law\u201d in support of their argument. This claim was not raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-7\">.
