In language which had remained virtually unchanged since its original enactment, it provided at all times relevant to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\"Each sheriff may appoint 1 or more deputy sheriffs at his pleasure, and may revoke such appointments at any time * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33), which was enacted in 1969,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> concerns the specific subject of the arbitration of public police and fire department labor disputes. However, it does not state whether these disputes include \"grievance\u201d as well as \"interest\u201d disputes;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> nor does it mention any particular kinds of grievance disputes, such as those involving a discharge or failure to reappoint. At the time the dispute in this case arose, the arbitration statute stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\"Whenever in the course of mediation of a public police or fire department employee\u2019s dispute, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>pute has not been resolved to the agreement of both parties within 30 days of the submission of the dispute to mediation and factfinding, or within such further additional periods to which the parties may agree, the employees or employer may initiate binding arbitration proceedings by prompt request therefor, in writing, to the other, with copy to the labor mediation board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Our brethren contend that by enactment of this statute the Legislature implicitly intended <em>sub silentio </em>to repeal MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863 and require compulsory binding arbitration of grievance disputes, including those involving a sheriffs decision not to reappoint a deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">We must respectfully disagree. The Legislature plainly intended MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) only to provide for arbitration of \"interest\u201d disputes where the normal process of collective bargaining over the terms of a new contract has broken down. It has clarified that intention by a recent amendment to the statute. Since the statute does not apply to individual grievances like the present dispute, it is not necessary to consider whether it can be reconciled with the statute which empowers the sheriff to appoint and remove deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The plaintiff was first appointed to serve a term as a deputy sheriff in 1957. He was subsequently reappointed to successive terms by various sheriffs, including the defendant when first elected in 1969. At the end of 1972, however, the defendant informed him that he would not be reappointed for the coming term.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s decision not to reappoint the plaintiff included a detailed five-step <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>grievance procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Step 1 provided for discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>sion of the grievance with the sheriff or the sheriff\u2019s designated representative. The grievant could, if he so desired, be represented by his local union representative. If no mutually satisfactory resolution resulted from step 1, step 2 provided for further discussions at the departmental level. Step 3 provided for discussion of the grievance with the designated representative of the county board of commissioners, and for a written disposition of the grievance by that representative within 48 hours. Step 4 provided for a hearing before the same representative, and a written opinion within 48 hours. Step 5 provided for mutual consent arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The plaintiff filed a grievance pursuant to these procedures on the day he was informed by the defendant that he would not be reappointed for the coming term. At the hearing conducted before the representative of the board of commissioners, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>however, the plaintiff refused to respond to the written charges of misconduct leveled against him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The grievance was thereafter resolved against the plaintiff, and the defendant did not consent to submit the grievance to arbitration, as he had a right to do or not to do under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The plaintiff filed the instant action in circuit court, asserting, <em>inter </em>alia, that he was entitled to compulsory arbitration of his grievance. He alleged that he had been discharged solely because he had run against the defendant as a candidate for sheriff in the last election. The defendant denied this allegation and alleged that his decision not to reappoint the plaintiff was supported by just cause. Testimony and exhibits presented at trial revealed that this included an alleged failure by the plaintiff to follow jail security procedures, resulting in the escape of three prisoners, and an alleged misuse of sick-leave time, involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>plaintiffs campaigning for sheriff while on extended sick leave for hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The trial judge did not rule on the merits of the factual allegations made by the parties. Instead, he ruled as a matter of law that MCL 51.70;' MSA 5.863 controlled and supported the defendant\u2019s actions. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\"Appointment remains the prerogative of the sheriff. If that is going to be changed, it should be changed by the Legislature and not by judicial legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The plaintiff appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Leave to appeal was granted primarily to consider whether the Court of Appeals decision conflicted with this Court\u2019s previous decision in <em>Council No 23, Local 1905, AFSCME v Recorder\u2019s Court Judges, </em>399 Mich 1; 248 NW2d 220 (1976).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We are of the opinion that the Legislature did not intend that MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) would apply to individual grievance disputes. The sophisticated provisions of the police and fire department compulsory arbitration act, MCL 423.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.455(31) <em>et seq., </em>of which MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) is a part, are directed toward the resolution of major collective bargaining impasses and the prevention of police and fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>department employee strikes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They are inapposite to the resolution of individual employee grievance disputes, which may involve matters as trivial as the length of an employee\u2019s hair or the shine on his or her shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The plaintiffs union apparently recognized this fact. In conjunction with negotiation of the collective bargaining agreement preceding the agreement involved in the case at bar, the union initiated compulsory interest arbitration pursuant to MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) in an attempt to secure a compulsory grievance arbitration provision as a part of the agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That would have been unnecessary if MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) itself already provided for compulsory arbitration of grievance disputes. In <em>Grosse Pointe Farms Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Chairman of the Michigan Employment Relations Comm, </em>53 Mich App 173; 218 NW2d 801 (1974), the chairman of the Michigan Employment Relations Commission also recognized this fact. He denied a plaintiffs request pursuant to the act for appointment of an arbitrator to arbitrate a grievance dispute on the ground that the act was intended to cover only interest disputes and not grievance disputes. Although asked to decide the scope of the act in the <em>Grosse Pointe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Farms </em>case, the Court of Appeals declined to address the question because it believed that plaintiffs had improperly bypassed a fact-finding stage provided by their collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">However, when the issue of the scope of MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) reappeared in <em>Local 1325, Council No 55, AFSCME v McKervey, </em>62 Mich App 689; 233 NW2d 836 (1975), the Court of Appeals declared that the statute applied to grievance disputes as well as to disputes arising out of contract negotiations. Our brethren, without analysis, rely upon <em>McKervey </em>and would apply it to all individual grievance disputes occurring prior to the effective date of 1977 PA 303.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">A closer examination of <em>McKervey </em>reveals that the Court of Appeals broad reading of MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) was unnecessary to the decision. In that case, the circuit court had voided an arbitration award rendered pursuant to a procedure established in the collective bargaining agreement on the ground that the police and fire department compulsory arbitration act provided the exclusive mechanism for arbitration of police and firefighters\u2019 disputes and preempted any contractual arbitration provision. Ironically, the plaintiff bargaining unit, another local of the same AFSCME council to which Local 1518 belongs, argued on appeal that the act \"makes compulsory arbitration applicable only to pre-contract negotiations, not to disputes over rights arising under the collective bargaining contract\u201d. The Court of Appeals rejected that interpretation but recognized that the parties to a contract could establish their own non-statutory arbitration procedure which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>would take priority over the mechanism provided by the act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That principle would have been sufficient to resolve the <em>McKervey </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In the case at bar, the contract in effect on December 31, 1972, the date plaintiff Bruin filed his grievance, provided for binding arbitration as a fifth and final step only if the parties mutually agreed in writing. That provision represented the negotiated agreement of the bargaining unit and the county commissioners on the extent to which arbitration would be an available means of resolving individual grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Moreover, the Legislature amended MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) in 1977 to make clear that it did <em>not </em>apply to grievance disputes. (See fn 11.) We view this amendment as a repudiation of the dictum of <em>McKervey, </em>intended to clarify rather than to change the meaning of the statute and therefore entitled to retroactive application. The purported conflict which leads our colleagues to attempt to reconcile this section with the deputy sheriff removal statute is entirely nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The foregoing analysis is not inconsistent with our decision in <em>Council No 23 v Recorder\u2019s Court Judges, </em>399 Mich 1; 248 NW2d 220 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In that case a collective bargaining agreement had been entered into establishing a grievance procedure ending in binding arbitration which a probation officer claimed superseded a state statute providing a procedure for the removal of probation officers. In the instant case, the grievance procedure does not end in binding arbitration, and the employee is not claiming that the collective bargaining procedure supersedes the statute, but rather, that he has rights under another statute, the police and fire department compulsory arbitration act, which supersedes the sheriffs statutory powers of removal. We have already indicated our view that no such rights arise under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The Court of Appeals erred in holding, in reliance on <em>McKervey, </em>that MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) compelled binding arbitration of plaintiff Bruin\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">We reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b136-11\">Kavanagh, Levin, Ryan, and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Coleman, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b136-12\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">This case considers whether the discharge of a sheriffs deputy is covered by the mediation/arbitration provisions of the public employees relations act (PERA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or by the pre-existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>provisions of MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863 which permit a sheriff to discharge a deputy \"at any time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We hold PERA controls and affirm the Court of Appeals result.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Appellee, James Bruin, served as a deputy sheriff of St. Clair County from January 1, 1957 through December 31, 1972. In the fall of 1972, Deputy Bruin campaigned against appellant, Sheriff Meharg, for the position of Sheriff and lost. On December 31, 1972, Sheriff Meharg informed Deputy Bruin that he would not be reappointed as a deputy. Deputy Bruin filed a grievance challenging his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">There was a collective bargaining agreement adopted under PERA, MCL 423.215; MSA 17.455(15), covering the deputy sheriffs of St. Clair County. The parties to the agreement were the St. Clair County Board of Commissioners and Local 1518 of the St. Clair County Sheriff\u2019s Department Chapter, Council No. 55, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, the duly authorized collective bargaining agent for the deputy sheriffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Sheriff Meharg testified that although he had consulted with the commissioners and their negotiator concerning various provisions, he was not bound by the agreement because he was not a party. Yet, Sheriff Meharg complied with the agreement, even those provisions which he did not think proper. Article 12 of the agreement, discharge and discipline, provided \"[s]hould the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>charged or disciplined employee consider the charge to be improper, procedures outlined in the grievance procedure provisions of the agreement may be followed by the employee\u201d. Article 4 of the agreement established a five-step grievance procedure ending in binding arbitration by mutual consent only.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Deputy Bruin and Local 1518 brought suit in the circuit court against the sheriff and the Board of Commissioners. Deputy Bruin sought reinstatement and compulsory arbitration of the grievance he filed against the sheriff challenging his discharge. The request for compulsory arbitration was premised on the mandatory mediation/arbitration provision of PERA, MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The circuit court found that the sheriff\u2019s power of appointment created by MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863 was absolute. The Court of Appeals, 77 Mich App 145; 258 NW2d 168 (1977), reversed, holding that the collective bargaining agreement adopted under PERA and the mediation/arbitration provision of PERA, MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33), take precedence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We granted leave to appeal February 23, 1978, 402 Mich 881 (1978),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">\"limited to these questions: (1) can the Court of Appeals decision in this case (77 Mich App <em>145 </em>[1977]) be reconciled with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Council No 23, Local 1905, AFSCME v Recorder's Court Judges, </em>399 Mich 1 [248 NW2d 220] (1976); and (2) if the sheriffs authority under MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863 takes precedence over the collective bargaining agreement between the deputies and the county, is that authority absolute, or, are there safeguards which attach?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">II. Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">The issue in this case is whether defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>sheriff retains the power to discharge a deputy sheriff without following PERA procedures. If he has such power it is based on MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">\"Each <em>sheriff </em>may appoint 1 or more deputy sheriffs at his pleasure, and <em>may revoke such appointments at any time. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The PERA impacts this case in two ways. First, the PERA requires a public employer, such as the sheriff, to bargain collectively with his employees. MCL 423.215; MSA 17.455(15). This was the basis for the collective bargaining agreement reached between the employees in the sheriff\u2019s department and the Board of Commissioners of St. Clair County. The sheriff participated in the process in such a way that it is arguable as to whether or not he is bound by this specific contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Second, beyond the PERA provision requiring public employers to bargain collectively with their public employees, is the PERA provision requiring mediation/arbitration to be used in public police and fire departments, MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33). This police/fire department mediation/ arbitration provision applies to sheriff departments, because \"[p]ublic police * * * departments\u201d are defined to mean \"any department of a * * * county * * * having employees engaged as policemen\u201d. MCL 423.232; MSA 17.455(32). Sheriff\u2019s deputies certainly are \"engaged as policemen\u201d. The police/fire department mediation/arbitration provision read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">\"Whenever in the course of mediation of a public police or fire department employee\u2019s dispute, the dispute has not been resolved to the agreement of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>parties within 30 days of the submission of the dispute to mediation and fact-finding, or within such further additional periods to which the parties may agree, the employees or employer may initiate binding arbitration proceedings by prompt request therefor, in writing, to the other, with copy to the labor mediation board.\u201d MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Ultimately, the issue is whether the sheriffs power to revoke the appointment of deputies \"at any time\u201d granted by the prior MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863 persists despite the provisions of the later PERA impacting the sheriffs office as a public employer and as a public police department by MCL 423.215; MSA 17.455(15) and MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">III. Discussion of Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The case law does not leave us on a completely uncharted sea. Perhaps the strongest statement in favor of the dominance of the PERA is found in <em>Rockwell </em>v <em>Crestwood School Dist Board of Education, </em>393 Mich 616; 227 NW2d 736 (1975). In <em>Crestwood, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\"This <em>Court has consistently construed the PERA as the dominant law regulating public employee labor relations </em>[citing <em>Detroit Police Officers Association </em>v <em>Detroit, </em>391 Mich 44; 214 NW2d 803 (1974); <em>Regents of the University of Michigan v Employment Relations Commission, </em>389 Mich 96; 204 NW2d 218 (1973); and <em>Wayne County Civil Service Commission v Board of Supervisors, </em>384 Mich 363; 184 NW2d 201 (1971)].\u201d (Emphasis added.) 393 Mich 616, 629.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">We followed that statement up by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">\"[T]he supremacy of the provisions of the PERA is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>predicated on the Constitution (Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 48) and the apparent legislative intent that the PERA be the governing law for public employee labor relations.\u201d 393 Mich 616, 630.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In <em>Crestwood, </em>the majority of this Court held that since the case related to striking teachers, the PERA provision, which provided that striking public employees are entitled to a hearing only after discipline, prevailed over the teachers\u2019 tenure act provision, which provided that no teacher on tenure may be discharged until after notice and hearing. 393 Mich 616, 624-625. In other words, a specific provision prevailed over a general one.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On the other hand, in <em>Council No 23, Local 1905, AFSCME v Recorder\u2019s Court Judges, </em>399 Mich 1; 248 NW2d 220 (1976), this Court held that the general collective bargaining provisions of the PERA, MCL 423.215; MSA 17.455(15), did not prevail over the very specific probate officer removal statute providing for full due process, including among other things a hearing before the whole Recorder\u2019s Court. The majority in that case consisted of two opinions. Justice Lindemer\u2019s opinion, concurred in by Justices Coleman and Fitzgerald, punctuated this point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\" 'In case of conflict between 2 such legislative enactments, the special statute or code must prevail.\u2019 \u201d 399 Mich 1, 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">This opinion also stressed that the PERA arbitration could intrude on the judicial function. 399 Mich 1, 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Justice Williams\u2019 opinion, however, said the first rule was to harmonize the two statutes, if possible, and found that there was no \"positive repugnancy\u201d between the PERA\u2019s collective bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>gaining provision and the probation officer removal statute. 399 Mich 1, 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">IV. Application of Law to Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Turning to the instant case, we have the specific deputy sheriff removal statute confronted by two sections of PERA, the general collective bargaining section and the specific mediation/arbitration section for public police and fire departments. Our first special question in the limited grant of leave to appeal was whether the Court of Appeals decision upholding the PERA can be reconciled with the <em>Recorder\u2019s Court Judges </em>case upholding the probation officer removal statute against PERA\u2019s collective bargaining section. While the deputy sheriff removal statute is neither as detailed nor as specific as the probation officer removal statute, it is sufficiently specific to prevail against the same general collective bargaining provision of PERA, because there is no positive repugnancy between these. It would be possible for the sheriff and deputy sheriffs to bargain collectively about all their affairs except removal and permit the sheriff to remove deputies at any time. That is the lesson of <em>Recorder\u2019s Court Judges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">This leaves us with whether the police/fire department mediation/arbitration section is or is not positively repugnant to the deputy sheriff removal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) through statutory definition deals specifically with sheriff department employee disputes. As of the time of this case, the statute did not specify whether both \"grievance\u201d and \"interest\u201d disputes were involved, or only one or the other.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It simply read \"employee\u2019s dispute\u201d. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We do note that in <em>Local 1325, Council No 55, AFSCME v McKervey, </em>62 Mich App 689; 233 NW2d 836 (1975), the Court of Appeals held this section to apply to both \"grievance\u201d and \"interest\u201d disputes between a sheriff and his deputies. We concur. As a consequence, the language of MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33) deals specifically with the requirement for mediation/arbitration in sheriff department grievances dealing with discharge and other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">This may not be as specific as the PERA discipline procedure for striking public employees in <em>Crestwood, supra, </em>on the one hand, but, on the other hand, the deputy sheriff removal procedure is not as specific nor does it provide the due process procedures of the probation officer removal statute in <em>Recorder\u2019s Court Judges, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In other words, the argument for repugnance or nonrepugnance is not as simple and clear in this case as in our two leading cases above described. As a consequence, we are warranted to see whether there are any corollary indications of whether the Legislature intended a repeal by implication. There are two items that appear to at least suggest the direction of the Legislature\u2019s intentions. One goes to the importance assigned to the PERA police/fire department mediation/arbitration and the other to the importance assigned to the deputy sheriff removal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Item 1. Section 1 of the PERA police/fire department mediation/arbitration act (and we must consider the whole statute) states a definite public policy of the Legislature as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\"It is the public policy of this state that in public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>police and fire departments, where the right of employees to strike is by law prohibited, it is requisite to the high morale of such employees and the efficient operation of such departments to afford an alternate, expeditious, effective and binding procedure for the resolution of disputes, and to that end the <em>provisions of this act, providing for compulsory arbitration, shall be liberally construed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) MCL 423.231; MSA 17.455(31).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Item 2. In <em>Locke v Macomb County, </em>387 Mich 634; 199 NW2d 166 (1972), a unanimous Court held that MCL 51.351 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.1191(101) <em>et seq., </em>an act to provide optional civil service for sheriffs departments in certain counties and \"to regulate the transfer, reinstatement, suspension and discharge\u201d did supersede the deputy sheriffs removal statute, MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863. While this is not the PERA but a different statute, it does indicate that the Legislature does not completely hold with the idea of removal of deputy sheriffs at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Viewing the contrasting intentions of the Legislature with respect to the PERA police/fire department mediation/arbitration provision and the sheriff deputy removal statute as a whole, as well as the specific provision of the two statutes, we believe there is a strong legislative intention to support the morale of sheriffs department employees by giving them some protection in their jobs and this intention is directly repugnant to the idea that sheriffs can discharge deputies at pleasure without notice and hearing and without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">We therefore conclude (1) that MCL 423.233; MSA 17.455(33), the police/fire department media<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>tion/arbitration statute as of the time of the instant case superseded <em>pro tanto </em>MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863, the deputy sheriff appointment and removal statute, (2) that <em>Council No 23, Local 1905, AFSCME v Recorder\u2019s Court Judges, </em>399 Mich 1; 248 NW2d 220 (1976), and the decision in the Court of Appeals and in this Court can be reconciled, and (3) that since we have decided the PERA takes precedence, it is not necessary to determine the second question in the limited grant predicated on MCL 51.70; MSA 5.863 taking precedence. It is noted that this decision applies to grievance disputes occurring prior to the effective date of 1977 PA 303 which amends the language herein interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We affirm the Court of Appeals result.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-7\">J.
