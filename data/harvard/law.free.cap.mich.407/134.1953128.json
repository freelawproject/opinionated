Johnson, following his refusal to be sworn or to answer any questions before a citizens\u2019 grand jury, was fined $10,000 and sentenced to one year in jail. He would be released upon purging himself of the contempt or expiration of the grand jury term.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed and held that an indigent witness has a right under the Due Process Clause of the Michigan Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to assigned counsel at contempt proceedings in respect to a citizens\u2019 grand jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>A witness summoned to appear before a grand jury, whose testimony or failure to testify is such that contempt proceedings are initiated, requires the assistance of counsel because of the nature and purpose of the grand jury and contempt proceedings. Counsel could advise him regarding the efforts of the state to compel his testimony and how he could purge himself of the alleged contempt without waiving his Fifth Amendment privilege or involving himself in criminal proceedings, and also defend him in the contempt proceedings against the state\u2019s efforts to incarcerate him for failing to testify and, if he indicates a desire to purge himself of the alleged contempt, counsel him in further proceedings before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Fundamental fairness requires that, if indigent, a witness be provided with counsel at state expense since the state is the moving party in such contempt proceedings, since the state seeks to compel the witness\u2019s testimony, since waiver of Fifth Amendment privilege is involved, since by his testimony the witness may involve himself in the crimes being investigated and since the witness might avoid being held in contempt if counseled regarding his failure to testify and the manner in which he can purge the alleged contempt consistent with exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">A number of courts have held that an indigent witness cited for civil contempt of a grand jury is entitled to counsel at state expense; we find no contrary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Cases involving civil contempt for failure to obey orders in private litigation, where the state is not involved (typically involving non-payment of alimony or child support), are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Johnson, while an inmate in the state penitentiary at Jackson, was subpoenaed to testify before a citizens\u2019 grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">When called as a witness and asked to take the oath, he responded, \"I\u2019m taking the Fifth Amendment. I don\u2019t want no oath.\u201d \"I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here.\u201d The assistant prosecutor explained to him that the \"oath involves your swearing to tell the truth. Then you may assert your Fifth Amendment rights, and I will give you your rights after the oath has been administered.\u201d Johnson said, \"I won\u2019t take no oath.\u201d He did not respond to any other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The assistant prosecutor then advised Johnson that he had \"the right to remain silent\u201d, to have an attorney outside the grand jury room with whom he could confer and that \"[a]nything that you say can and will be used against you\u201d and that at any time he could \"exercise these rights and not answer any questions or make any statements\u201d. Johnson was asked whether he wished to have an attorney and was advised that if he could not afford an attorney he could \"petition the presiding judge of the circuit court for Wayne County and ask for the appointment of an attorney\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Johnson made no response to inquiries whether he understood his rights, wished an attorney and understood that he could petition the presiding judge for the appointment of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Johnson was then taken before a circuit judge who inquired whether he had been duly served with a subpoena. Johnson responded, \"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what this is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">The assistant prosecutor testified that the grand jury was engaged in the investigation of a homi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>cide, that Johnson had been removed from Jackson prison and brought before the grand jury on a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>Johnson had refused to be sworn. The assistant prosecutor had attempted to advise him of his constitutional rights \"as well as his statutory rights concerning his right to counsel\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Johnson had not answered any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The judge asked Johnson whether he wished to question the assistant prosecutor or say anything. He shook his head indicating a negative answer. The judge did not advise Johnson of the nature of the contempt proceedings, inquire whether he wished an opportunity to obtain counsel, whether he was indigent or desired that counsel be appointed for him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAy1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The judge then found Johnson guilty of contempt pursuant to MCL 767.19c; MSA 28.959(3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and pronounced the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">This Court, in <em>Artibee v Cheboygan Circuit Judge,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>held that an indigent defendant in a paternity action has a right under this state\u2019s Due Process Clause to appointed counsel, and, in <em>Sword v Sword,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that an indigent defendant need not invariably be provided with appointed counsel in proceedings to enforce a child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Our colleague would distinguish <em>Artibee </em>on the ground that the factual and legal issues in a paternity action are likely to be more complex than in civil contempt proceedings. Contempt proceedings ordinarily present a relatively simple factual issue which will be summarily determined without a jury in a proceeding not involving \"the complexities of fact-finding, jury persuasion or resolution of sophisticated legal issues\u201d involved in a paternity action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">While the <em>factual </em>issues in a contempt proceeding for failing to testify may be simpler than in a paternity action and, indeed, often there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>factual dispute, there may be difficult <em>legal </em>questions. A witness may be confused and probably is uninformed regarding the subtleties of Fifth Amendment analysis and cannot be expected to know how to exercise his privilege in a manner which will avoid contempt proceedings nor how to defend himself against the state\u2019s efforts to compel his testimony or incarcerate him for failure to, or until he does, testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Johnson had indicated to the prosecutor that he did not understand why he was there, that he did not wish to take the oath and desired to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege. He apparently thought that the Fifth Amendment protected him from taking the oath. He may have thought that if he took the oath or said anything he was waiving his Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He may have been so advised by a jailhouse lawyer before he left the prison for Wayne County.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Applying the test suggested by our colleague,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is \"reasonable likelihood\u201d that the nature of the matter is of such complexity that without the assistance of counsel Johnson was \"unlikely to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings, articulating his position or appreciating the options available to him\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Whenever a witness indicates that he wishes to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege as did this defendant (\"I\u2019m taking the Fifth Amendment\u201d), the issues are sufficiently complex to require the assistance of counsel and the appointment of counsel, pursuant to the Due Process Clause, for an indigent witness in contempt proceedings which may result in incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">If a lawyer whose function was to represent him and not the state had been appointed for Johnson, the lawyer could have informed Johnson that he could exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege after being sworn. Johnson might have had confidence in such a statement by <em>his </em>lawyer and might thereby have purged himself of the alleged contempt. Providing counsel to an indigent witness is consistent with this Court\u2019s statement: \"Defendants in contempt proceedings should be given every opportunity to exonerate themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">If a lawyer had been appointed for Johnson and had persuaded him to be sworn, the lawyer would have been available to provide counsel regarding and to defend his exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege in further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">A lawyer could, additionally, have raised legal defenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\u2014Johnson was punished pursuant to \u00a7 19c<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which provides for potentially greater penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>than the general contempt provisions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It appears that \u00a7 19c concerns neglect or refusal to testify after a grant of immunity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Johnson was not granted immunity. A lawyer might have argued successfully that a witness, not granted immunity, who appears before a grand jury is not subject to \u00a7 19c punishment merely because he refuses to be sworn, the more severe penalties being applicable only to witnesses who have been granted immunity. Since Johnson could not have been punished so severely for refusing to testify after being sworn, it is beyond the intendment of the statute to so punish him for refusing to be sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u2014A lawyer might have claimed that summary contempt proceedings were unjustified because the contempt was not in the presence of the court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u2014A lawyer might further have claimed that Johnson\u2019s failure to testify was innocent in that he thought he had (the assistant prosecutor told him he had) the right to remain silent. He did only what he was told he could do \u2014 he remained silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Our colleague says that Johnson is \"charged with no crime, faces no conviction\u201d. That is an assumption which ignores Johnson\u2019s assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege. Johnson may have faced criminal charges. He was called as a witness in an investigation of a homicide. Not infrequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>witnesses before grand juries implicate themselves in the crimes being investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">A grand jury investigation is, in a sense, more akin to a criminal prosecution than is a paternity action. It is an inquisition conducted by the state in which the witness generally sits alone without counsel at his side. Counsel, whether retained or appointed, generally must remain outside the grand jury room.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A result of the inquiry may be indictment of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The purpose of such civil contempt proceedings is to coerce testimony, to force the witness back into the grand jury room, to compel him to testify, to provide testimony which, indeed, may implicate him in the crime under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The United States Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fourth and Ninth Circuits have held or said that there is a right to counsel where there is a possibility of incarceration in civil contempt proceedings for failing to testify before a grand jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit so concluded in civil contempt proceedings for failing to comply with a court order requiring production of records for the Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The Colorado Supreme Court and the Maryland Court of Appeals have also held that there is a right to appointed counsel in civil contempt proceedings for failing to testify before a grand jury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>We find no contrary authority in contempt proceedings for failing to testify before a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Sword<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is not inconsistent with the disposition we think appropriate. Here there are the added factors of the state being the moving party, the state\u2019s purpose to compel testimony in a criminal investigation, and the witness\u2019s assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-8\">Kavanagh, Williams, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b272-9\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axm\">On August 13, 1975, David C. Johnson, an inmate at Jackson State Prison, was called before a Wayne County citizens\u2019 grand jury pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum. When presented to the grand jury, Johnson refused to be sworn or to answer any questions whatever. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was then taken before a circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>judge for a contempt hearing. During this proceeding the assistant prosecuting attorney from the office of the Wayne County Prosecutor, who summoned Johnson before the grand jury, was sworn as a witness and described the defendant\u2019s behavior before the grand jury. The trial judge asked the defendant if he wished to question the prosecutor about his testimony or if he wished to make any statement at all about his conduct before the grand jury. Defendant responded to both questions by shaking his head in a negative manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The circuit judge found Johnson in contempt, fined him $10,000 and sentenced him to confinement for one year or until the term of the grand jury expired, whichever occurred first. MCL 767.19c; MSA 28.959(3). The judge explained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Johnson that he could purge himself of the contempt by testifying before the jury panel as to any matter which would not be self-incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and sentence, holding that \"[t]he Michigan Constitution affords a due process right to counsel in a grand jury contempt proceeding under MCL 767.19c; MSA 28.959(3)\u201d. 77 Mich App 426; 258 NW2d 504 (1977). We granted leave to appeal. 402 Mich 848 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In addressing defendant\u2019s claimed right to the assistance of counsel, it is necessary to examine the nature of the proceeding at issue and the interests which may be affected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The principle is elemental that courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through contempt proceedings. <em>Shillitani v United States, </em>384 US 364, 370; 86 S Ct 1531; 16 L Ed 2d 622 (1966); <em>United States v United Mine Workers, </em>330 US 258, 330-332; 67 S Ct 677; 91 L Ed 884 (1947). Equally basic is the proposition that courts must be able to compel the appearance and testimony of witnesses in judicial proceedings. <em>United States v Bryan, </em>339 US 323, 331; 70 S Ct 724; 94 L Ed 884 (1950). In instances where a witness refuses to obey a court order to appear or testify in a judicial proceeding, the witness may be confined until the court\u2019s order is obeyed. <em>Shillitani v United States, supra, </em>at 370; <em>McCrone v United States, </em>307 US 61; 59 S Ct 685; 83 L Ed 1108 (1939). Witnesses refusing to appear or testify in response to the summons of the grand jury risk an adjudication of contempt and are subject to a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment not exceeding one year. A contemptuous witness is entitled to purge himself of the contempt and receive commutation of the sentence upon testify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ing before the grand jury. MCL 767.19c; MSA 28.959(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the case before us the court imprisoned the defendant for the purpose of compelling him to obey the order to testify. The sentence was clearly intended to operate in a prospective manner in order to coerce and not to punish the defendant. In terms of the commonly used expression, \"defendant carried the keys of his prison in his own pocket\u201d. Because by its very character and purpose such an adjudication and sentence is coercive and remedial, rather than punitive, it is deemed civil in nature. <em>Shillitani v United States, supra, </em>at 368; <em>Sword v Sword, </em>399 Mich 367, 380; 249 NW2d 88 (1976). As the court said in <em>Shillitani, supra: </em>\"While any imprisonment, of course, has punitive and deterrent effects, it must be viewed as remedial if the court conditions release upon the contemnor\u2019s willingness to testify.\u201d <em>Shillitani, supra, </em>at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">This analysis of the lower court proceedings is significant in order to properly identify the constitutional guarantees to which a defendant is entitled in such proceeding. Because the contempt proceeding is civil in nature, a defendant\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>counsel, if any, must be predicated upon US Const, Am XIV<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The right to the assistance of counsel, guaranteed by US Const, Am VI,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> binding upon and applicable to the states via US Const, Am XIV and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is inapplicable to the contempt proceeding below since that right to assistance of counsel is confined to criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In <em>Sword v Sword, supra, </em>a case involving an adjudication of contempt for disobedience of an order to pay child support, it was argued that on the rational of <em>Argersinger v Hamlin, </em>407 US 25; 92 S Ct 2006; 32 L Ed 2d 530 (1972), the threat of immediate imprisonment for as much as one year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>carried with it the right to assistance of counsel. In that connection this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">\"The heart of the argument in favor of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to an appointed attorney if he is indigent is that he may be incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\"There is heavy reliance upon <em>Argersinger v Hamlin, </em>407 US 25, 37; 92 S Ct 2006; 32 L Ed 2d 530 (1972), in which the United States [Supreme] Court held that 'absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at his trial\u2019. <em>Argersinger </em>contemplates punishment for a criminal act whereas civil contempt is remedial or coercive. The objective is to bring about compliance with a court order entered after trial, not punishment for the offense of which defendant was determined guilty at the time of trial.\u201d <em>Sword, supra, </em>at 380-381.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">While the assistance of counsel guarantees of US Const, Am VI via Am XIV, or Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20 are not applicable to a civil contempt proceeding, the defendant\u2019s due process rights, including the assistance of counsel, must be honored if fundamental fairness in the due process sense requires such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Drawing upon a portion of this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Artibee v Cheboygan Circuit Judge, </em>397 Mich 54; 243 NW2d 248 (1976), the Court of Appeals in this case focused upon the following three factors in concluding that the defendant had a due process right to counsel at his contempt hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\"First, the contempt proceeding is an action in which the power of the state is brought to bear against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\"Secondly, it is undeniable that a recalcitrant grand jury witness faces a substantial penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">\"Third, although the grand jury contempt hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>may not involve complex factual issues, it does involve complex legal and procedural issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">While the Court of Appeals very understandably looked to <em>Artibee, supra, </em>for precedential guidance on the right to counsel issue, we think the Court fixed its focus too narrowly on the three factors it enumerated and failed to distinguish between the nature of the proceeding involved here and those involved in <em>Artibee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">While the majority in <em>Artibee </em>discussed a number of considerations in reaching the conclusion that in paternity proceedings, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17 requires the appointment of counsel for an indigent person, the focus was less upon the three isolated factors enumerated by the Court of Appeals below than upon the broader consideration that paternity pretrial and trial proceedings are very much akin to a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In determining whether due process requires the assistance of counsel in paternity proceedings, Justice Fitzgerald wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\"Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, embodies this state\u2019s guarantee of due process of law. An analysis of what process is due in a particular proceeding must begin with an examination of the nature of the proceeding and the interests which may be affected by it. Paternity proceedings are quasi-criminal. The interests of the individuals affected are substantial, and the nature of the proceedings is sufficiently complex so as to require counsel to insure a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\"The statute requires that the county prosecute the action if the complainant is without the means to employ an attorney. Both Federal and state law provide a monetary incentive to prosecute. A defendant\u2019s interest in being free from bodily restraint is directly affected from the beginning of the proceedings, since a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>warrant may issue upon the filing of the complaint. Upon arraignment, a defendant\u2019s failure to make the required recognizance or cash deposit may result in his commitment to the county jail. Although the immediate consequence of the paternity judgment is an order of filiation and for support, the order is enforceable by contempt proceedings. Penalties for contempt include up to one year in the county jail or state prison or until the amount due is fully paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\"Not only will an indigent defendant be less likely to remain free from bodily restraint, but also an uncounseled defendant will be less able to defend himself at trial against an untrue allegation of paternity. In contrast with support ordered following divorce, there is often a sharply disputed factual question concerning the relationship of the parties to a paternity action. The object of the proceedings is to determine with finality the obligation of support, and not merely to determine on the basis of present circumstances an appropriate level of support. An unrepresented paternity defendant may be unaware of his obligation to file notice of alibi if he intends to rely upon that defense. He may be unaware of his statutory right to demand blood tests or unable to analyze the legal implications of the results.\u201d <em>Artibee, supra, </em>pp 56-58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Thus, in <em>Artibee, </em>there was involved the adversary process of quasi-criminal litigation with all the procedural complexities incident to warrant issuance, arraignment, setting bail, discovery, notice of defenses, jury voir dire and challenge, pretrial motions, the examination and cross-examination of witnesses expert and otherwise, closing argument, instructions to the jury, and verdict. By contrast, a civil contempt proceeding for failure to testify before a grand jury, while carrying potentially severe consequences, involves virtually none of the procedural and substantive complexities of a paternity trial. It is a proceeding of a summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>character with a purely remedial purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Normally such a proceeding, as is the case here, involves a single, simple issue: will the witness answer the question put to him in whatever fashion he deems appropriate or, upon refusal to answer, be imprisoned for the refusal? Typically, as seen in this case, the proceeding is brief, simple to understand and does not involve the complexities of fact-finding, jury persuasion or resolution of sophisticated legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">We wish to emphasize that while it is true that in civil contempt proceedings of the kind involved here, the defendant faces the serious prospect of immediate imprisonment for up to one year and a fine not to exceed $10,000, those dire consequences <em>alone </em>do not create a due process right to counsel. It is the potential complexity of the proceedings which may result in imposition of the serious penalties and not the penalties themselves which implicate the assistance of counsel guarantee of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Stated otherwise, due process does not require counsel in every instance in which the possibility of imprisonment exists, but depends upon circumstances showing that in view of the nature of the proceedings the defendant would probably suffer unfair treatment if counsel were not provided. See <em>Gagnon v Scarpelli, </em>411 US 778, 787-791; 93 S Ct 1756; 36 L Ed 2d 656 (1973); <em>Sword v Sword, supra, </em>at 381-383.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">While in <em>Argersinger v Hamlin, supra, </em>the court focused upon the fact of imprisonment for six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>months in declaring the existence of a Federal constitutional right to counsel in a misdemeanor prosecution, it must be remembered the Court did so only in cases of criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">That is not the case before us. The defendant, Johnson, is charged with no crime, faces no conviction or final adjudication and cannot be made to suffer an involuntary penalty. By obeying the court\u2019s order to appear and give testimony before the grand jury, the defendant can purge himself of the adjudication of contempt and cause his sentence to be commuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Instead of the three factors delineated by the Court of Appeals as the appropriate criteria to be examined for determining whether there is a due process right to counsel in a civil contempt proceeding of any kind, we think the following to be a better standard:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">If there exists a reasonable likelihood that the civil contempt proceedings by their very nature involve matters of such factual, procedural or substantive complexity that it must be concluded that without the assistance of counsel the defendant is unlikely to be capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings, articulating his position or appreciating the options available to him, or any one of them, then it must be said that the process due him includes the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Certainly all civil contempt proceedings for all defendants do not present such a situation. The need for assistance of counsel as a due process requirement must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Here, the defendant, in the grand jury chambers, before being asked any questions at all, refused to be sworn.

Johnson was called before a citizens\u2019 grand jury and fined $10,000, the maximum fine under MCL 767.19c; MSA 28.959(3).

He was told, rather, that if he could not afford an attorney he could <em>petition </em>the court and ask for appointment. Johnson might not have understood how one petitions a court. If a formal petition was required, it was probably beyond his ability to prepare. He was not assured that counsel would be appointed if he were indigent and did petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Another witness, not as cautious or, perhaps, as fearful as this witness, might have responded, \"Yes, I would like an attorney. Yes, I would like to make such a petition. How do I petition? Will the questioning stop if I tell you I want a lawyer?\u201d This witness did not, perhaps out of ignorance, misinformation, bad advice or just plain fear. Perhaps he was just obstinate and, indeed, contumacious in failing to make that response. But he cannot be so characterized and no such determination can be made without inquiry by a judge, not a prosecutor, after the witness has had an opportunity to obtain counsel, of whether he has a basis for asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege. Before any such inquiry by a judge, an indigent witness should be offered counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">In all events, the issue here is not whether counsel was properly offered at the grand jury proceedings, but whether Johnson was entitled to counsel at the contempt proceeding.
