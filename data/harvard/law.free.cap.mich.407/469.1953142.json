He ceased working for Eureka in 1974 because of a disabling degenerative disc disease for which he is now entitled to and does receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The question presented is whether the last employer, Eureka, should bear full responsibility for payment of the benefits due plaintiff or whether that responsibility should be shared by both employers. The hearing referee factually found that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition was caused by the repeated lifting and bending he was required to do in the course of his work for both employers. On the basis of this finding, the referee concluded that an apportionment of liability was required. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board accepted and independently verified the referee\u2019s factual findings, but rejected his legal conclusion. The appeal board ruled on the basis of public policy, administrative precedent and statutory interpretation that an apportionment was not permitted in cases involving back conditions such as that suffered by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals reversed the board and remanded for reinstatement of the referee\u2019s original order apportioning liability. Defendant Hosking now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals. Given the particular factual findings of the referee and the appeal board in this case, apportionment was proper. If it is better public policy (less issues to be decided by the WCAB) to excise from \"occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tional disease\u201d those having to do with the back, the Legislature is the proper forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The tire recapping process used by both defendants Hosking and Eureka required the plaintiff to engage in extremely repetitious and strenuous physical activity. The plaintiff testified that, in order to recap one tire, he had to lift the tire up and down into and out of various molds and machines a total of approximately 20 times. The lifting distance varied from three to four feet. The tires ranged in weight from 30 pounds to 150 pounds or more. The plaintiff did most of this lifting manually without help from his co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s work during his seven years at Hosking was much more demanding than his work during his three years at Eureka. At Hosking he was required to recap 50 to 60 tires per day, while at Eureka he was only required to recap 20 to 35 tires per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">After several minor back incidents in the course of his work at both Hosking and Eureka, the plaintiff suffered another incident at Eureka in December of 1973. Although he worked the rest of the day of this incident and continued to work thereafter, he remained in constant pain. He worked six more months until June of 1974 when the pain became too great and he was forced to cease work.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Two medical experts examined the plaintiff in connection with this case and both of them concluded that the plaintiff was suffering from \"degenerative disc disease\u201d. One of these experts, Dr. Sim, an orthopedic surgeon from Mayo Clinic, described this disease in lay terms as \"[b]asically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>* * * a worn-out disc\u201d and responded in the affirmative when asked whether this disease was a \"process rather than an occurrence type of injury\u201d. The other expert, Dr. Roberts, stated that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition was of a type that \"required prolonged stress, wear and tear, taking years to develop\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Because the plaintiff had not been examined by these experts during the seven years he had worked at Hosking and because there were no X-rays of the plaintiff\u2019s back dating from that period, neither doctor could state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether the degenerative disc disease had begun at Hosking and continued at Eureka or whether it had sprung up solely during the plaintiff\u2019s final three years at Eureka. Based on the data available to them, the doctors could only be certain that the disease had been present since the more serious incident suffered by the plaintiff at Eureka in December of 1973. However, Dr. Sim did testify that it was \"quite probable\u201d that the plaintiff\u2019s work at Hosking had either caused, contributed to, or accelerated the disease; and Dr. Roberts reiterated his view that the degenerative changes in the plaintiff\u2019s back, as evidenced by current X-rays, were of \"a type and result of rather prolonged wear and tear\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The hearing referee factually found that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition \"was not caused by any single event but was the result of repeated trauma caused by lifting and bending in the course of his employment with the two defendant companies\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the basis of this finding, the referee concluded that an apportionment of liability was required based on the respective lengths of time the plaintiff had worked for Hosking and Eureka.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Defendant Hosking appealed the referee\u2019s findings and decision to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition resulted solely from the single-event incident suffered by the plaintiff at Eureka in December of 1973 or from that incident plus subsequent aggravation caused by his continued employment at Eureka until June of 1974. Hosking contended that the plaintiff\u2019s condition was compensable by virtue of Chapter Three of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Chapter Three did not contain any apportionment provisions, there could be no apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The appeal board did not accept the factual propositions urged by defendant Hosking. The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\"First, we proceed to our fact finding. We accept the referee\u2019s factual conclusion and independently find that plaintiff\u2019s disability is the result of his heavy lifting duties at both employers.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The board then stated the legal question presented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\"Having made that finding, which directs that plaintiff\u2019s disablement is compensable by virtue of the provisions of Chapter 4 * * * are we required to apportion liability by application of Section 435?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The pertinent portion of \u00a7 435<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to which the board referred states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\"The hearing referee <em>shall apportion liability </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>compensation among the several employers in proportion to the time that the employee was employed in the service of each employer <em>in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due and in which it was contracted </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The board concluded that this statute should not be read to require apportionment in cases involving degenerative disc disease caused by repeated lifting duties at two or more employers. The board candidly admitted that this conclusion was based on a \"conscious policy determination\u201d by the board and its predecessors not to treat back conditions as diseases for purposes of apportionment under \u00a7 435.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The primary reason given by the board for this policy determination was the possibility of an increase in litigation and a concomitant increase in the length of time a claimant must wait for benefits if the statute were to be read so as to include back conditions. In closing, the board added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\"Should our decision here be subject to Court review, and should the Court find insufficient the argument of policy and administrative precedent urged here (which we deem more than sufficient), we urge the consideration of a statutory rationale arising out of definitional differences in Sections 401 and 435. In Section 401, * * * [the term 'personal injury\u2019 is defined to] 'include a disease or disability\u2019. Section 435 provides for apportionment among prior employers only for 'disease\u2019. Notwithstanding the medical term 'degenerative disc disease\u2019, occupationally-weakened backs could more appropriately be described by the term 'disability\u2019 than by the term 'disease\u2019 as the latter word is treated in common usage, and thus be excluded from the provisions of Section 435.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Defendant Eureka appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Court of Appeals. That Court reversed the board and remanded the case for reinstatement of the referee\u2019s original order apportioning liability. 79 Mich App 750; 263 NW2d 30 (1977). In its opinion, the Court first explained the purpose of the apportionment provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">\"Apportionment of financial liability for an employee\u2019s disease-caused disability is designed to reflect the relative contribution of similar employment conditions at each employer to the occurrence of the disability. In other words, the fortuitous event of a disability, which is but the culmination of a prolonged exposure of the employee to deleterious employment conditions at multiple employers, should not result in the imposition of a financial burden only upon the last in the series of employers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>754.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Court then interpreted the term \"disease\u201d in \u00a7 435 in light of this purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\"A disease is present for purposes of the apportionment statute whenever the evidence establishes that the compensable disability derives from the effects of continued and protracted exposure to the inherent elements of the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Finally, the Court compared the factual findings of the appeal board to this interpretation and concluded that the plaintiffs back condition did constitute a disease for purposes of \u00a7 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Defendant Hosking has now appealed the Court of Appeals decision to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The appeal board\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive in the absence of fraud. MCL 418.861; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>17.237(861). Thus, we are bound to accept the WCAB\u2019s factual finding (which has support in the record) that the plaintiffs back condition was not the result of the incident he suffered at Eureka in December of 1973 or the result of that incident plus subsequent aggravation at Eureka, but was instead the result of his heavy lifting duties for both employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The legal issue generated by this finding of fact is whether a medically recognized back disease caused by repeated duties in the normal course of an employee\u2019s daily routine constitutes a \"disease\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The appeal board does not have any authority to alter or modify a provision of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, by interpretation or otherwise, in order to square that provision with the board\u2019s perception of good public policy. That is solely the Legislature\u2019s prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The language used by the Legislature in \u00a7 435 is clear and straightforward. It requires an apportionment of liability according to the length of time the employee has worked for each employer \"in the employment to the nature of which the disease was due and in which it was contracted\u201d. Thus, the employee must be suffering from a \"disease\u201d which is \"due\u201d to the \"nature\u201d of his or her employment in order for the statute to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The plaintiffs back condition falls within the ordinary meaning of the language used by the \u2022Legislature in \u00a7 435. The <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, New College Edition (1975), </em>defines the word \"disease\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\"An abnormal condition of an organism or part, especially as a consequence of infection, inherent weakness, or environmental stress, that impairs normal physiological functioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Other dictionaries contain a similar definition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiffs condition is certainly \"abnormal\u201d, it was found to be a \"consequence of * * * environmental stress\u201d and it \"impairs\u201d his \"normal physiological functioning\u201d. In addition, the condition is considered a disease \u2014 \"degenerative disc disease\u201d \u2014by the medical profession. And the appeal board found it was caused by the nature of his employment at both employers \u2014 his \"heavy lifting duties\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The board would have us reject the ordinary meaning of the words used by the Legislature in \u00a7 435 by reference to \u00a7 401(c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the act which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\"Whenever used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\"(c) 'Personal injury\u2019 shall include a <em>disease or disability </em>which is due to causes and conditions which are characteristic of and peculiar to the business of the employer * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The board argues that because \u00a7 435 only authorizes apportionment for a \"disease\u201d and not for a \"disease or disability\u201d, apportionment was not meant to apply to a \"disability\u201d. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>board urges that because the plaintiffs back condition could be described by the term \"disability\u201d rather than by the term \"disease\u201d, there should be no apportionment in this case. <em>Ergo, </em>if the policy argument should fail, we could simply give the disease another name.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">This argument by the board is not a conclusive finding of fact that the plaintiffs back condition is a \"disability\u201d and not a \"disease\u201d. To the contrary, the argument is couched in a legal conclusion as to the meaning of the words used by the Legislature in \u00a7\u00a7 401(c) and 435, thus bringing it within the proper scope of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The first flaw in the board\u2019s legal argument is that it does not appear from a reading of the act that the Legislature, by using the phrase \"disease or disability\u201d in \u00a7 401(c), intended thereby to create two distinct classes of personal injuries. Section 401(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> defines the term \"disability\u201d in a manner at odds with the meaning which the board urges us to adopt. That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\"Whenever used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\"(a) 'Disability\u2019 means the <em>state of being disabled from earning full wages at the work in which the employee was last subject to the conditions resulting in disability. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">As so defined, the term \"disability\u201d represents a shorthand expression for the end result of a personal injury. It does not connote a class of personal injuries distinct from diseases. Many sections of the act, including \u00a7 435 itself, use the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\"disability\u201d in the same sense as defined by the Legislature in \u00a7 401(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Despite the Legislature\u2019s express definition of the term \"disability\u201d in \u00a7 401(a), the board would have us infer that the Legislature additionally intended that this term should designate a class of personal injuries distinct from diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">If we accepted this interpretation and the board\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition could more appropriately be described by the term \"disability\u201d than by the term \"disease\u201d, no benefits could be awarded in this case. Based on its factual findings, the board properly concluded that Chapter Four and not Chapter Three controlled. Section 415<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of Chapter Four, which delineates the circumstances under which benefits can be awarded, only authorizes the payment of benefits when the claimant\u2019s condition is \"caused by a disease\u201d. The phrase \"disease or disability\u201d is not used. Thus, under the board\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 415 would not apply to a \"disability\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">I do not believe that the Legislature intended such a result. Nor do I believe that in addition to the express definition of the term \"disability\u201d in \u00a7 401(a), the Legislature also intended that this term should have some other meaning when used in another section.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Legislature did intend to distinguish between a \"disease\u201d and a \"disability\u201d for purposes of apportionment under \u00a7 435, the board is also incorrect in its conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition could more appropriately be described by the term \"disability\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>than by the term \"disease\u201d as the latter word is treated in common usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">As noted above, the dictionary meaning of the word \"disease\u201d includes abnormal physiological conditions such as that suffered by the plaintiff and caused (the board found) by environmental stress. Also, both of the medical experts who examined the plaintiff diagnosed his condition as \"degenerative disc disease\u201d \u2014 in lay terms, \"a worn-out disc\u201d. The board found that this condition was the result of the plaintiff\u2019s heavy lifting duties at both employers. Those duties required the plaintiff to lift hundreds of thousands of tires each year for ten successive years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Professor Larson, speaking about \"occupational diseases\u201d in his treatise on workers\u2019 compensation law, states that \"repeated strains associated with the employment may supply the distinctive element necessary to make a back injury occupational\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">These factors <em>in toto </em>are too clear to permit obfuscation in order to avoid Eureka\u2019s claim under \u00a7435.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">This conclusion is consistent with a long series of cases in which this Court, in the course of interpreting other sections of the act, has treated back conditions caused by repeated heavy lifting duties as constituting or possibly constituting occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>pational diseases (whether or not degenerative disc disease was involved). See <em>Underwood v National Motor Castings Division, Campbell, Wyant &amp; Cannon Foundry Co, </em>329 Mich 273; 45 NW2d 286 (1951), <em>Fields v G M Brass &amp; Aluminum Foundry Co, </em>332 Mich 113; 50 NW2d 738 (1952), <em>Gibbs v Motor Wheel Corp, </em>333 Mich 617; 53 NW2d 573 (1952),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and <em>Braxton v Chevrolet Grey Iron Foundry Division of General Motors Corp, </em>396 Mich 685; 242 NW2d 420 (1976). It is also consistent with <em>Kalee v Dewey Products Co, </em>296 Mich 540; 296 NW 826 (1941), in which the plaintiff developed bursitis in her shoulder from repeated twisting motions required as a normal part of her work. This Court affirmed an award of benefits for an occupational disease. A worn-out shoulder is little different from a worn-out back.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\"><em>Dressier v Grand Rapids Die Casting Corp, </em>402 Mich 243; 262 NW2d 629 (1978), is inapposite to the case at bar. In <em>Dressier </em>the appeal board factually found that the plaintiff\u2019s back problem was the result of a single-event injury (a fall at work) and subsequent aggravations thereof. On the basis of this finding, the board conclud\u00e9d that Chapter Three controlled. There was no question about apportionment under \u00a7 435. The cases holding that certain back disabilities constituted occupational diseases were distinguished by Justice Williams in <em>Dressier </em>on the grounds that those \"cases involve situations where the plaintiff\u2019s back condition arose <em>gradually because of long and repeated bending, twisting, or lifting, even though there might also have been an incidental trauma\u201d. Id. </em>at 257. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In the case at bar, the board rejected the conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>tion that the plaintiffs back condition was caused by a single-event injury at Eureka in December of 1973 or by that injury plus subsequent aggravations thereof. Instead, the board found that it was caused by the plaintiffs repetitive heavy lifting duties for both employers. On the basis of this finding, the board properly concluded that Chapter Four controlled. Thus, the fact-facting in <em>Dressier </em>is essentially the opposite of the situation presently before us and the language of the opinion is supportive of this opinion. The cases distinguished by the majority in <em>Dressier </em>are particularly applicable to this case because of the fact-findings by the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The appeal board in the case at bar failed even to mention that the purpose of \u00a7 435 is to distribute equitably the liability for a disease caused by similar employment conditions among the employers who were responsible for those conditions. We agree with the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 435 should be interpreted with this purpose in mind. Indeed, the position advocated by the appeal board and Justice Williams insulates the employer (Hosking) whose operation placed the most stress on plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Unfortunately, the board also failed to discuss the very real possibility that if back conditions such as that suffered by the plaintiff were not apportionable, employers can be expected to refuse to hire persons who have worked previously in occupations which require repeated heavy lifting duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Although the policy considerations toward the reduction of issues in the crowded WCAB docket are understandable, it is not the function of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>judiciary to override legislatively expressed public policy in order to implement its own views.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The drafters of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act clearly intended that similar multiple employments, through which an occupational disease finally progressed to a compensable disability, should share proportionately in the payment of benefits. In this case, Mr. Derwinski was found by both the referee and the WCAB to have a degenerative disc disease caused by work in the two employments. That finding is conclusive and requires apportionment of liability.

The Court of Appeals reversed the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) and found benefits due for this back injury should be apportioned. We find that action unwarranted and remand for reinstatement of the decision of the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Plaintiff was employed as a tire recapper at Hosking Tire Company (hereinafter Hosking) from 1964 to 1971. During the course of this employment, which involved lifting of heavy tires, he suffered two specific incidents of back injury: one in December of 1964 as a result of which he lost two days of work and another in 1967 or 1968 (plaintiff could not recall the specific date).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">In October of 1971 he quit his job over a wage dispute and went to work for Eureka Tire Company (hereinafter Eureka) in the same capacity. At Eureka he also suffered two incidents of back injury: one in May of 1973 which resulted in no loss of work and another on December 19, 1973. This last injury (during which plaintiff felt a \"big rip\u201d in his back) was the one which left plaintiff in pain and unable to continue working.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition for compensation was filed against defendant Eureka, the last employer, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>subsequently filed a motion seeking apportionment of any benefits between it and prior employers under MCL 418.435; MSA 17.237(435), which applies only to occupational diseases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over objection of defendant Hosking, it was thereby made a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Testimony of plaintiffs experts, Dr. Franklin Sim, an orthopedic surgeon from the Mayo Clinic, and Dr. Warren J. Roberts, also an orthopedic surgeon, adduced that plaintiff was suffering from a back disability currently diagnosable as a degenerative disc disease but neither doctor could corroborate the existence of that particular malady prior to the December, 1973 injury. Dr. Sim, in response to a hypothetical question describing the three injuries occurring prior to December, 1973, indicated that if plaintiff had suffered prior injuries, those injuries were not signs of degenerative disc disease. Dr. Sim concluded that plaintiffs disability stemmed from the December, 1973 injury-_</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Dr. Roberts testified based on the medical history as related by plaintiff, that but for the December, 1973 incident, plaintiff might still be working, and that he had no idea what prior X-rays showed and he could not \"say degenerative disc disease was present at any\u201d time prior to his examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The administrative law judge found the disability was caused by the repeated trauma in the course of both employments and ordered apportionment. The WCAB reversed as to apportionment, 1977 WCABO 540. In this regard it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\"[B]ack disabilities have never been apportioned, even when found compensable by virtue of Part VII (old act) or Chapter 4 (current act). Such failure or tacit refusal represents, I submit a conscious policy determination by this board, prior boards and our judicial reviewers on past and present courts, not to treat back conditions as a 'disease\u2019 for purposes of Section 435 apportionment.\u201d 1977 WCABO 542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The policy and practical reasons for denying apportionment in such cases were explained in the WCAB opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\"There is good reason for this tacit understanding by bar, board and courts that apportionment of back disabilities is a morass into which we ought not be drawn. Such treatment would enure to the benefit of virtually no participants in this system of social legislation, and would actually impede the administration of our act. No injured worker would receive an additional cent or dollar for his disablement. The total cost of workmen\u2019s compensation in the State of Michigan would neither increase nor decrease \u2014 except to the extent that additional legal costs would be incurred by defendants engaged in internicine <em>[sic] </em>battles over shares of liability. But what <em>would </em>happen is that the predictable increase in disputed, litigated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>appealed cases would further burden an administrative system already unable to properly meet its statutory obligation to 'promptly review\u2019 such cases (Section 859). Employees waiting for determination of their eligibility for benefits, and employers paying disputed benefits under Section 862 while appeals pend, would both have to wait just a little bit longer.\u201d 1977 WCABO 543.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that plaintiff was suffering from an occupational disease apportionable under the statute, 79 Mich App 750; 263 NW2d 30 (1977). Defendant Hosking has applied for leave to appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">II. Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The issue is not whether plaintiff is entitled to compensation, but rather whether plaintiff\u2019s disability is an occupational disease within the contemplation of MCL 418.435; MSA 17.237(435), which should result in apportionment of benefits between the two employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">III. Apportionment</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">The WCAB, in their findings of fact, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">\"We accept the referee\u2019s factual conclusion and independently find that plaintiffs disability is the result of his heavy lifting duties at both employers. Notwithstanding the best-remembered incident in December of 1973, we find plaintiffs heavy work continued thereafter and aggravated the condition found by * * * [the testifying doctors].\u201d 1977 WCABO 541.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Additionally, the WCAB came to the conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s injury was compensable by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>MCL 418.401(c); MSA 17.237(401)(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which defines a \"personal injury\u201d as a \"disease or disability\u201d and then found that in this case, \"[notwithstanding the medical term 'degenerative disc disease\u2019, occupationally-weakened backs could more appropriately be described by the term 'disability\u2019 than by the term 'disease\u2019 * * 1977 WCABO 543. Because the statute providing for apportionment, MCL 418.435; MSA 17.237(435), refers only to \"diseases\u201d, the WCAB found there could be no apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the WCAB, and found plaintiffs condition does constitute a \"disease\u201d and is therefore subject to apportionment. <em>Derwinski v Eureka Tire Co, </em>79 Mich App 750; 263 NW2d 30 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">To fully resolve the issue presented in this case, we find it necessary to enter into a twofold analysis: (1) was the Court of Appeals reversal based on their determination that plaintiff is suffering from an occupational disease warranted, and (2) if not, does the fact that the WCAB found plaintiffs disability to be a Chapter 4, \u00a7 401(c) disability necessitate a finding that \u00a7 435 apportionment applies?</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\n<em>A. Disability or Disease</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The WCAB, as quoted <em>supra, </em>specifically found that plaintiff was suffering from a disability under MCL 418.401(c); MSA 17.237(401)(c), and not a disease. However, the Court of Appeals panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>treated the question as one of law and fact. That Court formulated a legal definition of occupational disease and then proceeded to analyze the facts as found by the WCAB under its definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">The Court of Appeals found the dispositive issue to be, \"whether an employment-related injury that results from the nature of an employee\u2019s work duties is a 'disease\u2019 as that term is used in the apportionment statute\u201d, <em>Derwinski, supra, </em>752, and defined the term \"disease\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\"A disease is present for purposes of the apportionment statute whenever the evidence establishes that the compensable disability derives from the effects of continued and protracted exposure to the inherent elements of the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Derwinski, supra, </em>754.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The Court of Appeals held that since the WCAB had found \"plaintiffs disability is the result of his heavy lifting duties at both employers\u201d, the personal injury suffered in this case is a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">We find the reasoning of the Court of Appeals unacceptable for two reasons. First, the definition of \"disease\u201d advanced by that Court categorizes disease as a particular type of \"compensable disability\u201d. The use of the terms \"disease or disability\u201d within the statutory definition of \"personal injury\u201d, \u00a7 401(c), however, indicates that the Legislature had intended to make a clear distinction between these two terms and that one is not merely a form of the other. See <em>Skowronski v Ajax Forging &amp; Casting Co, </em>54 Mich App 136; 220 NW2d 725 (1974). That disease is a separate and distinct compensable condition from disability is further evidenced by the very different treatment it receives in subsequent sections of Chapter 4, for example, \u00a7\u00a7 431 and 435, see Part III, B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The second reason we find the Court of Appeals definition of \"disease\u201d unacceptable is that it is entirely too broad. When \"disease\u201d is defined as deriving \"from the effects of continued and protracted exposure to the inherent elements of the employee\u2019s employment\u201d, many types of injuries clearly not diseases as that term is used under the act would require recategorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">This is demonstrated by <em>Dressler v Grand Rapids Die Casting Corp, </em>402 Mich 243, 256; 262 NW2d 629 (1978), decided by this Court earlier. One of the issues in <em>Dressier </em>was whether a back injury in that case was an occupational disease. In <em>Dressier </em>a disabled plaintiff suffered back problems in a series of employments involving heavy lifting, and purposely concealed this history in order to secure his final employment. During the final employment, plaintiff\u2019s back condition worsened and ultimately precluded further work activity. Under \u00a7 431, purposeful concealment of a <em>disease </em>would preclude recovery from the employer from whom the disease was concealed. The WCAB specifically found that plaintiff was suffering from a personal injury which was not a disease. The WCAB found plaintiff was disabled under \u00a7 301; \"plaintiff\u2019s subsequent employment with defendant * * * aggravated his pre-existing back condition and injury to the point of total disability on and after his last day of work * * <em>Dressier, supra, </em>254.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Under the definition of \"disease\u201d framed by the Court of Appeals in the instant case, the finding of the existence of back problems which under the facts of <em>Dressier </em>were derived from the effects of continued exposure to inherent elements of the employment (heavy lifting) while employed by both employers would also have required a finding that plaintiff was suffering from a disease. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ever, in <em>Dressier, </em>the majority of this Court refused to reverse the findings of fact of the WCAB and found ample support in the record for the WCAB\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Many types of personal injuries could easily come within the definition of disease employed by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, that definition is so broad that anything other than a single event injury resulting in immediate inability to work could fall within its scope, <em>i.e., </em>any injury aggravated by the duties in subsequent employment. We cannot agree that the legislative intent is consistent with that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Clearly \"disease\u201d as used under the act is not an easy term to define. It is not defined by the present act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but has most commonly been applied to certain types of injuries common to specific industries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are in no better position to specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>define \"occupational disease\u201d without more legislative guidance than was the Court of Appeals. There are certain conclusions we can and do reach, however:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">1. Back injuries do not appear to be the type of compensable events normally found to be occupational diseases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">2. The Court of Appeals definition of occupational disease is unacceptable for the above-stated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">3. Although the definition of \"disease\u201d under the act is inexact, we cannot say that the WCAB made a definitional error of law in finding that plaintiff was suffering from a disability and not a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">4. Whether an injury is an occupational disease is generally a question of fact, <em>Dressier, supra, </em>256, and in this case there is support in the record for the factual findings of the WCAB.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Those findings are therefore conclusive. See Const 1963, art 6, \u00a728.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Under these circumstances we find the WCAB\u2019s interpretation of a \u00a7 401(c) disability and its application to these facts were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">\n<em>B. Apportionment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">It is asserted that because the WCAB found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>plaintiffs personal injury to be a Chapter 4, \u00a7 401(c) injury, the apportionment portion of Chapter 4, MCL 418.435; MSA 17.237(435), must also apply. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Despite the few cases in which a back disability was termed a disease, see fn 5, <em>supra, </em>our research has disclosed no cases in Michigan which have authorized apportionment in the case of back disability. This lack of precedent was noted and discussed by the WCAB:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\"[B]ack disabilities have never been apportioned, even when found compensable by virtue of Part VII (old act) or Chapter 4 (current act). Such failure or tacit refusal represents * * * a conscious policy determination by this board, prior boards and our judicial reviewers on past and present courts, not to treat back conditions as a 'disease\u2019 for purposes of Section 435 apportionment.\u201d 1977 WCABO 542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">This lack of precedent is, of course, not determinative if apportionment is necessitated by the statute, but we do not believe it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Under the act, apportionment is authorized only in the case of a disease (see fn 1, <em>supra). </em>The statutory section under which the WCAB awarded compensation, MCL 418.401(c); MSA 17.237(401)(c), refers to both a \"disease or disability\u201d. We do not find this difference in statutory coverage mere oversight on the part of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In <em>Skowronski v Ajax Forging, </em>54 Mich App 136; 220 NW2d 725 (1974), the Court of Appeals was faced with a challenge to the WCAB\u2019s determination that a work-related hearing loss was nonapportionable under MCL 418.435; MSA 17.237(435). That Court stated in regard to \u00a7 435:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\"This statute is obviously predicated upon the assumption that the employee must be suffering from an occupational disease before the rest of the section is to apply. As has already been stated, the board found that plaintiff\u2019s injury was noise-induced. * * * We are bound to agree. We do not believe that a noise-induced hearing loss is an occupational disease within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1969 for compensation purposes. The act does not clearly define what an occupational disease is, but MCLA 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301X1) makes an unmistakable distinction between a disease and an injury not attributable to a single event. This distinction is reverberated in MCLA 418.401(c); MSA 17.237(401)(c) * * *. Having gone to such lengths to maintain this distinction throughout the new act, the Legislature was obviously aware of it when it approved an apportionment section that mentioned only disease-caused disabilities. The legislative failure to specifically include the other kinds of disabilities, which had been repeatedly distinguished from diseases, must be viewed as a deliberate exclusion from the coverage of the apportionment section. Therefore, it would be improper to consider plaintiff\u2019s injury covered by the apportionment section.\u201d <em>Skowronski, supra, </em>141-142.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We agree that the statute does distinguish between personal injuries which are diseases and personal injuries which are disabilities, that apportionment applies only to the former, and that, under competent evidence upon which the WCAB based their unanimous determination, apportionment is not authorized in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The WCAB determined that plaintiff was suffering from a disability under \u00a7 401(c) and not a disease, and therefore apportionment was not statutorily authorized. We find competent evidence to support that determination. We, therefore, reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the findings of the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b625-5\">Blair Moody, Jr., J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> 1937 PA 61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> \"Definition.

Further, as indicated <em>supra, </em>this case is factually similar to <em>Dressier, supra, </em>very recently decided by this Court, in which we affirmed a finding that a back injury was not a disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
