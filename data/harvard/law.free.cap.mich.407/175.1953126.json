If he does not, he looks then to the insurer of a relative domiciled in the same household. It is only when there is no policy issued to anyone in his household that the statute permits him to claim benefits from the insurer of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">4) The provision of the no-fault act authorizing the commissioner to approve deductibles is not an invalid delegation of authority. <em>Porter </em>is remanded to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the $5,000 deductible provision is otherwise invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Randy Craig Underhill was injured when the motorcycle he was operating collided with an automobile insured under a no-fault policy issued by Safeco Insurance Company. He required hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and other medical care and was temporarily unable to work. Underhill lived alone and did not own an automobile. His motorcycle was insured for liability but not for no-fault benefits. Underhill claimed benefits from Safeco. The circuit judge entered a summary judgment in his favor and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">Philip Porter was injured when his motorcycle was struck by an automobile insured by Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Company. Porter lived with his father, who owned an automobile insured by Michigan Mutual Liability Company. The father\u2019s policy included a \"limits of liability\u201d clause providing for a $5,000 deductible where the injury arises out of the use of an owned motorcycle by the \"named insured or relative\u201d. Porter commenced this action seeking no-fault benefits from Michigan Mutual and argued that the $5,000 deductible was contrary to the act, that the delegation of authority to the commissioner to approve deductibles was without standards and therefore unconstitutional, and that the deductible unconstitutionally divided motorcyclists into two classes. He sought benefits from Aetna in the alternative. Aetna is no longer a party to the action. The circuit judge held that motorcyclists are excluded from the act and entered a partial summary judgment for both insurers. The Court of Appeals reversed and held that motorcyclists can recover under the act, and that Porter was entitled to recover from his father\u2019s insurer. We affirm. It also held that the $5,000 deductible was approved pursuant to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; we vacate that holding and remand to the Court of Appeals to determine the validity of the deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">In <em>Underhill, </em>Safeco argues that a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>scheme which permits motorcyclists to recover no-fault benefits without requiring them to purchase no-fault insurance violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Although Michigan Mutual had taken much the same position in earlier phases of the <em>Porter </em>litigation, in this Court it concedes that motorcyclists are entitled to no-fault benefits when they sustain bodily injury in accidents involving motor vehicles and that motor vehicle no-fault insurance issued to the motorcyclist or a member of his family in the same household is made primary by the act. It asserts that the $5,000 deductible is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Shelby Mutual, as amicus curiae in <em>Porter, </em>argues that the insurance covering the motor vehicle involved in the accident should be primary in all cases where the claimant was not an occupant of a motor vehicle, <em>i.e., </em>when injured as a pedestrian, bicyclist or, by reason of the definition of \"motor vehicle\u201d, as a motorcyclist although the injured person or a member of his family in the same household has no-fault insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The no-fault act requires that owners of \"motor vehicles\u201d maintain security for payment of no-fault benefits. Motorcycles are excluded from the definition by providing that a \"motor vehicle\u201d has more than two wheels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is separately provided, however, by a 1975 amendment to the act, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>owners of motorcycles must maintain security for public liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">Motorcyclists thus, although required to maintain security for injuries caused to third parties through their negligence, are not required to purchase insurance providing no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">All parties appear to concede that by its terms the act entitles motorcyclists to no-fault benefits when they are involved in accidents with motor vehicles. Benefits are payable for \"accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a motorcyclist is not among those whom the Legislature has excluded from benefits;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he is among those covered by the \"while not an occupant\u201d language of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">It would not be consistent with the structure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the no-fault act \u2014 designed to provide no-fault benefits to the populace at large for loss suffered as the result of an accident involving a motor vehicle \u2014 to infer a legislative purpose, inconsistent with the language of the act, to exclude motorcyclists from its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The act may not be construed as excluding the <em>motorcyclist </em>from its coverage for all purposes merely because <em>motorcycles </em>are excluded from the statutory definition of motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We hold that, under the terms of the no-fault act, motorcyclists are entitled to claim no-fault benefits when they are injured in accidents involving motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Safeco contends that the act abridges the due process and equal protection rights of owners of motor vehicles. Although the Legislature requires the motorcycle owner to maintain security for liability to third parties and in doing so likens him to the automobile owner, it groups him with pedestrians and bicyclists when defining the obligation to provide no-fault benefits. He is not required to purchase no-fault insurance but he may claim no-fault benefits when he is injured in an accident involving a motor vehicle. This system benefits motorcyclists at motor vehicle owners\u2019 expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Safeco does not argue that only those who contribute to the fund out of which no-fault benefits are paid can constitutionally be permitted to receive benefits from the fund. To do so would be to argue that pedestrians and occupants of motor vehicles who do not own motor vehicles, and therefore do not purchase no-fault insurance, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>collect benefits when they are involved in motor vehicle accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">Safeco argues, rather, that motorcycles are motor vehicles and there is no rational reason for treating them differently from other motor vehicles. As a result of the legislative scheme there are two classes of vehicles, both free to operate on the public streets, and both capable of becoming involved in accidents causing injury, death and property damage. The owners of only one class are required to purchase no-fault insurance although the operators of both are entitled to no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">In <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554; 267 NW2d 72 (1978), cert den 442 US 934 (1979), this Court held that the Legislature could constitutionally relieve motorcycle owners of the obligation to purchase no-fault insurance for themselves and others involved in accidents with them. The question now before us is whether motorcyclists can rationally be included among those who may claim no-fault benefits under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">When the Legislature excluded motorcycles from the statutory class of motor vehicles, it not only excused their owners from the obligation to purchase no-fault insurance but also excluded motorcycles from the class of vehicles which give rise to a claim for no-fault benefits when involved in an accident. Thus, when a motorcycle is involved in an accident which does not involve a motor vehicle, no claim to no-fault benefits arises. If an automobile driver loses control and suffers accidental bodily injury as a result, he is entitled to benefits whether another vehicle is involved or not. A motorcyclist would not be entitled to benefits under the same circumstances. Similarly, if an automobile driver suffers injury in an accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>with a pedestrian or a motorcyclist, he is entitled to no-fault benefits. A motorcyclist sustaining injury in an accident involving a pedestrian or another motorcycle is not eligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Although generically motor vehicles, motorcycles are sufficiently distinct from automobiles to be constitutionally singled out for distinct treatment. In <em>Shavers </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\"The actuarial data in the record tends to show that motorcycles are rarely at fault in motor vehicle accidents. Also, there was extensive testimony to the effect that in accidents involving motorcycles the drivers and passengers of motorcycles are killed or severely injured at a rate twice exceeding that of those involved in automobile accidents. Thus the inclusion of motorcycles in a no-fault system would result in insurance premiums so high as to preclude most motorcyclists from purchasing insurance. We believe these are, for purposes of satisfying equal protection, legitimate governmental interests. The exclusion of motorcycles from coverage under the No-Fault Act is, quite evidently, reasonably related to these legitimate interests.\u201d <em>Shavers v Attorney General, supra, </em>pp 633-634.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The same factors which support a legislative determination to exempt motorcycle owners from the obligation to maintain no-fault insurance coverage, thereby treating them differently from other motor vehicle owners, provide adequate rationale for the decision to permit motorcyclists, like bicyclists and pedestrians, to claim benefits when injured in accidents involving motor vehicles:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u2014The motorcycle-motor vehicle accident is much like the bicycle-motor vehicle accident. Motorcycles do comparatively little damage to motor vehicles and their operators. Motorcyclists are likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>suffer substantial injuries in accidents involving motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u2014Motorcyclists, according to the record made in <em>Shavers,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are \"rarely at fault in motor vehicle accidents\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Legislature could therefore rationally conclude that motorcyclists, like bicyclists, should receive no-fault benefits for injuries received in accidents involving motor vehicles although they do not maintain no-fault insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The dissenter in the Court of Appeals would hold that Philip Porter may not claim no-fault benefits under his father\u2019s policy but should claim them from the insurer of the owner of the motor vehicle involved in the accident. It is argued that this conclusion finds support in the language of the act and better serves its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Under this view \u00a7 3114(1)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> merely establishes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>priority between insurers where the injured person is insured under his own no-fault policy and also under the policy of a family member in the same household.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Adoption of this view would mean not only that motorcyclists could not recover under the no-fault policy of a household member, but that they could not recover under their own policies if they own a motor vehicle with no-fault coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>further mean that no owner of a motor vehicle could recover from his own insurer unless he was injured while an occupant of the insured vehicle or was struck by that vehicle while a non-occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">Consequently, if a person is struck as a pedestrian or bicyclist by a vehicle not owned by him or is injured while an occupant of such a vehicle he would be required to claim no-fault benefits from the insurer of the vehicle involved in the accident although he is the owner of the vehicle insured for no-fault benefits. If the involved vehicle was uninsured he would claim through the assigned claims plan,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> notwithstanding that he had purchased a no-fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">It is our understanding of the legislative purpose that it was intended that injured persons who are insured or whose family member is insured for no-fault benefits would have primary resort to their own insurer. Since their own insurer would be primarily responsible, there would be an incentive for the insurer to deal promptly and fairly with the customer. Additionally, making the owner\u2019s or family member\u2019s insurer primary may reduce the cost of insurance by facilitating the use of deductibles to avoid duplicative coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">A construction of the act which would require resort to the insurer of the involved motor vehicle whenever there is a one-vehicle accident would not be consistent with those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Moreover, unless the household provision of \u00a7 3114(1) authorizes a claim against the owner\u2019s or family member\u2019s insurer, it serves little apparent purpose because if the household member is injured in the policyholder\u2019s automobile, he claims against its insur\u00e9r simply because he was an occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>pant of that vehicle at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, under the alternative construction which we reject, if he was injured while an occupant of or when struck by another vehicle he must claim against that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\">The Legislature might have structured a no-fault act around the involved vehicle and such an act might make more sense to some people.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It followed, however, the approach of most states and of the uniform act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to make the owner\u2019s or family member\u2019s insurer primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">We conclude that the owner\u2019s or family member\u2019s insurer is primary and that there may be resort to the insurer of the involved vehicle only when neither the injured person nor a family member in whose household he is domiciled is insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The no-fault policy issued to Porter\u2019s father by Michigan Mutual contained a \"limits of liability\u201d clause which provided that \"any amount payable by the company for personal protection benefits shall be reduced by $5000 if the named insured or relative sustains bodily injury while occupying a two (2) wheel motor vehicle owned by the named insured or a relative\u201d. Porter\u2019s father could have purchased an endorsement for an additional pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>mium which would have eliminated that limits of liability clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Michigan Mutual argues that the limits of liability clause, which was approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, is an \"[a]ny other deductible\u201d authorized by \u00a7 3109(3) of the act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Porter argued, and the Court of Appeals held, that the delegation to the commissioner of the power to approve deductibles was unconstitutional because it did not provide standards to guide his exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Whether a due process test<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or a safeguards against abuse of discretion test<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is applied, the standards and procedures are sufficient to sustain the delegation. In authorizing deductibles the commissioner is guided by the purpose of the no-fault act and the general provisions of the Insurance Code. No deductible may thwart the purposes of the act as enunciated by the Legislature and elucidated by this Court in <em>Shavers. </em>The commissioner is also governed by the Insurance Code in his exercise of discretion. Among the code\u2019s provisions are MCL 500.210; MSA 24.1210, which provides for the promulgation of rules by the commissioner, MCL 500.2236; MSA 24.12236, which requires that all policies be filed with and approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>commissioner and which authorizes him to disapprove policies containing \"inconsistent, ambiguous or misleading clauses\u201d, or containing \"exceptions and conditions that unreasonably or deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the policy\u201d, MCL 500.2403; MSA 24.12403, which establishes standards for setting rates, and, finally, MCL 500.244; MSA 24.1244, which provides for judicial review of decisions by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We conclude that the Legislature has provided the commissioner with adequate standards to guide him in a decision to authorize a deductible and has provided persons and the industry with adequate procedures by which they can secure judicial review of decisions by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Since the Court of Appeals found the delegation unconstitutional and on that basis invalidated the deductible, it did not address Porter\u2019s other claims. In this Court the parties briefed only the delegation issue. We therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to consider other challenges to the validity of the deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In the trial court and Court of Appeals, Porter argued that the approval of the deductible violated the equal protection rights of some motorcycle operators by creating two distinct classes of motorcycle operators: i) those living in households with owned motor vehicles who must claim no-fault benefits from the family insurer under \u00a7 3114(1) and subject to a $5,000 deductible, and ii) those who do not live in such households who claim no-fault benefits from the insurer of the involved motor vehicle without regard to a $5,000 deducti-. ble.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In this Court it was asserted during oral argument that the $5,000 deductible effects \"a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>p\u00edete strangulation of the statutory scheme with regard to the payment of first-party benefits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Underhill </em>we affirm. In <em>Porter </em>we affirm the Court of Appeals except its finding of an unconstitutional delegation, and remand to it for consideration of additional challenges to the validity of the $5,000 deductible.

The insurer\u2019s obligations and the insured\u2019s entitlements under other sections are based on his relationship with the vehicle involved in the accident; then he claims, as would any other person, by virtue of his status as one injured while occupying or when struck by the insured vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> MCL 500.3172; MSA 24.13172.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> In that view, which we reject, it appears that the household member provision would only provide first-party benefits to the household member who is injured while driving a non-owned uninsured vehicle (under \u00a7 3114[4]) and to provide such benefits to his passenger (under \u00a7 3114[4]) or pedestrian victim (under \u00a7 3115).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\"> This was the view taken by the dissenter in the Court of Appeals in <em>Porter </em>and by the Court in <em>Davidson v Johnson, </em>76 Mich App 497; 257 NW2d 139 (1977), <em>rev\u2019d in part (On Rehearing), </em>79 Mich App 660; 262 NW2d 887 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> 13 ULA, Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act, \u00a7 4, pp 368-369 (1972 act).
