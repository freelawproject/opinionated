That same day Representative Montgomery introduced House Bill 4408, providing for an increase in the vehicle weight tax different from that proposed by the Governor. Both were referred to the House Taxation Committee. 1 Michigan House Journal (1977) 605. Other bills to implement the Governor\u2019s proposals were introduced as well. The House Legislative Analysis of HB 4408 is instructive of the \"package\u201d nature of these bills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">\"The bill is part of a package of proposed legislation its supporters say would provide the state with a comprehensive transportation program. House Bill 5656 would change the name of the Motor Vehicle Highway Fund to the Michigan Transportation Fund and would establish a State Department of Transportation Fund which would receive money from the gas/diesel fuel tax and the vehicle weight tax, a portion of which would go to support a comprehensive transportation fund (metropolitan bus systems, rail passenger and freight systems, intercity programs, dial-a-ride, small bus systems, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>airport improvement programs). House Bill 4407 would increase the tax on gasoline to 11 cents a gallon (it is now 9) and on diesel fuel to 9 cents a gallon (it is now 7), the revenue going to the Transportation Fund. House Bill 5654 would specify that part of the sales tax on auto dealers, parts dealers, and service stations would go to the comprehensive transportation fund. House Bill 4409 would change the name of the Department of State Highways and Transportation to the Transportation Department, and redefine the responsibilities, powers, and duties of the department director and the Highway Commission. House Bill 4410 would amend the Executive Organization Act to change the name of the department, establish job qualifications for the director (at least 5 years of experience in highway or transportation engineering, or possession of an engineering degree), and bring both the Department of Aeronautics and the Aeronautics Commission into the Department of Transportation. House Joint Resolution F would change the name of the Highway Commission to the Transportation Commission, expand the commission to 6 members (from 4), reduce terms from 4 years to 3, specify that the Director of the Department of Transportation be appointed by the governor, and delete the requirement that the director be a highway engineer. House Bill 6080 would transfer aviation tax revenues in the aeronautics fund to the comprehensive transportation fund. House Bill 6081 would specify that marine gasoline tax revenues continue to go to the Waterways Fund at the present amount (1.25% of all fuel taxes other than the diesel tax collected in 1977), but that anything above that amount go to the comprehensive transportation fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">Speaker Crim\u2019s opening day remarks on January 11, 1978, were in a vein similar to the Governor\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\"The need is obvious. A balanced transportation system \u2014 good roads, streets and highways combined with sound bus, rail, air and water programs demands immediate passage of the transportation package. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>adoption of the package, much of this will be lost. Therefore I am calling, on the Governor and my fellow legislative leaders not only to recognize this acute need, but also to join with me in a vigorous campaign to effect immediate passage of the transportation package. It is our responsibility to demonstrate to the people of this state the absolute necessity of this package, including the tax increase required for financing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Among the results were:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">1) 1978 PA 426, increasing fuel taxes, on which legislative action was completed on September 28 and the Governor\u2019s signature obtained September 30;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">2) 1978 PA 427, increasing the motor vehicle weight tax, on which legislative action was completed on September 27 and the Governor\u2019s signature obtained September 30; and</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">3) 1978 PA 444, providing among other things for the allocation of Michigan transportation funds, on which legislative action was completed on September 28 and the Governor\u2019s signature obtained October 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The acts contain no \"tie-bar\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Const 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">\"The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution.

On January 9, 1979, the group similarly filed petitions seeking referendum of 1978 PA 427. On January 3, 1979, the County Road Association filed a complaint for mandamus in the Court of Appeals; Michigan Road Builders\u2019 Association, Inc., filed a similar complaint on January 12, 1979. The plaintiffs sought an order preventing the Board of State Canvassers from certifying the sufficiency of the petitions. On January 12, 1979, the Court of Appeals entered an order setting the cases for oral argument and directed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\"that defendant Board of State Canvassers desist from making any official declaration of sufficiency or insufficiency of the petitions for referendum on 1978 PA 426 and 1978 PA 427 until further order of this Court.

Judge Cavanagh dissented as to 1978 PA 427. Because timely applications for leave to appeal were filed in this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the Court of Appeals stay of January 12, 1979, remained in effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 406 Mich 1119 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The gasoline tax was initially enacted in a single statute which also established the method for distributing the revenue collected. 1925 PA 2. This Court was quickly asked in a mandamus action whether the statute was subject to referendum under Const 1908, art 5, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\"Considering these constitutional exceptions in the order stated, the first question to be determined is whether this is an act making appropriations for a State institution. It appropriates money for the use of the highway department in constructing and maintaining the highways of the State. Is the highway department a State institution within the meaning of the Constitution? The question is not solely whether the highway department may be correctly termed a State institution, but rather whether, in view of the functions which it exercises, it comes within the meaning of that term as used in the Constitution. It is not difficult to determine what the framers of the Constitution had in mind. It is clear that by permitting immediate effect to be given to appropriation acts for State institutions, it was their purpose to enable the State to exercise its various functions free from financial embarrassment. The highway department exercises State functions. It was created by the legislature for that purpose. It must have money to carry on its activities. Without the money appropriated by this act for its immediate use, it would cease to function. The constitutional purpose was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>to prevent such a contingency. And so we hold it a fair conclusion that the framers of the Constitution used the term State institutions in a broad sense intending to include all organized departments of the State to which the legislature had delegated or should delegate the exercise of State functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\">\"We are of the opinion that the State highway department is a State institution within the meaning of the Constitution, and that, therefore, this act, which makes an appropriation for its use, is not subject to the referendum.\u201d <em>Detroit Automobile Club v Secretary of State, </em>230 Mich 623, 625-626; 203 NW 529 (1925).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">We reaffirmed that the legislation was not subject to referendum after the Legislature enacted a new gasoline tax in 1927 PA 150. <em>Moreton v Secretary of State, </em>240 Mich 584, 591-592; 216 NW 450 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In 1951, the Legislature used five acts to accomplish its purpose of increasing the fuel and weight taxes and distributing the revenue collected. 1951 PA 51 was the predecessor of 1978 PA 444 in establishing the Motor Vehicle Highway Fund, providing for the deposit in the fund of specific tax revenue, and allocating the money deposited. 1951 PA 54 amended 1925 PA 2 to increase the fuel taxes; under \u00a7 18b,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\"All sums of money received and collected under the provisions of this act, except the license fees provided for herein, shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the motor vehicle highway fund and, after the payment of the necessary expenses incurred in the enforcement of this act, are hereby appropriated, allocated and apportioned therefrom to the state highway department, the several county road commissions, and incorporated cities and villages of the state in the manner and for the specific highway purposes prescribed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In a mandamus action, we were asked to decide whether 1951 PA 54 was subject to referendum. The argument made was that 1951 PA 51 actually made the appropriation and therefore 1951 PA 54 was not an appropriation act and was subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\"Acte <em>51 to 55, </em>inclusive, PA 1951, to which plaintiffs thus point, <em>constitute a comprehensive system for the collecting of speci\u00f1c taxes on motor vehicles and motor vehicle fuels, the allocation of funds therefrom and the use thereof for highway purposes. They were all enacted by the 1951 legislature and became effective at the same time. </em>Construed together, they provide for levying the specific taxes and the use thereof for highway purposes, the manner in which the said appropriations for highway purposes are allocated to said institutions, and the specific highway purposes for which they are to be used by said institutions. Act 51 allocates said funds, after payment of necessary expenses, as follows: 44% to the State highway department, 37% to the several county road commissions, and 19% to incorporated cities and villages which contain State trunk line highways; and declares that all of it shall be used only for highway purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\"Acts <em>in pari materia </em>must be considered and construed together. Act 54, levying the specific tax and appropriating it to these institutions 'for the specific highway purposes prescribed by law,\u2019 necessarily points directly to those other acts for the apportioning of said moneys and for directing the manner of its use. If considered separately, without construing them together, they would be unworkable. Furthermore, if Act 51, instead of Act 54, appropriates these moneys, then Act 51 as well as Act 54 would fall; because Act 51 expressly provides (section 23) that it shall not take effect unless Act 54 also be enacted into law and become effective. Act 51 could not operate without Act 54, being without the funds appropriated by said Act 54.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Michigan Good Roads Federa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>tion v State Board of Canvassers, </em>333 Mich 352, 360-361; 53 NW2d 481 (1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">In 1972, the Legislature again increased the gasoline tax. 1972 PA 326 and 1972 PA 327. An amended \u00a7 18b was included. The acts were \"tie-barred\u201d and enacted the same day. In <em>Boards of County Road Commissioners v Board of State Canvassers, </em>391 Mich 666, 674; 218 NW2d 144 (1974), we were again asked to consider whether the tax increase was subject to referendum and held it was not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">\"The acts were enacted on the same day as part of a single legislative program. Each act included a so-called tie-bar provision that it 'shall not take effect\u2019 until the other act is 'enacted into law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\"While Act 327 (apportioning and appropriating the monies in the highway fund) would be viable even if Act 326 (raising the gasoline tax) were subjected to a referendum and defeated, as the motor vehicle highway fund would still be receiving and apportioning the net revenue from the former seven cents a gallon tax, it is apparent that the Legislature predicated the new appropriations for mass transit and the critical bridge program on a nine cents gasoline tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\"If these new appropriations were effective independently of the validity of the nine cents gasoline tax, a defeat of PA 326 would mean that the state highway department and county road commissioners would receive less money than before from the highway fund to finance previously authorized and contemplated programs.

He says that the only appropriation act was 1978 PA 468, the appropriation act for the Department of State Highways and Transportation. This argument seems to ignore our 1974 and 1952 decisions. In addition, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 1951 PA 51, as amended, are self-executing and make transportation tax legislation unique.

In addition, such prospective appropriations would force the Governor to approve or veto the expenditure far in advance of his ability to assess the fiscal needs of the state. See generally, Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7\u00a7 18 and 19.\u201d 392 Mich 621.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">There is no question of \"forecasting\u201d with this special fund; no more is expended than is actually received.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Finally, the Attorney General contends that a decision that the acts are not subject to referendum will frustrate the people\u2019s reserved right of referendum. We believe we answered that argument in 1974:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\"The construction placed by this Court on this exception to the right of referendum in the 1925 <em>Detroit Automobile Club, </em>1927 <em>Moreton </em>and 1952 <em>Good Roads </em>cases may, indeed, in many instances deny the people a right to vote on new or increased taxes. If the question were one not previously considered, a different result might obtain. However, the identical question involving substantially the same language has been considered by this Court and settled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\"The delegates to the 1961 Constitutional Convention are presumed to have known and to have understood the meaning ascribed in these earlier decisions to the language of the 1908 Constitution. This language was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>retained by them in the 1963 Constitution without modification in response to the earlier decisions. Under well-established principles, it is not open to us to place a new construction on this language.\u201d 391 Mich 676.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We are unable to find anything in the arguments of the parties, the legislative history of the 1978 enactments, or statutory or constitutional material cited to cause us to come to a conclusion as to this transportation package different from that reached in 1974 and 1952. The acts in question are not subject to referendum. The Court of Appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part.
