The first time we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Laquarius Gray\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint on qualified immunity grounds. <em>Gray v. Bostic, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 472 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(Gray I). </em>The second time we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of defendant Antonio Bostic\u2019s motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>458 F.3d 1295, 1307 (11th Cir.2006) <em>(Gray II). </em>The third time we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law against Bostic because \u201che lacked even arguable probable cause to arrest Gray.\u201d <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>264 Fed.Appx. 856 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(Gray III). </em>This time the issue is whether the district court abused its discretion under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 by awarding Gray attorney\u2019s fees even though the jury awarded her only $1.00 in nominal damages for Bostic\u2019s violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from illegal seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-18\">Because our earlier opinions set out the facts more fully we offer only a distilled version here. After Gray was reprimanded by her gym teacher for failing to finish an assigned set of jumping jacks, she made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>a physical threat toward him. <em>Gray II, </em>458 F.3d at 1300-01. Although a nearby female gym teacher stepped in to handle the situation, Antonio Bostic, who was then a Tuscaloosa County Sheriffs Deputy acting as the school resource officer, intervened. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. He took Gray into an adjacent lobby, where he pulled her arms behind her back and handcuffed her. <em>Id. </em>At the time of the incident the age of Laquarius was nine, and she was in the fourth grade. <em>Gray I, </em>127 Fed.Appx. at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">Following the district court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law against Bostic, which we affirmed, <em>Gray III, </em>264 Fed. Appx. at 856, a jury awarded Gray $1.00 in damages. Gray then filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses seeking $78,390. Bostic did not file a response to that motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court awarded Gray $70,532.93. Bostic appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s order awarding attorney fees for an abuse of discretion,\u201d which occurs if the court \u201cfails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>ACLU v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999). Under the abuse of discretion standard there is \u201cusually a range of choices\u201d available to the district court and \u201cthere is not only one right choice for the court to make. This is true even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call.\u201d <em>Kenny A. ex rel. Winn v. Perdue, </em>532 F.3d 1209, 1218 (11th Cir.2008) (alteration, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). No matter what choice the court makes, though, it must \u201cprovide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">Only a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is eligible for attorney\u2019s fees in civil rights cases, and a plaintiff prevails \u201cwhen actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Farrar v. Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566, 573, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). A \u201cplaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 113 S.Ct. at 573. That a plaintiff succeeds in only a limited way does not strip her of prevailing party status, but the degree of her success is \u201cthe most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 113 S.Ct. at 574 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. at 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-11\">The small amount of money involved in a nominal damage award does not automatically indicate that a particular case is of little importance or that awarding attorney\u2019s fees would be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>See Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 121, 113 S.Ct. at 578 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (\u201cNominal relief does not necessarily a nominal victory make.\u201d). Other factors, including \u201cthe significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed\u201d and \u201cthe public purpose served,\u201d go into determining whether a plaintiffs victory is substantial enough, despite the minimal damage award, to justify shifting her attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant under \u00a7 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 121-22, 113 S.Ct. at 578-79; <em>see also City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 574-75, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 2694, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986); <em>Duckworth v. Whisenant, </em>97 F.3d 1393, 1399 (11th Cir.1996); <em>Cullens v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>29 F.3d 1489, 1493 (11th Cir.1994). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201ca civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate important civil and constitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms.... [T]he public as a whole has an interest in the vindication of the rights conferred by the statutes enumerated in \u00a7 1988, over and above the value of a civil rights remedy to a particular plaintiff.\u201d <em>Riverside, </em>477 U.S. at 574, 106 S.Ct. at 2694 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">Relying on the statement in <em>Farrar </em>that \u201c[w]hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief, the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all,\u201d 506 U.S. at 115,113 S.Ct. at 575 (citation omitted), Bostic contends that Gray was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees even though she was technically a prevailing party. He argues not only that the amount of money damages she recovered was de minimis but also that the legal issue on which Gray prevailed had \u201cvirtually no significance.\u201d He asserts that she \u201caccomplished no public purpose or goal\u201d with this extended litigation. Finally, Bostic argues that the fee award \u201cis not proportional\u201d to the $1.00 in nominal damages the jury awarded her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">In response, Gray contends that at most <em>Farrar </em>supports the proposition that a district court may exercise its discretion to conclude that no attorney\u2019s fee award is appropriate where the plaintiff has recovered only nominal damages; it does not stand for the proposition that a court is required to reach that conclusion. She asserts that the district court was within its discretion to award her attorney\u2019s fees and \u201cdevoted considerable judicial effort\u201d to settling upon a reasonable fee. Gray argues that the district court used the proper method to calculate the lodestar amount, then followed this Court\u2019s case law when it reduced the lodestar to offset the claims on which she did not prevail and when it enhanced the 'lodestar to account for the delayed payment of the fees. She maintains that the outcome of this case sends a \u201cclear and unmistakable signal\u201d that society will not tolerate an authority figure violating a child\u2019s constitutional rights, which makes this litigation\u2019s significance extend \u201cfar beyond the jury\u2019s award of nominal damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">The district court, in deciding that the attorney\u2019s fee award it chose was warranted notwithstanding the nominal amount of damages, relied on the fact that the one published opinion to have come out of this litigation, <em>Gray II, </em>had been cited more than fifty times in the two years between its issuance and the district court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee order. The court also stated that Gray\u2019s lawsuit, a contingency-fee, civil rights case, was \u201can undesirable one\u201d among Northern District of Alabama lawyers because it required those lawyers to divert time and money away from more lucrative cases to accept one in which they had only a small chance of prevailing. The district court\u2019s reasoning was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">For one thing, the court\u2019s reliance on the number of times the published deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>sion generated by this litigation had been cited overstates the significance of the decision. Of the now eighty-eight citations to that decision, only three are for the point of law that it established. That point of law, which is hardly earth-shattering, is that it is an unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment for a law enforcement officer, acting as a school resource officer, to \u201chandcuff[] a compliant nine-year-old child for purely punitive purposes.\u201d <em>Gray II, </em>458 F.3d at 1307; see <em>also, e.g., Jordan v. Blackwell, </em>No. 5:06-cv-214, 2008 WL 4449576, at *4 (M.D.Ga. Sept, 29, 2008) (noting that <em>Gray II </em>used Fourth Amendment analysis when evaluating the seizure and use of force on a student by a school resource officer). The other eighty-five citations to our <em>Gray II </em>decision are for general principles of law that were already well established, such as those dealing with our interlocutory jurisdiction over appeals from motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. <em>See, e.g., Bates v. Harvey, </em>518 F.3d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Marshall v. West, </em>507 F.Supp.2d 1285, 1293 (M.D.Ala.2007) (citing <em>Gray II </em>for the principle that the first step of a qualified immunity analysis requires us to ask if the challenged act falls within or is reasonably related to the outer bounds of an officer\u2019s discretionary authority). It is clear that the district court\u2019s reliance on the number of citations to our <em>Gray II </em>decision, which was one of the central reasons supporting its fee award, was based on a misunderstanding about the significance of those citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">Likewise, the district court should not have based its decision to award attorney\u2019s fees, despite the nominal nature of the damages, on its belief that this case was \u201can undesirable one\u201d among Northern District of Alabama lawyers, and that it required them to divert time and money away from more lucrative cases to handle one in which they had only a small chance of prevailing. There is nothing in the record to support the district court\u2019s belief that the case was an \u201cundesirable one.\u201d Representing children is not an undesirable thing for attorneys to do. <em>See Kenny A., </em>532 F.3d at 1234 (Carnes, J., concurring) (noting that representing children in foster care \u201cbrings professional accolades and enhances one\u2019s standing in the community\u201d). Nor is there any support for the proposition that the plaintiff had only a small chance of prevailing; she did, in fact, obtain a judgment in her favor. Finally, there is nothing in the record to support the district court\u2019s speculation that but for their handling of this case, plaintiffs attorneys would have been able to pursue more lucrative cases. The silent premise of the district court\u2019s reasoning is that attorneys have all the business they can handle and every case they take requires them to turn down another case that would have brought them fees. We do not know that to be true, and neither did the district court. There is nothing in the record indicating that by representing Gray these attorneys passed up a chance to handle lucrative cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Plaintiffs in nominal-damage cases should not be awarded attorney\u2019s fees in any but exceptional circumstances. <em>See Farrar, </em>506 U.S. at 115, 113 S.Ct. at 575; <em>id. </em>at 121-22, 113 S.Ct. at 578-79 (O\u2019Con-nor, J., concurring); <em>Riverside, 477 </em>U.S. at 574-75, 106 S.Ct. at 2694; <em>Duckworth, </em>97 F.3d at 1399. We do not decide whether this is an exceptional circumstances nominal damages case justifying the award of fees. Instead, we decide only that the reasoning the district court used to find that it was cannot support that finding. On remand, the court should reconsider the issue of attorney\u2019s fees tree of the errors that we have pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">In case the district court does decide on remand that attorney\u2019s fees are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>justified in this case, we point out some errors it made in calculating the amount of them. First, it appears from our review of the record that the court included in its lodestar calculation hours spent by Gray\u2019s counsel during the earlier appeals to this Court. In general a \u201cdistrict court is not authorized, by local rule or otherwise, to control the ... assessment of attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered on appeal. If a party wishes to obtain fees on appeal, he or she must file a [timely] petition with the clerk of this circuit... .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Mills by Mills v. Freeman, </em>118 F.3d 727, 734 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">Eleventh Circuit Rule 39-2(e), however, does permit parties to request attorney\u2019s fees for appellate work from the district court under certain circumstances. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 39-2(e). Rule 39-2(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-6\">When a reversal on appeal, in whole or in part, results in a remand to the district court for trial or other further proceedings (e.g., reversal of order granting summary judgment, or denying a new trial), a party who may be eligible for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal after prevailing on the merits upon remand may, in lieu of filing an application for attorney\u2019s fees in this court, request attorney\u2019s fees for the appeal in a timely application filed with the district court upon disposition of the matter on remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\"><em>Id. </em>Because we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gray\u2019s complaint the first time this case was before us, <em>see Gray I, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 472, Rule 39-2(e) gave the district court discretion to include appellate hours spent on that appeal in its fee calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">Gray eventually prevailed on the merits when the final judgment awarding $1.00 in damages was entered in her favor. She filed an application for attorney\u2019s fees with the district court within the time allotted by that court. Thus, to the extent Gray\u2019s application requested fees for hours expended on this case\u2019s first trip to us, the district court did not abuse its discretion by including that time within the \u201creasonable hours\u201d variable of the lodestar formula. The second and third appeals in this case did not involve reversals and remands for further proceedings, however, so the district court should not have awarded fees for any work attributable to those appeals. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 39-2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">Second, even though the district court used current hourly rates to calculate the lodestar amount, it also enhanced that amount by fifteen percent to account for the \u201cdelay between the time the services were rendered and the payment for the services.\u201d The court decided to use both current rates and an enhancement to compensate for the delayed payment because of its general feeling that current rates did \u201cnot reflect inflation.\u201d We have recognized that \u201cwhere there is a delay the court should take into account the time value of money and the effects of inflation and generally award compensation at current rates rather than at historic rates.\u201d <em>Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>836 F.2d 1292, 1302 (11th Cir.1988). That does not mean a court should do more to adjust for the time value of money than award compensation at current rates. <em>See Missouri v. Jenkins by Agyei, </em>491 U.S. 274, 282, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2468, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989) (\u201cIn setting fees for prevailing counsel, the courts have regularly recognized the delay factor, <em>either </em>by basing the award on current rates or by adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its present value.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)); <em>Kenny A., </em>532 F.3d at 1227 (\u201cFinally, we have said that any delay in payment for professional services rendered is offset by the fact that the hourly rates used are those that prevail at the completion of the case instead of the usually lower rates that were in effect at the time the earlier work was done.\u201d); <em>Gaines v. Dougherty County Bd. of Educ., </em>775 F.2d 1565, 1572 n. 14 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201c[Ujsing current rates to account for the delay in payment is somewhat inaccurate as it assumes that the increase in legal fees mirrors that of inflation, which in many instances is not the case. A more accurate method for adjusting for delays in payment would be to apply to the award a figure which is recognized as representing the time value of money over the period of the litigation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">We need not decide if it is permissible for a district court to make time-value-of-money adjustments in calculating attorney\u2019s fees by any method other than paying for all countable hours at current hourly rates. Even if it is permissible to make the time-value-of-money adjustment through an enhancement in the lodestar amount, we seriously doubt that both methods of accounting for the time value of money can be combined. And we are sure that they cannot be combined without specific evidence in the record and particularized findings that the use of current hourly rates is not enough to reasonably approximate the effects of the delay in payment for past hours worked. There is no such evidence or finding in this record. A general statement, apparently based on nothing more than the district court\u2019s impression, that the increase in hourly rates over the life of the lawsuit has not kept up with inflation is insufficient to enhance a lodestar that is based on current hourly rates. <em>See Norman, </em>836 F.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">We are not implying that district courts should hear evidence and make the findings necessary to permit a comparison of the time value of money with changes in the hourly rate over the life of the lawsuit and then adjust the lodestar amount accordingly. Undertaking that sort of intensive and extensive inquiry might threaten to violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that a \u201crequest for attorney\u2019s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941; <em>cf. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d at 432 (\u201cPutting an end to attorney fees issues as soon as possible is, to borrow a phrase from Holmes, a \u2018concession to the shortness of life.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Reeve v. Dennett, </em>145 Mass. 23, 11 N.E. 938, 944 (1887))). It is far simpler, and under our precedent permissible, to account for the delay in payment by using current hourly rates to calculate the lodestar and leaving it at that. All we need say here is that if it is ever permissible to take a lodestar amount that was calculated using current hourly rates and enhance it because of delay in payment, that cannot be done without supporting evidence and detailed findings, neither of which exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">The district court\u2019s order granting attorney\u2019s fees is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">. Bostic did respond to Gray's earlier motions for attorney's fees, which she filed while Bostic\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law against him was pending before us. To avoid wasting judicial resources, the district court denied those earlier motions without prejudice but noted that Gray could refile her request for fees if we decided Bostic\u2019s appeal in her favor. We did, and she did. Bostic, however, did not refile his opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-12\">We would typically decline to consider this issue because Bostic failed to make his arguments to the district court, but because he had already filed an opposition containing those arguments and the \u201cproper resolution of this issue is now beyond any doubt,\u201d we \"choose to exercise our discretion to consider\" it. <em>See Narey v.
