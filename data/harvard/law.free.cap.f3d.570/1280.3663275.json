Thomas filed a class action against Bank of America and FIA Card Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of America, (jointly referred to as \u201cBank of America\u201d) in the Superior Court of Clarke County, Georgia. Thomas\u2019s complaint alleged that Bank of America committed insurance fraud in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-31-7, committed unfair and deceptive acts in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-6-4, acted in bad faith, and violated Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-14-4, by selling a bundled insurance product, known as Credit Protection Plus, to ineligible individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-18\">The Credit Protection Plan provides differing benefits under the following separate contingencies: credit life insurance, credit accident and sickness insurance, involuntary unemployment insurance, hospitalization, and unpaid family leave of absence. Thomas\u2019s complaint alleged that the payment of benefits for most of the Credit Protection Plus components was contingent on the customer being employed for at least 30 hours per week and Bank of America sold the product to individuals, including herself, who worked less than 30 hours per week. The complaint sought the recovery of \u201call premiums collected by [Bank of America] from Plaintiff and the class members ... for various insurance products for which Plaintiff and the class members were ineligible to receive benefits thereunder,\u201d and, under RICO, sought treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-19\">The complaint defined Thomas\u2019s putative class alternatively, as \u201c[a]ll Georgia residents who have (or had within the applicable statute of limitations) a credit ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>count with Defendants and have enrolled in, and paid premiums for Defendants\u2019 \u2018Credit Protection Plus\u2019 products,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9a\">All Georgia residents who have (or had within the applicable statute of limitations) a credit account with Defendants and have enrolled in, and paid premiums for Defendants\u2019 \u201cCredit Protection Plus\u201d products who were ineligible for any of the bundled benefits at the time of purchase of Defendants\u2019 \u201cCredit Protection Plus\u201d products, or became ineligible for any of the bundled benefits within the time period in which said Georgia residents paid premiums to Defendants for coverage under the \u201cCredit Protection Plus\u201d products.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">The complaint did not indicate the number of individuals in either of the proposed classes or the monetary amount of the recovery they were seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">On July 30, 2008, Bank of America filed a Notice of Removal to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, contending that jurisdiction was appropriate because the action qualified as a \u201cmass action\u201d under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\u201cCAFA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4 (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.). Under CAFA, to remove a mass action to federal court, a defendant must show: (1) an amount in controversy of an aggregate of $5,000,000 in claims: (2) minimal diversity; (3) numerosity involving monetary claims of 100 or more plaintiffs; and (4) commonality showing that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions of law or fact. <em>Lowery v. Alabama Power Co., </em>483 F.3d 1184, 1202-03 (11th Cir.2007). Because Thomas provided no information relating to the amount in controversy or the number of plaintiffs in each class, Bank of America supplemented its Notice of Removal with a declaration that stated that \u201c[f]rom October 23, 2006 through June 30, 2008, Defendant enrolled 77,787 customers and collected a total of $4,825,809 in fees from customers in Georgia for the Credit Protection Plus plan.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bank of America argued that because Thomas sought treble damages under the RICO statute and attorneys\u2019 fees, the amount in controversy clearly exceeded $5,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">Thomas moved the district court to remand the case to the state court on the ground that Bank of America had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeded $5,000,000; thus, Thomas argues jurisdiction under CAFA was lacking. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court agreed and granted Thomas\u2019s motion. The district court found that the $4.8 million figure did not accurately identify the amount in controversy because Thomas\u2019s complaint did not allege that all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Georgia Credit Protection Plus customers were entitled to relief for the entire amount of their Credit Production Plus fees. The court thus concluded that there was \u201cgreat uncertainty regarding the amount in controversy and the class size.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">A case does not become removable as a CAFA case until a document is \u201creceived by the defendant from the plaintiff\u2014be it the initial complaint or a later received paper ... [that] unambiguously establishes] federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Lowery, </em>483 F.3d at 1213. Once such a document is received, the defendant has thirty days to file the notice of removal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b). In other words, a defendant may not simply file a notice of removal thirty days after the filing of the complaint unless that document shows that the CAFA\u2019s jurisdictional requirements for an action to be deemed a mass action are met. A defendant will generally establish proof of the amount in controversy based on documents received from the plaintiff because a \u201cremoving defendant generally will have no direct knowledge of the value of the plaintiffs claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1213 n. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">Here, the complaint provided no information indicating the amount in controversy or the number of individuals in the alternative classes. Thus, because defendant has not shown the amount in controversy and the sizes of the alternative classes by a preponderance of the evidence, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">. Thomas sought class certification under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9\u201411\u201423(b)(2) which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-7\">An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of [numerosity, commonality, typicality, and representativeness] are satisfied, and, in addition ... [t]he party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9\u201411\u201423(b)(3) provides that an action may be maintained as a class action if the four prerequisites of class certification are met and a court finds that common issues of law or fact predominate over individual questions and a class action is superior to other available methods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">.
