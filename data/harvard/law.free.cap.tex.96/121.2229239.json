Plaintiff sued to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the negligence of defendant\u2019s employes. All of the petition containing allegations of negligence on the part of defendant is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-8\">\u201cThat on the day and date last aforesaid, to wit: On the-day of November, 1897, plaintiff was an employe of said defendant, in the town of Livingston aforesaid, acting and doing the business of porter and servant at defendant\u2019s station at said Livingston under and subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to the order and- control of said J. E. Burton, defendant\u2019s agent aforesaid ; that on the day and date last aforesaid it was the duty of plaintiff, when ordered or directed so to do by said J. E. Barton, to seal the doors, seal and cleat or nail up the windows of freight cars on defendant\u2019s railroad track at Livingston station; that on the day and date last aforesaid said agent of defendant, J. E. Burton, ordered and directed plaintiff to seal a door, seal and cleat or nail up the window of a certain loaded freight ear on defendant\u2019s railroad track at or near said Livingston depot or station; that plaintiff obeyed the order or direction of said agent and sealed the door of said car as directed; that it then became the duty of plaintiff to seal, cleat or nail up the window of the same car; that, to do this, plaintiff carefully and in the manner such work was usually and ordinarily done got upon and placed one 'foot on the dead wood at the end of said car and the other foot on an object on the end of the car which he could rest it on, this being the usual way such work is done; that plaintiff had sealed and partially cleated or nailed up the window of said car and was proceeding to finish the cleating or nailing up of said window of the car, and using due and reasonable care and prudence in doing this, when defendant\u2019s locomotive of a freight train, run by its engineer, John McBride, and with the tender and freight car or cars attached, on defendant\u2019s railroad track, unknown to plaintiff, and without blowing the locomotive whistle and without ringing the locomotive bell as required by statute, carelessly, negligently and without warning or notice to plaintiff (and unknown to plaintiff, though plaintiff was acting carefully), by means of the locomotive aforesaid, ran a freight car, unseen and unknown to plaintiff and unheard by him, with great force against the car on which plaintiff was standing and working as aforesaid, and thereby and by reason thereof jostled, jolted and violently knocked plaintiff off of the end of said car on which he was working onto the track of defendant\u2019s said railroad; that before plaintiff could save himself, though he used his utmost exertion to do so, he fell and his left foot was caught and crushed between the drawheads of two cara, caused by the momentum of the car on which plaintiff was standing and from which he was knocked as aforesaid, and the wheel or wheels of one of plaintiff\u2019s cars, put in motion by reason of the force aforesaid, ran over, crushed and mangled plaintiff\u2019s left leg or limb from and including his foot up to the knee joint, so that the said left leg or limb had to be and was by skilled physicians amputated above the knee on the same day of said injury. That plaintiff from and caused by said injury suffered great physical pain and mental anguish in having his lower limb or leg crushed, tom, mangled and amputated as aforesaid. That plaintiff suffered great physical pain and mental anguish, from said crushing of his leg and amputation thereof, for the space of three weeks, during which time he was confined to his bed, to his damage from causes aforesaid fifteen thousand dollars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">\u201cPlaintiff alleges that when he was ordered or directed as aforesaid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>seal the door, to seal and cleat or nail up the window of said car, and when he went on to the railroad track to do it the said railroad track on which said car stood was clear of said locomotive and all danger. That plaintiff, in obeying the order aforesaid, expected, as be had a right to do, that the employes of defendant then on the ground at and near the said station and on the train there and at the depot knew that plaintiff was doing the work that he was directed and ordered to do as aforesaid, and that in case of any danger they would give plaintiff due notice and warning. That especially so as loaded freight cars, the doors thereof, had to be sealed and the windows sealed and cleated or nailed before being pulled out from the said station. That the car aforesaid had been pulled out by the locomotive in charge of the engineer thereof and the trainmen thereof, from the side or switch track, while loaded, to the main track, with one door unsealed and one window uncleated and unnailed, which by reasonable care and common observation would and should have been known, and was known, by defendant\u2019s employes operating and in charge of said tram, and by defendant\u2019s said engineer, and by said J. E. Burton, and by the conductor of said train, and by the entire train crew, all then being on the ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">\u201cPlaintiff alleges that defendant\u2019s engineer and employes in charge of said train, and said J. E. Burton, and the conductor of said train, and the crew aforesaid, all then being at and on the ground and in rescue distance to plaintiff, did know the facts stated, and with gross negligence they failed and neglected to warn plaintiff of his danger and give him notice of the approach of said locomotive, they and each of them well knowing plaintiff\u2019s peril and situation at the time of the accident aforesaid, and this though plaintiff expected and relied on them to so give plaintiff notice and warning in ease of danger or approaching danger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">\u201cPlaintiff alleges and charges the facts to be: That defendant\u2019s said depot, station, main track, side track, switches and turnouts, at about and near where plaintiff was injured, were at the time of said injury situated in and a part of the public streets and blocks and avenues of the town of Livingston. That southerly and northerly from the point on the main track aforesaid where plaintiff was injured defendant\u2019s said main line of its railroad, at a point less than eighty rods, crossed public streets and public crossings and public roads leading across said , railroad track east and west. That defendant\u2019s train or locomotive in pulling cars from its side track aforesaid, had to and did pass southwardly and over and across the said street and public road southwardly from the point where plaintiff was injured and less than eighty rods therefrom. That from one street crossing passing by where plaintiff was injured to the next street or public crossing northwardly was less than eighty rods. That defendant\u2019s said engineer and the employes in charge of said train negligently and with gross carelessness failed to blow the whistle of the locomotive at the distance of at least eighty rods from said crossings above and below plaintiff. That defendant\u2019s said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>engineer and employes in charge of the locomotive aforesaid carelessly and with gross negligence failed to ring the bell of said locomotive at the distance of at least eighty rods from said crossing and so neglected to keep said bell ringing until the locomotive crossed each of said crossings; that at the point where plaintiff was injured on the main track for a distance of eighty rods north, and more than eighty rods south therefrom, was used (the entire main track of defendant\u2019s railroad), by defendant\u2019s consent and permission, and had so been used for fifteen years, as a public road, a public passway, and a public walk, by the public generally in going to defendant\u2019s depot, and the hotel at the depot. That defendant\u2019s employes ran its said engine, at the time plaintiff was injured, up and over said public way, and failed and neglected to.blow the whistle or ring the bell during the time the locomotive was on or passing over said public way up to where plaintiff was knocked off of said car. That, had defendant\u2019s said engineer and employes in charge of said train rung the bell or blown the whistle at said crossing and over said public road and public passway along and over said railroad track, plaintiff would have known and been warned of the approaching locomotive and train and would have escaped injury by getting off of said car before the same was struck as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">In answer to these allegations the defendant filed the following plea:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIu\">\u201cAnd for answer herein defendant denies all and singular the allegations in plaintiff\u2019s said amended petition contained, and of this it puts itself upon the country: And specially answering this defendant says, that plaintiff\u2019s injuries of which he complains were brought about and were the result of his own negligence and carelessness in this: That the two ears between which plaintiff was standing just immediately before his alleged injuries, and from which he claims to have at that time fallen, were loaded with cotton and had been so loaded for some hours prior thereto; that plaintiff himself had loaded these two cars while they were on the side track at Livingston; that it was plaintiff\u2019s duty immediately after loading the same to properly seal all the doors of said cars and to make all other fastenings that were necessary preparatory for the taking out of such cars before reporting them to the agent as loaded; but that, instead of sealing the doors and before reporting them to the agent as loaded, as it was his duty to do and which he well knew, he failed to seal the same, and while in that condition he reported said cars to defendant\u2019s agent, Burton, as being loaded, which said agent, Burton, from the rules and customs of such work and manner of doing the same, believed that the doors to the cars were sealed and that all proper fastenings had been made; that plaintiff well knew the rules and customs as to sealing the doors and making proper fastenings, and that it was his duty as porter, when he loaded cars, to seal the doors and make all necessary and proper fastenings immediately after loading and before reporting the same as loaded, and he knew that in reporting cars as loaded it would be understood by the agent and train crew that the doors were sealed and all proper fastenings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>made. That defendants said agent, Burton, did not know that the doors of said ears had not been sealed until so informed by defendant\u2019s conductor in charge of the train that pulled out said cars, and he at no time before plaintiff\u2019s injuries knew that the cars had windows in them, or, if there were any, that the windows required any fastenings, or but the same had been properly fastened. That when the conductor went into the side track for the cars he then discovered the doors on another and different car, which was then on the side track and then in the charge, care and control of defendant\u2019s agent, \u2022 Burton, had not been sealed, and so informed the defendant\u2019s agent, Burton. That, immediately after being informed that the door of said car had not been sealed, said agent then started to seal the same, when plaintiff of his own accord took the sealing irons from said agent and went to seal the doors of said car while on the side track, and without giving any notice that the window had not been fastened and cleated. That after said cars had been taken from the side track where they had been loaded, out of the possession, custody and control of said agent, and taken into the custody and control of the conductor in charge of said train, and after the same had been placed upon the main line of defendant\u2019s road, and while being placed in the train and while the train crew were doing switching with the engine upon the main line, setting in and taking out cars, which was being done in a careful and cautious manner and in the usual and customary way, which work of said train crew and the moving of said ears was then known to plaintiff, he (the plaintiff), without the knowledge of said agent, Burton, or the conductor in charge of said train or any of the said train crew, went between said cars and so stationed himself upon a car that he was not requested or instructed to seal or fasten, and attempted to fasten the window in said car, which was then in the exclusive control of defendant\u2019s said conductor, that his position was unknown to either the said agent, the said conductor, or any of the said train crew; that plaintiff negligently and carelessly placed himself between said cars in such a position and in such a manner that his whereabouts and the work or business he was engaged in was not known to said agent, to said conductor, or any of the said train crew. That when plaintiff went between said cars he ought to have known and did know that his position between the same was unknown to said agent and to said conductor and said train crew. That plaintiff ought to have known and did know that in going between said cars he was exposing himself to great danger and risk, and that in going and remaining between said cars as he did plaintiff knew and ought to have known that he would likely be knocked and jolted from between the cars as he was; that he ought to have known and did know that the engine was then doing switching and that the said two cars would necessarily be moved by the engine; but notwithstanding the dangerous and hazardous position he had voluntarily placed himself in, and which he well knew, and without the knowledge of either the said agent, conductor or any of the said train crew, he negligently and carelessly remained in said position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>until the said engine was backed against one of said cars, when plaintiff fell from same. That, in the handling and moving of said train, cars and engine, the same was done carefully and cautiously and in the manner and way that was usual and customary, and plaintiff well knew that the cars between which he had gone would be moved in the manner and about the time they were moved and that in coupling the engine to these cars, which would necessarily have to be done, that there would be more or less jarring and jolting, and that the jarring and jolting would unavoidably be sufficient to cause him to fall from the position he had as aforesaid voluntarily placed himself in. That neither defendant\u2019s said agent, Burton, its said conductor, or any of its said train crew knew that there were any windows in either of said cars, or if there were any that there was any necessary cleating or fastening to be done, until after plaintiff fell from between the same, nor did they or either of them know or have any reason to believe that plaintiff was about or between said cars. That plaintiff, in going and remaining between said cars and attempting to cleat the same, was then doing that which he was not required, ordered, directed or expected to do, and was then acting outside the scope of his duty as porter or servant of the defendant; all of which plaintiff ought to have and did know.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">\u201cDefendant further says that plaintiff\u2019s position between said cars was such that it was impossible for said agent or any of said train crew to know of same or to know the work he was then doing or the business he was engaged at, nor did either or any of them have any cause to suspect or know of plaintiff\u2019s position or the work he was then doing or the business he was engaged at. That plaintiff ought to have known and did know that his going and remaining between said cars was unknown to defendant\u2019s said agent and to its said conductor and its said train crew, and that he was assuming great risk in going in and remaining between said cars as he did; that it was through the fault, carelessness and negligence of plaintiff alone, in the manner aforesaid, and not the fault, carelessness or negligence of this defendant, or any of its agents, servants or employes, that plaintiff received any of the injuries of which he complains. Wherefore defendant says that plaintiff should not recover in this behalf, and of this it puts itself upon the country.\"\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">The evidence of plaintiff is in substance that he was employed by the defendant as porter at its depot in the town of Livingston; that among the duties of his employment was the loading, sealing and cleating of cars used by the defendant in hauling freight from said station. He was under the orders of J. E. Burton, defendant\u2019s station agent at said depot, and it was his duty to obey the orders of the agent. On the morning of the accident he had loaded a car with cotton on defendant\u2019s side track near its cotton platform, and started to the depot to get the sealing irons for the purpose of sealing the car, when he met the agent, Burton, who gave him a telegram and directed him to take it up town and deliver it. Hpon his return from this errand he met Burton near the cotton platform with the sealing irons in his hands and was asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>by him why he had not sealed the car. He replied that it was because he had been sent to deliver the telegram. Burton then gave him the irons and ordered him to go and seal the car. After taking the irons from Burton he went up the side of the platform and got a cleat with which to cleat the window of the car and then went upon the platform and got some nails. In the meantime the car had been taken from the side track, by the crew of a freight train which had come into the yards while plaintiff was delivering the telegram, and placed on the main track to be put into the train which was being then made up. Plaintiff went to the car as it stood on the main track and sealed the door. He then got upon-the end of the car to cleat the window, and while so engaged the train crew who were operating the engine engaged in making up the train, without any warning to plaintiff, ran the engine with a car attached thereto down on the main line, suddenly striking the car on which plaintiff was at work and causing him to fall. He fell on the ground on his back, and the wheels of the car on which he was at work ran over his leg and so injured it as to require its amputation. At the time Burton told plaintiff to go and seal the car the conductor of the train, who was in charge of the crew who were doing the switching at the time the plaintiff was injured, was within a few feet of them. Plaintiff did not know at the time he was told to seal the car whether it was then on the side track or had been switched to the main track. The engine was then engaged in switching. There was evidence to the effect that Poindexter, who was a brakeman on the freight train and one of the crew doing the switching, had stated that he knew plaintiff had been at work sealing the car on the main line, but thought he had gotten through and gone at the time the engine was backed against the car. It was against the rules for an unsealed car to be put in the train. The conductor knew that this car was unsealed and had reported the fact to the agent. He does not say whether he heard Burton order plaintiff to seal the car, but testifies that the door of the car was sealed on the side track after he notified the agent of its unsealed condition, and that it was not moved from the side track until after it was sealed. The agent, Burton, testified that when he ordered the plaintiff to go and seal the car it was standing on the side track and had not been moved by the switching crew. It would not require more than two minutes to seal the door of a car, and to cleat a window it was only necessary to place a small strip of lumber across the window and fasten it with two nails.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">The entire charge of the court is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">\u201cGentlemen of the jury: \u201e I give you in charge the following rules and instruction to guide and assist you in arriving at your verdict:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">\u201cThis is a suit brought by the plaintiff to recover of the defendant, the Houston East &amp; West Texas Bailway Company, damages for personal injury which the plaintiff alleges he sustained through the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servants or employes in operating its train or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>a portion thereof, near the company\u2019s depot in the town of Livingston, on the --day of-, 1897.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-3\">\u201cThe defendant company denies the material allegations of plaintiff\u2019s petition and pleads contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff; and it becomes necessary for the court to define for you what is meant by the terms \u2018negligence\u2019 and \u2018contributory negligence,\u2019 and also what is meant by the term \u2018ordinary care.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-4\">\u201c \u2018\u00a1Negligence\u2019 is the failure to exercise or use that degree of care and caution that persons of ordinary prudence would use under the same or like circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">\u201c \u2018Contributory negligence\u2019 is such negligence on the part of the person injured as directly or proximately helps to produce or contributes in producing the injury and without which the injury would not have happened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">\u201c \u2018Ordinary care\u2019 is that degree of care that persons of ordinary prudence would use under the same or like circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Air\">\u201cYou are charged that if J.

It is not true that servants of railway companies are held bound by the law under all circumstances to obey the orders of their superiors. Obedience to an order may involve personal risk so great and so obvious that no prudent man should take it. The master or his representative has no right to give nor is the servant bound to obey such an order. Hor is it necessarily true that, if work which the master orders the servant to do is extra hazardous, the master is responsible to the servant for the consequence of obedience. If the work be of so dangerous a character as we have just instanced, the servant, if he takes the risk of doing it, will not be heard to complain in the courts. The statement of the rule in the special charge was in an abstract and comprehensive form, without a qualification which was essential to its accuracy. A jury following it according to its terms would be bound to conclude that, if the servant were injured as a consequence of his obedience of an order of his superior, the master would be responsible, in law, for the damage inflicted, whatever might be the character and degree of the danger incurred. The defense involved the contention that the order to seal up the car only meant that the plaintiff should do so while the ear was on the side track, and that, in following it upon the main track and there exposing himself to increased perils, plaintiff went beyond the terms of the order. If this is true and plaintiff was not hurt while acting in obedience to the agent\u2019s order, the special instruction had no application. But the plaintiff\u2019s theory, reflected in the instruction, evidently was that the order required the work upon the car, whether at one place or the other, and was being executed when the injury occurred. This was a question for the jury, and, in case they sustained this contention of plaintiff, the further question arose for their decision, whether or not the situation involved such risk that plaintiff as a man of ordinary prudence ought not, under all the circumstances, including the order, to have undertaken to do the work as he did. The general charge and special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>charges given for defendant submitted this question as one of negligence vel non, but special charge No. 8, applied in this connection, virtually instructed without qualification,\u201d that, if the work was extra hazardous and plaintiff in doing it was obeying the order, defendant would be responsible. This was, in effect, to tell the jury that the order, if obedience to it brought about the injury, removed any question as to plaintiff\u2019s negligence as submitted in other instructions. At least the jury might naturally thus reconcile the differing instructions, and such instructions, if not thus reconciled, would be in such conflict as to confuse the jury. In either view there was error which the appellate courts can not say was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We answer the first question and the first branch of the second question in the negative.- Assuming that the question of reversal or not depends alone upon the instructions, the pleadings and evidence stated, we answer the second branch of the second question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\"><em>2. </em>A defendant has the right to plead inconsistent defenses, and where in one part of an answer he denies or otherwise puts in issue a fact and in another part alleges its existence, the answer can not be taken to be an admission of such fact. Duncan v. Magette, <em>25 </em>Texas, 246. Many other rulings of this court affirming this proposition might be cited. But this is true, not because admissions in pleading are not admissible against the party making them, but because a plea, in one part denying a fact and in another part affirming it, can not, under our statute, be treated as an admission of the fact. Abandoned pleadings when offered in evidence should doubtless be construed in the same way, and not be admitted as conceding a fact both affirmed and denied. But this rule has nothing to do with the admissibility of pleadings in evidence as tending to show a fact which they distinctly allege. If a fact be admitted in the pleadings on which the case is tried, it is, in general, assumed without other evidence to be conclusively established for the purposes of the trial. Ogden v. Bosse, 86 Texas, 344. The same rule can not be applied to pleadings superseded by amendment, but it does not follow that distinct admissions in them of particular facts can not be used as evidence against the party who filed them. The admission of a party thus made is admissible against him under the rule of evidence which allows admissions against interest. Of course they are open to explanation or contradiction like other admissions. It is sometimes the fact that allegations are made by the attorney drawing pleadings upon a misunderstanding of the facts and not by authority of the party, and this of course- may be shown. All that appears here as to this is that the superseded answer contained the allegation offered in evidence, and we think that pleadings which have been filed in court in behalf of a party should be, prima facie at least, regarded as authorized by him and admissible against him, where they admit facts relevant to the issue. This court has recently had occasion to review this subject and to point out that the question under consideration was not decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>in Coats v. Elliott, 23 Texas, 606, the expressions in which have given rise to most of the difference of opinion that has arisen in this State. First National Bank v. Watson, 95 Texas, 351. The case of Barrett v. Featherstone, 89 Texas, 567, is one in which the question was fully considered in the majority and dissenting opinions of the Court of Civil Appeals of the Second District, and in which this court held with the majority affirming the admissibility of the evidence. The plea in that case was signed and sworn to by the party himself, and this made it certain that the admission was his own and perhaps added to its. weight as evidence, but its admissibility did not depend on those circumstances. The certificate shows only that the fact in question was alleged in the plea offered in evidence, by which we understand that such fact was admitted and not otherwise put in issue. Such being the case the plea was admissible.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
