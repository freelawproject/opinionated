W. H. Wood was acting as agent and employe of defendant on said date, and was in charge of said depot, or rooms, or ticket office, at night of said date; and you further believe from the evidence that on the night of said date, and a short while before one of defendant\u2019s passenger trains was due at Calvert station, going to Marlin station by way of Bremond, the plaintiff accompanied his wife, Emma, to said Calvert depot for the purpose of his said wife taking passage on the defendant\u2019s passenger train, then nearly due, to the said town of Marlin, and that the plaintiff and his said wife entered said depot and said waiting room in pursuance of said purpose, and that the plaintiff purchased a ticket for the passage of his said wife, with the intention that she should become a passenger on such train from said depot in Calvert to the station of Marlin, over defendant\u2019s line of road, by way of Bremond, and that he had procured checks for the baggage of her, the said Emma, as such passenger; and you further believe from the evidence that shortly thereafter, and while the plaintiff and his said wife were waiting in said waiting, room. for the arrival of the defendant\u2019s said passenger train, that one A. A. Allen entered said waiting room, and that he then and there sang a vulgar or indecent song, or displayed an open knife in a threatening manner towards plaintiff, or assaulted the plaintiff, or cursed him, or compelled him to pray, or preach, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>against his consent, as stated in plaintiff\u2019s petition, and. you further believe that the said Wood was present, or near by, and heard or saw such conduct on the part of the said Allen, or could by the exercise of ordinary care have seen or heard the same, if you find that the said Allen was guilty thereof, and that the said Wood failed to protect, or to make any effort to protect, said plaintiff, against the said conduct of Allen, and you further believe that by reason of the said conduct of him, the said Allen, and as a direct consequence of said acts of said Allen, if any, the plaintiff Steve Phillio, was frightened, or suffered mental anguish and humiliation, in the manner alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition, you will determine from the evidence to what extent, taking into consideration such mental anguish and humiliation of mind, if any, he was injured or damaged individually by said conduct, if you believe he was so injured or damaged, you will find in favor of plaintiff against the said defendant, in such sum as you may find he was damaged or injured, not to exceed $600, as claimed in plaintiff\u2019s petition.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-5\"><em>E.

She at the time was sick and in feeble condition. While waiting in the waiting room of the depot for the train, and after the ticket had been purchased and the baggage checked, the defendant permitted one Allen, who was alleged to be a strong, active, and robust white man, and being in a drunken and rowdy condition, sang vulgar and indecent songs, and used vulgar and indecent language in the presence of plaintiff and his wife, and being armed with a pocketlmife open in his hand, made an unjustifiable assault upon the plaintiff and his wife, by which the plaintiff and his wife were greatly intimidated, causing them to become frightened, and causing plaintiff\u2019s wife to become very nervous and sick. There are further allegations to the effect that the agent of the plaintiff at the depot at that time was present. and witnessed the assault and wrongful conduct as alleged, inflicted upon the plaintiff and his wife by Allen, or was in a position to see the same, and that no steps were taken by the agent to prevent the assault or the wrongful conduct complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\">\u201cUpon trial of the case below, verdict and judgment were in favor of . the plaintiff for the sum \"of $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u201cWe find that the evidence in the record substantially sustains these averments, and the judgment and verdict below are supported by the evidence found in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The Court of Civil Appeals found no error in the proceedings and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We are of the opinion that the conclusions of that court, in so far as they pertain to the rights of recovery by reason of the assault upon and insulting conduct towards the wife of the plaintiff are correct, but do not concur in the proposition that the evidence showed any right of action in the plaintiff on account of the outrage of Allen upon himself personally. The wife having entered the depot and a ticket having been procured for her, became a passenger of the defendant company, and the duty devolved upon the company\u2019s agent to -protect her against assault and insulting conduct on the part of third persons, provided he knew of such misconduct or had reasonable grounds to anticipate it. As to the plaintiff the case is different. He went to the depot merely to assist his wife in taking the train and with no .intention of becoming a passenger himself. He was there by the implied invitation of the company and was not a trespasser. The railway company owed him the duty which is owed by the owners of property to persons who\" enter upon it by their invitation and no more. That duty is to use ordinary care to see that th\u00e9 premises are\" kept in a reasonably safe condition, so that persons entering thereupon by invitation are not injured thereby. Hamilton v. Railway, 64 Texas, 251; Railway v. Best, 66 Texas, 116. In the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>of Railway v. Crunk, 119 Indiana, 542, the court say: \u201cThe defendant, in contracting to carry the passenger Naas in his sick and enfeebled condition, contracted an obligation which could only be carried out by Naas being carried upon the train and seated in the car. By thus contracting to carry Naas as a passenger, it took upon itself the obligation of allowing him assistants to place him upon the train and seat him in the car, and the compensation received by the defendant for conveying Naas from Mount Vernon to his destination included as well the right to have assistants place him in the car as the earning him after being so placed in the car, and the defendant owed the same obligation to his assistants while necessarily entering and leaving the car with Naas as it owed to Naas himself.\u201d So far as we have been able to discover, this case, in so far as it holds that the railway company owed the same duty to the assistants which it owed to the passenger stands by itself; and unless there be a distinguishing feature in the fact that owing to the enfeebled condition of the passenger, which made it necessary for his friends to assist in boarding the train and securing a seat (which we doubt), it is in opposition to all the authorities upon the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Our conclusion is that since the plaintiff was not a passenger the defendant company did not owe him the duty of protection against the injurious actions of third persons, and that therefore he was not entitled to recover for the misconduct of Allen towards himself. Therefore the judgment of the District Court and that of the Court of Civil Appeals are reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
