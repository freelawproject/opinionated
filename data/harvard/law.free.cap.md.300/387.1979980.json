His only defense was insanity. After the jury verdict, Trimble elected to be sentenced by the court. On March 19, 1982, the Court sentenced Trimble to death on the murder count and imposed three life terms plus seventy years on the remaining counts. The entire case is before us pursuant to the automatic-review provision in Maryland Code Art. 27, \u00a7 414(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The facts adduced at trial were as follows: On July 3, 1981, Melanie Rae Newsom and the murder victim, Nila Kay Rogers, went to a local tavern. In the tavern parking lot, Rogers met a school friend, James Hanna, who invited them to ride around in a van with him and some of his friends. The three of them entered a van containing Trimble, Terry and Joseph Evans, and Anthony Kordell. Previously, the Evans brothers and Kordell had taken PCP, marijuana, and beer, and Trimble had taken valium and beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Shortly after the women entered the van, Trimble tried to kiss Newsom, and when she resisted he screamed and began tearing off her clothing. Rogers attempted to intercede, but Trimble punched her and threw her into the back of the van; he then bit Newsom severely, and forced her to commit fellatio. After another futile attempt by Rogers to stop the assault on Newsom, the two women persuaded the men to stop the van, and Hanna took Newsom out into a cornfield, where he tried unsuccessfully to have intercourse with her. Meanwhile, Trimble and Joseph Evans raped Rogers; Kordell then tried to pull Rogers out of the van, and, as he did so, Trimble struck her on the head with a baseball bat. Kordell unsuccessfully tried to take the bat from Trimble, then retreated to the other side of the van while Trimble repeatedly struck Rogers with the bat. Trim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ble then dragged Rogers into the cornfield and slit her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">After disposing of Rogers\u2019 body, Trimble returned to the van. He and the others could not locate Hanna and Newsom, who were still in the cornfield, so they got into the van and left. Hanna and Newsom saw the van leave, and she persuaded him to accompany her to the side of the road. She then flagged down a passing motorcyclist, who took her to a nearby house where she called the police. Baltimore County police officers responded to the call and thereafter discovered the body of Rogers; she was pronounced dead at the scene at 6:30 a.m. on July 4, 1981. The cause of death was listed as severe head injuries from a blunt object.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Trimble\u2019s only defense was insanity. The trial court, after hearing testimony from Trimble\u2019s expert witness, determined that Trimble had generated an insanity issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State produced Dr. Michael Spodak, who testified \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical probability\u201d that Trimble suffered from antisocial personality and mixed substance abuse by history, but that despite these disorders Trimble was not insane because he did not lack substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Spodak further testified that Trimble had a below-normal, full-scale I.Q. of 64, but that this factor did not impair his sanity. The State then called Dr. Neil Blumberg, who testified that Trimble suffered from antisocial personality disorder and mixed substance abuse, but that these disorders did not render Trimble unable either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law. This testimony was also based on \u201creasonable medical probability.\u201d Dr. Blumberg further stated that Trimble may have been faking his symptoms. He did not testify as to Trimble\u2019s I.Q. Dr. Robert Lehman then testified as the sole defense witness. Dr. Lehman testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Trimble was suffering from antisocial personality, periodic organic psychosis, and mental retardation. However, he testified only to a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that these disorders caused him to lack substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the law. He declined to state this conclusion with reasonable medical certainty or probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Based on this evidence, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all seven counts of the indictment, rejecting Trimble\u2019s affirmative defense of insanity. After waiving his right to be sentenced by the jury, Trimble was sentenced to death by the trial judge. On this appeal, Trimble raises several contentions of error arising out of the guilt stage as well as the sentencing stage of the trial. We shall address each of his contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Trimble\u2019s first contention of error focuses on the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on insanity. The court instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">Ladies and gentlemen, I will read to you the legal definition of insanity as used in criminal cases in Maryland, and this you are responsible for and bound by. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>is the definition of insanity that is your responsibility to apply in this case. A defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct and shall be found insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime if, at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disorder, he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">Therefore, the first determination which has to be made is whether the defendant at the time of the acts charged against him was or was not afflicted by a mental disorder. Mental disorder as defined by law means mental illness or any other form of behavioral or emotional illness resulting from any psychiatric or neurological disorder. <em>The term shall not include mental retardation. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Trimble argues that this instruction was not a complete and accurate statement of the law. He bases his argument on \u00a7 12-107 of the Health-General Article, which provides: \u00a7 12-107. Insanity\u2014Test of responsibility for criminal conduct.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">A defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, <em>because of mental retardation or a mental disorder, </em>lacks substantial capacity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">(1) To appreciate the criminality of that conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">(1) To conform that conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Trimble maintains that the court\u2019s instruction excluded any consideration of mental retardation by the jury as a basis for a finding of insanity. Trimble is correct. Trimble, however, did not object to the court\u2019s instruction. Nonetheless, he persists we should recognize the court\u2019s failure properly to instruct the jury as plain error under Maryland Rule 757h.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Rule 757h provides that an appellate court may, in its discretion, \u201ctake cognizance of and correct any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant even though the error was not objected to as provided by Rule 757f.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Trimble maintains that the circumstances of this case justify our exercising such discretion. We disagree and shall decline his invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We said in <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035, 1038 (1980), that \u201cwe have characterized instances when an appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error as compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant of fair trial.\u201d We further made clear that we would intervene in those circumstances only when the error complained of was so material to the rights of the accused as to amount to the kind of prejudice which precluded an impartial trial. <em>Id. </em>Thus, we shall examine the circumstances at the time of the court\u2019s instructions to determine if the court\u2019s omission was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">As we have already noted, \u00a7 12-107 plainly includes both mental disorders and mental retardation as potential causes of legal insanity. Section 12\u2014101(f)(3) states that \u201cmental disorder\u201d does not include \u201cmental retardation\u201d and the trial court\u2019s instruction so stated. The instruction did not, however, advise the jury that either affliction could cause a defendant to be found legally insane<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if either substantially limited the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>criminality of his conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The question we must answer, then, is whether there was evidence adduced during the course of the trial which generated a jury issue as to whether the defendant\u2019s mental retardation caused him to be legally insane. Dr. Spodak testified that Trimble had a full-scale I.Q. of 64, placing him in the borderline or mild range of mental retardation. Dr. Lehman made a passing reference that Trimble had a below-normal I.Q. of 64. Dr. Lehman did not state that this condition caused Trimble to lack substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law. As a matter of fact, Dr. Lehman virtually excluded mental retardation from his analysis of Trimble\u2019s responsibility under \u00a7 12-107. Dr. Lehman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">In my review with Mr. Trimble he complained [of] no difficulty in appreciating the fact that what he was doing was wrong. He knew that. He claims, though, he was hallucinating that night and saw gorillas that night. When he was swinging the bat at the girl he saw the face of a girl he was swinging the bat at. He knew it was wrong. He said he could not stop himself, which would be a part of the second, that is, he was saying he\u2014not in these words\u2014he lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the law. Antisocial personalities chronically have that problem. They have difficulty conforming their conduct to the law, though they know what the law is. Although he suffers from mental retardation, he did know what he was doing was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Dr. Lehman at no time characterized Trimble\u2019s retardation as contributing to his misconduct. Both Drs. Spodak and Blumberg found Trimble\u2019s mild or moderate mental retardation insignificant. Dr. Lehman found that despite his mental retardation Trimble knew what he was doing was wrong and that his failure to conform was caused by his antisocial personality. There simply was no evidence that linked Trimble\u2019s misconduct to his mental retardation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>To the contrary, the evidence indicated that Trimble was able to hold down a job and perform other normal social chores without any substantial handicap. His antisocial personality, intensified by his drug and alcohol abuse, was the reason he could not conform.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">As we see it, the question of Trimble\u2019s mental retardation was not material to his defense and the trial court\u2019s failure to include mental retardation as a basis for the jury\u2019s deciding if Trimble was insane at the time of the crimes under consideration did not deprive him of a fair trial. The omission in the instruction was not preserved for review and was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Trimble\u2019s second contention of trial error is also based on the expert testimony on the insanity issue. After Dr. Blumberg testified for the State that Trimble was not insane and may have been faking his symptoms, he was cross-examined about Trimble\u2019s stay at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital. Dr. Blumberg acknowledged that Trimble had been given Thorazine, an antipsychotic drug and a major tranquilizer. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0s\">Q. [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you approve of this treatment of Thorazine and Artane?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">A. In Mr. Trimble?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">Q. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">Q. You do not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-13\">Q. Why don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">A. I don\u2019t because I believe the symptoms that he is manifesting at the present time are not the result of a psychosis. They are the result of his feigning behavior that is geared to look like he is psychotic. I don\u2019t believe he is suffering from the type of mental illness which would warrant such treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">Q. Who did believe he was psychotic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">THE COURT: If you know, sir, who prescribed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">A. I can look at the order if you would like me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOu\">Q. Yes, I would like you to look at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">A. His medication for Thorazine is signed by Dr. Freinek. I would want to add\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Q. I want to know who prescribed it? Dr. Freinek? A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">Q. How do you spell that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">A. F-r\u2014and your guess is as good as mine\u2014I know him but I am not sure whether it is e-i or i-e-n\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">Q. What is his position with the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">A. He is a psychiatrist on the staff of the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8j\">Q. Did he make an evaluation of this patient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">A. When Mr. Trimble was admitted, he was the ward psychiatrist on ward three, which is the admission ward. The import of this exchange is that defense counsel was attempting to show that Dr. Freinek prescribed an antipsychotic drug for Trimble because Trimble was insane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">On redirect, the State returned to this subject:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-14\">Q. [STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Dr. Blumberg, just a couple of questions. Did Dr. Freinek participate in the staff conference and evaluation of this defendant in November?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-15\">A. No, he did not. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-16\">Q. To the best of your knowledge, did Dr. Freinek evaluate the defendant for responsibility at the time of the offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-17\">A. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-18\">Q. And the prescription for the defendant for Thorazine, would that come from symptoms observed by members of the staff at Clifton T. Perkins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-19\">A. Very possibly. Knowing Dr. Freinek and some of his prescribing policies on ward three\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-20\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I object as to what Dr. Freinek\u2019s prescription policies are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: He got into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">THE COURT: Overruled. The doctor indicates that he is familiar with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Q. You may continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">A. When an individual comes onto the ward and acts in a very agitated manner evidencing bizarre behavior, regardless of its cause Dr. Freinek seems a lot more likely than most of the other psychiatrists to prescribe a medication primarily to sedate the individual as opposed to necessary for any psychotic benefit of the drug, and ward three, which is the admission ward, is a very, very difficult place to work on. We have all the individuals who come in for pretrial evaluations who are fresh out of jail and are put in the hospital plus all the patients who are no longer treatable on the less restrictive wards. This is the maximum of the maximum security unit. There is a great deal of disruptive behavior, and he is a lot freer with medication than many of the other staff members, including myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The object of this testimony was to negate the inference that Trimble was insane by showing that Dr. Freinek prescribed Thorazine for Trimble only as a sedative. Trimble maintains that the admission of this testimony was reversible error because it was hearsay and because it violated the best-evidence rule. The State contends that this testimony violated neither the best-evidence rule nor the rule against hearsay, and that defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to the admission of this testimony by his question on cross-examination on that very same subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The examination of witnesses at a trial is left largely to the discretion of the trial judge and no error will be recognized unless there is a clear abuse of that discretion. This Court stated the rule as to the scope of cross-examination observed in this State in <em>Williams v. Graff, </em>194 Md. 516, 522, 71 A.2d 450, 452-53 (1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">[W]here a witness is called to testify on a particular point, the adverse party in the cross-examination of the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>is restricted to the point on which he testified and cannot question him in regard to other issues in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">sjs s]s * * sfc <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">However, our rule does not go to the extent of restricting the cross-examination of the witness to the specific details inquired into on direct examination, but permits full inquiry into the subject matter entered into. Where a general subject has been entered upon in the examination in chief, the cross-examining counsel may ask any relevant question on the general subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">As to the scope of redirect examination, this Court said in <em>Fisher Body Division v. Alston, </em>252 Md. 51, 56, 249 A.2d 130, 133 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">As a general rule, redirect examination must be confined to matters brought out on cross-examination. However, it is within the court\u2019s discretion to allow the introduction of something new or forgotten if the purposes of justice seem to demand it, and this Court will not interfere unless there is a clear abuse of such discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-q\">Here, the State sought to establish by its direct examination of Dr. Blumberg that Trimble was not psychotic but rather was faking the symptoms of an insane person. On cross-examination, defense counsel sought to rebut this testimony by creating an inference that Trimble was insane because Dr. Freinek prescribed Thorazine as an antipsychotic drug. On redirect examination, the State proceeded to dispel this inference by demonstrating the usual practice of Dr. Freinek in prescribing Thorazine as a tranquilizer for patients in the admissions ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Trimble objects to the State\u2019s inquiry on redirect because he claims it is tantamount to having Dr. Blumberg testify as to Dr. Freinek\u2019s opinion as to whether Trimble was psychotic. As we see it, Trimble\u2019s objection seeks to cloud the issue. What Trimble conveniently overlooks is that he opened the door to such testimony by eliciting from Dr. Blumberg the inference that Dr. Freinek had prescribed Thorazine for Trimble because Trimble was psychotic. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>direct examination, Dr. Blumberg limited his testimony to his conclusions based on his own examination of Trimble. Then, on cross-examination, defense counsel expanded the scope of Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony to include Dr. Freinek\u2019s action. The State on redirect examination then sought to disprove the inference that Trimble was psychotic. Because the State established that Dr. Blumberg was familiar with Dr. Freinek\u2019s prescription policies, it had a sound basis for explaining the inference to be drawn from the fact of Dr. Freinek\u2019s prescribing Thorazine for Trimble. Defense counsel, having created the issue, cannot now be heard to complain that the State sought to rebut its significance. We find no error on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Trimble\u2019s argument on the best-evidence rule misconceives its applicability. Generally, the rule applies to require a party to produce the original of a document instead of a duplicate or copy. <em>Gray v. State, </em>181 Md. 439, 30 A.2d 744 (1943). C. McCormick, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>559-62 (2d Ed. 1972). Here, Trimble maintains that Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony about Dr. Freinek\u2019s prescription policies is not admissible because Dr. Freinek\u2019s own testimony as to his policies is the best evidence. Obviously, Dr. Freinek\u2019s testimony would not be documentary evidence, so the purposes of the best-evidence rule\u2014to ensure that the exact terminology of a writing is presented to the court and to guard against fraud\u2014are inapplicable. <em>See Gray, </em>181 Md. at 443, 30 A.2d at 746; <em>McCormick </em>at 561-62. We conclude that the trial court did not violate the best-evidence rule by admitting Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Trimble next contends that the trial court erred in permitting the State\u2019s Attorney to make the following remark during his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">[W]hom did the defense put on to testify that this defendant was in fact insane at the time of the offense? I submit to you nobody. Nobody testified he was insane at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the time of the offense. Dr. Lehman testified and Dr. Lehman has no formal training in forensic psychiatry. He has a practice limited to child and adolescent psychiatry. He is not affiliated with any State or mental hospital, and he has in the past only examined five defendants to determine their responsibility at the time of a given \u00f3ffense. He, unlike Dr. Spodak and Dr. Blumberg, is eminently unqualified to give an opinion seven months after the occurrence of an offense as to what the defendant\u2019s mental state was at the time of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeU\">According to Trimble\u2019s argument, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s statements went beyond the permissible bounds of closing argument because the trial court had previously qualified Dr. Lehman as an expert. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Trimble correctly asserts that questions of the qualifications of expert witnesses are for the court to decide as a preliminary matter of law. But this does not mean that the expert\u2019s qualifications may not be minimized when arguing that the expert\u2019s opinion should not be accepted. The court\u2019s threshold determination simply represents a finding that the expert has the minimum degree of expertise necessary to allow him to state an opinion as to a given set of facts; it does not mean that the jury is bound to believe all or any part of his testimony. Rather, the quality, bias, strength, basis, and sincerity of an expert opinion can still be attacked before the jury as a matter of credibility-</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Thus, the issue here is whether the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s statement to the jury constituted error because he characterized Dr. Lehman as \u201cunqualified.\u201d Looking at the prosecutor\u2019s statement as a whole, his remarks questioned the believability of Dr. Lehman\u2019s testimony: He noted that Dr. Lehman was not trained in forensic psychiatry, that he had no affiliation with a mental hospital, that he had little experience in the area of criminal responsibility, and that he only diagnosed Trimble seven months after the event. These remarks all pertain to Dr. Lehman\u2019s credibility as an expert witness, a subject well within the range of permissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>ble argument to the jury. In short, the State\u2019s Attorney was urging the jury to disbelieve Dr. Lehman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We do not believe that these remarks become prejudicial simply because the State\u2019s Attorney used the word \u201cunqualified.\" The obvious import of this adjective was to question the credibility of the expert witness. Even though Dr. Lehman met the minimum requirements of expertise needed to give an expert opinion, the jury was still free to disregard his testimony and believe the \u201cmore qualified\u201d expert. Subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion, both the State\u2019s Attorney and defense counsel are given wide latitude in the conduct of closing argument, including the right to explain or to attack all the evidence in the case. <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 191-93, 453 A.2d 1218, 1231-32 (1983); <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974). We see no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Trimble makes several arguments concerning the sentencing stage of the trial conducted pursuant to Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 413. The first of these contentions is that the trial court erroneously found as an aggravating circumstance under \u00a7 413(d)(4)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201c[t]he victim was a hostage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>taken or attempted to be taken in the course of a kidnapping or abduction or an attempt to kidnap or abduct.\u201d Trimble claims that \u201chostage\u201d should be narrowly defined to mean a person who is held to enforce demands upon a third person. The State, on the other hand, maintains that the term hostage refers more generally to a kidnap victim without regard to whether any demands are made on third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Our task, therefore, is to ascertain the meaning of the term hostage as used by the legislature in the context of \u00a7 413. Looking first to the face of the statute, subsection (d)(4) is worded in terms of the characteristics of the victim\u2014he or she must be a \u201chostage ... taken in the course of a kidnapping or abduction____\u201d This structure seems to support a broader, more generic definition of hostage, because the term is being used to describe a person who is the victim of a kidnapping or an abduction. Yet this structure alone does not suffice to answer Trimble\u2019s contention, because the wording would also support a more narrow reading which encompasses kidnap victims only if they are held hostage to enforce demands on a third person. Thus, it is possible that the legislature intended to include as an aggravating circumstance only a small subclass of kidnappings\u2014those in which the defendant takes his victim to enforce demands on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The legislative history surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 413, however, indicates that the legislature did not intend to single out certain kidnappings as aggravating circumstances, but intended to include all kidnappings. Senate Bill 374, which became law in 1978 as the current \u00a7 413, <em>see </em>1978 Md.Laws ch. 3, was a proposal originating from the Governor\u2019s Legislative Office. The language contained in \u00a7 413(d)(4)\u2014\u201c[t]he victim was a hostage taken or attempted to be taken in the course of a kidnapping...\u201d\u2014is identical to the language in the original proposal; the legislative records do not disclose any proposals to amend this language or any legislative debate on its meaning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">But the Governor\u2019s Chief Legislative Officer, who drafted the bill, submitted to the General Assembly a lengthy memorandum explaining the bill. The memorandum explained subsection (d)(4) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">Paragraph (4) relates to the murder of a kidnap victim. The draft adds to this paragraph, as an aggravating factor to be considered, the murder of a person abducted. At common law, the difference between these offenses was that, while a kidnapping involved the taking of a person outside the country, an abduction involved a taking of a person for immoral purposes. The purpose of this paragraph, as enacted in 1975, was to deter the kidnapper from murdering his hostage. Absent capital punishment, the penalty for kidnapping (30 years) and for murder (life imprisonment) are no so dissimilar as to deter the kidnapper from killing the only witness to his crime. The differences between 30 years in jail and death is believed to be significant enough to deter the murder of the hostage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>This memorandum is significant in a number of respects. First, it states that (d)(4) \u201crelates to the murder of a kidnap victim.\u201d Thus, it apparently uses the term hostage only to describe a kidnap victim, not as a limiting term to narrow the class of kidnappings eligible as aggravating circumstances. Second, it states that the purpose of (d)(4) is to deter kidnappers from murdering their victims. Obviously, this purpose is not confined to kidnappings in which the kidnapper uses the victim to make a demand on a third person, but applies equally to all kidnappings. Third, the memorandum makes no mention of creating a subclass of kidnappings. Rather, it speaks in terms of the Maryland version of the crime of kidnapping, which does not define kidnapping in terms of making demands on third persons.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, this memorandum\u2019s explanation of the reach of subsection (d)(4), and the General Assembly\u2019s adoption of that provision <em>in to to, </em>support an inference that the General Assembly did not intend to limit this aggravating circumstance to kidnappings in which the kidnapper makes a demand on a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Trimble cites several cases that have employed a more restrictive definition of the term hostage, but, upon examination, none is persuasive here. In three of the cases, the applicable kidnapping statutes defined kidnapping as the confinement or asportation of a person with any of four different purposes, one of which is to hold the victim as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>shield or hostage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In each case, the court held that the term hostage meant a person held to enforce demands on a third person. Each statute, however, listed as another purpose inflicting bodily injury or terrorizing the victim without regard to any demands made on a third person, so a restrictive definition of one purpose did not restrict the overall crime. Here, on the other hand, such a restrictive definition would limit the entire aggravating circumstance to cases where the accused makes a demand on another, because there is no separate proyisi'on dealing solely with the accused's treatment of the victim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Therefore, we decline to define hostage in \u00a7 413(d)(4) to mean only a person held to enforce a demand on another person. Such a construction would eliminate as an aggravating circumstance under (d)(4) any kidnapping or abduction, however heinous, if the accused does not make a demand on a third person. We are not persuaded that the legislature intended to eliminate such a large class of kidnappings from the reach of \u00a7 413(d) in the absence of an express provision to that effect. Therefore, we hold that the term hostage in \u00a7 413(d)(4) refers to the victim of any kidnapping or abduction without regard to whether the kidnapper or abductor makes any demand on a third party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>V and VI</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Trimble\u2019s fifth and sixth contentions of error, both concerning the sentencing stage of his trial, question the trial judge\u2019s application of \u00a7 413. After hearing evidence, the trial court read its findings, in the form of a written report, in open court. The report indicated that the trial judge had found two aggravating circumstances beyond <em>a </em>reasonable doubt: (1) that the victim was a hostage taken in the course of a kidnapping and (2) that Trimble had committed the murder while committing rape and Sexual offense in the first degree. The report also indicated that the trial judge found three mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that Trimble had not previously been found guilty of a crime of violence, (2) Trimble\u2019s youthful age, and (3) Trimble\u2019s antisocial personality and substance abuse by history.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">After reading these findings, the judge came to Section III of the report, which calls for the trier of fact to weigh the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances pursuant to \u00a7 413(h).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At this point, the judge digressed into a discussion about some of the policies behind the death penalty as expressed by the Supreme Court, other courts, and commentators. He first quoted from a 1930 Pennsylvania case, <em>Commonwealth v. Ritter, </em>13 Pa.D. &amp; C. 285, 291 (1930):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">Only the death penalty gives absolute protection; if the prisoner receives a life sentence \u201che may again commit murder within the prison walls, or may escape and again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>make innocent victims his prey, or may even, by cunning simulation of repentence, obtain a pardon from governmental authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">He then quoted from LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>25 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">The current emphasis upon rehabilitation is reflected in probation and parole, as well as in the modern tendency to treat alcoholics, drug addicts and sexual psychopaths as sick persons, and juvenile delinquents as misguided children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Next, the trial judge quoted <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 183, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2929-30, 49 L.Ed.2d 859, 880-81 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">The death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">In part, capital punishment is an expression of society\u2019s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct. This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs. The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they \u201cdeserve\u201d then there are sown the seeds of anarchy\u2014of self-help vigilante justice, and lynch law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">Retribution is no longer a forbidden objective nor one inconsistent with our respect for the dignity of men. The decision that capital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in extreme cases is an expression of the community\u2019s belief that certain crimes are themselves so griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ark\">The judge then recited the details of the rape-murder of Rogers and discussed Trimble\u2019s background, including his prior sadistic behavior and other mental problems. The judge then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">I can only conclude that the crime committed by [James Russell] Trimble was so grievous an affront to humanity, that the only adequate response of this Court is to impose the penalty of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">I, therefore, answer the question in Part III \u201cno\u201d, and complete the form in Section III: If Section III was completed and was marked \u201cno\u201d enter \u201cdeath\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Trimble contends, on the basis of these passages, that the trial court erred in applying \u00a7 413 in two related ways: (1) by impermissibly considering the possibility of parole or probation in determining the proper sentence, and (2) by applying \u201chis own standards\u201d in lieu of the standards set forth in \u00a7 413. Upon our review of the proceedings, however, we hold that the trial judge neither considered impermissible factors nor misapplied \u00a7 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The trial judge mentioned parole or pardon only because the quotation from the Pennsylvania case mentioned it in the context of a discussion of the death penalty as society\u2019s \u201cabsolute protection.\u201d Nothing in the transcript indicates that the trial judge actually considered the possibility of parole or pardon in determining the sentence under \u00a7 413.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, the trial judge was simply exploring some of the policies behind the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Thus, this case does not come within the rule in <em>Poole v. State, </em>295 Md. 167, 453 A.2d 1218 (1983) <em>(Poole II). </em>In <em>Poole II, </em>the prosecutor argued to the sentencing jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the defendant should receive the death penalty because of the possibility that he could be paroled if given a life sentence. The Court held that such comments were improper. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 458 A.2d at 1232-33. <em>See also Poole v. State, </em>290 Md. 114, 428 A.2d 434 (1981) <em>(Poole I); Shoemaker v. State, </em>228 Md. 462, 180 A.2d 682 (1962). Here, on the other hand, the sentencing judge made only a cursory mention of pardon in a different context and did not in any way rely on this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Similarly, the trial judge\u2019s discussion does not indicate that he applied his own standards instead of applying \u00a7 413. The death penalty statute need not be applied in a vacuum; consideration of the legal and philosophical justifications for the death penalty is not inappropriate as long as the statute itself is not disregarded. Here, the trial judge simply recognized some of the basic policies underlying punishment\u2014deterrence, retribution, and rehabilitation\u2014 and juxtaposed them with the Maryland death-penalty scheme. Moreover, some of the judge\u2019s reference material was drawn from Supreme Court case law, which of course is the very foundation of the Maryland statute. Consideration of these factors is in no way inconsistent with \u00a7 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">A close reading of the transcript of the proceeding indicates that the trial judge carefully considered the details of Trimble\u2019s offense and his background in weighing the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors pursuant to \u00a7 413. The quotations challenged by Trimble simply punctuated a detailed examination of the facts of the case, facts which plainly support his conclusion. To hold, as Trimble would have us do, that this conclusion should be reversed because the trial judge looked at the larger picture, would only encourage a mechanical application of the death penalty. This we decline to endorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Trimble maintains that the death sentence should be vacated because he had the burden of proving, as a mitigat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ing circumstance under \u00a7 413(g)(4),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that the murder was committed while his capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law was substantially impaired by mental incapacity, a mental disorder, an emotional disturbance, or intoxication. According to this argument, the State should shoulder the burden of persuasion as to this mitigating circumstance because, at trial, Trimble successfully satisfied his burden of production on the insanity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As we recognized in <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 415 A.2d 830 (1980) <em>(Tichnell I):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">Section 413 does not explicitly specify which party has the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion. Instead, \u00a7 413 speaks in terms of requiring the sentencing authority to make findings that satisfy either the reasonable doubt or the preponderance of evidence standard; the section involves a three-step procedure. First, as a condition precedent to the imposition of the death penalty, the sentencing authority must find beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one aggravating circumstance has been proved. \u00a7 413(f). As to this, the State bears both the risk of nonproduction and nonpersuasion. The second step requires that the sentencing authority consider whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, a mitigating circumstance exists. \u00a7 413(g). This provision does not require the prosecution to disprove the existence of mitigation, thus placing on the accused the risk of nonproduction and nonpersuasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 730, 415 A.2d at 849.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Thus, we explicitly held that the accused has the burden of production and persuasion as to all mitigating circumstances, including \u201csubstantially impaired capacity\u201d under \u00a7 413(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Nevertheless, Trimble urges that a different result should be reached here because he had successfully met his burden of production on the insanity issue during the guilt stage of the trial. This contention, however, has several analytical flaws. First, the sentencing proceeding of \u00a7 413 is a separate and distinct proceeding; the burdens of production and persuasion at the guilt stage have no application in the sentencing proceeding. The parties\u2014especially the defendant\u2014are given a second chance to prove facts helpful to their case. This can only help a defendant in Trimble\u2019s position, because his insanity defense was rejected at the guilt stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Second, a finding that the defendant has generated an insanity issue at trial certainly does not mean either that he has proved that issue by a preponderance of the evidence or that the burden of persuasion on that issue should be shifted in the sentencing proceeding. To meet the burden of production on the insanity issue, a defendant must present evidence that could raise a doubt in a reasonable juror as to the sanity of the defendant. <em>Bradford v. State, </em>234 Md. 505, 200 A.2d 150 (1964). This is a relatively light burden because the State shoulders the ultimate persuasion burden beyond a reasonable doubt. C. McCormick, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>790-91 (2d ed. 1972). Obviously, raising a doubt about sanity is a far cry from proving insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Therefore, satisfying the burden of production during the guilt stage does not require shifting the burden of persuasion to the state at a different stage. The allocations of the burdens of proof and persuasion are essentially policy decisions, constrained only by constitutional considerations, that are influenced by judgments about the risk of error, the relative positions of the parties, and procedural efficiency.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the guilt stage of criminal trials, this court has held that such policy considerations require that the State shoulder the burden of persuasion on the insanity issue. <em>Bradford v. State, </em>234 Md. 505, 200 A.2d 150 (1964). In the sentencing phase of a death penalty case, however, the legislature has made the policy choice that the accused shoulders the burden of persuasion to show a somewhat broader form of insanity.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That policy choice must be and is respected by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Trimble next maintains that imposing the death penalty on persons under eighteen years of age <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and Articles 16 and 25 of the Maryland Declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of Rights.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This question has not been decided by the Supreme Court; it was presented to that Court but expressly left open in <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). Nevertheless, we discern from other Supreme Court cases the principles necessary to resolve this issue. These cases lead us to conclude that the Eighth Amendment does not shield Trimble from capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Any review of Supreme Court case law on capital punishment must begin with <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972). The <em>Furman </em>Court, in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, struck down the capital-punishment statutes in Georgia and Texas. Each justice wrote an individual opinion either concurring in or dissenting from the judgment. One justice took the position that the death penalty\u2019s discriminatory impact rendered it unconstitutional. <em>See id. </em>at 240, 92 S.Ct. at 2727, 33 L.Ed.2d at 350 (Douglas, J., concurring). Two justices found the death penalty to be cruel and unusual punishment in all circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 257, 92 S.Ct. 2736, 33 L.Ed.2d at 360 (Brennan, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 315, 92 S.Ct. at 2765, 33 L.Ed.2d at 393 (Marshall, J., concurring). The two other justices supporting the judgment did so on narrower grounds, finding that the statutes at issue were unconstitutional because the death penalty was imposed in a wanton, freakish, or infrequent manner with little basis for distinguishing the few sentenced to die from the many spared the ultimate penalty. <em>See id. </em>at 307, 92 S.Ct. at 2760, 33 L.Ed.2d at 388 (Stewart, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 310, 92 S.Ct. at 2763, 33 L.Ed.2d at 390 (White, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Four years later, the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of the Eighth Amendment as applied to capital punishment became more crystallized in <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976). In <em>Gregg </em>and its companion cases,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a plurality of the Supreme Court upheld five <em>post-Furman </em>death-penalty statutes. Six justices, in two different opinions, agreed that the statutes were constitutional because they were carefully drafted to give the sentencing authority adequate information and guidance in the exercise of its discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 158, 96 S.Ct. at 2918, 49 L.Ed.2d at 866 (opinion of Stewart, J., joined by Powell and Stevens, JJ.); <em>id. </em>at 207, 96 S.Ct. at 2941, 49 L.Ed.2d at 893 (opinion of White, J., joined by Burger, C.J., and Rehnquist, J.). The Court also placed reliance on the elaborate procedural checks built into the statutes\u2014bifurcated trials, mandatory appellate review, proportionality review\u2014that served to reduce further the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory application. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">More important for our purposes here, the <em>Gregg </em>Court began to develop more of a consensus as to a general approach to Eighth Amendment claims. Reviewing the history of the Eighth Amendment, the <em>Gregg </em>plurality noted that the Court had abandoned the early, more narrow approach of determining only whether any given method of execution was torturous or barbarous. <em>See, e.g., Wilkerson v. Utah, </em>99 U.S. 130, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1879); <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U.S. 436, 10 S.Ct. 930, 34 L.Ed. 519 (1890). Instead, the Court interpreted the Amendment in a more flexible, dynamic manner, noting that the provision may acquire new meaning \u201cfrom evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>173, 96 S.Ct. at 2925, 49 L.Ed.2d at 874 (quoting <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958)). Thus, \u201cpublic perceptions of the standards of decency\u201d became a central focus in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence. The <em>Gregg </em>Court also observed, however, that public perception alone does not answer all Eighth Amendment concerns: The Court must also satisfy itself the more abstract notions of excessiveness are not offended. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The <em>Gregg </em>Court therefore reaffirmed several earlier cases not involving the death penalty; these cases invalidated the punishment of denaturalization for the desertion from the Army, the punishment of hard labor for falsifying a document, and any punishment applied for the \u201coffense\u201d of being a drug addict. <em>See Trop v. Dulles, supra </em>(denaturalization); <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910) (hard labor); <em>Robinson v. California, </em>370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962) (drug addiction). In all these cases, the Court had determined that the punishment imposed was, as an abstract matter and as a matter of public perception, excessive in proportion to the offense at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">This more generalized approach to Eighth Amendment claims continued to solidify after <em>Gregg. </em>In <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977), a plurality of the Court found that the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman was a \u201cgrossly disproportionate and excessive punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 97 S.Ct. at 2866, 53 L.Ed.2d at 989. And in <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. 782, 102 S.Ct. 3368, 73 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1982), a majority of the Court held that the death penalty is unconstitutional when imposed on a person \u201cwho aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed.\u201d 458 U.S. at 797, 102 S.Ct. at 3376, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In both <em>Enmund </em>and <em>Coker, </em>the Court employed essentially the same two-fold analysis first articulated in <em>Gregg. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>First, the Court sought to determine whether \u201cevolving standards of decency\u201d had rejected capital punishment for the offense at issue. The Court identified several sources of evidence to assess these standards: state death-penalty legislation, jury verdicts in death-penalty cases, executive commutations, and scholarly and international views. Second, the Court evaluated the offense actually committed, and that same offense in general, to determine whether the penological purposes of the death penalty would be served by its imposition in that particular instance. In both cases, the Court found that, as an empirical matter, society had rejected capital punishment for rape and for accomplice liability. And in both cases, the Court also found that the purposes of the death penalty\u2014principally deterrence and retribution\u2014were not served for either offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Finally, in <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982), the Supreme Court was faced with the question now presented here: whether the imposition of capital punishment on a juvenile is cruel and unusual punishment. The Court, however, expressly avoided that issue, instead deciding the case on the ground that the death sentence imposed on a sixteen-year-old defendant should be vacated because the sentencing judge refused to consider various mitigating circumstances as required by <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978). Other courts, however, have addressed this issue, all concluding in summary fashion that the Eighth Amendment does not forbid capital punishment of juveniles. <em>Eddings v. State, </em>616 P.2d 1159 (Okla.Crim.App.1980); <em>State v. Valencia, </em>124 Ariz. 139, 602 P.2d 807 (1979); <em>State v. Harris, </em>48 Ohio St.2d 351, 359 N.E.2d 67 (1976); <em>Ice v. Commonwealth, </em>Ky., 667 S.W.2d 671 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Thus, based on our reading of Supreme Court case law, we perceive our analysis here to be as follows: First, we must ascertain, using objective indicia to the extent possible, society\u2019s \u201cevolving standards of decency\u201d with respect to capital punishment of juveniles. Second, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>must then satisfy ourselves that capital punishment of juveniles does in fact serve a penological purpose and is not excessive in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Our first task is to determine whether society has rejected capital punishment as a means of enforcing the criminal law for juvenile offenders. One of the more probative gauges of society\u2019s standards, the acts of state legislatures, is illuminative. We note first that the Maryland legislature has not seen fit to prohibit capital punishment of juveniles. <em>See </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code \u00a7 3\u2014804(d)(1); Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 413. This legislative judgment, like all others in our limited exercise of judicial review, not only is entitled to a presumption of validity, but is persuasive evidence that at least this segment of society has not rejected capital punishment of juveniles. <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. at 175-76, 96 S.Ct. at 2926, 49 L.Ed.2d at 876. In fact, the Maryland legislature, expressing society\u2019s preferences in a democratic society, has recognized that some juveniles are simply not amenable to the more benign treatment afforded most juvenile offenders. <em>See </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code \u00a7 3-804.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On a national level, the judgment of the Maryland Legislature is hardly aberrational. Out of the 39 states that currently provide for capital punishment, 29 states permit the execution of juveniles in some circumstances.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>not only an outright majority of all states, but it is a substantial majority of those states providing for capital punishment. This canvass of jurisdictions provides a probative indication that contemporary society has not rejected capital punishment of juveniles, but has chosen, through its elected representatives, to allow it in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Another relevant gauge of contemporary standards, jury verdicts in capital cases, is more ambiguous. Although arguably this source is more probative of society\u2019s actual feelings toward the death penalty, because it involves citizens actually imposing the penalty rather than vicariously passing an abstract statute through elected representatives, jury verdicts may have empirical problems that cast some doubt on their reliability. <em>Enmund v. Florida, </em>458 U.S. at 816-18, 102 S.Ct. at 3387, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1164-65 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, they give some indication of contemporary standards. The most recent statistics with which we have been furnished indicate that only seventeen inmates currently on death row, out of approximately 800 total death row inmates, committed their offense while under age eighteen.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This statistic, although it does not control for such factors as prosecutorial discretion and the requirements of the various state statutes, nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>shows some reluctance on the part of juries to sentence juveniles to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On the international level, one study found that out of 101 countries with a minimum age for capital punishment, 17 set the minimum age at 18, and 77 set it at age 20. Sixteen countries either do not have a minimum age or did not provide adequate information. Patrick, <em>The Status of Capital Punishment: A World Perspective, </em>56 J.Crim.L., Crim. <em>&amp; </em>Pol.Sci. 397 (1965). On the other hand, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Convention on Human Rights have called for the abolition of capital punishment of juveniles. And, closer to home, the Model Penal Code has recommended that the death penalty be withheld from juvenile offenders. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.6(l)(d) (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Based on this evidence, we are unable to conclude that society\u2019s contemporary standards of decency have rejected capital punishment of juveniles. Even though few juvenile offenders are currently on death row, several other countries forbid it, and a significant body of scholarly thought rejects it, a firm majority of states still permit capital punishment of certain offenders under 18. This legislative judgment, in our view, is the most probative evidence of societal standards. Moreover, we must not lose sight of the purpose of this limited inquiry in the context of judicial review of a statute: we are to determine only whether society has rejected capital punishment of juveniles, not whether society should reject it, nor whether society eventually will reject, nor whether were we legislators rather than judges would reject it. Thus, the burden is on those seeking to overturn the legislature\u2019s judgment, a burden that has not been satisfied in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The Maryland Legislature\u2019s treatment of juveniles is entirely consistent with this country\u2019s overall treatment of juvenile offenders. True, juveniles \u201chave a very special place in life which the law should reflect,\u201d <em>May v. Anderson, </em>345 U.S. 528, 536, 73 S.Ct. 840, 844, 97 L.Ed. 1221, 1228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(1953) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), yet the law has long recognized that not all juveniles are susceptible to such benign treatment. Rather, Maryland like most states provides in its juvenile code that certain juveniles are to be treated as adults. <em>See </em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code \u00a7 3-804. This policy decision is predicated on the belief that juveniles who commit certain crimes, especially murder, should be fully accountable as adults. This reflects not only penological goals of retribution and deterrence, but also the pragmatic recognition that the overtaxed juvenile system simply cannot handle serious juvenile offenders. These judgments, reached in the course of representative democratic processes, are not inconsistent with evolving standards of decency.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The second facet of the Supreme Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence analyzes the particular offense for which the death penalty was imposed and its relationship to the purposes of capital punishment. We note first that this inquiry is presented in a slightly different light in this case, because here it is the offender, not the offense, that is the focus. Thus, in the absence of any guidance from the Supreme Court to the contrary, we will examine both the offender and the offense to determine whether the death penalty is excessive in this instance.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>the Supreme Court discussed at length the penological purposes behind the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKK\">The death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">In part, capital punishment is an expression of society\u2019s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct. This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahs\">\u201cThe instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they \u2018deserve,\u2019 then there are sown the seeds of anarchy\u2014of self-help, vigilante justice, and lynch law\u201d. <em>Furman v. Georgia, supra, </em>[408 U.S.] at 308, [92 S.Ct. at 2761] (Stewart, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2f\">Retribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law, <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 248 [69 S.Ct. 1079, 1084, 93 L.Ed. 1337] (1949), but neither is it a forbidden objective nor one inconsistent with our respect for the dignity of men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\"><em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. at 394-395 [92 S.Ct. at 2806-2807] (Burger, C.J., dissenting); <em>id,., </em>at 452-54 [92 S.Ct. at 2835-2836] (Powell, J., dissenting); <em>Powell v. Texas, </em>302 U.S., at 531, 535-536 [88 S.Ct. at 2153, 2155-2156] (plurality opinion). Indeed, the decision that capital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in extreme cases is an expression of the community\u2019s belief that certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Although some of the studies suggest that the death penalty may not function as a significantly greater deterrent than lesser penalties, there is no convincing empirical evidence either supporting or refuting this view. We may nevertheless assume safely that there are murderers, such as those who act in passion, for whom the threat of death has little or no deterrent effect. But for many others, the death penalty undoubtedly is a significant deterrent. There are carefully contemplated murders, such as murder for hire, where the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act. And there are some categories of murder, such as murder by a life prisoner, where other sanctions may not be adequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">The value of capital punishment as a deterrent of crime is a complex factual issue the resolution of which properly rests with the legislatures, which can evaluate the results of statistical studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of approach that is not available to the courts. <em>Furman v. Georgia, supra, </em>[408 U.S.] at 403-405 [92 S.Ct. at 2810-2812] (Burger, C.J. dissenting). Indeed, many of the <em>post-Furman </em>statutes reflect just such a responsible effort to define those crimes and those criminals for which capital punishment is most probably an effective deterrent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-6\"><em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. at 183-86, 96 S.Ct. at 2929-31, 49 L.Ed.2d at 880-82. (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Thus, the question here is whether society\u2019s interests in retribution and deterrence are served by imposing capital punishment for a rape-murder committed by a person four months shy of his eighteenth birthday. Even though society\u2019s interest in retribution is focused mainly on the crime, not the defendant, we do not believe that consideration of the defendant\u2019s age is irrelevant. Society\u2019s \u201cmoral outrage\u201d may be tempered somewhat by the youthful age of the perpetrator; hence the alternate \u201cresponse\u201d of treatment in the juvenile system. Nevertheless,' society\u2019s interest in retribution is by no means inapplicable in juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>nile cases: In extreme cases, the benign goals of the juvenile system are subordinated to the more broad-based and immediate interest in retribution. In short, a particularly heinous act can take the juvenile outside of the protective umbrella of the juvenile system.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We believe that just such a crime was committed here. Trimble\u2019s crime was not a youthful prank; it was a cold, brutal act of repeated and sadistic violence. The trial judge was presented with psychiatric testimony indicating that Trimble\u2019s prospects of rehabilitation were bleak. Thus, the one factor that could temper society\u2019s justifiable moral outrage was noticeably absent. In these circumstances, the death penalty is not an unjustified response solely because the perpetrator of these acts was four months shy of his eighteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">By contrast, the Supreme Court found that society\u2019s interest in retribution was not served in <em>Enmunds, </em>where the defendant was only vicariously liable for the murder under the felony-murder rule. The Court stated: \u201cPutting Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did not commit and had no intention of committing or causing does not measurably contribute to the retributive end of ensuring chat the criminal gets his just deserts.\u201d <em>Enmund, </em>458 U.S. at 801, 102 S.Ct. at 3378, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1154. Here, however, Trimble committed the murder by his own hand and with criminal intent. Thus, society\u2019s retributive ends will be served by responding with capital punishment notwithstanding Trimble\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The second major purpose of capital punishment\u2014deterrence\u2014involves different considerations. Addressing murder in general, the <em>Gregg </em>Court concluded that capital punishment \u201cundoubtedly is a significant deterrent.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>428 U.S. at 185-86, 96 S.Ct. at 2931, 49 L.Ed.2d at 881. Looking, as the <em>Enmund </em>Court directed, at the subjective culpability of the individual offender, <em>Enmund, </em>457 U.S. at 797, 102 S.Ct. at 3376, 73 L.Ed.2d at 1151, we again are persuaded that the death penalty measurably contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>utes to society\u2019s interest in deterrence so capital punishment in this case will not be a \u201cpurposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Coker </em>at 592, 97 S.Ct. at 2866, 53 L.Ed.2d at 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">This is not a case like <em>Enmund </em>where the deterrent function- of the criminal law could not operate because the defendant did not intend to kill the victim. Trimble\u2019s culpability level was unaffected by his age, which was only four months from the age of majority. Imposition of the death penalty in this instance will send a message to others contemplating similar acts that society will respond harshly to their actions. In short, we believe that seventeen-year-old youths can be deterred from committing brutal rape-murders, so the legislature\u2019s judgment in that regard is not a purposeless act.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The imposition of the death penalty in this instance measurably serves society\u2019s weighty interests in both retribution and deterrence. Thus, Trimble\u2019s sentence is \u201cmore than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Coker </em>at 592, 97 S.Ct. at 2866, 53 L.Ed.2d at 989. Nor is the capital sanction \u201cgrossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime,\u201d <em>id., </em>in this case a brutal rape-murder. For Eighth Amendment purposes the punishment is therefore constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">We wish to emphasize the narrowness of our constitutional holding today. We do not hold that the death penalty is constitutionally permissible as applied to all juveniles, nor do we hold that any particular chronological age serves as a bright line under which the death penalty may not be imposed. We simply hold that on the facts of this case, Trimble\u2019s age\u201417 years and 8 months\u2014does not engage the Eighth Amendment as a shield to capital punishment. We believe that such a case-by-case approach not only affords the accused the individualized consideration warranted in death-penalty cases, but it also avoids the arbitrary line-drawing that is endemic to any hard-and-fast distinction between juveniles and non-juveniles. <em>See Coker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. at 601, 97 S.Ct. at 2870, 53 L.Ed.2d at 995 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Trimble next challenges his sentence on the ground that it is inconsistent with the penalty imposed in this State for other rape-murderers who share his traits. In other words, he contends that his death sentence is disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The procedure for our review is mandated in Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 414. We first articulated the procedure for our function in <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>297 Md. 432, 468 A.2d 1 (1983) <em>(Tichnell III). </em>There, we recognized that the purpose of proportionality review under \u00a7 414(e)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> is substantially to eliminate \u201cthe possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury,\u201d so that if the time comes \u201cwhen juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case,\u201d this Court can vacate the death sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 457, 468 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. at 206, 96 S.Ct. at 2940, 49 L.Ed.2d at 893).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We have examined the record and find no basis to conclude that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Nor do we find any basis to conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding of the aggravating factors that the murder was committed during the course of a rape and that the victim was a hostage. The evidence is abundant that Trimble forcibly raped the victim, confined and restricted her to the vehicle, brutally assaulted her with a baseball bat about her head and body, and then slit her throat from ear to ear to make certain of her death. These facts satisfy the finding of these aggravating factors under \u00a7\u00a7 413(d)(4) and (10). We further conclude that the trial court had a sound basis to find these aggravating factors were not outweighed by the mitigating factors that the defendant had no prior record of violent crime, that he was of a youthful age, and that he had an antisocial personality coupled with substance abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">However, Trimble maintains that there are others who have committed rape-murders more horrible than his case reflects and these offenders have only received a life sentence. As illustrative of his point, Trimble cites the cases of Vincent Greco, Dean Oliver, Jack Jones, William Parker, John Kevin Johnson, Theodore Wiener, and Elvis Horton, all of whom brutally raped their victims before killing them and all of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment. He argues that his crime is no more aggravating than any of these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 473 A.2d 903 (1984), we established an inventory for rape-murders which included many of these cases. Ordinarily, that pool of cases along with any additional cases considered since we decided <em>Stebbing </em>would establish our inventory for determining the appropriateness of the death sentence for Trimble. However, because the thrust of Trimble\u2019s argument is that he was too young at the time of his crime to be sentenced to die, we shall consider other cases where the State sought the death penalty and the defendant was of youthful age. We do this even though we have already decided that the imposition of death on one of youthful age is not <em>per se </em>cruel and unusual punishment. Therefore, having reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the trial judge\u2019s reports in each of Maryland\u2019s capital sentencing proceedings, we have selected certain cases as similar where rape of the victim was an aggravating factor in the murder of the victim or the defendant arguably was of youthful age at the time of the crime, or both.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The cases we have selected as similar within the framework of Article 27, \u00a7 414(e)(4) are eight in number and are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Donald Thomas Maziarz. </em>Age 19 years and eleven months at the time of his crimes, Maziarz was convicted of first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree rape, and robbery. He was sentenced to death by a judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Maziarz and an accomplice met a woman at a bar and they all went to her apartment to drink and socialize. After a while Maziarz made sexual advances to the woman. When she refused he beat and raped her, after which his co-defendant raped her. The victim was then bound with a telephone cord. Maziarz turned on the gas stove in the kitchen and ignited matches in the living room. A fire resulted and Maziarz deliberately destroyed the smoke detector, which had been activated by the blaze. Maziarz then removed the victim\u2019s television from her apartment and left. An explosion occurred and the victim died of either smoke inhalation or extensive burns. The court found as aggravating factors that the murder was committed in the course of arson, rape, and robbery. As mitigating circumstances, the court found that the defendant had no prior conviction for a crime of violence, that the defendant\u2019s capacity was impaired, that the act of the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the murder, and that the defendant was of a youthful age.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Theodore Scott Wiener. </em>At the age of 19 years and 6 months, Wiener committed the crimes for which he was convicted by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in a non-jury trial. He raped a 22-year-old female and then stabbed her 101 times. The aggravating factor of first-degree rape was found to be outweighed by the mitigating factors of lack of a record of prior violent crimes, diminished capacity, and youthful age. A life sentence was imposed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>Vincent Tito Greco, Jr. </em>Age 21 years and 11 months, Greco raped and strangled to death a 78-year-old female. The trial court found that the aggravating factor or rape was outweighed by the following mitigating factors: (1) the lack of any prior record of violent crimes; (2) substantially impaired capacity; (3) youthful age; (4) unlikelihood that Greco would engage in further criminal activity if he were successfully treated; (5) Greco\u2019s kindly treatment of two young witnesses to the offense after it was committed; (6) evidence of a likelihood of rehabilitation and apparent amenability to treatment. A life sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><em>Lawrence Johnson. </em>Age 17 years and ten months at the time of these offenses, Lawrence Johnson was found guilty of premeditated first-degree murder, robbery, and daytime housebreaking. On January 9, 1979, he and Dwayne Mayers broke into a residence and brutally murdered a 78-year-old woman they encountered during the course of the crime. A sentencing proceeding was held, after which the trial judge granted a motion for a new hearing because of an error in the jury instructions. At the new hearing, the sentencing jury found one aggravating circumstance: that the defendant committed the murder in the course of the robbery. The jury also found one mitigating circumstance: that the act of the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the murder. The jury did not find that his age was a mitigating circumstance. A sentence of death was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Lawrence Johnson. </em>In this case Johnson\u2019s death sentence was vacated by this Court and the case remanded for resentencing because the jury did not find as a mitigating factor the absence of any prior conviction for a crime of violence although the existence of this mitigating factor was uncontradicted on the record. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 439 A.2d 542 (1982). Johnson<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> was two weeks short of being 19 years old when the crimes were committed. On February 23, 1980, Johnson and his companions drove the victim (who had been abducted in her car the night before by his companions) to a wooded area where Johnson and one Dwayne Mayers each raped the victim. Then, to avoid identification, Johnson shot the victim in the head four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On remand, the sentencing was conducted by the trial judge. As an aggravating factor he found that the murder was committed during the course of rape. The judge also found five mitigating factors: lack of any prior conviction for a crime of violence, acting under substantial duress or domination of another person, the substantial impairment of Johnson\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, youthful age, and that a co-defendant in another murder case had received a life sentence. The trial judge concluded that these mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factor and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Annette Louise Stebbing. </em>Stebbing was 19 years old when she strangled a female victim while directly assisting in the rape and sodomizing of the victim by her husband. At the sentencing proceeding, the trial judge found as an aggravating factor that the murder occurred during the course of the rape. The sole mitigating factor was that Stebbing had not been found guilty of a crime of violence. The court determined that this mitigating factor did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>outweigh the aggravating factor and sentenced Stebbing to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><em>Derrick Quinton White. </em>Age 18 at the time of the crime, White was found guilty of first-degree murder for the shooting death of a 61-year-old man who was riding a moped. As an aggravating circumstance, the jury found that White had committed the murder in the course of an attempted robbery. The jury found as mitigating circumstances that White (1) had not previously been convicted of a crime of violence and (2) lived in a poor environment which was conducive to unlawful conduct. The jury found, however, that these factors did not outweigh the aggravating factor of the attempted robbery. Accordingly, a death sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Brian Keith Quickley. </em>Age 16 at the time of the offense, Quickley was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery with a deadly weapon. He and his two brothers entered into a furniture store. While in the store, Brian shot the victim once between the eyes and then again in the neck region. The brothers then took several television sets and fled. The court found as an aggravating circumstance that the defendant committed the crime in the course of a robbery. The court found as mitigating circumstances the defendant\u2019s youthful age, his low intelligence, and his impoverished environment. A life sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">To summarize, the pool of cases we have selected for comparison comprises 5 rape-murders and 3 robbery-murders. The ages of the defendants range from 16 to 21 years. In the 2 rape-murders where the death penalty was imposed the defendants were 19 years old. In the 2 robbery-murder cases where the death penalty was imposed, the defendants were 17 and 18 years old at the time of their crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">We see no bright line by which this Court can say when death shall be imposed. Moreover, we believe the guidelines established by the legislature represent the clearest course of action in attempting to resolve this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Nevertheless, Trimble argues that the death penalty has not been imposed on a juvenile for rape-murder. Again we say while the youthful age of the offender is a relevant mitigating factor, it alone does not end the weighing process. Here, the sentencing authority had before it a wealth of information about Trimble\u2019s character. Trimble was expelled from school while in the 10th grade after several suspensions. At the time of the offense, he had been steadily employed at an airport for seven months. He maintained a steady relationship with a girlfriend. In addition to his low intelligence, he was diagnosed as having antisocial personality, possible temporary organic psychosis, and possible schizophrenia but nevertheless criminally responsible. These characteristics were exacerbated by his drug and alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">According to the psychiatric testimony, his criminal behavior was part of his lifestyle (he regarded Charles Manson as a role model) and a matter of choice. Trimble freely admitted his involvement in ten breaking and entering crimes, a handgun violation, an assault, and several drug arrests. He further admitted a pattern of sadistic behavior toward his girlfriend and animals. The psychiatrists determined his prospects for rehabilitation to be bleak because he had no respect for the rights of others. In our view, the trial judge who sentenced him to death could reasonably conclude that Trimble was an adult beyond repair rather than a juvenile in need of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We have said that under the federal constitution Trimble is not, because of his age, shielded from the death penalty. We further see no obstacle presented by \u00a7 414(e)(4), our state constitution, or the Declaration of Rights to prevent the imposition of the death penalty on account of his age. Trimble\u2019s ability to realize his actions were wrong and to conform his conduct to the letter of the law were not impaired by his age. We hold that the death sentence imposed on this defendant was neither excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Trimble also maintains that his sentence is disproportionate because his co-defendants were allowed to plead guilty to first-degree murder and avoid the death penalty. The short answer to this argument is that Trimble\u2019s co-defendants were ineligible for the death penalty because they were not principals in the first degree to the murder. <em>See </em>\u00a7 413(e)(1) of Art. 27. Trimble places particular emphasis on co-defendant Anthony Kordell, who testified for the State and was given a suspended sentence. The sentences of Trimble\u2019s accomplices do not, in our view, render Trimble\u2019s sentence disproportionate. First, the characteristics and conduct of each individual are a prime focus of proportionality review, so that the conduct of the accomplices has no bearing on the heinous crime committed by Trimble himself. The accomplices were far less culpable than Trimble. Although other accomplices raped the two women, it was Trimble himself who brutally beat Rogers and slit her throat. This conduct plainly distinguishes Trimble from the others, making different treatment appropriate. Second, mechanically linking the sentence of an accomplice to Trimble\u2019s own sentence has several unfortunate results: it places an artificial limitation on an offender\u2019s sentence; it restricts the plea-bargaining process in multiple-defendant cases; it prevents the individual consideration of each sentence required in capital cases. Therefore, we hold that Trimble\u2019s sentence is proportionate notwithstanding the lesser sentences received by his accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Trimble lastly argues that the Maryland capital-punishment statute is unconstitutional on a number of grounds.

The trial court was following the insanity-defense procedures established by this Court in <em>Bradford v.

Once the court found that the evidence could generate a jury issue, the evidence was submitted to the jury with the State first introducing its evidence as to the commission of the crime, followed by evidence of the defendant\u2019s sanity; the defendant then was allowed to produce evidence of insanity. <em>See abo Fowler v.

It finds that the objected to portion of the closing argument was nothing more than an effort to attack the credibility of an expert witness. In my view, the objected to portion of the closing argument constituted a contradiction of the trial judge\u2019s previous ruling that the sole defense psychiatrist was qualified and competent and, consequently, that his expert opinion, that as a result of mental disorders the appellant was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law, was admissible. It also contradicted the trial judge\u2019s binding instruction that the jury should consider, among other things, the defense psychiatrist\u2019s expert opinion. Under established Maryland law, a ruling and binding instruction on such matters cannot be disputed by counsel in argument to the jury. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Here the record shows that the appellant was 17-years old at the time of the commission of the crimes. The record further shows that the appellant\u2019s sole defense was insanity. The appellant called only one witness, Dr. Robert B. Lehman (defense psychiatrist), who testified that he was graduated from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1971; that in that year he was licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland; that he was trained in general psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry at the Sheppard-Pratt Hospital; that for seven years he had been in private practice specializing in adolescent and child psychiatry; that he was on the staff of the Baltimore County General Hospital; that he was a clinical instructor in child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine; and that his clinical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>educational skills in psychiatry were certified to by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">When defense counsel asked that the defense psychiatrist be qualified as an expert witness, the State indicated that it had \u201cno questions\u201d and did not cross examine the defense psychiatrist with respect to his qualifications. The trial judge then ruled that the defense psychiatrist was qualified as an expert. The State did not object to the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The record further shows that the defense psychiatrist gave oral testimony and submitted a written report in which, among other things, he expressed the opinion that, as a result of mental disorders, the appellant was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. The State did not object to the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">After the State and the defense rested, the trial judge instructed the jury. With respect to expert testimony, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201cYou will recall we have heard several doctors or psychiatrists\u2019 testimony in this case. A witness who has special training or experience in a given field is permitted to express opinions based on observed or assumed facts to aid you in deciding the issues in this case. In weighing the opinions of experts you should consider the expert\u2019s experience, training, and skills, and the expert\u2019s knowledge of the subject matter about which he is expressing an opinion. You should give expert testimony the weight and value you believe it should have. You are not required to accept any expert\u2019s opinion. <em>You should consider an expert\u2019s opinion together with all the other evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Additionally, the record shows that in closing argument, the State\u2019s Attorney argued to the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201cIn that regard whom did the defense put on to testify that this defendant was in fact insane at the time of the offense? I submit to you nobody. <em>Nobody testified he was insane at the time of the offense. </em>Dr. Lehman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>testified and Dr. Lehman has no formal training in forensic psychiatry. He has a practice limited to child and adolescent psychiatry. He is not affiliated with any State or mental hospital, and he has in the past only examined five defendants to determine their responsibility at the time of a given offense. <em>He, </em>unlike Dr. Spodak and Dr. Blumberg, <em>is eminently unqualified to give an opinion </em>seven months after the occurrence of an offense <em>as to what the defendant\u2019s mental state was at the time of the offense.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Defense counsel\u2019s objection to this portion of the argument was overruled by the trial judge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">Finally, the record shows that in closing argument, defense counsel placed heavy emphasis on the evidence of insanity adduced by the defense psychiatrist. Initially, in explaining that the State had the burden of proof on the question of sanity, he said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cAll the doctors agree he is crazy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">They all will agree he is crazy. Now, the job of this jury really is to determine how crazy is he. The State has to prove he is sane. The burden of proof is on them, not on us. <em>We have already proved that he is insane, </em>but the burden is on the State to prove he was sane.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The significance of the evidence of insanity adduced by the defense psychiatrist was again stressed at the conclusion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\"><em>\u201cI also leave you with something else that is extremely important. I leave you with a copy of Dr. Lehman\u2019s report, </em>the same exact copy that he gave to me, not edited, not inked out, bad things as well as good. Contrary to what [the State\u2019s Attorney] says, Dr. Lehman\u2019s qualifications are very, very good. He is a specialist in adolescent psychiatry, and he is board certified. That is very difficult to get done. I have prepared a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>copies of this report for you to take into the jury room with you to refer to.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">I agree with the majority that \u201cboth the State\u2019s Attorney and defense counsel are given wide latitude in the conduct of closing argument, including the right to explain or to attack all the evidence in the case.\u201d Nevertheless, under Maryland law, there are limitations upon the general scope of permissible closing argument. <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 413-23, 326 A.2d 707, 714-20 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Under Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as construed by this Court, there is an established dichotomy between the role of the trial judge and the jury with respect to the determination of questions of law. <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 84, 91, 437 A.2d 654, 658 (1981); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 178-80, 423 A.2d 558, 564-65 (1980). The jury\u2019s authority is limited to deciding \u201cthe law of the crime\u201d or \u201cthe definition of the crime\u201d as well as \u201cthe legal effect of the evidence.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 178, 423 A.2d at 564. All other legal issues are for the trial judge alone to decide. <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 179, 423 A.2d at 565. More particularly, questions of the qualification and competency of expert and other witnesses and the admissibility of evidence are for the trial judge alone to determine and are not for the jury to decide. <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 179, 423 A.2d at 564; <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 338, 368 A.2d 1005, 1015 (1977); <em>Hewitt v. Maryland State Board of Censors, </em>243 Md. 574, 582, 221 A.2d 894, 898 (1966); <em>Turner v. State Roads Commission, </em>213 Md. 428, 433, 132 A.2d 455, 457 (1957). Once evidence is admitted, the jury\u2019s function is limited to determining its weight. <em>Duffin v. State, </em>229 Md. 434, 436, 184 A.2d 624, 625 (1962); <em>Rasin v. State, </em>153 Md. 431, 435, 138 A. 338, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>340 (1927); <em>see Bellamy v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 65, 72-73, 435 A.2d 821, 825 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>292 Md. 376 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">A trial judge\u2019s instructions on the legal questions of the qualification and competency of expert and other witnesses and the admissibility of evidence are binding upon the jury and may not be disputed by counsel in argument to the jury. <em>Montgomery, </em>292 Md. at 88, 437 A.2d at 656; <em>Stevenson, </em>289 Md. at 180, 423 A.2d at 565; Md.Rule 4-325(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Manifestly, a trial judge\u2019s rulings on qualification and competency of expert witnesses and on the admissibility of evidence, like a trial judge\u2019s instructions on such legal questions, are binding upon the jury and may not be disputed by counsel in argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The rationale underlying this principle was expressed by this Court as long ago as 1881 in <em>Bell v. State, </em>57 Md. 108, 120-21 (1881). There this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201c[Counsel] are still officers of the court, and under its proper control, and if the court expresses an opinion on a question of law, upon which it has a right to express it, and a party considers himself aggrieved by it, he has his remedy, either by petition in the nature of a writ of error, or by a bill of exception. But counsel have no right, and ought not to be permitted to argue against it before the jury, in order to induce them to disregard it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">This rationale is equally valid today. Arguments that contradict a trial judge\u2019s binding rulings and instructions on questions of law inevitably create confusion and may well induce the jury not to consider evidence for inappropriate reasons\u2014reasons that are contrary to law. While a jury may appropriately disregard admitted expert opinion evidence after considering it and determining that it lacks credibility and, therefore, is not entitled to any weight, it is inappropriate for a jury to disregard such evidence without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>considering it at all. Indeed, the administration of justice is not furthered by permitting counsel to encourage juries not to consider evidence for reasons that are contrary to law. Thus, it is not within the general scope of permissible closing argument to mislead the jury by inducing it to disregard the trial judge\u2019s binding rulings and instructions on questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Here the trial judge ruled that the defense psychiatrist was qualified and competent and, consequently, that his expert opinion that as a result of mental disorders the appellant was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was admissible evidence to be considered by the jury. Moreover, the trial judge instructed the jury to consider that expert opinion. If the State\u2019s Attorney was of the view that the defense psychiatrist was not qualified and that his opinion was inadmissible and should not have been considered by the jury, he should have objected and preserved the issue for review. However, the State\u2019s Attorney did not object. Instead, he argued to the jury that the defense psychiatrist was \u201ceminently unqualified\u201d and that \u201c[njobody testified [that the appellant] was insane at the time of the offense.\u201d In essence, the State\u2019s Attorney argued to the jury that the defense psychiatrist was not qualified and that, consequently, his opinion was inadmissible and should not be considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In sum, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s argument was not merely an attack on the credibility of the defense psychiatrist. Rather, it was a contradiction of the trial judge\u2019s previous ruling and binding instruction. It was, therefore, misleading and confusing. The State\u2019s Attorney had no right and ought not to have been permitted to induce the jury not to consider the defense psychiatrist\u2019s expert opinion on the question of sanity for inappropriate reasons\u2014reasons contrary to the trial judge\u2019s previous ruling and binding instruction, and therefore contrary to law. In my view, the objected to portion of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s closing argument exceeded the scope of permissible closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>In this case, the appellant\u2019s sole defense was insanity. The defense psychiatrist was the only witness that the appellant called. At the time of the trial in this case, the State had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was sane at the time the criminal acts were committed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Bradford v. State, </em>234 Md. 505, 513, 200 A.2d 150, 155 (1964). Consequently, at the moment of truth, the jury\u2019s verdicts depended upon whether the evidence presented by the defense psychiatrist was sufficiently compelling to raise a reasonable doubt as to the appellant\u2019s sanity. The State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s improper closing argument may well have misled and confused the jury, and induced it, for inappropriate reasons, not to consider the only evidence presented by the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt. Under these circumstances, I cannot, upon reviewing the record, declare a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the objected to portion of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s closing argument in no way influenced the jury\u2019s verdicts. Accordingly, I would reverse the convictions and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. Art. 23 of the Md.
