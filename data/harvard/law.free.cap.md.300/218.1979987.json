MORTON, Jr.,</author>\n<p id=\"AV2\">Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals (retired), Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In this case, we are confronted with the question whether the State\u2019s failure to provide appellant with adequate notice, pursuant to Maryland Rule 734 b, of its intent to seek enhanced punishment under Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1983 Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b), mandates reversal of appellant\u2019s sentence as a subsequent offender for unlawful possession and transportation of a handgun. We conclude that although the State\u2019s notice was defective, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we shall uphold the sentence and affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>King v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 672, 466 A.2d 1292 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Because the issue presented on this appeal involves only the propriety of the sentence imposed, it is unnecessary to delineate the facts underlying King\u2019s conviction. King was arrested for a violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in July 1981. After praying for a jury trial, King was arraigned in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on September 14, 1981. At this time, the State served King with notice of its intent to seek additional or mandatory sentence as authorized by Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(b)(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this statute, if a defendant has previously been convicted of unlawful possession and transportation of a handgun then the Court must impose at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>a sentence of one year imprisonment, but may impose a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment. The notice in this case provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201c[T]he State will seek increased punishment as authorized by law since Maurice King, Defendant, was convicted of the violation(s) of Art. 27 Sections 36; 36B of the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cThe maximum increased/mandatory punishment, if the Court determines that the Defendant is a subsequent offender, is imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of _, or both on the above stated charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">King was convicted by a jury on August 10, 1982. The court deferred sentencing proceedings until September 17, 1982. At the sentencing hearing, appellant objected for the first time to the State\u2019s attempt to seek enhanced punishment. Appellant asserted that the notice of his prior conviction for unlawful possession of a handgun was inadequate under Maryland Rule 734.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> King contended in partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ular that the State\u2019s notice failed to comply with the requirement in Rule 734 b that \u201c[t]he notice shall set forth each prior conviction to be relied upon.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel admitted to the trial court that there was no surprise, and indeed that there was full knowledge on the part of both appellant and his attorney, with respect to the prior conviction. Nevertheless, he claimed that the technical failure to comply with the rule was itself prejudicial and should result in rendering the enhanced punishment statute inapplicable. The trial court dismissed this objection on the basis that, although the State\u2019s failure to serve adequate notice pursuant to Rule 734 b was \u201cinexcusable,\u201d the lack of surprise as well as prejudice to the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare his defense necessitated a finding of substantial compliance with the purpose of the rule. The trial court sentenced appellant to ten years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed King\u2019s sentence in <em>King v. State, 55 </em>Md.App. 672, 466 A.2d 1292 (1983). The court determined that the notice served King was timely and informed him that the State intended to seek enhanced punishment based on the prior conviction. Therefore, the notice was sufficient to allow the defendant to competently plead to and defend the current charge, especially given his actual knowledge of the prior conviction-relied on by the State. The court concluded that the underlying purpose and function of Rule 734 were satisfied in this case. 55 Md.App. at 687, 466 A.2d at 1300. Because the intermediate appellate court apparently relied on the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the rule, we issued a writ of certiorari in order to clarify two points: First, that the State did not substantially comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>with the notice provision contained in Rule 734 b; and second, that the failure to comply with the rule constitutes, given the facts of the present case, harmless rather than reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">This Court delineated the dimensions of the harmless error doctrine in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). We stated, \u201c[Wjhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed 'harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d 276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. In <em>Dorsey, </em>we determined that the erroneous admission of a detective\u2019s testimony, which included his opinion as to the basis of defendant\u2019s guilt, directly influenced the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty and, thus, constituted reversible error. 276 Md. at 659-60, 350 A.2d at 678-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Since our decision in <em>Dorsey, </em>we have applied the harmless error doctrine in several cases which involved alleged violations of the various Maryland Rules applicable to criminal actions. For example, in <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. 549, 446 A.2d 844 (1982), the appellant claimed that his absence from the voir dire of a juror at the bench violated his right under Maryland Rule 724 to be present at every stage of his trial. Judge Eldridge noted for the Court, \u201cThis Court has firmly adhered to the principle that the rules of procedure are precise rubrics to be strictly followed, and we shall continue to do so. A violation of one of these rules constitutes error, normally requiring such curative action or sanction as may be appropriate.\u201d 293 Md. at 557, 446 A.2d at 848. He went on to say, \u201cIt does not follow, however, that the harmless error doctrine has no application to the Maryland Rules and that a violation of a procedural rule can never be harmless. There is no basis in authority or logic for such a holding.\u201d 293 Md. at 558, 446 A.2d at 848. After determining that a violation of a procedural rule will not result in reversal of a criminal conviction if the standard for harmless error is satisfied, we held in <em>Noble </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>defendant\u2019s absence from the voir dire of a juror did not result in prejudice to him. Therefore, there was no reversible error. 293 Md. at 571-72, 446 A.2d at 856. For other cases involving violations of criminal rules in which the harmless error doctrine was considered, see, e.g., <em>Broadway v. State, </em>298 Md. 237, 468 A.2d 351 (1983) (Rule 775 c: notice with respect to grounds for revocation of probation); <em>Sherman v. State, </em>288 Md. 636, 421 A.2d 80 (1980) (Rule 758 a: previously dismissed indictments in jury room during deliberation); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>283 Md. 196, 388 A.2d 926 (1978) (Rule 753 (now Rule 755): sequestration of witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The <em>Dorsey </em>standard for harmless error has been applied most frequently in cases raising questions concerning those proceedings which lead to the determination of a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Nothing in the cases, however, suggests that application of the standard should be limited to pretrial or trial proceedings. We note for purposes of clarification, therefore, that the harmless error doctrine as delineated in <em>Dorsey </em>applies not only to proceedings involving the determination of an individual\u2019s guilt or innocence, but also to proceedings involving his sentence after conviction. <em>See Wiener v. State, </em>290 Md. 425, 450-51, 430 A.2d 588, 602 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Having established that the harmless error doctrine applies to the instant case, we turn to an analysis of the underlying purpose and function of the notice requirement contained in Rule 734 b. The propriety of subjecting repeat offenders to enhanced punishment \u201chas long been recognized in this country and in England.\u201d <em>See Graham v. West Virginia, </em>224 U.S. 616, 623, 32 S.Ct. 583, 56 L.Ed. 917 (1912) (Court upheld constitutionality of bifurcated procedure, whereby fact of prior conviction was alleged in information and was proved at a proceeding subsequent to the current conviction). This Court first recognized the validity of imposing increased sanctions for repeat offenders in <em>Maguire v. State, </em>47 Md. 485 (1878). In that case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>defendant was indicted for three counts of liquor law violations; each count was alleged to have been the defendant\u2019s second such offense. In his opening statement, the prosecutor read that part of the indictment containing the allegations of prior convictions. The Court rejected defendant\u2019s objection to this practice on the basis that it exposed him to double punishment. First, the Court noted that the rationale underlying enhanced punishment statutes is that a person who has previously been convicted of the crime with which he is currently charged is presumed to be aware of the penalties attaching to the offense. 47 Md. at 495. Judge Alvey remarked that if the first conviction was \u201cinsufficient to restrain his vicious propensities,\u201d a defendant \u201chas no reasonable cause of complaint that his former transgressions, under the same law, are brought up in judgment against him.\u201d 47 Md. at 496. The Court further stated, \u201cNo constitutional objection exists to such regulation of punishment; and provisions in statutes similar to that under which the present indictment was framed, have been uniformly sustained, whenever or wherever questioned.\u201d 47 Md. at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Second, the Court upheld the proceeding whereby the fact of a prior conviction was averred in the indictment of the current offense. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe indictment must contain an averment of every fact essential to justify the punishment inflicted.\u201d 47 Md. at 496. Therefore, the fact of a prior conviction was necessary to the indictment for the second offense, to which enhanced punishment would attach. The prior conviction was to be proven by production of the record of the prior charge and by proof that the same person committed both the prior and the current offenses. 47 Md. at 497. The Court pointed out, however, that \u201csuch an averment of prior conviction does not charge an offense. As said by Lord Campbell, in <em>Reg. v. Clark, </em>[20 E.L. &amp; Eq. 582], \u2018it is only the averment of a fact which may affect the punishment. The jury do not find the person guilty of the previous offense; they only find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that he was previously convicted of it, as an historical fact.\u2019 \u201d 47 Md. at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Subsequent to the decision in <em>Maguire, </em>the Court continued to recognize the necessity of including in the indictment for a current offense an averment which alleged a prior conviction, as well as having the jury determine that the defendant actually was convicted of that prior offense. <em>See, e.g., Hall v. State, </em>121 Md. 577, 89 A. 111 (1913); <em>Goeller v. State, </em>119 Md. 61, 85 A. 954 (1912). The purpose of alleging a prior conviction in the indictment was to inform a defendant of the accusation against him with sufficient detail in order to enable him to prepare adequately for his def\u00e9nse. <em>Hall, </em>121 Md. at 581, 89 A. at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The requirement that the jury establish the historical fact of a prior conviction when it assessed the guilt of a defendant with respect to a current offense was questioned by the Court in <em>Beard v. State, </em>216 Md. 302, 140 A.2d 672, <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 846, 79 S.Ct. 72, 3 L.Ed.2d 81 (1958). In <em>Beard, </em>defendant was indicted for violations of the narcotics laws. The Court confronted two issues relevant to the instant case: whether the indictment properly alleged the fact of his prior conviction for the same offense; and whether the jury\u2019s general verdict of guilty, which failed to specify the historical fact of the prior conviction as well as guilt for the current offense, was sufficient to subject him to enhanced punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The Court considered the latter question first, and noted, \u201cIn this State, under the rule of the <em>Maguire </em>case and of the cases following it, if there is a general verdict of guilty on a count or indictment charging a current offense and alleging one or more prior offenses, the defendant can be sentenced only as for a first offense.\u201d 216 Md. at 309, 140 A.2d at 676. The defendant\u2019s admission by stipulation in open court of the prior conviction, however, was deemed sufficient to support his being sentenced as a repeat offender. As the Court stated, \u201c[I]t would be an unwarranted refinement of technicality which would serve no useful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>purpose, to hold that, in spite of the defendant\u2019s stipulation of record admitting two prior convictions, the jury must, nevertheless, pass upon them.\u201d 216 Md. at 312, 140 A.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">With respect to the other issue, the Court concluded that the precise form of an indictment was immaterial so long as it sufficiently informed the defendant of all necessary facts on which enhanced punishment would be based. 216 Md. at 319-20, 140 A.2d at 682. In <em>Beard, </em>the combination of the jury\u2019s determination of defendant\u2019s guilt as to the current offense and his admission of the former convictions justified the increased penalty. 216 Md. at 319-20, 140 A.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">At the conclusion of the Court\u2019s opinion, Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e noted that the Rules Committee might consider whether to adopt a change in the <em>Maguire </em>rule, given that neither a particular form of indictment alleging a prior conviction nor the practice of having the jury pass on the accused\u2019s former convictions was constitutionally required. 216 Md. at 320, 140 A.2d at 682-83. Indeed, in <em>Oyler v. Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), the Supreme Court determined that \u201ca defendant must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge even if due process does not require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive offense.\u201d 368 U.S. at 452, 82 S.Ct. at 504. Under the statute at issue in <em>Boles, </em>notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek enhanced punishment was timely even if served on defendant after the trial on the current offense; a jury trial was provided for on the issue of identity if the defendant denied that he was the person named in the information alleging the prior conviction. 368 U.S. at 452-53, 82 S.Ct. at 503-04. <em>See also Loveday v. State, </em>296 Md. 226, 237-38, 462 A.2d 58, 63 (1983) (constitutionality of imposing more severe penalties on subsequent offenders \u201cno longer open to challenge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In response to the Court\u2019s invitation in <em>Beard, </em>the Rules Committee promulgated Maryland Rule 713. Under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>713, which was adopted in 1962, the indictment was silent as to the State\u2019s intent to prosecute the accused as a second offender. Rather, the rule required the attachment of an addendum to the indictment, which informed the defendant that: the State had evidence of the prior convictions; the State intended to prosecute the accused as a second offender; the maximum punishment may be imposed if convicted; and the defendant had the right to request that the issue of whether he had in fact been previously convicted for the same crime could be tried concurrently with the current offense. Although the procedure had altered, under Rule 713 the existence of a prior conviction continued to be a triable issue determined by, at the defendant\u2019s election, either court or jury. <em>See, e.g., Ware v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 302, 305-06, 283 A.2d 177, 179-80 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The promulgation and adoption of Rule 734 in 1976 discontinued the practice of informing an accused at the time of his indictment- for the current offense that the State intends to seek enhanced punishment based on a former conviction. Under the rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u201cno defendant shall be sentenced as a subsequent offend- \u2022 er unless prior to acceptance of a plea of guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>or at least 15 days prior to trial, whichever is earlier, the State\u2019s Attorney serves a notice on the defendant or his counsel that the State will seek increased punishment as authorized by law. The notice shall set forth each prior conviction to be relied upon.\u201d Md.Rule 734 b.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Further, the rule provides, \u201cThe allegation that the defendant is a subsequent offender is not an issue in the trial upon a charging document and may not be disclosed to the trier of fact without the consent of the defendant....\u201d Md.Rule 734 d. Moreover, the rule states, \u201cBefore sentencing and after giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard, the court shall determine whether the defendant is a subsequent offender as specified in the notice of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d Md.Rule 734 e.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>As an annotation to the rule there appears the following Committee Note: \u201cSentencing a defendant as a subsequent offender is here conceived to be in the sentencing power of the court and not a matter for a jury. The burden of establishing the prior offense rests with the State.\u201d It follows, therefore, that the fact of a former conviction pertains only to the sentencing of the defendant after his conviction for the current offense. <em>See Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Memorandum on Draft Rule 734 Attached to the 53rd Report </em>at 4 (1976) (submitted by Robert J. Ryan, Reporter). The purpose of giving a defendant notice before trial of the State\u2019s intent to seek enhanced punishment is to permit a realistic assessment of the consequences of defending the current offense at trial or pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">When the Rules Committee submitted its report on Rule 734, it indicated that the rule was modeled on provisions in the United States Code and the District of Columbia Code. <em>Memorandum on Draft Rule 734 </em>at 3. Therefore, it is instructive to consider those cases which have interpreted and applied the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575 (1982)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 23-111 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Very few cases have confronted, even remotely, the issue raised in this case, which involves the determination of whether insufficient notice of the government\u2019s intent to seek enhanced punishment can be harmless error. In <em>Arnold v. United States, </em>443 A.2d 1318 (D.C.1982), the government filed an information, which stated the previous convictions it relied on to seek sentencing of the appellant as a subsequent offender, after the impaneling of the jury. The court held that although D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 23-lll(a)(l) provides that the notice must be filed prior to the impaneling of the jury, and therefore that the government\u2019s notice clearly was untimely, the error was harmless. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201c[Wjhile we conclude that the prosecutor must file informations seeking enhanced punishment prior to the start of the impaneling of the jury, we believe that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to do so in this case constituted harmless error____ Here, the record reveals that appellant was fully aware of the government\u2019s intention to file informations seeking enhanced punishment, thus allowing him an adequate opportunity to determine whether to plead guilty or proceed to trial. The overriding statutory purpose of providing a defendant \u2018notice\u2019 of the possibility of enhanced punishment was clearly satisfied in this case.\u201d 443 A.2d at 1327-28.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">No federal case involving 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575 (1982) has applied the harmless error doctrine to circumstances in which the government served inadequate notice on the defendant. At least two cases, however, have indicated that the government\u2019s substantial compliance with the notice requirement of the statute was sufficient. <em>See Marshall v. United States, </em>576 F.2d 160, 162-63 (9th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Ilacqua, </em>562 F.2d 399, 403-04 (6th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Our review of the history of Rule 734 leads us to the conclusion that the State\u2019s notice in the instant case was inadequate. The purpose underlying the notice provision of the enhanced punishment statute is, and always has been, to inform a defendant fully of the nature of the State\u2019s case against him in order that he may intelligently conduct his defense. This purpose has remained constant even though the existence of a prior conviction has shifted from an historical fact to be proven at the guilt stage of a criminal trial to a fact to be considered by the trial judge in determining the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The rule provides that the notice \u201cshall set forth each prior conviction to be relied upon.\u201d This language clearly indicates that the former conviction be delineated with particularity, including the date of the conviction, the court in which the proceedings occurred, the statute under which the conviction was obtained, and the exact nature of the offense with which the defendant was charged. Against this standard, the State\u2019s notice in this case clearly is deficient, for it simply stated that appellant King was convicted of a violation of \u201cArt. 27 Sections 36; 36B of the State of Maryland.\u201d Section 36 authorizes punishment for carrying a weapon, either concealed or openly, with intent to injure. As delineated in \u00a7 36(a), the term \u201cweapon\u201d includes various dangerous articles, but handguns are expressly excluded. Therefore, the reference to Art. 27, \u00a7 36 was irrelevant to the offense for which King was tried in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the instant case. In addition, the mere reference to the prior conviction under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B was insufficient for no specific or detailed information, such as that delineated above, was included.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The determination that the notice was inadequate to satisfy the requirements of Rule 734 does not in any way preclude our holding that, under the facts of this case, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The record establishes that the State served notice of its intent to seek the maximum ten year sentence for second offenders at least fifteen days before trial, as required by Rule 734 b. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201ca defendant has no duty to bring a defective notice to the State\u2019s attention,\u201d <em>King v. State, 55 </em>Md.App. at 678, 466 A.2d at 1295, and we have determined that the defective notice served in this case failed to discharge the State\u2019s burden of establishing the prior conviction. Nevertheless, the defendant was aware of the precise prior conviction to be relied upon at the time he received the notice. Indeed, King\u2019s counsel conceded this knowledge at the sentencing hearing. Therefore, the appellant cannot allege surprise. Moreover, there was no prejudice. Given that there was full knowledge of the nature and circumstances of the prior conviction despite the inadequate notice, the appellant was not in any way hampered in his ability either to decide whether to plead guilty or proceed to trial, or having elected a jury trial, in presenting and preparing his defense. Thus, the lack of surprise or prejudice to King by virtue of the State\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 734 b leads us to conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT.

The federal statute requires that the government establish not only that a particular defendant is a repeat offender, but also that he is dangerous. The statute provides that the prosecutor must serve before trial a notice \"(1) specifying that the defendant is a dangerous special offender who upon conviction for such felony is subject to the imposition of [an enhanced punishment], and (2) setting out with particularity the reasons why such attorney believes the defendant to be a dangerous special offender.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3575(a) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">.

Although the government failed to file an information delineating the prior conviction, the defendant admitted in open court that he realized his second conviction would subject him to a mandatory minimum sentence without probation. Given this admission, the court concluded, \"In our view the defect or omission here involved does not involve a substantial right. If failure to file such an information was error we regard it as harmless.\u201d 225 F.2d at 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
