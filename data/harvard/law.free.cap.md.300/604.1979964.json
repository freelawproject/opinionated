The parties had been divorced <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>on February 19, 1969. Pursuant to the divorce, appellant paid child support for each of their three children until they reached the age of majority\u2014age twenty one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By court order, payments were ended in August of 1980, all children having reached the requisite age.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">By the complaint filed herein, Mrs. Sininger sought support for their daughter Janette, who although age twenty-three at the time, suffered from severe mental illness and was incapable of supporting and caring for herself. At hearings before a domestic relations master testimony focused on when Janette\u2019s disability occurred. Appellant contended that Janette was not disabled by her illness until she became an emancipated adult. Both parties agree that after reaching age twenty one, Janette left the family home and held her own apartment and a job. Further, it is uncontested that Janette presently is disabled and requires medical attention. Appellee maintained, however, that Janette\u2019s mental illness, hence her disability, began in childhood and that she never was able to care for herself properly. The evidence focused on this question because in ruling on appellant\u2019s Motion for Decision of a Question of Law, the master had held that for support to be awarded, appellee had to prove that Janette\u2019s mental or physical disability existed before she reached the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">After hearing the evidence, the master found that Janette was not disabled at the time she attained the age of majority, and he denied support. Appellee excepted to the master\u2019s legal and factual conclusions. The circuit court accepted the master\u2019s factual finding concerning the time that the disability occurred, but granted appellee\u2019s exception to the master\u2019s legal conclusion that the duty to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>port an adult child existed only when the disability preceded emancipation. The court concluded that Janette was currently disabled and that Maryland law imposed an obligation on her parents to contribute to her support. The case was remanded to the master to determine Janette\u2019s needs and the relative abilities of her parents to pay. Based on all the testimony, the master recommended child support of $300.00 per month commencing and accounting from January 1, 1982. Both parties excepted to the master\u2019s recommendations. The circuit court overruled the exceptions and adopted the master\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Mr. Sininger appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and Mrs. Sininger cross-appealed contending that the sum awarded and the retroactive date set were clearly erroneous. Prior to consideration by the intermediate appellate court, we issued certiorari on our own motion to consider this issue of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Appellant first contends that the equity court lacked jurisdiction to order child support because jurisdiction terminated once the children attained the age of majority. Appellant\u2019s contention focuses on the lack of continuing jurisdiction. The complaint, however, although based in equity, is not for modification of the original support order. The complaint here relies on the court\u2019s general equity jurisdiction and not on its continuing jurisdiction in the original domestic relations case. Appellant essentially concedes that section 3-602(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> grants the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>circuit court jurisdiction over a child; and that if the term \u201cchild\u201d has been statutorily enlarged it may include more than persons under the age of majority. In the instant case the issue before us is whether an incapacitated adult child is to be treated on equal footing with a minor child. Because we will hold that the parent has a duty to support an incapacitated adult child and because such an adult child is to be treated on equal footing with a minor child, the parents duty is properly enforceable under section 3-602(a), Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Appellant contends, and the dissent agrees, that the duty to support a disabled child into adulthood continues because the disability prevents the child from ever becoming emancipated. The reasoning is that because the child is incapable of emancipation, he remains a minor and the obligation continues until the condition changes. Appellant concedes that the parental duty to support exists in the situation where the incapacitation is continuing from the child\u2019s minority, but contends that the duty extends no further. Appellant contends that once a child becomes an emancipated adult the obligation of parental support cannot be resumed. We shall refer to this view as the emancipation rationale. Appellant supports these contentions by characterizing <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>227 Md. 355, 176 A.2d 862 (1962), the pivotal case on point, as a case limited to its facts, which involve a child incapacitated during his minority. Essentially, the appellant would draw a distinction in the parents\u2019 support obligation based upon the time that the child\u2019s disability arose. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In <em>Borchert v. Borchert, </em>185 Md. 586, 45 A.2d 463 (1946), this Court first addressed the issue of a parent\u2019s duty to support an adult incompetent child. The Court pointed out that no common law obligation to support adult incompetent children existed, <em>id. </em>at 590, 45 A.2d at 465, but noted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tendency in other jurisdictions to expand the common law and to recognize a duty, <em>id. </em>at 592, 45 A.2d at 465. The Court, however, chose not to follow the trend in the absence of statutory authority in this state to enforce such a duty. <em>Id. </em>at 594-95, 45 A.2d at 466-67. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">\u201cHowever desirable it may be for some power to exist by which a father may be compelled to support his son, ... the Legislature has not seen fit to make the failure to do so a criminal offense although it has so designated such failure in other domestic situations heretofore mentioned. The omission by the legislative branch of the government of such a statute is an indication that the failure to support an incapacitated child is placed by it on a different footing from the failure to support a minor child. We cannot now without further legislative action hold that the divorce statute attempted to be invoked in this case is enlarged to include other than minor children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><em>Id. </em>The Court was content to hold that a parental duty did exist for purposes of the law of the case based upon the concession of the appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 45 A.2d at 46. In view of the Court\u2019s holding that such a duty was ultimately unenforceable, it was not essential to determine whether the duty was recognized in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The General Assembly promptly responded to the legislative omission noted by the Court in <em>Borchert, </em>and in 1947 enacted what is now codified as Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 97. The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\u201c\u00a7 97. Failure of parent to support destitute adult child.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">Any person who has an adult child destitute of means and unable to support himself by reason of mental or physical infirmity, who is possessed of or able to earn means sufficient to provide such child with necessary shelter, food, care and clothing and who neglects or refuses so to do, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>The Court again faced the issue in <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>227 Md. 355, 176 A.2d 862 (1962). In <em>Smith, </em>a chancellor\u2019s order for the divorced father to pay support for his physically incapacitated adult child, who lacked other means of support, was upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 176 A.2d at 865. The Court reviewed the <em>Borchert </em>decision and then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\u201cIt is significant, we think, that at the first opportunity after the <em>Borchert </em>decision further legislative action was in fact taken. At its 1947 session the Legislature enacted an act now codified as \u00a7 97 of Art. 27, Code (1957), making it a criminal offense for a parent, possessing the means, to fail to provide for a destitute adult child where mental or physical infirmity makes it impossible for the child to care for itself. <em>The passage of this act is a clear indication of legislative intent to place failure to support an incapacitated child on equal footing with failure to support a minor child.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In <em>Smith, </em>the Court did not draw a distinction based on emancipation. The Court held that the legislative enactment made it clear that the duty to support an adult incapacitated child was on equal footing with the duty to support a minor child. 227 Md. at 360, 176 A.2d at 865. The holding in <em>Smith </em>is based on Article 27, section 97, of the Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.). This statute contains no suggestion that a distinction should be based on emancipation. We agree with the holding in <em>Smith </em>that the legislative intent in this enactment was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Although the facts of <em>Smith </em>involved a child incapacitated during his minority,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is significant that the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>did not include such facts in the recitation of facts, rationale, or holding of its opinion. The fact that the child was incapacitated during his minority is crucial to the emancipation rationale. The absence of this crucial fact persuades us that the Court did not intend the interpretation that the appellant and dissenting opinion would attribute to the Court\u2019s opinion. It is apparent that the Court in <em>Smith </em>was aware of the emancipation rationale and declined to base its holding on such reasoning. Further, in <em>Borchert, supra, </em>the Court noted that an emancipation rationale was used in some cases in other jurisdictions, 185 Md. at 592, 45 A.2d at 465, yet the Court apparently resisted adopting this rationale for Maryland. Thus, where the Court twice was faced with the perfect situation to adopt the rationale it declined to do so. We are not persuaded that an emancipation rationale can be properly attributed to the <em>Smith </em>case. We instead rely on the plain language of Article 27, section 97, and the holding of <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>and hold that a parent who has the means to do so, has a duty to support an incapacitated adult child whose disability commenced after she attained the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">This conclusion is reinforced by comparison with the statutes dealing with the converse of the issue at hand, <em>i.e., </em>the duty of a child to support the child\u2019s parents. Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 104-110, comprising the subtitle, \u201cDestitute Parents,\u201d treat this duty. The subtitle was first enacted by Chapter 637 of the Acts of 1916 and was amended into substantially its present form by Chapter 675 of the Acts of 1939. To facilitate the reader\u2019s comparison of the present \u201cDestitute Parents\u201d subtitle with \u00a7\u00a7 97-103, comprising the subtitle, \u201cDestitute Children,\u201d we have set forth the two subtitles in parallel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>an appendix to this opinion where w\u00e9 have supplied italics to the words \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild.\u201d This comparison makes immediately apparent that the General Assembly essentially tracked the then existing \u201cDestitute Parents\u201d subtitle when it responded to <em>Borchert </em>with the \u201cDestitute Children\u201d subtitle enacted by Chapter 113 of the Acts of 1947. Sections 97-103 dealing with destitute adult children are obviously the converse of \u00a7\u00a7 104-110 dealing with destitute parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The foregoing is significant in its relevance to interpretation of the phrase \u201c[a]ny person who has an adult child,\u201d which introduces \u00a7 97. That phrase\u2019s companion in present \u00a7 104 is the phrase, \u201c[a]ny person having a parent or parents.\u201d It is clear from the comparison of \u00a7 97 with \u00a7 104 and from the way in which the words \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d are employed in both subtitles as a whole that the use of the verb \u201cto have\u201d with \u201cperson\u201d as its subject and either \u201can adult child\u201d or \u201ca parent or parents\u201d as its objects describes the relationship of parent and child. The \u201cperson who has an adult child,\u201d referred to in \u00a7 97, is a person who stands in the relation of parent to the \u201cadult child.\u201d The person who has a \u201cparent or parents\u201d in \u00a7 104 stands in the relation of child to the parent or parents. Thus, \u00a7 97\u2019s use of the term, \u201cperson,\u201d is not limited to one who has the \u201ccare, custody and possession\u201d of the adult child as those terms are used in \u00a7 96 and as suggested by the dissent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, when Chapter 113 of the Acts of 1947 brought \u00a7 97 into the Maryland Code the Act was described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>by its title as one \u201crelating to the support of destitute adult children by their parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">One significant difference between the statutes relating to the support by financially able parents of destitute and disabled adult children, at the time of their enactment in 1947, and the then subtitle relating to the support of destitute and disabled parents by their financially able children is that the introductory section of the latter was limited to \u201c[a]ny <em>adult </em>person ... having a parent or parents____\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See </em>Md.Code (1939), Art. 27, \u00a7 98. By Chapter 36 of the Acts of 1952 the limitation, \u201cadult,\u201d was deleted from that section which is presently \u00a7 104. The deletion expanded \u00a7 104 to impose the duty to support destitute parents on their minor children in addition to their adult children, when, in either instance, the children were financially capable of doing so. This 1952 expansion by the General Assembly of the statute dealing with support of the preceding generation by the succeeding generation strongly indicates that the 1947 parallel statute dealing with support by the preceding generation of incapacitated adults of the succeeding generation should not be forced into a restricted construction. The plain meaning of \u201cadult child ... unable to support himself by reason of mental or physical infirmity\u201d includes Janette. Section 97 is not limited exclusively to the child who has chronologically reached the age of majority, who suffers from a disability incurred during minority and extending uninterruptedly beyond the age of majority, and who thereby has not, as a technical legal matter, been emancipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">There are statutes other than those in Art. 27 which impose on a parent the duty to support a child, and our interpretation of the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 97-103 may be tested against them in an effort to discern a consistent policy, if any. Currently such statutes include those dealing with the expense of patients in state hospitals, with paternity, and with marital property. At the time present Art. 27, \u00a7 97 was enacted the hospital reimbursement statutes seem to have been construed to include incapacitated, but previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>emancipated, adult children within the parents\u2019 support duty. The later enacted paternity and marital property statutes reflect the same policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In 1947 obligations to reimburse for the care of inmates in state psychiatric hospitals and in chronic disease hospitals were imposed by Md.Code (1989, 1947 Cum.Supp.), Art. 59, title, \u201cLunatics and Insane,\u201d subtitle, \u201cLunatic or Insane Paupers.\u201d In that subtitle \u00a7 4 placed liability on \u201ca father or mother, or both for a son or daughter ____\u201d With respect to chronic disease hospitals, Md.Code (1947 Supp.), Art. 43, \u201cHealth,\u201d \u00a7 528 provided that \u201cthere shall be collected from the patient or his family as much of the actual cost of maintenance as is reasonably possible ....\u201d Chapter 509 of the Acts of 1949 expanded on this theme by providing for investigation of the financial condition of \u201cpersons legally chargeable\u201d with the patient\u2019s support. See Md.Code (1951), Art. 43, \u00a7 562(a). These provisions for reimbursement of psychiatric and chronic disease hospital costs were construed to apply to the parents of adult children. This is demonstrated by the amendments to both statutes effected by Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1964 which limited the parental obligation to make reimbursement toward the cost of care rendered to a son or daughter to cases where the children were under twenty-one years of age. In the title to Chapter 164 the General Assembly stated its purpose to be \u201cto remove the liability of parents for payment toward the cost of care of their adult children____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">These provisions are today Md.Code (1982), \u00a7\u00a7 16-101(f)(2) and 16-102(a) of the Health General Article which incorporate the present age of majority. While the policy was changed in 1964 with respect to health care reimbursement, no comparable change was or has since been made to the dependent adult children subtitle of Art. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Disputed paternity and the obligation to support illegitimate children were litigated in 1947 under former Art. 12, title, \u201cBastardy and Fornication,\u201d of Md.Code (1939, 1947 Cum.Supp.). A civil procedure for determining paternity and enforcing support was substituted by Chapter 722 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the Acts of 1963. See Md.Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.), Art. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 66A to 66P. Section 66H(a)(l) provides that the equity court may order the declared father to pay a certain sum for the support and maintenance of the child</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">\u201cuntil the child reaches the age of 18 years, dies, marries or becomes self-supporting, whichever event first occurs. However, if the child, having reached 18 years of age, is destitute of means and unable to support himself by reason of mental or physical infirmity, the court may require payments to be made or continued during the continuance of the mental or physical infirmity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We do not believe that this language necessarily applies only when the incapacity occurred prior to reaching eighteen years of age. First, the expression \u201chaving reached 18 years of age\u201d is applicable to a nineteen year old as well as an eighteen year old. Had the legislature intended to implement an emancipation rationale, they could have simply and clearly stated instead: \u201cupon reaching 18 years of age____\u201d Further, in our view this provision is not limited only to a continuing incapacitation situation because the legislature did not limit the power of the court to continuing existing payments, but rather, provided that the court could require \u201cpayments to be made <em>or </em>continued.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The most recent expression by the General Assembly in a somewhat analogous area is under the Marital Property Act, Md.Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-6A-01 to 3-6A-08 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. That statute employs the term \u201cminor child\u201d in defining a \u201cfamily home\u201d which is the subject of special provisions in \u00a7 3-6A-06. Under the Marital Property Act a \u201c \u2018[mjinor child\u2019 includes a child 18 years of age or older who, because of mental or physical disability, is dependent upon a parent.\u201d \u00a7 3-6A-01(d). Once again, the General Assembly has not indicated any intention to restrict this definition to a child who is unemancipated because of continuing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>In sum, most of the analogous statutes are consistent with our interpretation of the \u201cDestitute Children\u201d subtitle of Art. 27. In any event, these statutes fail to reflect any definite and consistent policy which is contrary to our interpretation and which might otherwise justify placing a very restrictive construction on the plain language of Art. 27, \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We also note that the Maryland Institute for Continuing Professional Education of Lawyers, Inc., <em>Estate Planning for Families with Handicapped Dependents </em>332-333 (1983) advises practitioners that transfers by a parent to a child generally are not taxable as gifts so long as they are in satisfaction of a legal obligation to support the child. Then, citing <em>Smith v. Smith, supra, </em>227 Md. 355, 176 A.2d 862 and Art. 27, \u00a7 97 it is stated that \u201c[i]n Maryland, the parents of an adult disabled child do have an obligation of support,\u201d without limiting the statement to the adult child who is unemancipated because of continuing disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Finally, in consideration of the dissent in the instant case we are presented with an extreme and emotional hypothetical to support appellant\u2019s view. But this Court decides actual cases, not hypotheticals. We could easily imagine a hypothetical that would have absurd results under an emancipation rationale approach. For instance, a man\u2019s two daughters, one age 17, the other age 18, are injured and paralyzed in the same car accident. The younger daughter can rely on her father\u2019s support indefinitely, yet the eighteen year old daughter has no right to support. We reject the inequitable results that could follow from the appellant\u2019s approach. We prefer to await an actual case and decide it, and distinguish it if appropriate, at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In the instant case we are concerned with the plight of Janette Sininger. We believe that the vast majority of married parents would care and support a mentally disabled twenty-three year old daughter. Indeed, in this case Janette\u2019s mother has taken Janette into her care to care for her; it would be no different if the Siningers remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>married. The rights of a child should not be made to suffer from her parents\u2019 divorce. Washburn, <em>Post-Majority Support: Oh Dad, Poor Dad, </em>44 Temp.L.Q. 319, 345 (1971). Under the appellant\u2019s approach, Janette would so suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Janette\u2019s case illustrates the difficulty of the emancipation rationale in cases of mental, rather than physical disability. Unlike physical injuries, mental disabilities often develop over time. The evidence in the instant case traced the roots of Janette\u2019s mental disability into her childhood. Yet, her mental difficulties, though present all along, did not become disabling, according to the master\u2019s finding, until after she passed the age of majority. Although she has suffered all along, her father is freed from any obligation to support her because the master found that her sufferings did not disable her until after her twenty-first birthday. Under the emancipation rationale we can imagine two twenty-three year olds, both incapacitated, one incapacitated for five years (after majority), the other for six years (before majority). The result is that one is entitled to support and the other is not. The arbitrary age chosen for the age of majority should not override the clear policy expressed in plain language by the legislature in Art. 27, \u00a7 97. We cannot accept the inconsistency and inequity that would follow from applying an emancipation rationale as urged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Therefore, we hold that the instant case is within the ambit of <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>227 Md. 355, 176 A.2d 862 (1962);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the parental duty to support an adult incapacitated child existed in this case regardless of the child\u2019s emancipation. The duty is enforceable under the general equity jurisdiction of the circuit court under \u00a7 3-602(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Md.Code (1974, 1980 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In view of our holding we need not address appellee\u2019s contention that the circuit court was clearly erroneous in finding that the child was not disabled until after she reached the age of majority. The distinction between when the onset of illness occurs and when the illness becomes disabling is irrelevant under our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Appellee also contended on her cross-appeal that the sum awarded, and the retroactive date set, by the circuit court were clearly erroneous.

Sininger, the father of Jannette Sininger, presents this question for review on his appeal from the judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">Whether a parent has a civil duty enforceable by the court of equity to support his once emancipated, adult daughter who after attaining the age of majority experiences mental disability?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The majority answer this question by holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">a parent who has the means to do so, has a duty to support an incapacitated child whose disability commenced after she attained the age of majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In concluding that \u201cthe parental duty to support an adult incapacitated child existed in this case regardless of the child\u2019s emancipation,\u201d the majority provide a classic example of judicial legislation in the guise of judicial interpretation. The Court\u2019s usurpation of the Legislature\u2019s function leads to a holding which is without support in law or practicality. The holding strains to reach a result; it is case oriented rather than law oriented. This is apparent from the majority\u2019s confession that \u201c[i]n the instant case we are concerned with the plight of Jannette Sininger.\u201d While the concern is commendable, the majority holding reflects what they feel the law should be rather than what it actually is. The majority close their eyes to practical applications of their holding beyond this case. For example, assume a 66 year old father and a 45 year old son. The father worked hard and faithfully until he retired at the age of 65. Being thrifty and conservative in his life-style, he had saved enough to spend his remaining years in relative comfort. The father had supported his son, a ne\u2019er-do-well even as a minor, until the child attained the age of majority, at which time the son fled the home and embarked on a life of crime. In and out of jail thereafter, and a thoroughly dissolute character, at age 45 he drove his car into a tree, and as a result of the injuries he suffered he was paralyzed. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>not seen or attempted to get in touch with his father for over 20 years, and, in fact had evidenced no concern whatsoever about his father\u2019s welfare. Now, destitute of means and unable to support himself by reason of his physical infirmity, he calls upon his father to support him. Under the majority\u2019s holding, the father has the duty to do so, and if he fails in that duty he is liable criminally and civilly. The father would also, in all likelihood, be responsible to third parties who furnished the son with necessaries. I cannot conceive that such a result was contemplated by the Legislature. The majority characterize this hypothetical as extreme and emotional. They declare that they \u201cprefer to await an actual case and decide it, and distinguish it, if appropriate, at that time.\u201d It is true that my hypothetical invokes none of the sympathy or concern present with respect to the unfortunate woman in the instant case. But the holding of the majority permits no distinction. By the majority\u2019s rule a parent, for as long as he shall live, faces the possibility that he will have the legal duty to support his adult child thrust upon him, regardless of the child\u2019s prior independence. The duty of care and support, invoked upon the birth of the child is not only active during the child\u2019s minority, but remains dormant thereafter so long as the parent and the child are alive. The duty is awakened, with no further ado, at any time the child becomes incapacitated. In the words of Mr. Bumble, \u201cIf the law supposes that, the law is a ass, a idiot.\u201d This Court has recognized that \u201c[o]ne of the well understood canons for the construction of statutes is that courts should avoid absurd consequences.\u201d <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 281, </em>299 Md. 181, 200, 473 A.2d 1 (1984). To me, the holding of the majority results in absurd consequences, and I cannot accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Before I explain why I think that the law is not what the majority would have it be, I note that the majority found no need to address the mother\u2019s contention on cross-appeal that the circuit court was clearly erroneous in finding that Jannette was not disabled until after she reached the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>majority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority say: \u201cThe distinction between when the onset of the illness occurs and when the illness becomes disabling is irrelevant under our holding.\u201d For reasons which will be apparent <em>infra, </em>I find it necessary to address the contention. The Domestic Relations Master who conducted the plenary hearing on the petition found from the evidence before him that Jannette was not disabled at the time she attained the age of majority. The equity court accepted this determination. It said: \u201c[Tjhere is sufficient credible evidence to support the Master\u2019s finding that she was not in fact disabled at the time she attained the age of 21 years.\u201d From the findings of fact on the evidence adduced as set out in the Master\u2019s report I am in full agreement with the Chancellor that there was credible evidence to support the Master\u2019s finding. Therefore, the court was not clearly erroneous in that judgment. Md.Rule 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The majority state that what they have held to be the parental duty \u201cis enforceable under the general equity jurisdiction of the circuit court under section 3-602(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code\u201d (1974, 1984 RepLYol.). The opinions of this Court have time and again made perfectly clear that the statutory declaration set out in this section\u2014\u201c[a] court of equity has jurisdiction over the ... support of a child\u201d\u2014applies only to minor children. This Court said in <em>Price v. Price, </em>232 Md. 379, 384, 194 A.2d 99 (1963) that the statute is \u201cdeclaratory of the inherent power of equity over minors.... \u201d (Emphasis supplied). The statute was referred to as concerning minors as recently as <em>Stancill v. Stancill, </em>286 Md. 530, 533-534, 408 A.2d 1030 (1979). <em>See </em>in addition to the cases cited therein, <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>246 Md. 616, 619, 229 A.2d 131 (1967) and <em>Coleman v. Coleman, </em>228 Md. 610, 613, 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>A.2d 875 (1962), and the cases cited in those opinions. The majority say that \u201cif the term \u2018child\u2019 has been statutorily enlarged it may include more than persons under the age of majority.\u201d They then assert that because they will hold now that a parent has a duty to support an incapacitated adult child, the word \u201cchild\u201d has been statutorily enlarged and is within the ambit of \u00a7 3-602(a). I do not believe that the term \u201cchild\u201d has been statutorily enlarged to encompass an incapacitated adult child, and even if the parental duty is as the majority hold it to be, the enforceability of that duty will have to be on some authority other than \u00a7 3-602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The majority expressly look to Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 97, as applied in <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>227 Md. 355, 176 A.2d 862 (1962), to support their holding. What spurred the enactment of this statute is readily apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\u201cThere was no common law obligation to support adult, incompetent children; neither was there any to support infant children____\u201d <em>Borchert v. Borchert, </em>185 Md. 586, 590, 45 A.2d 463 (1946). The Poor Relief Act of 43 Eliz. Ch. 2 required the father and the mother, among other relatives, of every poor, old, blind, lame, and impotent person, or other poor person unable to work, to relieve and maintain such person at their own charges, if they were of sufficient ability to do so. Annot., 1. A.L.R.2d 910, 935 (1948). Sir William Blackstone, Knt., stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">[N]o person is bound to provide a maintenance for his issue unless where the children are impotent and unable to work, either through infancy, disease or accident, and then is only obligated to find them with necessaries____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">1 <em>Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries </em>449 (Lewis\u2019s ed. 1898). This statement was based on 43 Eliz. Ch. 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Borchert </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">591, 45 A.2d 463. In any event, a number of the American states adopted the view that the common law went no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>further than to impose on parents the duty of supporting their minor children, and that as a general rule there was no obligation on the part of a parent to support an adult child. 1 A.L.R.2d at 914. <em>See </em>Recent Decision, <em>Domestic Relations\u2014Child Support\u2014Parental Duty to Support a Subnormal Adult Child, </em>48 Miss.L.J. 361 (1977); Comment, <em>The Parental Duty to Support Disabled Adult Children, </em>9 De Paul L.Rev. 245, 246-247 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In Maryland any doubt that parents were obliged to support their minor children was removed by the enactment early on of a statute now codified as \u00a7 88(b) of Art. 27. The statute made it a criminal offense for any parent to desert or wilfully neglect to provide for the support and maintenance of his or her minor child. Later the General Assembly enacted another statute to the same effect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These statutes left open, however, whether under Maryland law there was any parental duty to support an adult child. This Court had the question before it in <em>Borchert </em>but did not reach it because the father from whom support was sought expressly did \u201cnot dispute the obligation of the father to care for children, no matter what age, physically or mentally unable to take care of themselves____\u201d 185 Md. at 592, 45 A.2d 463. He agreed \u201cwith this general statement of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court accepted this concession as the law of the case, but did not declare it to be the law of the State. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The father\u2019s concession in <em>Borchert </em>was made on these facts. The case arose from a divorce action and concerned a petition to amend an order for child support included in the decree granting a divorce a vinculo matrimonii. At the time of the order the child was a minor and shortly thereaft<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>er became totally and permanently incapacitated. He reached the age of majority some 15 years later and continued to be a helpless invalid. The mother, who had custody, could not properly provide for the child, but the father, a man of comfortable means (he owned valuable property and was the recipient of a large income), was fully able to do so. The mother\u2019s petition asked that the father be ordered to pay a reasonable and adequate sum for the support of the child as long as it continued under the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The case not only brought into the open the inadequacies of the Maryland law on the matter but spotlighted those inadequacies. The Court determined that even if there were a duty on a father to support an incapacitated adult child, there was no provision in the Maryland law by which it could be enforced. The Court noted that there was no statute making the failure to perform the conceded duty a criminal offense. And neither the statute bestowing on a court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of equity original jurisdiction over the support of children<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor the statute empowering the court in an a mensa divorce action to order who shall be charged with the support of a child was sufficient to enable enforcement of such duty. Those statutes, the Court observed, referred to \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cunless we attempt judicial legislation that word must be construed as meaning children in the ordinary sense; that is those who have not reached their majority.\u201d <em>Borchert, </em>185 Md. at 593, 45 A.2d 463. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">However desirable it may be for some power to exist by which a father may be compelled to support his son, under the circumstances set out in these proceedings, the Legislature has not seen fit to make the failure to do so a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>criminal offense although it has so designated such failure in other domestic situations.... The omission by the legislative branch of the government of such a statute is an indication that the failure to support an incapacitated child is placed by it on a different footing from the failure to support a minor child. We cannot now without further legislative action hold that the divorce statute attempted to be invoked in this case is enlarged to include other than minor children. <em>Id. </em>at 594-595, 45 A.2d 463.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The Court held that the demurrer to the Bill of Complaint should have been sustained and reversed the order overruling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The General Assembly promptly responded to the plain suggestion in <em>Borchert. </em>It enacted Acts 1947, Ch. 113, now set out in Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Yol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 97. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Any person who has an adult child destitute of means and unable to support himself by reason of mental or physical infirmity, who is possessed of or able to earn means sufficient to provide such child with necessary shelter, food, care and clothing and who neglects or refuses so to do, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>227 Md. 355, 176 A.2d 862, the Court was again concerned with the duty of a father to support his incapacitated destitute adult child. The matter arose in an action for permanent alimony. On appeal, the father challenged an order included in the decree that he support his incapacitated adult child. The Court thought that it was significant that \u201cat the first opportunity after the <em>Borchert </em>decision further legislative action was in fact taken.\u201d <em>Smith </em>at 360, 176 A.2d 862. \u201cThe passage of [the 1947] act,\u201d the Court declared, \u201cis a clear indication of legislative intent to place failure to support an incapacitated child on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>an equal footing with failure to support a minor child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the Court\u2019s \u201copinion, therefore, the Chancellor was justified in recognizing this legislative policy and awarding support payments for the disabled adult child, whom the testimony showed was destitute of oth\u00e9r means of maintenance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Borchert </em>made clear that any duty on the part of a parent to support an incapacitated, destitute, adult child would have to be under the authority of a statute. <em>Smith </em>certainly stands for the proposition that an equity court in a domestic case may order a parent to support such a child, <em>insofar as that duty is imposed by the 1947 </em>statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Smith, </em>however, does not define the scope and extent of the duty the statute imposes on a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The father urges that the <em>Smith </em>holding did not encompass the situation in which the child became incapacitated after attaining the age of majority. In other words, he argues that the duty applied only when the incapacity occurred before the child was emancipated. The rationale for this view is that if an incapacitated child reaches the age of majority it is not thereby emancipated but remains a minor. The majority dismiss this contention on the ground that <em>Smith </em>did not base its holding on such reasoning. As I read <em>Smith, </em>the Court said no more in its brief treatment of this matter than that the equity court could recognize a legislative policy inherent in the statute and that this legislative policy was to place failure to support an incapacitated child on an equal footing with failure to support a minor child. <em>Smith </em>simply does not express a position on whether a parental duty to support an incapacitated destitute adult child arises only when the incapacity occurs before the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>is emancipated or whether the duty is invoked even though the incapacity occurred after emancipation. The factual circumstances, however, on which that opinion was decided, were that the incapacity of the child occurred before it attained the age of majority. As the majority point out, this was not clear from the opinion, but it was evident from the briefs submitted. The <em>Smith </em>Court was certainly aware of it. It seems to me that a view that the opinion went no further than the facts required it to do is more sound, in the absence of a stated position, than a notion that the opinion went beyond the facts in its holding. In short, I do not believe that <em>Smith, </em>in its very brief treatment of the subject, teaches what the majority would have it say. But if it does, I think that it is wrong, and I would renounce it without further ado so that it may not serve as the basis for more bad law. In any event, I turn, as the majority finally do, to Art. 27, \u00a7 97. As <em>Borchert </em>makes clear, the question here can only be resolved upon due regard of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">As we have seen, <em>supra, </em>the opinion in <em>Borchert, </em>which prompted the enactment of the statute, made perfectly clear that the incapacity of the child in that case occurred before the child attained the age of majority. This circumstance was, therefore, readily available to the Legislature. The desire of that body to remedy the deficiency in the law discovered in <em>Borchert </em>was in the light of that factual situation, and not as to an incapacity occurring after a child had been emancipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Section 97 of Article 27 imposes the duty to support an incapacitated destitute adult child on \u201c[a]ny person who has ...\u201d the child. The designation of the person chargeable with support is plain, unambiguous and unequivocal. The duty is not restricted, to parents, but, as the statute clearly says, to \u201cany person.\u201d So when the statute speaks in terms of one who \u201chas\u201d a child it is not referring only to one who \u201chas a child\u201d in the sense that a person is the child\u2019s natural father or mother. Since this Court has determined that the legislative intent in enacting \u00a7 97 was to place \u201cfailure to support an incapacitated child on equal footing with failure to support a minor child,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>227 Md. at 360, 176 A.2d 862,1 look for guidance with respect to the meaning of \u201chas an adult child\u201d to \u00a7 96 imposing the duty to support a minor child. Section 96, unlike \u00a7 88(b) which runs only to \u201cany parent,\u201d imposes the duty to support a minor child on \u201c[a]ny person having the care, custody or possession\u201d of the child. I think that it is apparent that the phrase \u201chas an adult child\u201d used in \u00a7 97 contemplates \u201chaving the care, custody or possession\u201d of the adult child as spelled out in \u00a7 96. Each section must be read in the light of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">This leads to the matter of emancipation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">The law imposes a certain bondage upon minor children, but it also permits release therefrom. Such release, which sets the child free from legal subjection and gives it the right to labor for itself and collect and control its own wages, is called \u201cemancipation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">A child is emancipated, of course, upon arriving at the age of majority, although not where, on account of some infirmity of mind or body rendering him incapable of taking care of himself, he is compelled to remain with the parent. Emancipation of this kind is effected by operation of law. 59 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 93 at 191.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>See Monticello v. Monticello, </em>271 Md. 168, 172, 315 A.2d 520, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 880, 95 S.Ct. 145, 42 L.Ed.2d 121 (1974); Washburn, <em>Post-Majority Support: Oh, Dad, Poor Dad, </em>44 Temp.L.Q. xxxxxxxx 319, 344-346 (1971). A minor child is subject to the authority and control of its parents. \u201cThe father and mother are the joint natural guardians of their [minor] child ... and are jointly and severally charged with its support, care, nurture, welfare and education. They shall have equal powers and duties.... \u201d Md.Code (1957, 1983 Repl.Yol.) Art. 72A, \u00a7 1. A parent is entitled to the services and earnings of a minor child. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2. The legal rights and liabilities as to both the parents and the child are extinguished, however, upon emancipation. 59 Am.Jur.2d \u00a7 93 at 191-192. A severance of the relationship between parents and minor child by the coming of age of a child who is capable of taking care of himself</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ard\">relinquishes the parent\u2019s claim to the child\u2019s services, thus conferring on him the right to his own time and earnings. It frees the parents from their duty of care and the child from their custody, control, and authority. It terminates the parents\u2019 legal duty to support the child.... <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Once completely emancipated by reaching the age of majority with no impediment sufficient to overcome the presumption of emancipation arising by the coming of age, the adult child thereafter cannot relapse into pupilage except by the consent, express or implied, of parent and child. <em>Cf, </em>J. Areen, <em>Family Law, </em>847-848 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">It may be that Jannette was completely emancipated before she attained the age of majority. <em>See </em>H. Clark, <em>The Law of Domestic Relations in the United States, </em>\u00a7 8.3 (1968). In any event, she was clearly completely emancipated upon becoming of age. The obligation of her father to support Jannette was then ended by the terms of the decree for support and was later formally terminated by court order. She was employed and earned enough to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>herself; her parents, of course, had no claim on her earnings or services. She established a domicile separate from that of either parent. She enjoyed the power to enter into binding contracts and conveyances. In short, she went her own way as an adult, free and clear of any parental control and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The mere fact that Jannette subsequently became disabled did not change this relationship with her father. He could not force his authority and control on her, dictate where she was to reside, or otherwise run her life. That is, she did not become \u201cde-emancipated\u201d by reason, of her disability; she did not thereby relapse into pupilage. Her father certainly had a moral obligation to care for her, but he had no legal obligation to do so. In other words, as between Jannette and her father, the father did not fit into the category of a \u201cperson who has an adult child\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The majority seeks support in \u00a7 3-6A-01(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article wherein \u201cminor child\u201d is defined as including \u201ca child 18 years of age or older who, because of mental or physical disability, is dependent upon a parent.\u201d They point out that the definition does not recognize a distinction based on emancipation. I do not believe that this statute, enacted in 1978, and concerned with an entirely different matter\u2014the distribution of marital property in divorce and annulment\u2014reflects any legislative intent with respect to the enactment of Art. 27, \u00a7 97 thirty-three years prior. The utter lack of connection, even by inference, of \u00a7 97 and \u00a7 3-6A-01(d) is readily apparent when considered in the light of \u00a7 3-6A-06(a). That section explains that the authority of the court regarding the marital property \u201cshall be exercised to permit the children of the family to continue to live in the environment and community which is familiar to them and to permit the continued occupancy of the family home and possession and use of family use personal property by a spouse with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>custody of a minor child who has a need to live in that home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">A more appropriate indication of the thinking of the Legislature with respect to the support of children is found in the Health-General Article of the Maryland Code. Md. Code (1982, 1983 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 16-102 of the Health-General Article announces that \u201c[i]t is the policy of this State to obligate each recipient of services and, to the extent provided in this title, those legally responsible for the recipient to pay, if financially able, for the cost of care that is received by the recipient of services.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A person chargeable for the cost of services includes \u201c[a]ny responsible relative....\u201d \u00a7 16-101(c)(l). A \u201cresponsible relative\u201d encompasses \u201c[t]he parents of a recipient of services who is a minor____\u201d \u00a7 16-101(f)(2). (Emphasis supplied). Thus the Legislature has not seen fit to make a parent pay for the support and care of an adult child. The parent would be chargeable, however, for the support and care of an adult child who was incapacitated at the time it attained the age of majority, for in that circumstance it would retain the status of a minor, the presumption of emancipation having been rebutted by the fact of the incapacity. This is precisely how I read \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The incongruity of the majority\u2019s holding is obvious when considered in the light of the above provisions of the Health Article. Under the majority view, the parents have the duty of care and support, not only of a minor child, but also of an incapacitated destitute adult child regardless of the child\u2019s emancipation. But if the care and support of an incapacitated destitute adult child is provided by the State, then there is no legal duty imposed on the parents to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>reimburse the State. The obligation of parents to reimburse the State is only with respect to a minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Statutory provisions regarding the paternity of a child born out of wedlock also shed light on the Legislature\u2019s policy as to child support. The man declared to be the father may be ordered by the equity court to pay a certain sum for the support and maintenance of the child</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al3Q\">until the child reaches the age of 18 years, dies, marries or becomes self-supporting, whichever event first occurs. However, if the child, having reached 18 years of age, is destitute of means and unable to support himself by reason of mental or physical infirmity, the court may require payments to be made or continued during the continuance of the mental or physical infirmity. Md.Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Yol.) Art. 16, \u00a7 66H(a)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">This provision clearly recognizes emancipation as serving to extinguish the duty to provide support. And the language used for the continuance of support payments after the child has attained the age of majority\u2014\u201cif the child having reached 18 years of age, <em>is </em>destitute of means and [incapacitated]\u201d\u2014patently applies only when the incapacity occurred prior to reaching 18 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The majority\u2019s attempt to. distinguish the health and paternity statutes which I have referred to is far from persuasive. I find the majority\u2019s view to be more self-serving than logical. Contrary to' their assertions, I think, for the reasons herein set out, that those statutes and the statute here reflect a consistent legislative policy, namely, that there is no parental duty to support a destitute adult child who becomes incapacitated after he has been emancipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">It is my opinion that the Master below was correct and that the Chancellor was wrong.
