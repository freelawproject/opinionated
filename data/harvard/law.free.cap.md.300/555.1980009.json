Snowden, \u201cfor himself and on behalf of all others similarly situated,\u201d commenced the present action by filing in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a declaration against the Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company. Snowden alleged in the declaration that he had telephoned the defendant to make a complaint concerning his bill, that during his telephone conversation with the defendant\u2019s Customer Service Representative he heard a \u201cbeep,\u201d and that he \u201cwas advised that it was the policy of the company to record all incoming calls relative to inquiries concerning service or billing.\u201d Snowden asserted that the defendant\u2019s actions with respect to his telephone call and similar telephone calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>of others were in violation of Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 through 10-412 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Snowden stated that his suit was a class action, and he sought actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 10-410 on behalf of himself and each of the other members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The defendant filed a demurrer, which the circuit court overruled, and then filed a general issue plea. Subsequently the defendant filed a \u201cMotion ... For Determination of Non-Class Action Status,\u201d setting forth several reasons why the court should issue an order \u201cdeclaring the nonrepresentative character of the action, and stating that only the rights of the individual named parties are bound thereby\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">On July 18, 1983, the circuit court filed a memorandum opinion holding that \u201c[bjecause the named plaintiff\u2019s claim cannot be typical of a class, the named plaintiff cannot adequately represent a class,\u201d and that, therefore, the action was \u201cnon-representative in character and ... cannot proceed as a class action.\u201d The order concluded by stating \u201cthat Defendant\u2019s Motion for Determination of Non-class action be granted\u201d and that \u201cthis action be dismissed as to the unnamed plaintiffs, members of the alleged class of others similarly situated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The plaintiff on August 7, 1983, filed a motion requesting that the circuit court make its July 18th order final and appealable under former Rule 605 a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circuit court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>August 9, 1983, granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion, determined that there was no just reason for delay, and directed the entry of \u201cfinal judgment ... in favor of the Defendant, with respect to the unnamed Plaintiffs, members of the alleged class of others similarly situated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The plaintiff filed an order of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the August 9th order. After briefs were filed but before the case was argued in the intermediate appellate court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. In our order directing the issuance of the writ, we requested the parties to file supplemental briefs on an additional question which the parties had not dealt with in their original briefs. The additional question was as follows: \u201cWhether the circuit court\u2019s order of August 9, 1983, constitutes an appealable judgment in light of Maryland Rule 605 a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">We shall answer in the negative and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In their supplemental briefs and oral arguments, both sides take the position that the circuit court\u2019s August 9th order was appealable under Rule 605 a, although they obviously disagree over the merits of the order.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>less, as we have repeatedly stated, \u201cappellate jurisdiction cannot be conferred on a reviewing court by consent of the litigants, and this Court will dismiss an appeal <em>sua sponte </em>when it recognizes that appellate jurisdiction is lacking.\u201d <em>Anthony Plumbing Of Md. v. Atty. Gen., </em>298 Md. 11, 16, 467 A.2d 504 (1983), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">It has been pointed out on several recent occasions that Rule 605 a empowers a trial court to enter a final judgment resolving part of a case only where there are multiple claims and the order disposes of at least one entire claim. An order which disposes of only a portion of a claim cannot be made final under Rule 605 a. <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 458, 445 A.2d 343 (1982); <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>290 Md. 175, 181, 428 A.2d 454 (1981); <em>Pappas v. Pappas, </em>287 Md. 455, 464, 413 A.2d 549 (1980); <em>Biro v. Schombert, </em>285 Md. 290, 294, 402 A.2d 71 (1979); <em>Diener Enterprises v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 554-556, 295 A.2d 270 (1972); <em>Harford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>Sands, Inc. v.

Yorkridge Serv., </em>292 Md. 557, 559-560 n. 4, 440 A.2d 373 (1982); <em>Lang v. Catterton, </em>267 Md. 268, 297 A.2d 735 (1972); <em>Moritz v. Church Of Jesus Christ, </em>266 Md. 220, 222, 292 A.2d 84 (1972); <em>Brooks v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>261 Md. 278, 274 A.2d 345 (1971); <em>Tedrow v. Ford Motor Co., </em>260 Md. 142, 271 A.2d 688 (1970); <em>Picking v. State Finance Co., </em>257 Md. 554, 557-558, 263 A.2d 572 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, if a trial court\u2019s order is dispositive with respect to one party, the order can be made final as to that party by the express determination and direction required under Rule 605 a. <em>See Picking v. State Finance Co., supra, </em>257 Md. at 558, 263 A.2d at 574; <em>Prickett v. Consolidated Liquidating Corp., </em>180 F.2d 8, 9, 196 F.2d 67, 68 (9 Cir.1950, 1952); 6 J. Moore, W. Taggart &amp; J. Wicker, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7\u00a7 54.33, 54.34 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On the other hand, this Court has not previously considered whether an order that a case may not proceed as a class action can be made final under Rule 605 a on the theory that it is dispositive as to certain \u201cparties,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cunnamed plaintiffs, members of the alleged class of others similarly situated.\u201d The federal courts, however, have considered this issue. And, as Judge Digges stated for the Court in <em>Diener Enterprises v. Miller, supra, </em>266 Md. at 554, 295 A.2d at 472, Rule 605 a \u201cwas modeled after Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and uses substantially the same language. This renders interpretations of the federal rule especially persuasive as to the meaning of the Maryland Rule.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Lewis, supra, </em>290 Md. at 181, 428 A.2d at 457; <em>Biro v. Schombert, supra, </em>285 Md. at 295, 402 A.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), considered the appealability of a trial court\u2019s order determining that an action could not be maintained as a class action and held that such order was not appealable as a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d Although the <em>Livesay </em>case did not involve a trial court\u2019s attempt to make the order appealable under Federal Rule 54(b), the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion is instructive on the issue. In holding that the order was interlocutory, that it was not appealable under the \u201ccollateral order doctrine,\u201d and that it was not appealable under the \u201cdeath knell\u201d theory developed by some lower federal courts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Supreme Court pointed out that under Federal Rule 23(c)(1) the order is specifically subject to later revision by the trial court. 437 U.S. at 469, 98 S.Ct. at 2458.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court went on to observe that \u201cthe class determination generally involves considerations that are \u2018enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff\u2019s cause' of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Mercantile Nat. Bank v. Langdeau, </em>371 U.S. 555, 558, 83 S.Ct. 520, 522, 9 L.Ed.2d 523 (1963).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The opinion in <em>Livesay </em>charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>terized a refusal to certify a class as being \u201cinherently interlocutory.\u201d 437 U.S. at 470, 98 S.Ct. at 2458. Finally, the Supreme Court discussed the availability of the Federal Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), which provides for discretionary appeals from certain interlocutory orders. The Court indicated that, where an appeal was desirable, this statute furnished the appropriate route for appellate review of orders refusing to certify a class. <em>Id. </em>at 474-475, 98 S.Ct. at 2460-2461.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court did not mention Federal Rule 54(b) as an available alternate route. Rather, the Supreme Court quoted from Judge Friendly\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Parkinson v. April Industries, Inc., </em>520 F.2d 650, 660 (2nd Cir.1975), that \u201c \u2018the best solution is to hold that appeals from the grant or denial of class action designation can be taken <em>only </em>under the procedure for interlocutory appeals provided by 28 U.S.C. 1292(b).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475 n. 27, 98 S.Ct. at 2461-2462 n. 27, emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">As previously indicated, the authorization in Federal Rule 54(b) and Maryland Rule 605 a for trial judges to make certain orders appealable, is limited to orders which, by their nature, have a characteristic of finality. Such orders must be completely dispositive of an entire claim or party. The emphasis in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Livesay </em>opinion upon the inherently interlocutory nature of orders refusing to certify suits as class actions, and the Court\u2019s indication that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) provides the only route under federal procedure for appeal of such orders, strongly suggests that the orders may not be made final and appeal-able under Federal Rule 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Following the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, supra, </em>one federal appellate court has dealt with the question presented in the instant case and has decided that a trial court\u2019s order refusing to certify an action as a class action cannot be made final and appealable under Federal Rule 54(b). In <em>Minority Pol. Off. Ass\u2019n v. City of South Bend, Ind., </em>721 F.2d 197 (7th Cir.1983), where the trial judge had made the requisite determination and direction under Rule 54(b), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed an appeal from a purported \u201cfinal Judgment\u201d with respect to the class action issue. The Seventh Circuit reasoned as follows (721 F.2d at 201):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">\u201cThe only reason the district judge refused to certify this lawsuit as a class action was that he thought the members of the class too few to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23. Their claims are identical to those of the named plaintiffs. In any event, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that refusals to certify actions as class actions are not appealable under the \u2018collateral order\u2019 doctrine, <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), implies that they are not appealable under Rule 54(b) either. The argument for appeal that the Court rejected was that such a refusal was sufficiently final as a practical matter to be a \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 interpreted in light of the \u2018collateral order\u2019 doctrine. Since a federal rule of civil procedure cannot enlarge the jurisdiction of the district court (Fed.R.Civ.P. 82), Rule 54(b) only allows appeals from orders that are in some sense final. <em>See, e.g., Western Geophysical Co. of America v. Bolt Assocs., </em>463 F.2d 101, 102-03 (2d Cir.1972). And since <em>Livesay </em>holds that refusals to certify a case as a class action are- not final, they cannot be appealed under Rule 54(b) any more than they can be appealed under section 1291 directly.\u201d Although the case was decided shortly before the Su-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjJ\">preme Court\u2019s <em>Livesay </em>decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reached the same conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>in <em>West v. Capitol Federal Sav. And Loan </em>Ass<em>\u2019n, </em>558 F.2d 977 (10th Cir.1977). That was a class action suit under the antitrust laws, and the district court denied class action certification. Like the circuit court in the instant' case, the district court in <em>West </em>determined that there was no just reason for delay, dismissed the action as to all but the named plaintiffs and directed the entry of final judgment in favor of the defendants with respect to all but the named plaintiffs. In holding that the order could not be made reviewable under Rule 54(b), the Tenth Circuit pointed out that it was not dispositive with respect to any parties, because the unnamed plaintiffs in such an action cannot be considered \u201cparties\u201d for purposes of Rule 54(b) until there is class action certification and notice. The Court of Appeals explained (558 F.2d at 980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">\u201cThe notice of appeal is from both the denial of class certification and the dismissal of the action against the putative members of the class. At the time of dismissal the putative members were not parties to the suit. Class certification had been denied and no notice had been given to the nonappearing class members as required by Rule 23(c)(2) if the suit is to proceed as a class action. Until class certification is followed by notice the members of the potential class are \u2018mere passive beneficiaries\u2019 who do not \u2018have any duty to take note of the suit.\u2019 <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 552, 94 S.Ct. 756, 765, 38 L.Ed.2d 713. Notice is \u2018an unambiguous requirement of Rule 23.\u2019 <em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 176, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 2152, 40 L.Ed.2d 732. A personal judgment entered without jurisdiction over the person violates due process and is void. <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 250, 78 S.Ct. 1228 [1237], 2 L.Ed.2d 1283.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Court went on to point out that, as to the named plaintiffs, there was no final judgment against them with regard to any claim, <em>id. </em>at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>In our view, the opinions of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits in the above-discussed cases are sound. We have discovered no reasoned holdings to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In arguing that the order in the case at bar was appealable, the plaintiff relies on three cases. They are <em>Hayes v. Sealtest Foods Division of Nat. Dairy Prod. Corp., </em>396 F.2d 448 (3rd Cir.1968); <em>Katz v. Carte Blanche Corporation, </em>496 F.2d 747 (3rd Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 885, 95 S.Ct. 152, 42 L.Ed.2d 125 (1974); and <em>Windham v. American Brands, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 1016 (4th Cir.1976). These cases are not persuasive authority supporting the plaintiffs construction of Maryland Rule 605 a. First, all three cases were decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, supra. </em>Moreover, the <em>decisions </em>in neither the <em>Hayes </em>case nor the <em>Katz </em>case support the plaintiff\u2019s position. Although there is a comment in <em>Hayes, </em>396 F.2d at 449, which might arguably support the proposition that an interlocutory order denying class action certification could be made appealable under Federal Rule 54(b), the case itself involved an appeal from a final judgment dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. <em>Katz, </em>while containing a one sentence dictum that a denial of class action treatment could be made appealable under Federal Rule 54(b), <em>see </em>496 F.2d at 752, was an appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the <em>Windham </em>case, where the district court had denied class action certification and had purport ed to make the judgment final under Federal Rule 54(b), the Fourth Circuit, without any reasoning or discussion, merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>stated that \u201c[w]e accept such certification as appropriate,\u201d citing the <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Katz </em>cases. 539 F.2d at 1020.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the circuit court\u2019s order in this case was not dispositive with respect to an entire claim or party and could not be made appealable under Rule 605 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">COSTS TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">.

In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims, and the order or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">Effective July 1, 1984, the Rule was re-numbered Rule 3-602, and the wording was slightly modified.

The defendant\u2019s principal contention, however, is that the plaintiff\u2019s declaration failed to set forth a cause of action and that, therefore, the circuit court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer. This contention has no relation to the \"Motion Of Defendant For Determination Of Non-Class Action Status\u201d and the circuit court\u2019s interlocutory order granting that motion. Even if that order could have been made appealable under Rule 605 a, a party could not on such appeal obtain review of prior unrelated orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Rule 887, which provides that generally on an appeal from a final judgment, every previous interlocutory order shall be open to appellate review, only applies to appeals from final judgments in the usual sense. It does not ordinarily apply to permissible appeals from interlocutory orders, whether permitted under Code (1974, 1984 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>permitted because the interlocutory orders are \"deemed\u201d final under a rule such as Rule 605 a or a principle such as the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Pappas v. Pappas, </em>287 Md. 455, 413 A.2d 549 (1980). As one court has explained <em>(United States v. Fort Sill Apache Tribe, State of Okl., </em>507 F.2d 861, 863-864 (Ct.Cls.1974)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">\"Thus while part 3 [of the defendant\u2019s appeal] is properly reviewable at this time, it is NOT a final decision to which may be added other matters for appeal, if they are orders in unrelated matters not part of the foundation of the decision appealed from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">\"Defendant's theory is that an allowable interlocutory appeal can be made to carry with it all previous orders and rulings whether or not separately appealable.

Globe Protection, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 1121, 1122, 1124 (7th Cir.1983), the court held that an appeal from a denial of a preliminary injunction \"did not bring up for review an earlier denial of class action maintenance,\u201d as the earlier order did not \"directly control\" and was not \"inextricably bound to the denial of the preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>See </em>the discussions in <em>Kershner v.

New Rule 3-602 embodies these holdings by expressly referring to \"multiple parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-4\">. The Supreme Court described the \"death knell\u201d theory as follows (437 U.S. at 469-470, 98 S.Ct. at 2458):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\"Several Circuits, including the Court of Appeals in this case, have held that an order denying class certification is appealable if it is likely to sound the \u2018death knell\u2019 of the litigation.
