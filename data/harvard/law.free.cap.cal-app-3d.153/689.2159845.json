J.</author>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Two issues are presented in this appeal: (1) whether the trial court erred in considering certain factors in aggravation in sentencing appellant to prison<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and (2) whether appellant is entitled to good conduct and participation credits (conduct credits) for the presentence time he spent at Atascadero State Hospital as a mentally disordered sex offender (MDSO).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">We hold that although the trial court erred in considering certain factors in imposing the aggravated sentence on the principal term (count 8\u2014rape), the error does not compel a remand since there is no reasonable probability that a different term would have been imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">We also hold as a matter of equal protection of the laws that appellant is entitled to conduct credits for the time spent at the state hospital. We remand for the trial court to determine the specific number of days for which appellant is entitled to credit pursuant to Penal Code section 2931 calculated from July 29, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Appellant pleaded guilty to four counts of rape, three counts of burglary, three counts of assault with intent to commit rape and one count of false imprisonment as a reasonably related offense of assault with intent to commit rape. Criminal proceedings were suspended pursuant to Welfare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Institutions Code section 6300, and MDSO proceedings were instituted. The court thereafter found appellant to be an MDSO.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Appellant was committed to the Atascadero State Hospital on March 21, 1980, for a period of 18 years and 4 months with credit for time served of 205 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">About two and one-half years later, the medical director of Atascadero State Hospital found that although appellant was still an MDSO, he was unamenable to further treatment. Appellant was referred back to the superior court, and criminal proceedings were reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Appellant was sentenced to prison for a total term of 17 years and 8 months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sentences were to run consecutively because the court found that all the crimes were \u201cseparate and distinct.\u201d Appellant was given a total of 1,273 days\u2019 credit which included 223 days\u2019 actual local time, 111 days\u2019 local conduct credits and 939 actual institutional days\u2019 credits. No conduct credits were given for these institutional days. The court set forth aggravating and mitigating circumstances at length, and it found that the aggravating circumstances significantly outweighed those in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Statement of the Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Appellant, nicknamed the \u201cEast Fresno Rapist\u201d by the local media, was apprehended after three years of rapes, burglaries and assaults. He would typically isolate a woman who was home alone, remove a screen from her window in the middle of the night, enter and commit the rape or sexual assault while covering the victim\u2019s head with a blanket or pillow. No harm was inflicted upon the victims aside from that inherent in the crimes themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>During his two and one-half year stay at Atascadero following his apprehension, appellant developed a \u201crelationship\u201d with a female staff member. His inability to break off this relationship after repeatedly stating he would do so indicated to his doctors that he was unable to control his compulsions and appears to be the primary reason for his referral back to the superior court for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\n<em>Conduct Credits for Time Spent at Atascadero State Hospital as an MDSO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Appellant contends he was denied equal protection of the laws when the trial court failed to grant him conduct credits for time spent at the state hospital under an MDSO commitment,  Appellant advances two theories to support his argument: (1) that the enactment of Penal Code section 1364 extending conduct credits under Penal Code section 2931 to persons committed as MDSO\u2019s after January 1, 1982, must be given retroactive effect so as to apply to appellant who was committed to the state hospital on March 21, 1980; and (2) the amendments to Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), effective July 29, 1980, extending conduct credits to narcotics addicts committed for rehabilitation and protective purposes to the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) remove any rational basis for denying the credits to those like appellant who have been committed as MDSO\u2019s.  Appellant\u2019s first contention is answered by this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brunner </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 761 [195 Cal.Rptr. 367] where we held: \u201c. . .a person convicted and committed to state hospital during the era of the treatment model is not similarly situated vis-\u00e1-vis a person subject to the punishment model. The theory of the law has changed. Section 1364\u2019s award of conduct credits is part and parcel of the punishment model: since a defendant is not to be released before the end of his DSL term, regardless of the effectiveness of any treatment, a denial of conduct credits would leave him worse off than the state prisoners <em>not </em>transferred to state hospital and thus create real equal protection prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>lems. On the other hand, equal protection does not require that a defendant who has received substantial benefits under the treatment model also receive, selectively, one benefit of the punishment model given to other persons denied the benefits that defendant received.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 766-767.) We found in <em>Brunner, supra, </em>that the repeal of Welfare and Institutions Code section 6316.1 which provided for no conduct credits for time spent as an MDSO and enactment of Penal Code section 1364 granting conduct credits in the same situation represented a legislative change from a \u201crehabilitative model\u201d to a \u201cpunishment model\u201d and that the defendant could not demand the benefits of each on an equal protection theory. Since appellant, like <em>Brunner, </em>was committed to Atascadero State Hospital before the enactment of Penal Code section 1364 on January 1, 1982, appellant has reaped the benefits of former Welfare and Institutions Code section 6316.1 so he cannot now argue that he has been denied equal protection by the trial court\u2019s failure to grant him conduct credits under Penal Code section 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Appellant\u2019s second theory is that he is entitled to credits from July 29, 1980, to the end of his hospitalization because since that time narcotics addicts committed to CRC pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are entitled to such credits. In essence, appellant argues that MDSO\u2019s and CRC addicts are now similarly situated so as to require equal treatment of them for conduct credit purposes. The argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The policy reasons which have justified disparate treatment of MDSO\u2019s and CRC addicts vis-a-vis prisoners in custody have been greatly eroded by recent changes in the law. For example, both CRC addicts under Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), and MDSO\u2019s under Penal Code section 1364<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are now entitled to have good behavior and participation credits taken into consideration in the calculation of their maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>mum term of commitment. Even though appellant cannot directly benefit from present MDSO legislation <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brunner, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d 761), the mere enactment of Penal Code section 1364 reflects a legislative policy favoring conduct credits for MDSO commitment time.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Furthermore, there appears to be no persuasive rationale in case law for maintaining any distinction between MDSO\u2019s and CRC addicts, at least for conduct credit purposes. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Saffell </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 223 [157 Cal.Rptr. 897, 599 P.2d 92] (reaffirmed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sage </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 498, 506 [165 Cal.Rptr. 280, 611 P.2d 874]), the Supreme Court set forth several reasons for denying an MDSO\u2019s equal protection claim that he was entitled to the same conduct credits as a prison inmate. These reasons were that good-time credit is fundamentally at odds with the treatment of the mentally disturbed; that MDSO confinement offers incentives in itself for good behavior; that hospitals are ill-equipped to provide work-time opportunities; that hospitals don\u2019t have the ability or time to conduct disciplinary hearings to decide a loss of credits and, finally, that credits are meaningless when commitment can later be extended. While these factors may have been persuasive prior to the enactment of Penal Code section 1364, they become meaningless in the equal protection context in light of the Legislature\u2019s implied finding that these concerns are subordinate to an MDSO\u2019s right to conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We recognize the dicta in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hankins </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 694 [187 Cal.Rptr. 210], suggesting that MDSO\u2019s and CRC addicts are not similarly situated for equal protection purposes: \u201cIn deciding whether Han-kins is entitled to conduct credit under equal protection principles, we are cognizant of one fundamental difference between MDSO and narcotic addict confinement. <em>In practice, </em>an MDSO commitment is involuntary; the CRC commitment is largely voluntary. What compelling state interest is there in deterring narcotic addicts guilty of crimes from seeking treatment and rehabilitation while in custody? Few, if any, addicts are going to volunteer for CRC commitment knowing that if they are found \u2018unamenable to treatment\u2019 they will be deprived of conduct credits.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 699, fns. omitted.) However, the <em>Hankins </em>court then said: \u201cTheoretically, defendant\u2019s lack of motivation is not a factor and one found to be a fit subject may not refuse treatment. (Citation.) <em>Accordingly, a </em>. . . <em>[CRC </em>commitment] <em>can be </em>involuntary.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 699, fn. 10, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 103 [146 Cal.Rptr. 165], this court explained that a defendant\u2019s lack of motivation for rehabilitation is not a factor to be considered in determining whether a defendant could be committed to CRC. We found that \u201cthe entire statutory scheme manifests the Legislature\u2019s intent that a defendant\u2019s lack of desire for, or lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>cooperation with, the treatment program should not defeat his commitment. Commitment to this program is not consensual but involuntary, although by civil process <em>(People </em>v. <em>Navarro, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 248, 265 [102 Cal.Rptr. 137, 497 P.2d 481]).\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 111.) Thus, there is no discretion to refuse to institute CRC proceedings for a person who appears to be a fit subject under the statutory criteria (see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hankins, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d 694, 699, fn. 10). Even assuming the underlying goal of MDSO and CRC commitment is treatment of an illness, we find no basis for concluding that a mentally disordered sex offender is less able to conform his conduct so as to earn credits than is a narcotics addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">As a further distinction between a CRC commitment and an MDSO commitment, the Attorney General observes that a narcotics addict is committed to the Department of Corrections whereas an MDSO is committed to the Department of Mental Health, and consequently, as noted in <em>In re Martin </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 896, 902 [178 Cal.Rptr. 445]: \u201cThe Legislature does not intend an addict to be treated for longer than he could be imprisoned and it intends the \u2018credit\u2019 to apply <em>irrespective of the nature of his conduct while in CRC. </em>\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, to make the CRC program workable, the Attorney General argues, the Legislature saw fit to limit the period drug addicts could be treated to two-thirds of the prison term imposed, irrespective of the addict\u2019s conduct while in the program. We disagree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The recent case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Talton </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 729 [193 Cal.Rptr. 660] supports the theory that Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), contemplates that a narcotics addict must <em>earn </em>conduct credits while confined at CRC. <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>refutes the statements in <em>In re Martin, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.3d 896 to the effect that such credits are automatically included in fixing the addict\u2019s maximum confinement time regardless of his behavior at CRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe <em>Martin </em>decision went beyond its holding of eligibility for CRC inpatient conduct credits and added that the Legislature intended \u2018 \u201ccredit\u201d to apply irrespective of the nature of his conduct while in CRC.\u2019 (125 Cal.App.3d at p. 902.) . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\"><em>\u201cMartin </em>looked to the terms of Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), and said that the statute \u2018appears to give him credit even when he does not \u201cparticipate\u201d or when his conduct might not have warranted it in another institution.\u2019 (At p. 900.) . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\u201cWe do not agree with that portion of the <em>Martin </em>decision which would apply <em>unearned </em>CRC conduct credits against a state prison sentence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>6\"</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cWhile the current language of the statute differs somewhat from the statutory language considered by <em>Martin, </em>the equal protection rationale of <em>Martin </em>and later cases remains unaffected. However, neither the prior nor current statutory language justifies the <em>Martin </em>conclusion that the statute shows a legislative intent to provide <em>unearned </em>conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cBoth prior and present versions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), refer to the \u2018good behavior and participation credit <em>provisions </em>of Article 2.5 <em>{commencing with </em>Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Penal Code,\u2019 (italics added). Article 2.5 covers Penal Code sections 2930-2935. Thus, the Legislature referred to the whole of article 2.5 as evidenced by use of the words \u2018provisions\u2019 and the use of \u2018commencing with.\u2019 When the statute is correctly read, it refers not only to the granting of custody credits <em>but also to the forfeiture of custody credits because sections 2930-2935 cover both the giving and forfeiture of credits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\u201cWe have received varying points of view from the parties concerning the mechanics involved in the sentencing court\u2019s determination of CRC inpatient custody credits. These positions fail to recognize that Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), already requires the Department of Corrections to apply the provisions of Penal Code sections 2930-2935 to CRC patients and that the credit and forfeiture procedures are, presumably, already in place and operational.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">\u201cThe manner in which credits are to be applied by the sentencing court is straightforward and familiar. The sentencing court is required to apply \u2018rehabilitation facility\u2019 credits (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2900.5, subd. (a)) to the sentence which would include application of CRC inpatient conduct credits. Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), requires the Department of Corrections to compute CRC conduct credits in the manner prescribed by Penal Code sections 2930-2935. Thus, the Department of Corrections \u2018can readily provide the court with the necessary computation and/or records. Any dispute over the right to credit, the number of days of credit, or the judgment or judgments to which the credits are applicable can then be resolved at the probation and sentencing hearing.\u2019 <em>{People </em>v. <em>Sage, supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d at p. 509.)\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Taiton, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at pp. 731-733, fn. omitted, final italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">As did the <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>court, we interpret Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), to mean that the provisions of Penal Code section 2930 et seq. will be applied in calculating the period of an individual\u2019s CRC confinement. Penal Code section 2931 requires that performance of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>acts and the nonperformance of other acts on the part of a defendant enter into the calculation of credits. A defendant must \u201cforebear [ ] from any act for which the [defendant] could be prosecuted in a court of law\u201d (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 2931, subd. (b)) in order to receive his maximum good-time credits and \u201cparticipate in the specified [work] activities\u201d (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 2931, subd. (c)) in order to receive his maximum work-time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Finally, we are aware of the recent decision in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 663 where the Supreme Court held that persons committed as MDSO\u2019s before January 1, 1982 (the date of enactment of Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1364, 1365), could nevertheless have their commitment time extended pursuant to the provisions of former Welfare and Institutions Code sections 6300-6330. The court found that the language and the intent behind the new legislation warranted the conclusion that the statutes were meant to operate prospectively only. Our allowance of credits in the present case is not at odds with the rationale of <em>Baker. </em>We base our allowance of credits not on the asserted retroactivity of Penal Code sections 1364 and 1365, but on fundamental principles of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We therefore hold it is a denial of equal protection for appellant to be denied presentence conduct credits for time spent at Atascadero State Hospital as an MDSO when such credits are afforded CRC addicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed. The matter, however, is remanded to the trial court for a determination of the number of conduct credits appellant is entitled to pursuant to Penal Code section 2931, calculated from July 29, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Andreen, J., and Hamlin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 20, 1984, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-14\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 689.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\">The total sentence was computed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">Count 2\u2014false imprisonment indeterminate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">Count 4\u2014rape one year (consecutive; nonviolent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">Count 5\u2014burglary one year, four months (consecutive; violent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-14\">Count 8\u2014rape eight years (principal term)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-15\">Count 10\u2014rape two years (consecutive; violent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-16\">Count 13\u2014burglary one year (consecutive; nonviolent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-17\">Count 14\u2014assault one year (consecutive; nonviolent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-18\">Count 16\u2014assault one year (consecutive; nonviolent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-19\">Count 18\u2014rape one year, four months (consecutive; violent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-20\">Count 20\u2014burglary one year (consecutive; nonviolent)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-21\">Count 22\u2014assault [six] years (stayed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-22\">Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASb\">seventeen years, eight months</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 689.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 3201, subdivision (c), reads in relevant part: \u201c(c) Any person committed pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 3050), whose execution of sentence in accordance with the provisions of Section 1170 of the Penal Code was suspended pending a commitment pursuant to Section 3051, who has spent, pursuant to this chapter, a period of time in confinement or in custody, excluding any time spent on outpatient status, equal to that which he or she would have otherwise spent in state prison had sentence been executed, <em>including application of good behavior and participation credit provisions of Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Penal Code, </em>shall, upon reaching such accumulation of time, be released on parole under the jurisdiction of the Narcotic Addict Evaluation Authority subject to all of the conditions imposed by the authority and subject to the provisions of Article 1 (commencing with Section 3000) of Chapter 8 of Title 1 of Part 3 of the Penal Code. . . .\u2019\u2019 (Italics added; urgency, elf.
