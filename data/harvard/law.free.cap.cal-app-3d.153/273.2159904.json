Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 3) and driving under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the influence of alcohol/drugs causing death and bodily injury. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23101, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His motion for new trial was denied. He appeals on two general grounds: (1) prosecutorial misconduct<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the court\u2019s failure to determine whether evidence of prior accidents at the scene of defendant\u2019s accident was admissible. We find defendant\u2019s first contention without merit. However, we conclude the trial court should have held a hearing to determine whether defendant\u2019s proffered evidence was admissible and so remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Defendant was involved in a head on collision with another vehicle, as a result of which a passenger in the other vehicle was killed. Both drivers had been drinking at the same birthday party earlier in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Defendant claims that exclusion of certain evidence denied him a fair trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He sought to introduce evidence of four other accidents which occurred at approximately the same location as the one upon which the present charges are based. He intended to use this evidence to establish the dangerous condition of the road as the cause of the accident, and during the trial he attempted to introduce a map of the portion of the road on which the accident occurred. The map was prepared by the Department of Public Works, and indicated the locations of the prior accidents at issue. The record implies that he also wanted to introduce the California Highway Patrol reports of the prior accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Defendant could not introduce evidence of the prior accidents without first establishing that they occurred under substantially the same circumstances as the accident in which he was involved. <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>Pessin Grocery Co. </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 212, 216-217 [282 P.2d 148].) He could not lay this foundation without access to the reports and the map. The record indicates that when he subpoenaed the map and reports he was informed they were privileged under Evidence Code section 1040, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Evidence Code section 1040, subdivision (b)(1) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA public entity has a privilege to refuse to disclose official information . . . if . . . [disclosure is forbidden by ... a statute of this state.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the instant case, the People claim that Vehicle Code section 20012,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which limits, with certain exceptions, use of <em>required </em>accident reports to the DMV and CHP, entitles them to claim this privilege to the reports and map. Vehicle Code sections 20008 through 20010 indicate that required reports are those filed by drivers and passengers of vehicles involved in accidents resulting in death or bodily injury, and by witnesses to such accidents.  Hence, it is these reports which are privileged under Vehicle Code section 20012. Reports of accidents made by investigating officers are not so privileged. (Ho<em>dges </em>v. <em>Severns </em>(1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 99, 106 [20 Cal.Rptr. 129]; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Beavers </em>(1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 828, 837 [273 P.2d 56, 59 A.L.R.2d 263].)  It is important to understand that it is the required reports which are covered by the confidential privileges in sections 20012 and 20013, and not the fact of the accidents themselves. <em>(State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Department of Transportation </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 25 [162 Cal.Rptr. 78]; <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 430 [148 Cal.Rptr. 687].)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">It is unclear from the record whether defendant sought to introduce required reports or police reports. However, even if he sought to introduce required reports, Vehicle Code section 20012 does not allow the People\u2019s claim of unconditional privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The due process requirements of the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution, guarantee a defendant in a criminal prosecution the right to present relevant exculpatory evidence,  In the instant case, a state statute was utilized to prevent the accused from gaining access to evidence of possible benefit to his defense. The manner in which this was accomplished constitutes a denial of due process. The trial court should have examined the reports <em>in camera </em>to determine whether the prior accidents were sufficiently similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>defendant\u2019s accident to render such evidence relevant to the issue of causation. The trial court must also segregate the required reports from the accident reports prepared by the police agencies, since the later are not covered by section 20012. If evidence of the prior accidents is deemed to be relevant and the state claims the privilege of nondisclosure under section 20012, the court may then be required to give an instruction under Evidence Code section 1042, subdivision (a), which provides: \u201cExcept where disclosure is forbidden by an act of the Congress of the United States, if a claim of privilege under this article by the state or a public entity in this state is sustained in a criminal proceeding, the presiding officer shall make such order or finding of fact adverse to the public entity bringing the proceeding as is required by law upon any issue in the proceeding to which the privileged information is material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The exclusion of this evidence, if relevant, could have had a significant impact on the jury\u2019s decision not only on the issue of guilt, but also in failing to recommend a place of confinement pursuant to Penal Code section 193.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glass </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 222 [71 Cal.Rptr. 858], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Hawkins) </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 757 [100 Cal.Rptr. 281, 493 P.2d 1145].) We therefore conclude that the failure to examine the reports in question was error. However, a remand in such a situation does not automatically require a new trial.  \u201c[W]hen the validity of a conviction depends solely on an unresolved or improperly resolved factual issue which is distinct from issues submitted to the jury, such an issue can be determined at a separate post-judgment hearing and if at such hearing the issue is resolved in favor of the People, the conviction may stand.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vanbuskirk </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 395, 405 [132 Cal.Rptr. 30]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bustamante </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 88 [177 Cal.Rptr. 576, 634 P.2d 927]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coyer </em>(1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 839 [191 Cal.Rptr. 376]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cheeks </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 826 [185 Cal.Rptr. 496]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Minor </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 194 [163 Cal.Rptr. 501].)</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We reverse and remand to the trial court for resolution of the evidentiary issue in accordance with this decision. If the trial court finds the evidence of prior accidents to be rel\u00e9vant, the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a. new trial is to be vacated and a new trial granted. Conversely, if the evidence is deemed irrelevant, defendant\u2019s conviction shall stand, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>court shall undertake all necessary proceedings, including rearraignment for and pronouncement of judgment, to give effect to the verdicts returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Low, P.
