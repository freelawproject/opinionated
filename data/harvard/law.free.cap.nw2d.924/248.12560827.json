Denson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20385\">\n    500 Mich. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n    902 N.W.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). We AFFIRM, however, the Court of Appeals holding that any error in this regard was harmless in light of the overwhelming untainted evidence.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   Markman, J. (concurring).\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I agree with the majority that any error that might have occurred here was harmless and therefore reach the same result. However, for precisely the reason of this harmlessness, I believe it is unnecessary to address whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that evidence of defendant's previous criminal conduct was admissible under MRE 404(b). Such error is clearly implied by reference to\n   <em>\n    People v. Denson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20Mich.%20385\">\n    500 Mich. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20N.W.2d%20306\">\n    902 N.W.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), a decision of this Court in which there was both a 404(b) violation and the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of harmless error.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
