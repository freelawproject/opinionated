Templeton, Respondent.\n </docketnumber>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-3\">\n  No. 2018AP2457-D\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-4\">\n  Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-5\">\n  Opinion Filed: March 21, 2019\n </decisiondate>\n <disposition id=\"p-6\">\n  ATTORNEY disciplinary proceeding.\n  <em>\n   Attorney's license suspended.\n  </em>\n </disposition>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-7\">\n   PER CURIAM.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b61 We review a stipulation filed\n   pursuant to Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 22.12 by the Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR) and Attorney David P. F. Templeton. In the stipulation, Attorney Templeton admits that he committed professional misconduct, and he agrees with the OLR's request that his license to practice law be suspended for a period of six months. He further agrees that the court should impose various conditions upon the reinstatement of his license to practice law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 After careful review of the matter, we accept the stipulation and impose the requested discipline. Because Attorney Templeton entered into a comprehensive stipulation prior to the appointment of a referee, we do not require him to pay the costs of this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Attorney Templeton was admitted to practice law in Wisconsin in 2004 and practiced in Menasha. He has no prior disciplinary history. Effective May 31, 2017, his license to practice law was suspended for failure to comply with continuing legal education reporting requirements. Effective\n   October 31, 2017, his license to practice law was suspended for failure to pay state bar dues and provide the OLR trust account certification. Attorney Templeton's license remains suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 On December 27, 2018, the OLR filed a complaint alleging that Attorney Templeton had engaged in three counts of professional misconduct. The complaint sought a six-month suspension of his license to practice law in Wisconsin. Attorney Templeton filed a handwritten answer on January 7, 2019, stating that he accepts the OLR's findings and recommendations and that he takes full responsibility for his misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 On January 18, 2019, the OLR and Attorney Templeton filed a stipulation pursuant to SCR 22.12. The following facts are taken from the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 On June 22, 2017, Village of Fox Crossing Police Department Investigator Jeremiah Gustafson provided information to the OLR about Attorney Templeton, advising that Attorney Templeton was under investigation for suspected drug-related conduct. Investigator Gustafson was working with an investigator from the Lake Winnebago Metropolitan Enforcement Group (MEG) and a confidential informant (CI). MEG is a multi-jurisdictional law enforcement task force concentrating on illegal drugs that uses CIs to gather evidence. The CI and Attorney Templeton had discussed the possibility of the CI performing clerical work for Attorney Templeton in exchange for drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 On August 2, 2017, Investigator Gustafson, the MEG investigator, and the CI met in advance of a pre-arranged controlled buy of illegal drugs from Attorney Templeton set for later that day. The CI wore a wireless body transmitter while the investigators observed the drug transaction between Attorney Templeton and the CI. Attorney Templeton delivered approximately .2 grams of heroin to the CI with the assurance, \"Don't worry, I'll get more.\" Following the drug transaction, Attorney Templeton was arrested and later released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 On August 11, 2017, Attorney Templeton was charged in Winnebago County with one count of manufacturing/delivery of heroin in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20961.41\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 961.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(d) 1, a Class F felony. Conditions of his bail/bond included absolute sobriety and no commission of any criminal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 On August 14, 2017, Attorney Templeton tested positive for methamphetamine, in violation of\n   his bail/bond. On August 17, 2017, he caused a disturbance at a Menasha apartment while intoxicated, two additional violations of his bail/bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 On August 18, 2017, as a result of his conduct the previous day, Attorney Templeton was charged in Winnebago County with two counts of felony bail jumping pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20946.49\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b), and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20947.01\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 947.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 On March 6, 2018, Attorney Templeton pleaded guilty to the felony count of manufacturing/delivery of heroin and one count of felony bail jumping. The other felony bail jumping and the disorderly conduct counts were read in and dismissed. On May 18, 2018, Attorney Templeton received an imposed but stayed sentence consisting of two years of initial confinement and three years of extended supervision, as well as an imposed five-year probation sentence with credit for time served. (Attorney Templeton was incarcerated between August 18, 2017 and May 18, 2018.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b612 Attorney Templeton's license to practice law in Wisconsin has been continuously suspended since May 31, 2017. On June 5, 2017, he appeared in Winnebago\n   County Circuit Court on behalf of a client. Attorney Templeton failed to inform his client, opposing counsel, or the court that his license to practice law had been suspended. A representative of the Town of Grand Chute Police Department notified the OLR that on June 28 and 29, 2017, Attorney Templeton stated to the police department he had been retained by and represented a client under criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b613 The OLR's complaint alleged the following counts of misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Count One\n   </strong>\n   : By engaging in conduct leading to criminal felony convictions for the manufacture/delivery\n   of heroin and for bail jumping, Attorney Templeton violated SCR 20:8.4(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Count Two\n   </strong>\n   : By failing to notify his client, opposing counsel, and the court of his license suspension, Attorney Templeton violated SCR 22.26(1)(a), (b) and (c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Count Three\n   </strong>\n   : By practicing law after May 31, 2017, while his license was suspended,\n   Attorney Templeton violated SCR 22.26(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and SCR 31.10(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable via SCR 20:8.4(f).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Attorney Templeton states that the terms of the stipulation were not bargained for or negotiated between the parties. He avers that he admits the facts and misconduct alleged by the OLR and agrees to the discipline sought by the OLR director. He represents that he fully understands the misconduct allegations, the ramifications should the court impose the stipulated level of discipline, his right to contest the matter, and his right to consult with and retain counsel. He states that his entry into the stipulation is made knowingly and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 In the stipulation, the parties agree that an appropriate level of discipline to impose in response to Attorney Templeton's misconduct is a suspension of his license to practice law in Wisconsin for a period of six months. The parties further agree that the court impose the following conditions on the reinstatement on Attorney Templeton's law license:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Prior to filing a petition for reinstatement, Attorney Templeton will provide the OLR with signed medical releases for each treatment provider who is providing or has provided treatment, assessment, or services related to substance abuse to Attorney Templeton within the three previous years;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Prior to filing a petition for reinstatement, Attorney Templeton will undergo a substance abuse assessment that makes specific written recommendations, and demonstrate compliance with the recommendations; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 As a condition of reinstatement, Attorney Templeton will submit to monitoring as directed by the OLR and must comply with all monitoring requirements for a period of two years following reinstatement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 In its memorandum in support of the stipulation, the OLR says that Attorney Templeton's misconduct was serious and merits a sanction that will require him to demonstrate his fitness before practicing law again in Wisconsin. The OLR notes that there a number mitigating factors present in this case: Attorney Templeton has no disciplinary history; he is remorseful for his misconduct; he fully cooperated in the OLR's investigation and stipulated to the misconduct, and he continues to participate in weekly counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 After careful review of the matter, we accept the stipulation and determine that Attorney Templeton engaged in the three counts of misconduct alleged in the OLR's complaint. We further conclude that a six-month suspension of his license to practice law is an appropriate level of discipline. Although no two disciplinary proceedings are precisely alike, we find that the misconduct at issue here is somewhat similar to that presented in\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Schwitzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279632\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/375/414/\">\n    2017 WI 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279632\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/375/414/\">\n    375 Wis. 2d 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12279632\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/375/414/\">\n    895 N.W.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Attorney Schwitzer's license was suspended for six months following his criminal convictions for possession of THC and cocaine, as well as holding himself out as an attorney following an administrative suspension. As in\n   <em>\n    Schwitzer\n   </em>\n   , we find a six-month suspension which will require Attorney Templeton to go through a formal reinstatement proceeding, to be an appropriate level of discipline. We also find it appropriate to impose the conditions enumerated in the stipulation upon the reinstatement of Attorney Templeton's license to practice law. Since this matter was brought to the court in the context of an SCR 22.12 stipulation without the need to appoint a referee, we impose no costs upon Attorney Templeton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 IT IS ORDERED that the license of David P. F. Templeton to practice law in\n   Wisconsin is suspended for a period of six months, effective the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, to the extent he has not already done so, David P.
