Each party moved to exclude the\n   other party's experts; appellants moved to add a claim for punitive damages; and respondent moved for summary judgment with respect to general causation. The district court granted respondent's motions and denied appellants' motions. Appellants challenge these decisions. Because we see no error in the decisions to exclude appellants' experts, to grant summary judgment to respondent, and to deny appellants' motion for punitive damages, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1987, Scott Augustine, an anesthesiologist and the CEO of Augustine Medical, Inc., invented a FAWD to maintain patients' normal body temperature during surgery. Known as the Bair Hugger, it became the leading warming device in the world. In 2002, Augustine was notified that he was under investigation for Medicare fraud. He resigned from Augustine Medical Inc., which was reorganized as Arizant Healthcare Inc. (Arizant), and Arizant retained the rights to the Bair Hugger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2003, Augustine formed Augustine Biomedical + Design and invented an electric-conduction warming device (ECWD) known as the HotDog. In 2004, he pleaded guilty to Medicare fraud, was fined $2 million, and was prohibited from participating in federal health-care programs for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During those years, he deprecated the Bair Hugger in other countries, leading the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to reject his claim that FAWDs increase the risk of SSI and a German court to enjoin him from making false claims that the Bair Hugger increased bacterial contamination in operating rooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2009, Augustine hired a law firm to promote the use of his ECWD and agreed to work with the law firm as a nontestifying expert for individuals who brought lawsuits against Arizant. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated Augustine's claims that the Bair Hugger increased the risk of bacterial contamination and rejected them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2010, Arizant was acquired by respondent 3M Company (3M). Augustine repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to induce 3M to purchase the HotDog system, which he claimed reduced the rate of SSI compared to FAWDs such as the Bair Hugger. The FDA warned Augustine that his claim lacked clinical support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2013, the law firm that Augustine had hired began filing lawsuits against Arizant and 3M, claiming that the Bair Hugger was unsafe. In 2014, Augustine funded the McGovern Study,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which purported to find an association between the Bair Hugger and increased SSIs. One of the study's authors, a former employee of Augustine, testified that \"[t]he study does not establish a causal basis\" and characterized it as marketing rather than research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2017, the FDA sent a\n   <em>\n    Safety Alert\n   </em>\n   to healthcare providers \"reminding [them] that using thermoregulation devices during surgery, including [FAWDs], ha[s] been demonstrated to result in less bleeding, faster recovery times, and decreased risk of infection for patients\"; advising them that \"[a]fter a thorough review of available data, [the FDA was] unable to identify a consistently reported association between the use of [FAWDs] and [SSIs]\"; and recommending \"the use of thermoregulating devices (including [FAWDs] ) for surgical procedures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To support the claims in their lawsuits, appellants retained three general-causation\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   medical experts, none of whom had previously studied the efficacy of FAWDs or published peer-reviewed articles relevant to the claims in this litigation and none of whom claimed that their general-causation opinions were generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. On respondent's motion, the district court excluded the testimony of appellants' experts and consequently granted respondent summary judgment with respect to general causation. The district court also denied appellants' motion to amend their complaint by adding a claim for punitive damages. Appellants challenge these decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Did the district court err in applying Minn. R.

The district court concluded that \"[appellants] have failed to satisfy the general-acceptance standard under [ Minn. R.

But Minn. R. Evid. 702 pertains to \"novel scientific theory,\" not novel science; the fact that air and particulate movement is not a new science does not\n   mean that appellants' premise, i.e., that FAWDs increase the risk of SSIs, is not a novel scientific theory. Because appellants' scientific theory has not been examined or pronounced on by any court, it is novel. Therefore its proponents, i.e., appellants, \"must establish that the underlying scientific evidence is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Evid. 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellants also argue that Minn. R. Evid. 702 does not require a showing that \"proof of the expert's ultimate opinion\" is generally accepted; instead, it requires only a \"showing that the tools employed by the expert[s] in reaching their opinion [i.e., the experts' methodologies] have gained general acceptance.\" But Minn. R. Evid. 702 is not restricted to novel methodologies; it refers to \"opinion or evidence involv[ing] novel scientific theory\" for which \"the underlying scientific evidence is generally accepted.\" Minn.

Thus, the district court did not err in excluding the testimony of appellants' general-causation medical experts, having found that none of them \"had studied the efficacy of forced-air warming devices prior to being retained by [appellants],\" nor had they \"published any peer-reviewed articles relevant to the claims made in this litigation,\" nor did they \"claim that their general-causation opinions are generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Six documents that the district court reviewed in reaching its decision clearly demonstrate that the relevant scientific community has not accepted the novel scientific opinion that FAWDs cause an increased risk of SSIs. The first was the\n   <em>\n    2013 Proceedings of the International Consensus Meeting on Periprosthetic Joint Infection\n   </em>\n   [PJI], which appellants' attorney\n   agreed was \"something that both sides can rely upon.\" The document states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Delegates from various disciplines including orthopaedic surgery, infectious disease, musculoskeletal pathology, microbiology, anesthesiology, dermatology, nuclear medicine, rheumatology, musculoskeletal radiology, veterinary surgery, pharmacy, and numerous scientists with interest in orthopaedic infections came together to evaluate the available evidence, when present, or reach consensus regarding current practices for management of SSI/PJI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The process of generating the consensus has spanned over 10 months.

The McGovern Study itself said that, \"This study does not establish a causal basis for this association [between FAWDs and SSIs]\". The other documents on which appellants rely similarly provide: (1) \"The present study did not evaluate the link between [FAWD] and [SSI] rates...\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) \"[O]ur findings do not establish a direct link between [FAWD] and increased [SSI] rates ...\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) \"Because of the nature of our experiment we are unable to conclude that the use of the [FAWD] ... would actually lead to an increased risk of [SSI]\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) \"Another limitation of our study is that the definitive effects of this excess heat [from FAWDs] on clinical outcomes is presently unknown.\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5) \"[T]his study does not show that forced-air warming increases the risk of infection ...\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (6) \"[W]e did not track hospital infections, nor did we study the association between [forced-air warming] contamination generation/emission and hospital infection rates. ...\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (7) \"[W]e are unsure of the exact degree of ventilation disruption that might occur in a working OR during orthopedic surgery...

The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellants had not presented the prima facie case requisite for a punitive-damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The district court's decisions to apply the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Mack\n   </em>\n   general-acceptance standard and exclude the testimony of appellants' experts and to grant respondent's motion for summary judgment as to general causation were without error, and its decision to deny appellants' motion to amend their complaint to seek punitive damages was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    McGovern, PD et al., Forced-air warming and ultra-clean ventilation do not mix,\n    <em>\n     J.
