Savage, concerning our opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Savage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559504\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/692/\">\n    301 Neb. 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559504\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/692/\">\n    920 N.W.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). We overrule the motion, but we modify the opinion as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the subsection \"(a) Authentication,\" after the fourth sentence of the fourth paragraph, we insert the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   As for Savage's contention that the State did not properly authenticate messages sent to him by others, we again disagree. The State was required only to introduce testimony sufficient to establish that the evidence was what\n   the State claimed it to be. The State did not claim that messages sent by others were anything more than messages sent to Savage's cell phone. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Elseman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=287%20Neb.%20134\">\n    287 Neb. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20N.W.2d%20225\">\n    841 N.W.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559504\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/692/\">\n    301 Neb. at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559504\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/692/\">\n    920 N.W.2d at 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In subsection \"(b) Hearsay,\" following the second to the last paragraph, we insert the following paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We also reject Savage's argument that text messages sent to his cell phone by unidentified individuals contained inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2027-801\">\n    Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 27-801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (Reissue 2016). Messages sent to Savage's cell phone were not offered for the truth of the matters asserted. They were offered to prove that the statements were made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559504\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/692/\">\n    301 Neb. at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12559504\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/920/692/\">\n    920 N.W.2d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The remainder of the opinion shall remain unmodified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   FORMER OPINION MODIFIED .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   MOTION FOR REHEARING OVERRULED .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
