Chisholm was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment and we affirmed the conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Chisholm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7069007\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/818/707/\">\n    2012 ND 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7069007\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/818/707/\">\n    818 N.W.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] Chisholm previously filed multiple applications for post-conviction relief, one which was denied by the Honorable Donald Hager. In his most recent application for post-conviction relief, Chisholm alleges newly discovered evidence entitles him to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] In conjunction with his application for post-conviction relief, Chisholm filed a request for a change of judge referencing N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21 and including allegations that Judge Hager was not impartial. Chisholm also filed a motion to compel discovery and a request for court-appointed counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b65] The Honorable Lolita Hartl-Romanick reviewed Chisholm's request for change of judge and denied his request in her capacity as the acting presiding judge. Judge Hager subsequently denied the motion to compel discovery, denied the application for court-appointed counsel, and summarily dismissed the application for post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b66] Chisholm argues the district court erred by summarily dismissing his application for post-conviction relief, denying his request for counsel, and denying his motion to compel discovery. He further contends the court erred when it denied his request for a change of judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] Chisholm's demand for change of judge referenced N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21, which allows for a peremptory challenge of an assigned judge. Within the body of the demand for change of judge, Chisholm included allegations that Judge Hager should recuse himself from the case for bias or prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] \"We distinguish peremptory demands for a change of judge from a demand for a change of judge based on bias.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray v.

We conclude the document submitted by Chisholm contains two separate requests-a peremptory request for change of judge under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21 and a request for recusal based on bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b69] To the extent Chisholm's request is a peremptory challenge to the assignment of a particular judge, it is governed by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21. One of the prerequisites to reassignment of the case under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21 is certification by the moving party that the assigned judge \"has not ruled upon any matter pertaining to the action or proceeding in which the moving party was heard or had an opportunity to be heard.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21(4). Additionally, \"no demand for a change of judge may be made after the judge sought to be disqualified has ruled upon any matter pertaining to the action or proceeding in which the demanding party was heard or had an opportunity to be heard.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b610] Judge Hager presided over Chisholm's prior post-conviction action. Each application for post-conviction relief is assigned a new civil case number. We have not previously considered whether successive post-conviction applications should be considered new actions or proceedings sufficient to allow a peremptory demand for a change of judge under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b611] Our prior decisions support a conclusion that successive post-conviction relief applications are a single action. In\n   <em>\n    Estate of Ketterling\n   </em>\n   , this Court considered whether to allow a change of judge under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21 when a formal probate proceeding was initiated after informal probate proceedings had begun.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10592443\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/515/158/#p166\">\n    515 N.W.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (N.D. 1994). The appellant contended formal probate proceedings were distinct from informal proceedings and should be considered a separate proceeding from the original action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10592443\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/515/158/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court disagreed and held that informal probate and formal probate actions concerning the same estate were a single proceeding because they relate to the same matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10592443\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/515/158/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b612] Similarly in\n   <em>\n    Falcon v. State\n   </em>\n   , the district court declined to find that a criminal action and related post-conviction action were separate proceedings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11892915\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/570/719/\">\n    1997 ND 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11892915\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/570/719/\">\n    570 N.W.2d 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Falcon argued\n   because post-conviction applications are civil in nature, filed under a new and separate civil case number, the post-conviction proceeding is separate from the underlying criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. This Court, relying on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Ketterling\n   </em>\n   , held the post-conviction action and the criminal case concerned the same matter and were not a separate proceeding for the purpose of a peremptory demand for change of judge under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b613] Having previously held that an initial post-conviction action is a continuation of the underlying criminal case, it is a logical extension of our holding that subsequent applications for post-conviction relief are also a continuation of the underlying action. We affirm the denial of the peremptory demand for change of judge made by Chisholm under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b614] Under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21(6), \"the judge sought to be disqualified has no authority or discretion to determine the timeliness or validity of the demand and shall proceed no further or take any action in the action or proceeding and is thereafter disqualified from doing any further act in the cause unless the demand is invalidated by the presiding judge.\" As such, it was proper for Judge Hartl-Romanick, in her capacity as the acting presiding judge, to consider and determine the merits of the peremptory challenge to Judge Hager. Judge Hartl-Romanick also reviewed and denied Chisholm's request as a motion based on bias and prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b615] We have previously held motions seeking the recusal of a judge for bias or prejudice are not within the scope of N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21(6), and the assigned judge is not disqualified from acting on matters within the case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Schweitzer v. Mattingley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12148318\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/887/541/\">\n    2016 ND 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12148318\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/887/541/\">\n    887 N.W.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (district court committed reversible error in allowing a different judge to rule on a motion for recusal based on bias). Unlike a demand for a change of judge, \"a district court judge is not immediately divested of authority upon the filing of a motion to recuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. While \"a judge has a duty to recuse when required by the Code of Judicial Conduct, a judge also has an equally strong duty not to recuse when the circumstances do not require recusal.\"\n   <em>\n    Rath v. Rath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819131\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/474/\">\n    2016 ND 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6819131\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/474/\">\n    876 N.W.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rule 2.7, N.D. Code Jud. Conduct, requires the assigned judge to hear and decide all matters assigned to the judge, unless disqualification is required or otherwise provided by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b616] Chisholm's request for recusal, based on bias or prejudice, was not governed by N.D.C.C. \u00a7 29-15-21, was not required to be considered by another judge, and should have been determined by the judge assigned to the case. We reverse the denial of the demand for change of judge based on bias or prejudice and remand for the assigned judge to consider the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b617] The district court properly denied the peremptory demand for change of judge, and we affirm the denial of the peremptory demand. The request for recusal of the assigned judge should have been considered by the assigned judge, and we therefore reverse the denial of the request for recusal based on bias and prejudice. We remand for consideration of the request for recusal for bias or prejudice by the assigned judge and, subsequent to a determination on the request for recusal, reconsideration of the motion to compel discovery, request for appointment of counsel, and summary dismissal of the post-conviction application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b618] Jon J.
