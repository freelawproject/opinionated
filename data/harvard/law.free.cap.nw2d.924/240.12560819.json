I write separately to note that the motion for reconsideration raised new issues that are not properly before this Court, and this denial does not prejudice the defendant's ability to raise those issues in a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Subchapter 6.500 of the Michigan Court Rules.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
