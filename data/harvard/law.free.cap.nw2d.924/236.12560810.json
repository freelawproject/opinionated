The denial is without prejudice to the defendant's right to file a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to MCR Subchapter 6.500 that may include the issue of whether the defendant asserted his right to self-representation knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
