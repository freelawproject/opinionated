The lake has a contributing watershed of 14,000 acres, 75% of which is agricultural land. Crystal Lake is considered hypereutrophic, meaning that it has excessive levels of phosphorus and algae that cause negative impacts on water quality. The phosphorus water-quality standard for Crystal Lake is 90 ug/L (micrograms per liter or parts per billion).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%207050\">\n    Minn.

Following a toxic algae bloom in 2004, the MPCA placed Crystal Lake on the state's impaired-waters list in 2006 and initiated a TMDL study to determine the type and degree of pollutant-source reductions needed to achieve water-quality standards. During the 2008 and 2009 monitoring seasons for the TMDL study, total phosphorus (TP) averaged 264 ug/L, almost three times the water-quality standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The TMDL study resulted in a Draft Crystal Lake Excess Nutrient TMDL Report (the report) being released for public comment on August 27, 2012.

On August 27, 2012, the MPCA published in the state register notice of the report and requested comments on the draft TMDL.

Again here, relator cites no legal authority in support of his argument. The MPCA responds that relator's argument is based on a misconception of \"what a TMDL is and the scientific methodology by which it is developed.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As discussed above, the TMDL is the amount of a particular pollutant that can be released into a particular water while maintaining water-quality standards. The phosphorus water-quality standard for Crystal Lake is 90 ug/L.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%207050\">\n    Minn.

In other words, the 2008 and 2009 data were used to determine if the models were correctly predicting phosphorus levels that result in the lake from certain inputs. This information was used to calculate the amount of phosphorus that can be released into Crystal Lake while maintaining its phosphorus water-quality standard. Subsequent changes in phosphorus inputs-including through implementation of the buffer law-may affect whether Crystal Lake continues to be an impaired water, that is, whether phosphorus levels in the lake continue to exceed the water-quality standard. But the underlying math-that is, the calculation of how much phosphorus can be released into Crystal Lake without exceeding the water-quality standard-does not depend on current data. For this reason, the MPCA did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by relying on the 2008 and 2009 data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We again emphasize that we do not condone the unexplained delay in the MPCA's approval of the TMDL for Crystal Lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nevertheless, we conclude that relator has not met his burden to demonstrate that the delay violated his due-process rights or renders the MPCA's decision arbitrary and capricious.

In support of this argument, relator relies on the federal regulatory definition of load allocation, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The portion of a receiving water's loading capacity that is attributed either to one of its existing or future nonpoint sources of pollution or to natural background sources.

Relator also relies on a provision in the CWLA defining a TMDL as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   the sum of the pollutant load allocations for all sources of the pollutant, including a wasteload allocation for point sources,\n   <em>\n    a load allocation for nonpoint sources and natural background\n   </em>\n   , an allocation for future growth of point and nonpoint sources, and a margin of safety to account for uncertainty about the relationship between pollutant loads and the quality of the receiving surface water. \"Natural Background\" means characteristics of the water body resulting from the multiplicity of factors in nature, including climate and ecosystem dynamics, that affect the physical, chemical, or biological conditions in a water body, but does not include measurable and distinguishable pollution that is attributable to human activity or influence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 114D.15, subd. 10 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This court considered and rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   , noting that the federal regulations do not mandate separate allocations and reasoning with respect to state law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Relators argue that \"nonpoint sources\" and \"natural background\" should be interpreted as separate elements. This interpretation is not supported by the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. The portion of the statute that defines TMDL contains four clauses, each of which is separated by a comma from the other clauses. The phrase \"a load allocation for nonpoint sources and natural background\" is set off by commas from the remaining three clauses. If \"nonpoint sources\" and \"natural background\" were intended to be read separately they would have been separated by a comma or other disjunctive phrase. Here, \"nonpoint sources\" and \"natural background\" are not separated by a comma or otherwise set apart from one another. Thus, according to a plain and ordinary reading of the statute, the legislature chose not to separate \"nonpoint sources\" from \"natural background.\" Therefore, relators' assertion that the statute requires the MPCA to develop an independent load allocation for nonpoint sources, as well as a second load allocation for natural background, is not well-founded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206923602\">\n    2016 WL 6923602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Relator asserts that, in addition to being unpublished and nonprecedential,\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, arguing\n   that the court's interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   \"ignores the latter part of the definition of a TMDL that specifically defines 'natural background' and provides instructions on how to calculate it\" and thus that the interpretation \"render[s] part of the statute essentially dead letter.\" We disagree. The statutory definition of natural background does not defeat this court's analysis that the statute contemplates assignment of load capacity for nonpoint sources and natural background together. That the MPCA must consider natural background in determining the LA-as it did in both\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   and this case-does not mean that it must separately assign a loading capacity for natural background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Relator also asserts that\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on its facts because the record in that case \"supported the conclusion that natural background had 'marginal impact on Little Rock Creek's overall water quality' and that 'current research is not sufficient to differentiate between nonpoint and natural background sources of pollutants.' \" Relator argues that, in this case, the MPCA \"failed to conduct testing recommended by its own guidance that would have allowed it to calculate natural background, and the MPCA ignored evidence in the record showing that natural background in the form of internal phosphorus loading has a major impact on water quality levels.\" Again here, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   , the TMDL study concluded that assigning a separate loading capacity for natural background was not feasible:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   While substantial research has been conducted to estimate the amount of nutrient contribution from different nonpoint or natural sources, allocations in this report do not subdivide the LA. There are several reasons for this. First, current research is not sufficient to precisely define either nonpoint or natural background sources especially with the influence of the ditch system and sources of nutrients. Secondly, subdivision of the LA is not required by the EPA. Finally, discussions on which nonpoint or natural background sources should be considered, and how they should be addressed will be included in the implementation process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The study noted that \"[e]xisting methods, such as core data or diatom reconstruction, could potentially define a general value for natural background in the watershed but determining a specific percentage within an individual watershed is difficult.\" And the study concluded that \"a specific value would not be defensible or ultimately beneficial to the TMDL project.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, the TMDL study does not ignore evidence of internal loading, as relator asserts. Rather, the study repeatedly emphasizes that internal loading likely is contributing to the phosphorus levels in Crystal Lake. But the study also cautions that, \"while the data indicate internal processes are contributing to in-lake phosphorus concentrations, external sources of phosphorus will need to be reduced to attain long-term improvements to Crystal Lake water quality.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, although the study suggests that additional data may allow a quantification of the relative contributions of external versus internal loading, internal loading is not a proxy for natural background, as relator seems to assert. Rather,\n   <em>\n    internal loading can be caused by external loading\n   </em>\n   . According to the MPCA, data suggest that Crystal Lake's water quality \"is due to excess nutrients entering and accumulating in the lake from both rural and urban sources,\n   <em>\n    increasing\n   </em>\n   potential internal loading and phosphorus releases.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the MPCA concludes\n   that, \"[b]y not addressing the external loading, the effectiveness of any in-lake treatment would be limited. Over time,\n   <em>\n    internal load[ing] will subside if external loading is controlled\n   </em>\n   through implementation activities.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Relator separately asserts that the MPCA erroneously interprets \"natural background\" to exclude all human influence. But the MPCA's definition is consistent with EPA guidance cited in the report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Natural or background inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus in stream and river systems will contribute to increased nutrient concentrations. Typically, such sources can be estimated from regional reference streams. Reference sites are relatively undisturbed by human influences or represent least-impaired conditions; their levels of nitrogen and phosphorus reflect background loading from stream erosion, wild animal wastes, leaf fall and other natural or background processes. If possible, reference streams should be located in similar geophysical and hydrologic watersheds, having similar stream morphology and stream order. A wide variety of state and local agencies may collect information about reference streams. Without site-specific or regional reference stream information, literature values may be used to estimate background sources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, the CWLA defines natural background to exclude \"pollution that is attributable to human activity or influence.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 114D.15, subd. 10. In the absence of a federal statutory or regulatory definition of \"natural background,\" we defer to these reasonable interpretations of the EPA and the MPCA of federal regulations that they are charged to enforce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Annandale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8309854\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/731/502/#p510\">\n    731 N.W.2d at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining deference owed to agency's reasonable interpretation of its own regulations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In sum, we conclude that this case is not distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Little Rock Creek\n   </em>\n   , and that that case was correctly decided. We adopt here its holding that the MPCA is not required to separately designate a load allocation for natural background in a TMDL. Accordingly, we reject relator's arguments for reversal on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Relator finally challenges the MPCA's decision not to hold a contested-case hearing. The approval of a TMDL is subject to the contested-case procedures of MAPA \"in accordance with agency procedural rules.\" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 114D.25, subd. 2.
