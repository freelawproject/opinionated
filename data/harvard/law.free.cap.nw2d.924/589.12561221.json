The parties shall address: (1) whether a legal misconception concerning a defendant's sentence on one count renders the sentences for other counts arising out of the same transaction invalid; (2) whether the requirements for a motion for relief from judgment must be satisfied before a defendant may be resentenced on other counts where a change in the law requires resentencing for one count, or whether a trial court may exercise its discretion to resentence on other counts where resentencing is required for one count; and (3) if the latter, what parameters apply to the exercise of the court's discretion when deciding whether to resentence on other counts. The time for oral argument shall be 20 minutes for each side.
