He argues the district court erred in awarding Jessica Purdy primary residential responsibility of the children. We affirm the amended judgment, concluding the district court did not clearly err in denying his motion to modify primary residential responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] Daren and Jessica Purdy were divorced in a May 2014 default judgment awarding Jessica Purdy primary residential responsibility of the parties' two minor children, granting Daren Purdy parenting time, and ordering him to pay Jessica Purdy $818 per month in child support. Daren Purdy was awarded parenting time on alternating weekends from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Sunday at 8:00 p.m., on Wednesday from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., on specified holidays alternating every other year and for one week of uninterrupted parenting time during June, July and August.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b63] In June 2017 Daren Purdy moved to modify primary residential responsibility and parenting time for the parties' children. His motion sought an order granting him primary, or at least equal residential responsibility. He alternatively sought increased parenting time. The district court ruled Daren Purdy established a prima facie case for modification and ordered an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 14-09-06.6(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b64] After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Daren Purdy's motion to modify primary residential responsibility, modified the parties' parenting time and ordered him to pay Jessica Purdy $932 per month in child support. In denying the motion to modify primary residential responsibility, the court analyzed the best interest factors and concluded most favored neither party, but factors (b), (d), (e) and (h) favored Jessica Purdy. The court modified Daren Purdy's parenting time to include alternating weekends from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Sunday at 4:00 p.m., one night a week from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. the next morning or when school starts, alternating weeks during June, July and August, and specified holidays alternating every other year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] Daren Purdy argues the district court erred in awarding Jessica Purdy primary residential responsibility of the children. He contends the court's decision is not in the best interests of the children and he should have been granted at least equal residential responsibility for the children. He argues the court did not address his claim that Jessica Purdy was in possession of a controlled substance near the children, the court erred in finding Jessica Purdy's statements about his parenting time were true and accurate, and the court erred in finding a \"boiler plate\" parenting schedule was in the children's best interests. He argues the best interest factors should be reevaluated with consideration given to his evidence that he is an involved parent and there is no plausible reason why equal residential responsibility would\n   cause harm to the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] Jessica Purdy responds that the district court's findings on the best interests of the children are not clearly erroneous. She argues that she adequately explained the presence of a prescription pill near the children and that Daren Purdy essentially seeks to have this Court reweigh evidence and reevaluate the district court's findings on the best interests of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] A party moving to modify primary residential responsibility has the burden of proof. N.D.C.C. \u00a7 14-09-06.6(8).

Second, after balancing the child's best interests and stability with the custodial parent, the trial court must conclude that a change in the status quo is required. A child is presumed to be better off with the custodial parent, and close calls should be resolved in favor of continuing custody. A change should only be made when the reasons for transferring custody substantially outweigh the child's stability with the custodial parent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7057851\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/837/342/\">\n    2013 ND 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7057851\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/837/342/\">\n    837 N.W.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vining v.

However, the court explicitly found neither parent had any significant moral failings that would impact the children. From this finding the court ostensibly believed Jessica Purdy's explanation that almost two years before Daren Purdy's motion she inadvertently left a bottle in her car with one prescription pill for her gastrointestinal pain. The court did not err as a matter of law by not explicitly mentioning the prescription pill in its findings on the best interest factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b612] The court considered each of the best interest factors under N.D.C.C. \u00a7 14-09-06.2(1)(a)-(m) and found that most favored neither party, but factors (b), (d), (e) and (h) favored Jessica Purdy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    B.

Jessica is the one that has historically been the one to schedule and ensure that the children have gotten to medical appointments. Daren emphasized heavily an incident involving pain in the girl's 'bottom.' He complains that this is a result of the girl's alleged poor hygiene practices when they are with Jessica and that Jessica does nothing to fix this situation. Daren's mother testified that this condition has been ongoing since the date of the parties' separation. The only documentary evidence in the record on this point is a text message exchange on September 27, 2016. Exhibit 90. In this exchange, Jessica indicated that she was aware of the problem and had contacted medical professionals about it, but was told there was no urgency. Further, she indicated that she had scheduled an appointment with the children's pediatrician within two weeks, at which point the issue would be addressed. Daren did not contest this evidence. Frankly, Daren and his witnesses appear to have greatly exaggerated their testimony in\n   this regard, rendering Jessica's version of events more credible than Daren's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"There was also testimony that Jessica allowed the children to be at home after school without supervision. Jessica testified credibly and without being impeached that this may have happened very infrequently, due to a late babysitter. Jessica further explained that she retained a babysitter to be at her home by 3:10 p.m. during the school year and that the children did not get home prior to that time. If the babysitter was late or did not show up, she had a back-up plan that they could go [to] a neighbor's house, at which resided a stay-at-home dad. Further, [one child] had a key to get into Jessica's home. It appears that, if anything, Jessica has exercised reasonable prudence and care to make sure the children are supervised.

Jessica has resided at the present location for two years. The girls are more used to Jessica's residence. Daren indicated that if he were to prevail in this motion, that he would likely try to relocate to somewhere in West Fargo to be closer to the children's school. This is admirable on his part.

On the other hand, there is also evidence that Daren has, occasionally, kept the girls beyond the time he is allotted in the JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT. His responses, when questioned by Jessica, indicate a cavalier attitude toward her rights under the decree.
