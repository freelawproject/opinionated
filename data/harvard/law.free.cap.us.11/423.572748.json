France may, by . her own municipal laAvs, regulate her own trade, but she lias no right to control .ours, beyond her territorial jurisdiction, further than to protect her own belligerent rights, acknowledged by the law of nations. If we violate no such right, and if we do not carry our property within her territorial jurisdiction, she has no right to regulate our trade., Her condemnation, grounded upon regulations which she has no right, according to the law of nations, to make, is void. But even if she had a right to condemn, her. condemnation \u2022ean transfer ho'title, unless the thing' itself be in her possession, at the time of condemnation, so that the' possession may pass. with the title. Here the property never was within the jurisdiction of the Court at Guadalope. It had been sold and delivered by the Dutch governor, before the condemnation. It does not appear that he had any authority either from the capfors, or from the Court, to make the sale.

This is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the correctness of the title, and throws the <em>onus probandi </em>upon the Appellants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">A Court of Admiralty is a Court whose jurisdiction is .co-Ordinate with that of every other throughout the world. The Admiralty Jaw is <em>\u201c of all times and of all </em>nations,\u201d and its decrees, so far as they uffect the thing itself, and so long as they remain unreversed, cannever be question-, ed. The <em>end </em>being gained,' it is an immaterial question, what, were the means, as they are sanctified by1 tlie end. Whether the proceedings are erroneous, or not, according to our notions of right and wrong, whether they are predicated upon a mistake of the <em>law, </em>or of <em>the </em>fact, or are founded upon regulations consistent with, or rc* pugnant to, the law of, nations, .are questions wholly immaterial. The sentence has sealed the proceedings, and those questions can never judicially come before this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-11\">In confirmation of these positions,, it might be suificient to refer to the decisions of this Court, where the principles are settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2M\">\u25a0In the case of <em>Rose v. Himely, </em>4 Cr. 292, this Court refused, to' confirm the property of the alleged purchaser, because the Court, passing sentence, had neither the actual nor constructive jurisdiction, nor power, over the subject in controversy. The point upon which it was decided was, that the vessel and cargo were seized, out of the territorial jurisdiction claimed by the French government of St. Domingo, for a breach of municipal regulations, and were never carried within that jurist diction, but were sold by the captor at a foreign port.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-13\">Two Judges, (the Chief Justice and Judge Washing-top) thought that, in order to give jurisdiction, the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>perty should have beep taken as prize of war,, brought <em>infra presidia; </em>\u00cdj\u2019\u00edi\u00ed*ee (Jiu!ges Cushing, CIia^fe and Liyjngston) were of opinion;'that it wot\u00ed\u00edd be coni' c]usiye even under a municipal Regulation, provided it were carried to the country of the captors. Judge Johhson considered, it conclusive at all events. But even in that case, the Chief Justice says, in p. 276, \u00ab If the F Court of St. Domipgo had jurisdiction, the sentence is conclusive.55 \u25a0 In the cage of <em>Hudson and others </em>v. <em>Guestier, </em>and <em>La Font v.

Judge johnson adhered to 1ns former opinion, that it was immaterial whether the capture was \u00bfnade in the exercise of <em>m,unicipal </em>or <em>belligerent </em>rights, or, Wither within the jurisdictional limits of France, where She is supreme, or upon the high gras, where her authority is concurrent with that of other nations.

If sp, it was expressly over-ruled in <em>Hudson &amp; Smith, v. Guestier, 6 </em>Cr. 281. The Court there unanimously decided; that the judge of tlie.Fr&lt; nch Court must have had a rightto p\u00edspese of every question made in behalf of the owner pf the property, whether it related to the jurisdiction of the Court,' pr arose out of the law of nations, or out of the French decrees, or in any other way: and even if tlye reasons of his judgment, should not be satisfactory,, it would be no ground for a foreign Court to rescind his proceedings, and to r: fuse to consider his sentence as conclusive pn the proper y ; and that, as the title was changed by the condemnation at Guadalope, the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>pwner had po right to pursue ,it in the hands of a yendee, '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ade\">But this is no new principle of law originating with the present state of the worid, which would seem, rather to forbid it; since the rapacity of Courts of on the one side, apd their acknowledged subserviency to the governing power' on the other/ di minish the respect which would otherwise be due to their sentences.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-4\">The conclusive eifect of a foreign sentence in changingjfthe property seems to have been first judicially decided in the case of\u2019 <em>Hughes v.

The only question has been as to the collateral eifect -between underwriters and the assured in cases of warranty in a policy of insurance. And even there, whenever the condemnation has been upon,.the ground of its being the property <em>\u2019 </em>of an enemy, the sen- , tepee has always beep holder to be conclusive, without regard to the circumstances by which the Court came to, that result; The sentence is conclusive as to whatever; it purports to decide. <em>Park. </em>355; 360, 361-2, <em>Rob. </em>173, <em>The Christopher. </em>4 <em>Rob, </em>35, <em>The Henrick and Maria. 5.Rob,, </em>255,, <em>The Comet. </em>4 <em>Rob. </em>3. <em>The Helena. </em>3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. 505, Lothian v.

After the sale, the.vessel and cargo were condemned by the Court of' prize, sitting at Guadaloupe; professedly for a violation of the <em>Milan decree </em>in trading to a dependence of England. On the arrival of this goods, they were claimed by the original owner, who filed a. libel for them. In the District Court, they were adjudged to 1dm; The Circuit Court reversed that sentence, and from the' judgment of the Circuit. Court there is an appeal to this Court.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">It appears to be. settled in this country,- that the Sentence of a competent Court, proceeding <em>in rem, </em>is conclusive with respect to the thing itself, and operates as an absolute change of the property. By such sentence; the right of the former owner is lost, and a complete title given to the person who claims under, the decree: No Court of co-ordinate' jurisdiction can examine the Sentence. The question, therefore, respecting its conformity to general or municipal law, cam never arise, for no co-ordinate tribunal is capable of making the inquiry. The decision, ..in the. case of <em>Hudson Smith, </em>v-Guestier, reported in 6t\u2019&gt; Cranch, is considered as fully establislungthis principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">It is contended that the sentence, in tnis case, has not- . changed the property, because</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>1st; The sale was made under the direction 0/the governor of St. Martins, before the sentence of condemnation was pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">2d. The sentence proves its own illegality, because it purports to be made under a decree which the govern'ment of the United States has declared to be subversive of neutral rights and national law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">1st.* In support of the first objection, it has been urged, that the jurisdiction of the Court depends on the possession of' the <em>thing; </em>that a sentence is a formal decision, by. which a forcible possession is converted into a civil right; and that the possession being gone, there remains nothing on which the sentence can operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">However just this reasoning may be when applied to a. case, in which the possession of the captor has been divested by an adversary <em>force; </em>as in the cases of recapture, rescue, or escape ,\u2022 its correctness is not admitted when' applied to this case. The possession is not an adversary possession, but the possession of a person claiming under the captor. The sale was made on the application of the captor, and the possession of the vendee is a continuance of his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The captur\u00e9 is made by and for the government j and the condemnation, relates back to the capture, and affirms its legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">2d. That the sentence is avowedly made under a decree subversive of the law of nations, will not help the Appellant\u2019s case, in a Court which cannot revise, correct, or even examine that sentence.
