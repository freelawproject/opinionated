That the vessel was unlawfully employed in trade other than that for which she was licensed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqf\">The facts of the case appeared to be as stated in the \u25a0 libel, except that the vessel was seized in the act of leaving.the port, hut before she had gone out of the pprtj and that Gates, the owner of the greater part of die, cargo, was neither master, owner \u00f1or mariner of the vessel.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Bitkin and Dana; for .the Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABa\">Three questions arise iiNhis cause.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">1. Whether the vessel and cargo were forfeited being laden, contrary to the 2d section of the act of <em>April, 1808 </em>\u2014 vol. <em>9, p. </em>146, which declares that \u201c <em>\u201c </em>vessel shall receive a clearance, unless the lading <em>\u201c </em>shall'be made hereafter under the inspection of the <em>4f </em>proper revenue officers, subject to the same restnc- \u201c tions, regulations, penalties and <em>forfeitures, </em>as are* <em>\u201c </em>provided by law for the inspection of goods, wares <em>\u201c </em>and merchandize imported,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-11\">.2. Whether she departed from a port of the. United States without a clearance or permit,, contrary to the 3d section of the act of .the <em>9th of January, 1808 </em>\u2014 'vol. <em>9, p. </em>11.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-12\">3. Whether she was employed in any other trade than that for which she was licensed, contrary to the 32&lt;1 section of the act of <em>February 18th, </em>1'. , for in-rolling and licensing vessels \u2014 vol. 2, <em>p. </em>193.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-14\">1. Upon the first question, nothing will be added to the arguments urged in the case of the <em>Paulina, f Ante p. 55.J</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-15\">The only penalty, under that act, for lading without the inspection of a revenue officer, is the denial of a clearance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-16\">There was no law then in force to punish the <em>intent </em>to violate the embargo. The \u00e1ct of January 9th, 1809, <em>(vol. 9, \u00b6. 184J </em>first made it penal to lade a vessel with that <em>intent.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-18\">The libel does r . charge the intent to be to export the cargo to any <em>foreign </em>place, which was the evil intended to be guarded against by all those laws. It was not unlawful to transport domestic goods from one district to another in the United States. She had given bond according to the provisions of the act of <em>January 9th, 1808 </em>\u2014 (vol. <em>9, p. 11) </em>not to proceed to any foreign port or place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>. The, 5tlr section of tlie act. of January 9th, 1809, (commonly called the <em>enforcing </em>_&amp;ct) first made the vessel liable to forfeiture for lading without a permit. This is a legislative confession that the. law was not so before. It sanctions our construction of the act of the <em>25th of \u25a0April, </em>180,8.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">2. It appears from the evidence that the vessel was seized within the port, about a mile and an half from the wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">She did not \u00ab <em>depart </em>from\u201d the port, and is therefore not liable to forfeiture iinder the 3d section of the act pf January 9th, 1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">3. Was, the <em>Active </em>engaged in any trade-[other than that for Which she was licensed] within the meaning of the enrolling act?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-9\">By the 32d section of that act, <em>vol.~2, p. </em>193, it is de\u00bb -dared, \u00abthat'if any licensed vessel shall be employed \u00ab iii any other trade than that for which she is licensed, \u00ab such vessel* with her tackle, apparel arid furniture, <em>if </em>arid the cargo found on board her, shall be forfeited.?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\">The object of this provision evidently was to prevent smuggling, and other frauds, upon the revenue. This is evident from various expressions and provisions in other parts of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-11\">Thus^the S3d section provides that if the cargo belong to a person other than the master, owner, or mariners of the vessel so trading, and if the duties on the cargo have been paid or secured according to law, such cargo shall not be forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-12\">' Tin? reason is, that the revenue cannot he defrauded if the duties have been paid. If then this vessel had been laden with foreign goods, and the duties had been paid,, they would not have been forfeited; <em>a fortiori, </em>would they be exempt from forfeiture, being American produce and not liable to any duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-13\">So* in the 4th section of the same act, <em>vol.. </em>2,. <em>p. </em>171, bond is to be given to pay to the United States 1,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>dollars in c\u00e1se it shall appear that the vessel has been employed id any trade, <em>whereby the revenue of the United States has leen -defrauded, </em>during the time the license was in force; and the master is to take an oath that she shall not be employed in any. trade' whereby the revenue may be defrauded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ3\">By the 5th section, it is declared that no license shall be in force for carrying on any Other business or employment than that for which the vessel is specially licensed j and by the 6th section, every vessel' found trading. between district and district, or between different places i\u00bb the same district, without being enrolled and licensed, if laden with goods, <em>the growth or manufacture of the United States only, </em>(distilled spirits excepted) or in ballast, shall pay <em>foreign </em>fees and tonnage, but if she has any articles of foreign growth or manufacture, or distilled spirits, the vessel and cargo shall be forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">\u2022 The license which the sloop <em>Ac\u00f1ve </em>had for the tod fishery not being m force for the coasting trade,' she was found trading between different places in the same district without a license, and therefore was within the 6th <em>section </em>of 'the actj and being laden, only with do-, mestic produce, was only liable to pay foreign fees and' tonnage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">By the 8th sectio\u00f1, if a vessel^ enrolled-and licensed, shall proceed on a foreign voyage, without giving up her enrolment and license, and being registered, such \u2022vessel, and the goods <em>so imported </em>therein, shall be liable to-forfeiture. Under this section the vessel must actually. make the foreign voyage and import goods before she can be forfeited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\">The 12th section authorizes a change of. the master, and requires the new master, or the owner, to make oath that the Vessel shall not, while the license continues in force, be employed in any manner <em>whereby the </em>reve<em>me may be defrauded,</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-10\">By the 21st section, a licensed fishing vessel trading to a foreign port without a license or permit therefor, is only liable to forfeiture. in case she be found within three leagues of the coast with\" foreign goods on board to the value of 500 dollars. Domestic goods found on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>board are not ..Habl\u00e9 to forfeiture.. It c\u00e1nnot. therefore be supposed that the legislature intended to redder, such a vessel liable to forfeiture, for carrying domestic goods* upon which no duties were payable, from one part of a-port to another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-4\">The act of taking on board certain domestic goods and <em>carrying </em>them from ofte part of the port to another is not 3tich a <em>trade </em>as was contemplated in the 3&amp;d section of,the act. Such a construction would be contrary to the spirit of the whole act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">All that can be said is, that she took in 'the goods with intent to <em>trade; </em>hut this is ndt trading. Such. an intent is not punishable.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-6\">Damas, <em>Attorney of the Uniied States for the-District of Pennsylvdnia, and </em>Pinkney, <em>Attorney General of the United States </em>\u2014 for <em>Appellees.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-7\">The parties engaged in this transaction were conscious that it was an unlawful business. This vessel was confined by law to the cod fishery. She could ndt lawfully carry on the coasting trader</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-8\">She was laden in the night, and was towing out of the hai\u2019bor when she was seized. Gates* who claims the cargo, appears to be master for that voyage \u2014 at least he had the use of the vessel, and was on board and there was, no other master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-9\">,1. The first \u00e9nquiry is, whether this vessel is liable to forfeiture und\u00e9r the embargo law,' and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-10\">2. Whether she id liable under the enrolling and licensing act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-11\">1. She departed from a port of the United States without a clearance or permit, contrary to the act of <em>January 9th, 1808 </em>\u2014 vol. <em>9, p. </em>11. G 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-12\">To depart frdm a port, does not mean to go out of the port. She departed from the \u25a0 port when she set sail to leave the port \u2014 when she broke ground. This is the construction always given to. policies, when the insurance is <em>from, </em>(not <em>at </em>and from) a certain port.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u25a02. The protection of the revenue was. not the only object of the prohibition to use the license for another purpose than that for which it was given, it was raaterial to know in what kind of trade, every vessel wa\u00e1 engaged. All the sections which have been cited show that it was the intention of the legislature to prohibit the vessel from engaging in any other employment than that for which she was licensed, although such employment should not in any manner affect the revenue. It is a plain and express prohibition under the penalty of forfeiture of vessel and cargo \u2014 and it is unnecessary to enquire into the motives of the legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">She was engaged in the business of carrying goods from one place to another \u2014 and this was <em>pn </em>employment or trade for which she had no license. She was as much engaged in trade at the inception as she would have been at the consummation of the vbyage. It was not necessary that she should have finished the voyage, or have been engaged in buying and selling.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b121-7\"><em>February </em>26.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-8\">Marshaix, <em>Chief Justice,</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARX\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows :<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The sloop Active, a vessel licensed for the fishing trade, was laden, in the night of the 4th of July in the year 1808, in the port of New London, and was seized by the revenue officer, after having left the wharf without a clearance, under circumstances which justify a belief that she was about to proceed on a foreign voyage in violation' of the acts laying an embargo. , The vessel and cargo were libelled as having been forfeited tinder the laws of, the United States, and were both condemned in the District Court, which sentence was affirmed in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">This sentence is supported on the part of the United States tinder the 3d section of the supplementary act, to the act laying an embargo, and the 32d section of the act for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed in the coasting trade and fisheries.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>This court is of opinion* that however criminal the intentions \u2019of those on bo\u00e1rd the Active might have. been, neither the vessel nor cargo were forfeited under the 3d section- of the \u00ab act supplementary- to the act, en~ an act laying an embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports and harbors of the United States,\u201d because she appears to have been seized in <em>port; </em>and a depar-' ture from port without a clearance was necessary - to consummate the offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The case is undoubtedly 'within the words of the 32(1 section of the enrolling and licensing act. The Active was a licensed vessel employed in a trade' other than that for which she was licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The argument that this act was intended merely to secure the revpnue, and that its provisions do not contemplate a vessel laden .with domestic produce not subject to duty, has been urged..with great force and certainly derives much strength from the various sections of the act which have been quoted. But the words of the 32d section are explicit, and although other preceding sections furnish .much reason for believing that a forfeiture in a case where the revenue could not be defrauded, might not be contemplated by the legislature, yet they are not so expressed as to control the 32d section. . The Active and her cargo, therefore, must be considered as' forfeited, except so far as they come within the 33d section. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">. That section.is in these words&gt; \u201cProvided nevertheless, and be it further enacted, That in all cases \u201c where the whole or any part of the lading, or cargo \u201c on board, any ship or vessel, shall belong, <em>bona Jide, </em>\u201c to any person or persons other than the master, oiVn- \u201c er, or mariners, of such ship or vessel, and upon \u201c which the duties shall have been previously paid or <em>*&lt; </em>secured, according to law, shall he. exempted from \u00ab any forfeiture under this aet, any thing therein con- \u201c tabled to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">In this casefhe libel states^ thaj Billings and-Morgan were owners of the vessel, and a certain \u25a0; Gates owner of the cargo A claim is filed by Billings and Morgan for tiie vessel and part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the cargo, and by. Oates .for the residue of the cargo, ft appears^ then, both fronrthe libel and claim, that a part of the cargo, did \u201c belong, <em>bona fide, </em>to \u00e1 person. other than the master, owner or mariners of the ship ..or vessel.\u201d This part of the cargo comes completely within that part of the description which relates to .the ownership of the property. But the goods on board being liable to no duty, the duties could not. have been previously paid or secured..</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">The court considers this section as manifesting a-clear intention in the legislature to exempt from forfeiture a cargo not belonging to the owner, master or mariners, provided that cargo was not liable to duties. Whether this condition was produced by, a previous payment of duties, or by a perfect exemption from duties, must he immaterial. Duties cannot be paid or secured, according to law, on goods not liable, by law, to duty. The legislature must be understood, when saying <em>\u201c </em>upon which the duties have been previously paid or secured according to law,3\u2019 to mean, <em>\u201c </em>upon which the duties, <em>if any, </em>have been nreyiously paid,\u201d &amp;c. '</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">; It is the opinion of the court, that the sentence of the Circuit Court be <em>reversed </em>as to so much of the cargo of the sloop Active as is claimed as the property of . Oates, and be <em>affirmed </em>as to the vessel ,and the residue of the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">And it is directed to be certified that there was probable cause of seizure.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\"> Judge Todd v/aa-absent in consequence of indisposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
