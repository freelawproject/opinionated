The lower court\u2019s order enforcing the trust\u2019s discriminatory provisions was State action under the United States and New York Constitutions. <em>(Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, </em>407 US 163; <em>Barrows v Jackson, </em>346 US 249; <em>Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1; <em>Adickes v Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 US 144; <em>Griffin v Maryland, </em>378 US 130; <em>United States v Hughes Mem.

The court below was correct in holding that the Surrogate\u2019s enforcement of the gender restriction in the Johnson scholarships was State action. <em>(Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1; <em>United States v Hughes Mem.

II.

III. The court below\u2019s deletion of the gender restriction best furthers the testator\u2019s general intent. <em>(Evans v Abney, </em>316 US 435; <em>Matter of Hawley, </em>32 Misc 2d 624; <em>Matter of Stuart, </em>183 Misc 20; <em>Bradwell v State, </em>16 Wall [83 US] 130; <em>Stanton v Stanton, </em>421 US 7; <em>Orr v Orr, </em>440 US 268; <em>People v Whidden, </em>51 NY2d 457; <em>Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v New York State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>41 NY2d 84; <em>General Elec.

When a court applies trust law that neither encourages, nor affirmatively promotes, nor compels private discrimination but allows parties to engage in private selection in the devise or bequest of their property, that choice will not be attributable to the State and subjected to the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s strictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">_L</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The factual patterns in each of these matters are different, but the underlying legal issues are the same. In each there is imposed a decedent\u2019s intention to create a testamentary trust under which the class of beneficiaries are members of one sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">In Matter of Wilson, article eleventh of Clark W. Wilson\u2019s will provided that the residuary of his estate be held in trust (Wilson Trust) and that the income \u201cbe applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defraying the education and other expenses of the first year at college of five (5) young men who shall have graduated from the Canastota High School, three (3) of whom shall have attained the highest grades in the study of science and two (2) of whom shall have attained the highest grades in the study of chemistry, as may be certified to by the then Superintendent of Schools for the Canastota Central School District.\u201d Wilson died in June, 1969 and for the next 11 years the Wilson Trust was administered according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In early 1981, the Civil Rights Office of the United States Department of Education received a complaint alleging that the superintendent\u2019s acts in connection with the Wilson Trust violated title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (US Code, tit 20, \u00a7 1681 <em>et seq.), </em>which prohibits gender discrimination in Federally financed education programs. The Department of Education informed the Canastota Central School District that the complaint would be investigated. Before the investigation was completed, the school district agreed to refrain from again providing names of students to the trustee. The trustee, Key Bank of Central New York, initiated this proceeding for a determination of the effect and validity of the trust provision of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Surrogate\u2019s Court held that the school superintendent\u2019s co-operation with the trustee violated no Federal statute or regulation prohibiting sexual discrimination, nor did it implicate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court ordered the trustee to continue administering the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">A unanimous Appellate Division, Third Department, modified the Surrogate\u2019s decree. The court affirmed the Surrogate\u2019s finding that the testator intended the trust to benefit male students only and, noting that the school was under no legal obligation to provide the names of qualified male candidates, found \u201cadministration of the trust according to its literal terms is impossible.\u201d (87 AD2d, p 101.) The court then exercised its cy pres power to reform the trust by striking the clause in the will providing for the school superintendent\u2019s certification of the names of qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>candidates for the scholarships. The candidates were permitted to apply directly to the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Matter of Johnson also involves a call for judicial construction of a testamentary trust created for the exclusive benefit of male students. By a will dated December 13, 1975, Edwin Irving Johnson left his residuary estate in trust (Johnson Trust). Article sixth of the will provided that the income of the trust was to \u201cbe used and applied, each year to the extent available, for scholarships or grants for bright and deserving young men who have graduated from the High School of [the Croton-Harmon Union Free] School District, and whose parents are financially unable to send them to college, and who shall be selected by the Board of Education of such School District with the assistance of the Principal of such High School.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Johnson died in 1978. In accordance with the terms of the trust, the board of education, acting as trustee, announced that applications from male students would be accepted on or before May 1,1979. Before any scholarships were awarded, however, the National Organization for Women, filed a complaint with the Civil Rights Office of the United States Department of Education. This complaint alleged that the school district\u2019s involvement in the Johnson Trust constituted illegal gender-based discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">During the pendency of the Department of Education\u2019s investigation, a stipulation was entered into between the executrix of the will, the president of the board of education, and the Attorney-General. The parties sought \u201cto avoid administering the educational bequest set forth in Article Sixth in a manner which is in conflict with the law and public policy prohibiting discrimination based on sex\u201d. The stipulation provided that \u201call interested parties agree to the deletion of the word \u2018men\u2019 in Article Sixth of the Will and the insertion of the word \u2018persons\u2019 in its place.\u201d The Attorney-General then brought this proceeding by petition to the Surrogate\u2019s Court to construe article sixth of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The Surrogate found that the trustee\u2019s unwillingness to administer the trust according to its terms rendered ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ministration of the trust impossible. The court, however, declined to reform the trust by giving effect to the stipulation. Rather, it reasoned that the testator\u2019s primary intent to benefit \u201cdeserving young men\u201d would be most closely effected by replacing the school district with a private trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">A divided Appellate Division, Second Department, reversed, holding that under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a court cannot reform a trust that, by its own terms, would deny equal protection of law. The court reasoned that inasmuch as an agent of the State had been appointed trustee, the trust, if administered, would violate the equal protection clause. Judicial reformation of the trust by substituting trustees would, in that court\u2019s view, itself constitute State action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court determined that administration of the trust was impossible and, in an exercise of its cy pres power, reformed the trust by eliminating the gender restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">JL</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On these appeals, this court is called upon to consider the testators\u2019 intent in establishing these trusts, evaluate the public policy implications of gender restrictive trusts generally, and determine whether the judicial reformation of these trusts violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">There can be no question that these trusts, established for the promotion of education, are for a charitable purpose within the meaning of the law (see EPTL 8-1.1; see, also, <em>Russell v Allen, </em>107 US <em>163, 172; Butterworth v Keeler, </em>219 NY 446; see, generally, Bogert, Trusts and Trustees [rev 2d ed], \u00a7 375; 4 Scott, Trusts [3d ed], \u00a7 370). Charitable trusts are encouraged and favored by the law (see Bogert, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 361), and may serve any of a variety of benevolent purposes (see EPTL 8-1.1). Among the advantages the law extends to charitable trusts are their exemption from the rules against perpetuities (see EPTL 9-1.1; <em>Matter of MacDowell, </em>217 NY 454) and accumulations (EPTL 8-1.7) and their favorable tax treatment (see Bogert, Trusts and Trustees [rev 2d ed], \u00a7 264.25; 9B Rohan, NY Civ Prac, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>pars 8-1.7[3] \u2014 8-1.7[6]). Moreover, unlike other trusts, a charitable trust will not necessarily fail when the settlor\u2019s specific charitable purpose or direction can no longer be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">When a court determines that changed circumstances have rendered the administration of a charitable trust according to its literal terms either \u201cimpracticable or impossible\u201d, the court may exercise its cy pres power to reform the trust in a matter that \u201cwill most effectively accomplish its general purposes\u201d (EPTL 8-1.1, subd [c]). In reforming trusts pursuant to this power, care must be taken to evaluate the precise purpose or direction of the testator, so that when the court directs the trust towards another charitable end, it will \u201cgive effect insofar as practicable to the full design of the testator as manifested by his will and codicil\u201d <em>(Matter of Scott, </em>8 NY2d 419, 427; see Bogert, Trusts and Trustees [rev 2d ed], \u00a7 442).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The court, of course, cannot invoke its cy pres power without first determining that the testator\u2019s specific charitable purpose is no longer capable of being performed by the trust (see, e.g., <em>Matter of Scott, supra; Matter of Swan, </em>237 App Div 454, affd <em>sub nom. Matter of St. Johns Church of Mt. Morris, </em>263 NY 638; <em>Matter of Fairchild, </em>15 Misc 2d 272). In establishing these trusts, the testators expressly and unequivocally intended that they provide for the educational expenses of male students. It cannot be said that the accomplishment of the testators\u2019 specific expression of charitable intent is \u201cimpossible or impracticable.\u201d So long as the subject high schools graduate boys with the requisite qualifications, the testators\u2019 specific charitable intent can be fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Nor are the trusts\u2019 particular limitation of beneficiaries by gender invalid and incapable of being accomplished as violative of public policy. It is true that the eradication in this State of gender-based discrimination is an important public policy. Indeed, the Legislature has barred gender-based discrimination in education (see Education Law, \u00a7 3201-a), employment (see Labor Law, \u00a7\u00a7 194, 197, 220-e; General Business Law, \u00a7 187), housing, credit, and many other areas (see Executive Law, \u00a7 296). As a result, women, once viewed as able to assume only restricted roles in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>society (see <em>Bradwell v State, </em>16 Wall [83 US] 130, 141), now project significant numbers \u201cin business, in the professions, in government and, indeed, in all walks of life where education is a desirable, if not-always a necessary, antecedent\u201d <em>(Stanton v Stanton, </em>421 US 7, 15). The restrictions in these trusts run contrary to this policy favoring equal opportunity and treatment of men and women. A provision in a charitable trust, however, that is central to the testator\u2019s or settlor\u2019s charitable purpose, and is not illegal, should not be invalidated on public policy grounds unless that provision, if given effect, would substantially mitigate the general charitable effect of the gift (see 4 Scott, Trusts [3d ed], \u00a7 399.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Proscribing the enforcement of gender restrictions in private charitable trusts would operate with equal force towards trusts whose benefits are bestowed exclusively on women. \u201cReduction of the disparity in economic condition between men and women caused by the long history of discrimination against women has been recognized as * * * an important governmental objective\u201d <em>(Califano v Webster, </em>430 US 313, 317). There can be little doubt that important efforts in effecting this type of social change can be and are performed through private philanthropy (see, generally, Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs, Giving in America: Toward a Stronger Voluntary Section [1975]). And, the private funding of programs for the advancement of women is substantial and growing (see Bernstein, Funding for Women\u2019s Higher Education: Looking Backward and Ahead, Grant Magazine, vol 4, No. 4, pp 225-229; Ford Foundation, Financial Support of Women\u2019s Programs in the 1970\u2019s [1979]; Yarrow, Feminist Philanthropy Comes Into Its Own, <em>NY Times, </em>May 21, 1983, p 7, col 2). Indeed, one compilation of financial assistance offered primarily or exclusively to women lists 854 sources of funding (see Schlacter, Directory of Financial Aids for Women [2d ed, 1981]; see, also, Note, Sex Restricted Scholarships and the Charitable Trust, 59 Iowa L Rev 1000, 1000-1001, &amp; nn 10, 11). Current thinking in private philanthropic institutions advocates that funding offered by such institutions and the opportunities within the institutions themselves be directly responsive to the needs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>particular groups (see Ford Foundation, <em>op cit., </em>at pp 41-44; Fleming, Foundations and Affirmative Action, 4 Foundation News No. 4, at pp 14-17; Griffen, Funding for Women\u2019s Programs, 6 Grantsmanship Center News, No. 2, at pp 34-45). It is evident, therefore, that the focusing of private philanthropy on certain classes within society may be consistent with public policy. Consequently, that the restrictions in the trusts before this court may run contrary to public efforts promoting equality of opportunity for women does not justify imposing a per se rule that gender restrictions in private charitable trusts violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Finally, this is not an instance in which the restriction of the trusts serves to frustrate a paramount charitable purpose. In <em>Howard Sav. Inst. v Peep </em>(34 NJ 494), for example, the testator made a charitable bequest to Amherst College to be placed in trust and to provide scholarships for \u201cdeserving American born, Protestant, Gentile boys of good moral repute, not given to gambling, smoking, drinking or similar acts.\u201d Due to the religious restrictions, the college declined to accept the bequest as contrary to its charter. The court found that the college was the principal beneficiary of the trust, so that removing the religious restriction and thereby allowing the college to accept the gift would permit administration of the trust in a manner most closely effectuating the testator\u2019s intent (see, also, <em>Matter of Hawley, </em>32 Misc 2d 624; <em>Coffee v Rice Univ., </em>408 SW2d 269 [Tex]).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In contrast, the trusts subject to these appeals were not intended to directly benefit the school districts. Although the testators sought the school districts\u2019 participation, this was incidental to their primary intent of financing part of the college education of boys who attended the schools. Consequently, severance of the school districts\u2019 role in the trusts\u2019 administration will not frustrate any part of the testators\u2019 charitable purposes. Inasmuch as the specific charitable intent of the testators is not inherently \u201cimpossible or impracticable\u201d of being achieved by the trusts, there is no occasion to exercise cy pres power.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Although not inherently so, these trusts are currently incapable of being administered as originally intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>because of the school districts\u2019 unwillingness to co-operate. These impediments, however, may be remedied by an exercise of a court\u2019s general equitable power over all trusts to permit a deviation from the administrative terms of a trust and to appoint a successor trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A testamentary trust will not fail for want of a trustee (see EPTL 8-1.1; see, also, <em>Matter of Thomas, </em>254 NY 292) and, in the event a trustee is unwilling or unable to act, a court may replace the trustee with another (see EPTL 7-2.6; SCPA 1502; see, also, <em>Matter of Andrews, </em>233 App Div 547; 2 Scott, Trusts [3d ed], \u00a7 108.1). Accordingly, the proper means of continuing the Johnson Trust would be to replace the school district with someone able and willing to administer the trust according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">When an impasse is reached in the administration of a trust due to an incidental requirement of its terms, a court may effect, or permit the trustee to effect, a deviation from the trust\u2019s literal terms (see 9A Rohan, NY Civ Prac, pars 7-2.4[3] \u2014 7-2.4[4]). This power differs from a court\u2019s cy pres power in that \u201c[tihrough exercise of its deviation power the court alters or amends administrative provisions in the trust instrument but does not alter the purpose of the charitable trust, or change its dispositive provisions\u201d (Bogert, Trusts and Trustees [rev 2d ed], \u00a7 394, p 249; see, e.g., <em>Trustees of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor v Carmody, </em>211 NY 286; <em>Matter of Bruen, </em>83 NYS2d 197; <em>Matter of Godfrey, </em>36 NYS2d 414, affd no opn 264 App Div 885). The Wilson Trust provision that the school district certify a list of students is an incidental part of the trust\u2019s administrative requirements, which no longer can be satisfied in light of the district\u2019s refusal to co-operate. The same result intended by the testator may be accomplished by permitting the students to apply directly to the trustee. Therefore, a deviation from the Wilson Trust\u2019s administrative terms by eliminating the certification requirement would be the appropriate method of continuing that trust\u2019s administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">It is argued before this court that the judicial facilitation of the continued administration of gender-restrictive char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>itable trusts violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (see US Const, 14th Amdt, \u00a7 1). The strictures of the equal protection clause are invoked when the State engages in invidious discrimination (see <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, </em>407 US 163, 173, 176-177; <em>Burton v Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 US 715, 721; <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 US 3). Indeed, the State itself cannot, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, award scholarships that are gender restrictive (see <em>Mississippi Univ. for Women v Hogan, </em>458 US 718; <em>Kirchberg v Feenstra, </em>450 US 455; <em>Stanton v Stanton, </em>421 US 7, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment, however, \u201cerects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.\u201d <em>(Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1, 13; see <em>Blum v Yaretski, </em>457 US 991, 1002; <em>Jackson v Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 US 345, 349; <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, </em>407 US 163, 171-179, <em>supra; Evans v Abney, </em>396 US 435, 445). Private discrimination may violate equal protection of the law when accompanied by State participation in, facilitation of, and, in some cases, acquiescence in the discrimination (see, e.g., <em>Burton v Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 US 715, <em>supra; Reitman v Mulkey, </em>387 US 369; <em>Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1, <em>supra). </em>Although there is no conclusive test to determine when State involvement in private discrimination will violate the Fourteenth Amendment (see <em>Reitman v Mulkey, supra, </em>at p 378), the general standard that has evolved is whether \u201cthe conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right [is] fairly attributable to the state\u201d <em>(Lugar v Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 US 922, 937). Therefore, it is a question of \u201cstate responsibility\u201d and \u201c[o]nly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the * * * involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance\u201d <em>(Burton v Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 US 715, 722, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The Supreme Court has identified various situations in which the State may be deemed responsible for discriminatory conduct with private origins. For example, one such instance appears when the State delegates one of its inherent functions to private parties and those parties engage in discrimination (see <em>Lloyd Corp. v Tanner, </em>407 US 551; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Food Employees v Logan Plaza, </em>391 US 308; <em>Evans v Newton, </em>382 US 296; <em>Terry v Adams, </em>345 US 461; <em>Marsh v Alabama, </em>326 US 501). Another arises when the State does not directly enforce or abet the private discrimination, but substantially facilitates and profits from it <em>(Burton v Wilmington Parking Auth., </em>365 US 715, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u201cThe Court has never held, of course, that discrimination by an otherwise private entity would be violative of the Equal Protection Clause if the private entity receives any sort of benefit or service at all from the State, or if it is subject to State regulation in any degree whatever\u201d <em>(Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, </em>407 US 163, 173, <em>supra). </em>Rather, \u201cthe State must have \u2018significantly involved itself with invidious discriminations\u2019 * * * in order for the discriminatory action to fall within the ambit of the constitutional prohibition\u201d <em>(id.; </em>see, also, <em>Rendell-Baker v Kohn, </em>457 US 830; <em>Gilmore v City of Montgomery, </em>417 US 556).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The State generally may not be held responsible for private discrimination solely on the basis that it permits the discrimination to occur (see <em>Flagg Bros. v Brooks, </em>436 US 149, 164; <em>Jackson v Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 US 345, 357, <em>supra; Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, </em>407 US 163, 176, <em>supra; Evans v Abney, </em>396 US 435, <em>supra). </em>Nor is the State under an affirmative obligation to prevent purely private discrimination (see <em>Reitman v Mulkey, </em>387 US 369, 376, 377, <em>supra). </em>Therefore, when the State regulates private dealings it may be responsible for private discrimination occurring in the regulated field only when enforcement of its regulation has the effect of compelling the private discrimination (see <em>Flagg Bros. v Brooks, supra; Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, supra; Shelley v Kraemer, </em>334 US 1, <em>supra; </em>cf. <em>Adickes v Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 US 144, 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In <em>Shelley v Kraemer (supra), </em>for example, the Supreme Court held that the equal protection clause was violated by judicial enforcement of a private covenant that prohibited the sale of affected properties to \u201cpeople of Negro or Mongolian Race.\u201d When one of the properties was sold to a black family, the other property owners sought to enforce the covenant in State court and the family was ordered to move from the property. The Supreme Court noted \u201cthat the restrictive agreements standing alone cannot be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>garded as violative of any rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the purposes of those agreements are effectuated by voluntary adherence to their terms, it would appear clear that there has been no action by the State and the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated\u201d (334 US, at p 13). The court held, however, that it did have before it cases \u201cin which the States have merely abstained from action leaving private individuals free to impose such discriminations as they see fit. Rather, these are cases in which the States have made available to such individuals the full coercive power of the government to deny petitioners, on the grounds of race or color, the enjoyment of property rights\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 19). It was not the neutral regulation of contracts permitting parties to enter discriminatory agreements that caused the discrimination to be attributable to the State. Instead, it was that the State court\u2019s exercise of its judicial power directly effected a discriminatory act.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In <em>Barrows v Jackson, </em>(346 US 249, <em>supra), </em>the court applied the same reasoning when it held that a court\u2019s awarding damages against a party who has breached a racially restrictive covenant also violates the equal protection clause. The court reiterated that \u201cvoluntary adherence [to the covenant] would constitute individual action only\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 253). But, \u201c[t]o compel respondent to respond in damages would be for the State to punish her for failure to perform her covenant to continue to discriminate against non-Caucasians in the use of her property * * * Thus, it becomes not respondent\u2019s voluntary choice but the State\u2019s choice that she observe her covenant or suffer damages\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 254).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">More recently, the Supreme Court considered whether a State\u2019s regulation of private clubs licensed to serve liquor caused a club\u2019s restrictive membership policy to be attributable to the State (see <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 v Irvis, </em>407 US 163, <em>supra). </em>The court held that although the State extensively regulated these private clubs, it was not responsible for the private discrimination simply because the regulation permitted the discrimination to occur. The court stated that \u201c[hjowever detailed this type of regulation may be in some particulars, it cannot be said to in any way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>foster or encourage * * * discrimination\u201d (407 US, at pp 176-177). The court distinguished the regulatory scheme\u2019s general neutral effect on the discrimination from a situation in which that scheme could be used to compel discrimination. One of the regulations provided that \u201c \u2018[e]very club licensee shall adhere to all of the provisions of its Constitution and By-Laws\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at p 177). The court acknowledged that if this regulation were used (at p 178) \u201cto place state sanctions behind [the licensee\u2019s] discriminatory membership rules,\u201d the Fourteenth Amendment would be implicated. Accordingly, the court enjoined enforcement of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">A court\u2019s application of its equitable power to permit the continued administration of the trusts involved in these appeals falls outside the ambit of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the field of trusts is regulated by the State, the Legislature\u2019s failure to forbid private discriminatory trusts does not cause such trusts, when they arise, to be attributable to the State <em>(see Flagg Bros. v Brooks, </em>436 US 149, 165, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>Evans v Abney, </em>396 US 435, 458 [Brennan, J., dissenting], <em>supra). </em>It naturally follows that, when a court applies this trust law and determines that it permits the continued existence of private discriminatory trusts, the Fourteenth Amendment is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In the present appeals, the coercive power of the State has never been enlisted to enforce private discrimination. Upon finding that requisite formalities of creating a trust had been met, the courts below determined the testator\u2019s intent, and applied the relevant law permitting those intentions to be privately carried out. The court\u2019s power compelled no discrimination. That discrimination had been sealed in the private execution of the wills. Recourse to the courts was had here only for the purpose of facilitating the administration of the trusts, not for enforcement of their discriminatory dispositive provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">This is not to say that a court\u2019s exercise of its power over trusts can never invoke the scrutiny of the Fourteenth Amendment. This court holds only that a trust\u2019s discriminatory terms are not fairly attributable to the State when a court applies trust principles that permit private discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>nation but do not encourage, affirmatively promote, or compel it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The testators\u2019 intention to involve the State in the administration of these trusts does not alter this result, notwithstanding that the effect of the courts\u2019 action respecting the trusts was to eliminate this involvement. The courts\u2019 power to replace a trustee who is unwilling to act as in Johnson or to permit a deviation from an incidental administrative term in the trust as in Wilson is a part of the law permitting this private conduct and extends to all trusts regardless of their purposes. It compels no discrimination. Moreover, the minimal State participation in the trusts\u2019 administration prior to the time that they reached the courts for the constructions under review did not cause the trusts to take on an indelible public character (see <em>Evans v Newton, </em>382 US 296, 301; <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v Brown, </em>392 F2d 120).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In sum, the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the State to exercise the full extent of its power to eradicate private discrimination. It is only when the State itself discriminates, compels another to discriminate, or allows another to assume one of its functions and discriminate that such discrimination will implicate the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Accordingly, in Matter of Wilson, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs payable out of the estate to all parties appearing separately and filing separate briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In Matter of Johnson, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs payable out of the estate to all parties appearing separately and filing separate briefs and the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, Westchester County, reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b524-8\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcE\">(concurring in Matter of Wilson and dissenting in Matter of Johnson). I would affirm in both cases. Although the Constitution does not proscribe private bias, it does proscribe affirmative State action in furtherance of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In Matter of Wilson the trust is private and the only involvement of a public official (the superintendent of schools) is his certification of a student\u2019s class standing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>information which is, in any event, available to any student applying to the trustee for a scholarship. There is, therefore, no State action.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In Matter of Johnson, however, the trustee is the board of education, a public body. The establishment of a public trust for a discriminatory purpose is constitutionally improper, as Presiding Justice Mollen has fully spelled out in his opinion. For the State to legitimize that impropriety by replacement of the trustee is unconstitutional State action. The only permissible corrective court action is, as the Appellate Division held, excision of the discriminatory limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In <em>Matter of Wilson:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer and Simons concur with Chief Judge Cooke; Judge Meyer concurs in a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">In <em>Matter of Johnson:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Simons concur with Chief Judge Cooke; Judge Meyer dissents and votes to affirm in a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
