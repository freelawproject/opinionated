The facts support liability of defendant owners, Edwards and Latham, to all plaintiffs under the Multiple Dwelling Law. <em>(Weiner v Leroco Realty Corp., </em>279 NY 127; <em>Tkach v Montefiore Hosp. for Chronic Diseases, </em>264 App Div 135, 289 NY 387; <em>Robinson v Shapiro, </em>484 F Supp 91; <em>Hollman v Kayell Realty Co., </em>120 Misc 546; <em>Sticker v Seril Realty Corp., </em>256 NY 687; <em>Al's 334 9th Ave. Corp. v Herbener, </em>275 App Div 904.) II. Apart from statute, defendants Edwards and Latham, as owners, had a common-law duty of maintenance because of the reservation in the lease of the right to enter, inspect and repair the premises. <em>(Antonsen v Bay Ridge Sav. Bank, </em>292 NY 143; <em>Noble v Marx, </em>298 NY 106; <em>Reische v Montgomery, </em>273 App Div 824; <em>Abrams v Manhattan Dial Mfg.

III. Appellant City of New York was clearly negligent in the performance of the duties of its building department; no unreasonable burden would be imposed by requiring due care in the facts of this case; the decisions denying duty are inapplicable to these facts. <em>(Smullen v City of New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>York, </em>28 NY2d 66; <em>Schuster v City of New York, </em>5 NY2d 75; <em>Gannon Personnel Agency v City of New York, </em>103 Misc 2d 60, 81 AD2d 755.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-5\"><em>Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr., Corporation Counsel (Stephen J. McGrath </em>and <em>Leonard Koerner </em>of counsel), for City of New York, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axq\">I. As this court held in <em>O\u2019Connor v City of New York </em>(58 NY2d 184), a municipality may not be cast in liability for breach of a general statutory duty. As th\u00e9 city did not have a special relationship with any party to this action, all claims against it must be dismissed. <em>(Gannon Personnel Agency v City of New York, </em>81 AD2d 755, revd <em>sub nom.

II. Should this court determine that the city may be held liable to plaintiffs, the trial court\u2019s award of indemnification to the city against defendant owners Edwards and Latham, which was affirmed by the court below, should not be disturbed. <em>(Mazelis v Wallerstein, 51 </em>AD2d 579; <em>McDermott v City of New York, </em>50 NY2d 211; <em>Runkel v Homelsky, </em>286 App Div 1101, 3 NY2d 857; <em>Dole v Dow Chem.

Corp., </em>1 AD2d 398; <em>D\u2019Ambrosio v City of New York, 55 </em>NY2d 454.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b280-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">This case arose out of the collapse of a portion of the Broadway Central Hotel building in lower Manhattan on August 3, 1973. Four persons were killed, many others were injured, and a number of businesses suffered extensive property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Forty-three actions to recover for wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage were consolidated. After a nonjury trial, Supreme Court held that the owners of the building were 25% liable, the net lessee was 45% liable, and the City of New York was 30% liable. The city was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>held to be entitled to indemnification by the owners, and its liability for property damage limited to the value of the property that could have been removed from the building had the city taken prompt action. The court found the city liable because of its department of buildings\u2019 failure to ensure that the building\u2019s dangerous condition was remedied before it collapsed. The Appellate Division modified by granting the city judgment on its indemnification cross claim against the net lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The city should not have been held liable. As this court recently reaffirmed, \u201cit has long been the rule in this State that, in the absence of some special relationship creating a duty to exercise care for the benefi t of particular individuals, liability may not be imposed on a municipality for failure to enforce a statute or regulation\u201d <em>(O\u2019Connor v City of New York, </em>58 NY2d 184, 192). Here the city building department failed to enforce provisions of the city\u2019s Administrative Code relating to building safety, even though its employees knew of the dangerous structural conditions in the building. These regulations were designed to protect the general public, however, and no special relationship has been shown that would establish a municipal duty to the instant plaintiffs in particular. Thus, the complaints should be dismissed as against the City of New York, and apportionment of liability among the remaining defendants redetermined accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Appellants Latham and Edwards, the building\u2019s owners, assert that it was also error to impose liability against them. They argue that violation of section 78 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, which requires an owner of a multiple dwelling to keep its building in good repair, cannot form the basis for liability to commercial tenants in the building. It is not disputed that the building, which contained residential units, was a multiple dwelling.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Section 78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>places on the owner the duty to see that \u201c[ejvery multiple dwelling, including its roof or roofs, and every part thereof and the lot upon which it is situated, shall be kept in good repair.\u201d The defect in this case involved a structural problem \u2014 an ever-widening crack in a major weight-bearing wall \u2014 that was central to the entire building. Likewise, the resulting collapse obviously affected the structure as a whole. The dangerous condition had a direct and unquestionable \u201crelation to the maintenance of the building as a tenantable habitation\u201d <em>(Altz v Leiberson, </em>233 NY 16, 18). In such a case, the owner\u2019s duty to repair the defect is not affected by the use for commercial purposes of portions of the structurally unsafe building (see <em>Sticker v Seril Realty Corp., </em>256 NY 687).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Although an owner will not be held liable under section 78 where it has completely parted with possession and control of the building, the owners here reserved the right under the terms of the net lease to enter for inspection and repairs. This reservation constituted a sufficient retention of control to subject the owners to liability (see <em>Tkach v Montefiore Hosp. for Chronic Diseases, </em>289 NY 387, 390; <em>Weiner v Leroco Realty Corp., </em>279 NY 127, 130; <em>Appel v Muller, </em>262 NY 278, 283-284). In addition, there was an affirmed finding below that the owners had both constructive notice of the long-standing defect and, through their agent, the husband of one of the owners, actual notice of the dangerous condition. There was, therefore, a sufficient basis for the trial court\u2019s finding of liability against the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to the City of New York against plaintiffs, and the case remitted to Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs to plaintiffs against appellants Latham and Edwards. The question certified is answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Meyer and Simons concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> Subdivision 4 of section 4 of the Multiple Dwelling Law defines a \u201cdwelling\u201d as \u201cany building or structure or portion thereof which is occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence or sleeping place of one or more human beings.\u201d Subdivision 7 of section 4 defines a \u201cmultiple dwelling\u201d, in relevant part, as follows: \u201ca dwelling which is either rented, leased, let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied as the residence or home of three or more families living independently of each other * * * A \u2018multiple dwelling\u2019 shall not be deemed to include a hospital, convent, monastery, asylum or public institution, or a fireproof <em>building used wholly for commercial purposes except for not more than one janitor\u2019s apartment and not more than one penthouse occupied by not more than two families\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
