He asserts that on the jury trial he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and that a stipulation designed to keep secret a transcript revealing defendant\u2019s participation in other crimes was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">On November 24, 1976, at approximately 3:00 p.m., Robert Hedderman and Margaret Byron were murdered while working at the Hedderman Religious Shop located at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>50 Columbia Street in Albany. The murderer slit both victims\u2019 throats after stabbing them several times in the chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">During the course of the intensive investigation which followed these murders, the defendant was questioned and released. Upon further investigation, however, evidence came to light implicating defendant. Mr. William Weber told the police that he saxy a \u201cwild-eyed\u201d black male approximately six feet tall in Hedderman\u2019s store on November 24, 1976, standing near the body of Margaret Byron. Later, after being shown a lineup photograph, Mr. Weber identified defendant as that man. Maureen Toomey informed the police that she observed a black man leaving the Hedderman Religious Shop at approximately the time of the slayings. In September, 1977, she was taken to police headquarters where she was shown a lineup photograph containing pictures of six men and asked whether she recognized the man she saw leaving the Hedderman store that day. She pointed to defendant\u2019s photo. Also in September, 1977, Lieutenant Murray of the Albany Police Department, while conducting an authorized search of a building where defendant had been employed, discovered one of defendant\u2019s sweaters in a closet. A hair found on the sweater was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington for testing. The FBI report indicated that the hair found on defendant\u2019s clothing was that of the deceased, Margaret Byron.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Meanwhile, defendant had been indicted by a Schenectady County Grand Jury for the kidnapping and attempted robbery of Marlene Maggio. Defendant had been arrested several hours after the abduction while still holding the victim. In September, 1977, he retained counsel to represent him on the Schenectady County charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Thereupon, his counsel met with the District Attorneys of Schenectady, Albany and Saratoga Counties in an attempt to negotiate a plea bargain concerning crimes defendant had allegedly committed in all three jurisdictions, including the Hedderman-Byron homicides for which defendant had not yet been indicted. The attorney\u2019s proposal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>that defendant receive concurrent sentences of 25 years to life in satisfaction of all charges was rejected. At the same meeting, it was agreed that the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office would assume responsibility for the cost of continuing psychiatric assistance which defendant could not afford but which defense counsel had arranged for defendant through the Schenectady County District Attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">After defendant indicated to his psychiatrist, Dr. Camperlengo, and a psychiatric social worker, Diane Kassel, that he was willing to speak to the police, a meeting was arranged for March 5, 1978. Defense counsel agreed to allow defendant to be questioned at that meeting, providing that certain conditions were met. Pursuant to defense counsel\u2019s demands, a stipulation was entered into whereby all persons present at the meeting, except defendant and his attorney, were to be considered agents of the Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s office and all statements made thereat were to be kept secret. No disclosure was permitted without the defendant\u2019s and his counsel\u2019s written consent. The stipulation did allow the Albany County District Attorney, who was not notified of the meeting and did not appear, to be informed of the general substance of defendant\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">At the meeting, defendant admitted committing several murders, including those at the Hedderman Religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Shop in Albany. The following day, defense counsel and Schenectady County Assistant District Attorney Carey notified Albany County District Attorney Greenberg of the meeting and the fact that defendant had made incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">A nonjury trial was held in Schenectady County Court in July, 1978. While preparing for that trial, defense counsel, who decided to assert an insanity defense on defendant\u2019s behalf, gave the transcript of the March 5 meeting to Dr. Zvi Klopott, a psychiatrist he planned to use as a defense witness. At the trial, Dr. Klopott testified that the defendant was suffering from a delusion that his deceased brother John lived within him and was responsible for the crimes that defendant had committed. He also testified that, according to the transcript furnished by defense counsel of the March 5 meeting, defendant admitted killing both Robert Hedderman and Margaret Byron in Albany.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial concluded on July 21, 1978, and the defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">On July 27, 1978, an Albany County Grand Jury indicted defendant for the murders of Robert Hedderman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Margaret Byron, and in October, 1978 the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office subpoenaed the transcript and tapes of the March 5, 1978 meeting. At a suppression hearing held prior to his Albany County murder trial, defendant unsuccessfully attempted to suppress the transcript and tapes, Maureen Toomey\u2019s identification of defendant and the hair found on defendant\u2019s clothing. The case then proceeded to trial where defendant\u2019s attorney again presented the insanity defense. The defense failed and defendant was convicted and sentenced to consecutive sentences of 25 years to life for each murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">On this appeal, defendant contends that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, that the trial court erred in its <em>Sandoval </em>ruling, that unqualified opinion testimony was improperly admitted into evidence and that the statements he made at the March 5 meeting were not given voluntarily and should, therefore, have been suppressed. In asserting this last contention, defendant raises a number of overlapping issues involving allegations that the Albany County District Attorney was bound by the March 5 stipulation, that the Schenectady County District Attorney violated the terms of that stipulation, that defendant\u2019s statements were not the product of a rational intellect and free will and that defendant inadvertently waived his right against self incrimination due to the ineffective assistance of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Preliminarily, we note that the record supports the factual determination by the courts below that defendant\u2019s statements were given freely and voluntarily and not as a result of improper police inducement. That issue, therefore, is beyond this court\u2019s scope of review. <em>(People v Taylor, </em>57 NY2d 729; cf. <em>People v Harrison, </em>57 NY2d 470.) Furthermore, with respect to defendant\u2019s claim of mental incompetence to make the statements, defendant was found to be mentally competent at both his Schenectady and Albany County trials. The affirmance of those factual determinations, which are supported by the record, similarly precludes review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the Schenectady County District Attorney breached the terms of the March 5 stipulation is wholly without merit. Pursuant to the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>stipulation, Assistant District Attorney Carey promised not to disclose the details of defendant\u2019s statements without the written consent of both defendant and his attorney. Carey scrupulously honored his promise. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s office did not improperly allow Albany County District Attorney Greenberg to obtain a copy of defendant\u2019s March 5 statements. The transcript was lawfully <em>subpoenaed </em>by District Attorney Greenberg and only <em>after defendant allowed certain of its contents to be publicly disclosed </em>by Dr. Klopott during his testimony at defendant\u2019s prior Schenectady County trial. By permitting Dr. Klopott to disclose the details of those admissions, as he necessarily had to in order to support defendant\u2019s insanity defense, the defendant not only waived his physician-patient privilege <em>(People v Edney, </em>39 NY2d 620; <em>People v Al-Kanani, </em>33 NY2d 260), but also made that information a matter of public record. Defendant cannot be heard to claim, therefore, that the Schenectady County District Attorney breached the agreement to keep defendant\u2019s incriminating statements secret. There is not a shred of evidence to indicate that the Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s office disclosed any of the details of the March 5 meeting to law enforcement officials, prosecutorial agencies or the public prior to the transcript of that meeting being subpoenaed by the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The defendant argues alternatively that the Albany County District Attorney was bound by the March 5 stipulation and, thus, should not have been allowed to use defendant\u2019s admissions against him at the HeddermanByron murder trial. In support of this argument, defendant contends that Diane Kassel, the psychiatric social worker who was present at the March 5 meeting and was a party to the stipulation, was an agent of the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office and, therefore, bound that agency to abide by the stipulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While it is true that when asked by the Schenectady County District Attorney to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>financial responsibility for defendant\u2019s continuing psychiatric care, including Dr. Camperlengo\u2019s and Diane Kassel\u2019s salaries, the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office agreed, this alone is insufficient to create an agency relationship. To the contrary, a review of the record in this case makes it abundantly clear that no such relationship existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">It is undisputed that District Attorney Greenberg was never informed that the March 5 meeting was to take place. Defendant\u2019s attorney testified that he specifically intended to exclude the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office from the meeting because of some undefined antipathy he had towards Albany County Assistant District Attorney Daniel Dwyer. Furthermore, Diane Kassel testified that it was defendant\u2019s attorney that directed her to work under the supervision of Dr. Camperlengo and Dr. Camperlengo testified that Kassel was brought into the case by defendant\u2019s attorney. Also noteworthy is the testimony of Assistant District Attorney Carey that when he notified District Attorney Greenberg on March 6 that the meeting had taken place and that he could not reveal the details thereof, Greenberg became upset and would not consent to the stipulation. Finally, District Attorney Greenberg testified that Diane Kassel appeared at the meeting as a representative of defendant\u2019s attorney. In light of this undisputed testimony and the explicit classification of Diane Kassel as an agent of the Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s office in the stipulation entered into pursuant to defense counsel\u2019s demand, there can be little doubt that Diane Kassel was not acting as an agent of the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office and, therefore, had no authority, actual or apparent, to bind that office in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Turning then to defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, we must consider the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the representation in order to evaluate the quality of the representation afforded the defendant. In doing so, it is important to avoid confusing mere losing tactics with truly ineffective representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and to avoid attributing undue significance to retrospective analysis. The constitutional requirement of effective assistance of counsel will be met where \u201cthe evidence, the law, and the circumstances of a particular case, viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation, reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation\u201d. <em>(People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Applying this standard of review, we conclude that defendant was accorded effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Defendant was a predicate felon facing the serious charges of kidnapping and robbery in a case where the prosecution\u2019s * proof was overwhelming. Indeed, defendant was apprehended while still holding his victim. As a predicate felon, defendant faced a lengthy sentence if he was convicted. Furthermore, defense counsel knew that his client was a suspect in several brutal murders committed in the Albany area. This knowledge, coupled with the fact that defendant was apparently in need of and had requested psychiatric help, made it incumbent upon defense counsel to attempt to obtain a psychiatric evaluation for the purpose of helping defendant personally and, from a legal standpoint, to establish an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">There can be little doubt that defense counsel\u2019s decision to structure defendant\u2019s defense around a claim of mental disease or defect was a proper one. <em>(See People v Bennett, </em>29 NY2d 462.) While not disputing this fact, defendant contends that his attorney made a serious mistake in advising him to speak with law enforcement authorities on March 5 because there was nothing to be gained by doing so. To the contrary, we believe that it was entirely reasonable for defendant\u2019s attorney to assume that by co-operating with the police he might revive the hope that a favorable plea might be accepted. Although there was no guarantee that this would happen, the truth of the matter was that defense counsel had precious few alternatives. Indeed, as things stood at the time, defendant had nothing to lose by speaking to the authorities. He was a predicate felon facing overwhelming <em>proof of </em>guilt on the kidnapping and robbery charges in Schenectady County and was facing substantial, if not overwhelming, evidence with respect to the Hedderman-Byron murders. Moreover, in light of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>counsel\u2019s reasonably conceived plan to assert an insanity defense at the Schenectady County trial and necessarily to call Dr. Klopott to testify to the fact that defendant admitted committing the various murders but placed responsibility for them on his deceased brother John, the secrecy to be attached to the March 5 meeting became of secondary importance. Nevertheless, defendant\u2019s attorney took steps to insure the secrecy of defendant\u2019s statements by insisting on the stipulation. While it certainly would have been preferable to have had the Albany County District Attorney personally consent to the stipulation, to say that he would have done so, if asked, is rank speculation. That the stipulation ultimately proved ineffective in preventing the Albany County District Attorney from using the March 5 statements does not render defense counsel\u2019s otherwise thoughtful and reasonably employed defense strategy ineffective. <em>(People v Aiken, </em>45 NY2d 394, 399.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In <em>People v Baldi </em>(54 NY2d 137, <em>supra), </em>a somewhat similar case, we held that an attorney provided effective representation to his client when, in an effort to strengthen the defendant\u2019s insanity defense, the attorney took the stand and testified that his client had committed a large number of sexual assaults and murders. There, as here, defense counsel had thoroughly reviewed the facts of the case and the law relevant to his client\u2019s defense. <em>(People v Bennett, </em>29 NY2d 462, 466, <em>supra.) </em>In light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, we held that counsel\u2019s defense strategy was reasonable. Similarly, we hold today that defendant\u2019s attorney provided meaningful representation under the circumstances when he permitted defendant to speak with the authorities on March 5 and allowed Dr. Klopott to testify at the Schenectady County trial concerning statements made by defendant at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We now turn our attention to defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error. The record demonstrates that the trial court, at the pretrial <em>Sandoval </em>hearing, exercised its discretion in ruling that five of defendant\u2019s prior convictions could be inquired into on cross-examination should defendant choose to testify. Indeed, the Judge specifically advised defense counsel that in reaching his decision he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>considered the prejudicial effect that evidence of those convictions would have on the defendant. The ruling, therefore, cannot be said to constitute an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. <em>(People v Mackey, </em>49 NY2d 274, 281; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371, 378.) Inasmuch as the record demonstrates that the court exercised its discretion, appellate review ends in the intermediate appellate court. <em>(People v Pollock, </em>50 NY2d 547, 550.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Defendant also cites as error the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing Dr. Jack Neville-Phillips Davies, a professor of pathology at Albany Medical College, to give his opinion as to whether the deaths of Robert Hedderman and Margaret Byron were the results of a maniacal attack. Defendant argues that Dr. Davies was not trained in psychiatry and was, therefore, not qualified to offer this testimony, which, according to defendant, constituted an opinion as to defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the slayings.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The record shows, however, that Dr. Davies did not testify as to defendant\u2019s mental condition. After testifying that he had been involved in more than 40,000 autopsies, two to three thousand of which involved homicides, Dr. Davies was asked to define a maniacal stabbing. He responded that a pattern of widely distributed knife wounds is indicative of a maniacal stabbing. Dr. Davies further testified that a maniacal stab wound pattern was not found on the bodies of either Robert Hedderman or Margaret Byron. Thus, it is clear that Dr. Davies was testifying about the nature of the attack, a subject well within his area of competence, and not to defendant\u2019s state of mind. There was no error in allowing Dr. Davies to so testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">For all of the above reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\">. The Albany County District Attorney apparently agreed to this arrangement in hopes that with proper treatment defendant would realize that it was he and not his brother John (who died in infancy but according to defendant lived within him) who was responsible for the murders. If the psychiatrist was successful, the District Attorney hoped to obtain a guilty plea from defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">. Schenectady County Assistant District Attorney Carey reiterated the stipulations for the record. It was agreed, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u201cToday\u2019s proceeding is entirely secret. The only persons who are aware of the proceeding are those present in this room and the District Attorney of Schenectady County, who is not present today. Everybody here has been sworn to secrecy. There will be no releasing of either the fact that this meeting is taking place or the substance of what has taken place today, with the exceptions that I\u2019ll state later on. The proceedings are being recorded on tape. There are two tapes being made, one is an original which will be sealed at the end of the proceeding. The other one is for the purpose of Mr. McConchie, in the event that he misses anything on the stenographic minutes he\u2019ll be able to review the second tape, and the tape is for the purpose of insuring the accuracy of the stenographic transcript. The stenographic transcript and the two tapes will be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>property of the Schenectady County District Attorney. They will be in the sole and exclusive possession of the Schenectady County District Attorney. They will not be available to anyone else without the written permission of both Mr. Smith and his attorney, at that time. All the persons present, with the exception of Mr. Rosenblum and Mr. Smith, are to be considered the agents of the Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s Office and will abide by all the stipulations which are entered into between Mr. Rosenblum and myself. In no * * * the transcript or the tapes cannot be used in any form without Mr. Smith\u2019s and his attorney\u2019s permission. I will be permitted to discuss the matter with the District Attorneys of Montgomery County, Saratoga County and Albany County as to the substance of the fact that this meeting has taken place and to the general substance of the conversation, but I\u2019ll reveal no other information without Mr. Smith and Mr. Rosenblum\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u201cMr. Smith is not waiving any of his fifth amendment privileges by being here today.\u201d Those present at the meeting were: Lemuel Smith, his attorney, Diane Kassel, Captain Robert Scheeman of the New York State Police, Joseph Carey, Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s office, and a court reporter, Lynn McConchie. From time to time, four State Police investigators came in and out of the room; the investigators were R. T. Anslow, J. A. Manello, H. J. Malee and T. O. Rehm. In another room monitoring the tape recorder was Investigator Richard Gannon of the State Police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\">. During the cross-examination of Dr. Klopott, the prosecutor sought to introduce into evidence the transcript of the March 5, 1978 meeting. Judge Stroebel, however, refused to allow its admission on the ground that the Schenectady County District Attorney\u2019s office had agreed, pursuant to the March 5 stipulation, that the particulars of that meeting would not be disclosed unless defendant and his attorney gave their permission in writing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\">. Defendant has apparently abandoned his argument raised below, that Captain Scheeman and Investigator Gannon, both of the New York State Police, were also agents of District Attorney Greenberg. In his brief to this court, defendant states that \u201cthe record of the instant case fails to reveal that either Captain Scheeman or Investigator Gannon were acting at any time as the agents of the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b212-8\">Meyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZq\">(dissenting). The incompetence of defendant\u2019s trial attorney is made clear by his own testimony (1) that he told defendant \u201cthat no one could ever use these statements that he had made that night against him; that he was in no jeopardy whatsoever * * * by giving these statements; that it can only help him and not hurt him\u201d and (2) that before he gave the statements on March 5, 1978, defendant was granted immunity for any statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>given by Captain Scheeman and Investigator Gannon on behalf of the Albany County District Attorney\u2019s office. The fact, noted in the majority\u2019s footnote 4, that defendant\u2019s present attorney no longer presses the latter argument only emphasizes the trial attorney\u2019s incompetence, for the March 5 meeting was a \u201ccriminal proceeding, other than a grand jury proceeding\u201d and, therefore, under CPL 50.30, immunity turned on court approval, at the request of the District Attorney and, thus, was not within the competence of Scheeman and Gannon to give, even had they been employees of the Albany County District Attorney, which they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The more particularly is this so in view of the prior negotiations of the attorney with the Albany County District Attorney, which had ended with harsh words. That the Albany District Attorney would have consented if asked was, therefore, highly improbable. The attorney\u2019s strategy was hopelessly defective without that consent, yet without it he advised defendant that \u201cno one\u201d could use his statements. His ignorance of the law readily distinguishes the present case from <em>People v Baldi </em>(54 NY2d 137) on which the majority relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">I would reverse and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jones, Wachtler and Simons concur with Judge Jasen; Judge Meyer dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
