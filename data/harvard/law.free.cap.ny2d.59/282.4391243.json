The People\u2019s proof as to the two counts of assault in the second degree was insufficient as a matter of law especially in light of the specific testimony of the complainants that appellant was not the one who committed the crimes. <em>(People v Abdullah, </em>30 AD2d 960; <em>People v Phillips, </em>263 App Div 994; <em>People v Hutchinson, </em>88 AD2d 921; <em>People v Oden, </em>36 NY2d 382; <em>People v Dlugash, </em>41 NY2d 725; <em>People v Stewart, </em>40 NY2d 692; <em>People v Santos, </em>38 NY2d 173.) II. The court below improperly refused to allow defense counsel to impeach the credibility of a key prosecution witness. <em>(People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Melendez, </em>55 NY2d 445; <em>People v Mendez, </em>57 NY2d 764.) III. The court below committed reversible error by refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>to grant defense counsel\u2019s request to prohibit the prosecutor from cross-examining appellant with respect to a pending indictment. <em>(People v Molineux, </em>168 NY 264; <em>People v Zackowitz, </em>254 NY 192; <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241; <em>People v Carborano, </em>301 NY 39; <em>People v Fiore, </em>34 NY2d 81; <em>People v Branch, </em>34 AD2d 541, 27 NY2d 834; <em>People v Reyes, </em>48 AD2d 632; <em>People v Dellarocco, </em>86 AD2d 720; <em>People v Neumuller, </em>29 AD2d 886; <em>People v Williams, </em>56 NY2d 236.) IV. The prosecution\u2019s tactics and remarks were purposely calculated to create improper and prejudicial inferences so as to deny appellant a fair trial. <em>(People v Hearns, </em>18 AD2d 922; <em>People v Green, </em>89 AD2d 874; <em>People v Burris, </em>19 AD2d 557; <em>People v Matthews, </em>33 AD2d 679; <em>People v Burney, </em>20 AD2d 617; <em>People v Brown, </em>26 AD2d 614; <em>People v Von Werne, </em>41 NY2d 584; <em>People v Al-Kanani, </em>26 NY2d 473; <em>People v Rutigliano, </em>261 NY 103; <em>United States v Hale, </em>422 US 171.)

Defendant\u2019s guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. II. The court\u2019s rulings upon the <em>Sandoval </em>motion were proper. <em>(People v Duffy, </em>36 NY2d 258, 857, 423 US 861; <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, 396 US 846; <em>People v Mayrant, </em>43 NY2d 236; <em>People v Caviness, </em>38 NY2d 227; <em>People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371; <em>People v Rahman, </em>62 AD2d 968, 46 NY2d 882.)

IV. The court\u2019s refusal to permit testimony that a prosecution witness had a bad reputation with respect to veracity was not prejudicial. <em>(Spira v Holoschutz, </em>38 Misc 754; <em>People v Hinksman, </em>192 NY 421; <em>Carlson v Winterson, </em>147 NY 652; <em>People v Loris, </em>131 App Div 127; <em>Elmendorf v Ross, </em>221 App Div 376; <em>People v Zabrocky, </em>26 NY2d 530; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230.)

The interpreter was qualified.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b330-4\">Jasen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On this appeal we are asked to consider whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow a defense witness to testify, for purposes of impeachment, that a key prosecution witness had a bad reputation in the community for truth and veracity. Also presented for our consideration is the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions for assault in the first and second degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In the early morning hours of December 14,1979, a fight broke out in \u201cPop\u2019s Bar\u201d in Queens. According to the prosecutor, defendant Frank Pavao, accompanied by Joseph Pavao and Pasquale Tridico, approached James Irwin and John Staganelli, who were sitting at the bar, and, for no apparent reason, struck both men in the face with a pistol.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ensuing fight spilled out onto the sidewalk in front of the tavern where Patricia Pittman and Thomas Walters happened to be passing by. As Irwin and Staganelli walked away, defendant began cursing and hurling racial slurs at Pittman and Walters, both of whom are black. A fight ensued, during the course of which Walters was beaten and knocked to the ground by defendant and his two companions. Defendant then produced a pistol and shot Walters. The three men fled while Pittman called for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The police arrived shortly thereafter and Pittman furnished them with a description of the man who shot Walters, to wit: a young white male, 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with short curly hair, a beard and moustache and wearing a beige turtleneck sweater and black hat. She then accompanied the police officers as they patrolled the neighborhood in search of the suspects. At 97th Street and Sutphin Boulevard, about two blocks from the scene of the shooting, Pittman saw three men being detained by two other police officers and immediately identified the men as Walters\u2019 assailants. She specifically pointed out defendant as the man who had shot Walters.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Defendant was arrested and charged with attempted murder in the second degree and assault in the first degree with respect to the attack on Walters and two counts of assault in the second degree with respect to the attacks on Irwin and Staganelli. After a jury trial, defendant was found not guilty of attempted murder, but was convicted of the remaining charges. Defendant appealed and the Appellate Division affirmed, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Defendant, on this appeal, contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions. He also contends that various trial errors require that his convictions be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Initially, we hold that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction on the two counts of second degree assault. With respect to these charges, both of the complainants, Irwin and Staganelli, testified that the defendant was not the person who assaulted them. Additionally, the barmaid on duty the night of the attack, Elizabeth Lerch, testified that she knew defendant and that he was not in the bar that night. In view of this evidence, Patricia Pittman\u2019s testimony that she saw the defendant push Irwin and Staganelli out of the bar immediately before the fight with Walters broke out does not constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant pistol-whipped Irwin and Staganelli inside the bar. Pittman\u2019s eyewitness account of the shooting and her positive identification of defendant as the man who shot Walters did, however, provide the jury with sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the first degree assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Defendant also contends that various trial errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial and that his conviction of first degree assault should be reversed accordingly and a new trial ordered. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Defendant\u2019s principal argument for reversal focuses on the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defendant to call a witness to testify that one of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses had a bad reputation in the community for truth and veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">At the trial, the prosecutor called as a witness, Serafim Pelarigo, an employee of a Portuguese social club located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>at 95-41 Sutphin Boulevard, one block from the scene of the <em>shooting. </em>Pelarigo testified that defendant entered the club at approximately 1:00 a.m. on December 14,1979 and said that he had just shot a black man in a bar. Pelarigo further testified that he told the defendant to leave and that when they met again on August 20,1980, Pavao asked him why he had not helped him the night of the incident. On cross-examination, Pelarigo admitted that although he had told his wife about the shooting, he failed to notify the police or anyone else of defendant\u2019s admission. Pelarigo also admitted that he had had a fight with defendant subsequent to December 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Defense counsel then called James Velasquez as a witness for the purpose of impeaching Pelarigo\u2019s credibility. Velasquez testified that he knew Pelarigo personally. Further questioning, however, was interrupted by the prosecutor\u2019s repeated objections. A side bar conference was held, at which defense counsel made an offer of proof stating that \u201cI am putting \u2014 I am putting him on the stand for the sole purpose and I am leading into it as to the reputation of Serafim Pelarigo in the community and in him being able to tell the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court ruled that this was a collateral issue which could not be inquired into because Velasquez had nothing to do with the shooting. Thereupon, Velasquez was dismissed and the jury was instructed to disregard all of the questions asked of the witness and the answers given by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The general rule of evidence in this State concerning the impeachment of witnesses with respect to collateral matters is that \u201cthe cross-examiner is bound by the answers of the witness to questions concerning collateral matters inquired into solely to affect credibility.\u201d (Richardson, Evidence [Prince, 10th ed], \u00a7 491, p 477.) It is well established that the party who is cross-examining a witness cannot introduce extrinsic documentary evidence or call other witnesses to contradict a witness\u2019 answers concerning collateral matters solely for the purpose of impeaching that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>witness\u2019 credibility. <em>(People v Zabrocky, </em>26 NY2d 530, 535; <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, 245, cert den 396 US 846; <em>People v Duncan, </em>13 NY2d 37, 41; <em>People v Sorge, </em>301 NY 198, 201.) This rule is premised on sound policy considerations for if extrinsic evidence which is otherwise inadmissible is allowed to be introduced to contradict each and every answer given by a witness solely for the purpose of impeaching that witness, numerous collateral minitrials would arise involving the accuracy of each of the witness\u2019 answers. The resulting length of the trial would by far outweigh the limited probative value of such evidence. (See <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, 245, cert den 396 US 846, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Where, however, the cross-examiner does not seek to contradict specific answers given by a witness, but, rather, attempts only to show that the witness has a bad reputation in the community for truth and veracity, the rule is different. The rule in such cases is that other qualified witnesses may be called to testify with respect to the witness\u2019 reputation for untruthfulness. <em>(People v Hinksman, </em>192 NY 421, 432; Richardson, Evidence [Prince, 10th ed], \u00a7 494, p 479; Fisch, New York Evidence, \u00a7 452, p 259; 65 NY Jur, Witnesses, \u00a7 75, p 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>People v Hinksman (supra), </em>we limited the use of extrinsic impeaching testimony to attack on the witness\u2019 reputation for truth and veracity; in so doing, we held that evidence of the witness\u2019 general reputation is inadmissible for purposes of impeaching his credibility. <em>(People v Hinksman, supra, </em>at pp 433, 435.) The rule set forth in <em>Hinksman </em>is not in conflict with the policy considerations which preclude parties from introducing for purpose of impeachment extrinsic evidence to contradict a witness\u2019 answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">When the use of extrinsic impeaching testimony is limited to a general statement that the witness\u2019 reputation in the community for truth and veracity is bad, there is no fear that trials will become unnecessarily protracted affairs involving numerous minitrials over whether or not a witness\u2019 answer was accurate or whether a witness did a particular act. Nor will the introduction of this evidence divert the jury\u2019s attention from the main issues involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the trial. Thus, we see no reason why such evidence which is probative of a witness\u2019 credibility (McCormick, Evidence [2d ed], \u00a7 41, p 81), should not be admissible. To hold otherwise would be to deny the jury an effective means of testing and assessing the credibility of witnesses and reaching a proper verdict. We hold, therefore, that a party has a right to call a witness to testify that a key opposing witness, who gave substantive evidence and was not called for purposes of impeachment, has a bad reputation in the community for truth and veracity. Whether the opposing party may call witnesses to rebut the impeaching witness\u2019 statement is a question best left to the discretion of the Trial Judge for it is he who can best assess whether doing so may result in confusion or cause the trial to be unduly extended in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Turning then to the facts of the case on appeal, we note the highly damaging nature of witness Pelarigo\u2019s testimony that the defendant came into the club on the night in question and told him \u201che had just shot a black man in a bar\u201d. The opportunity to impeach the credibility of this witness was, therefore, crucial to the defendant, especially in light of the contradictory testimony as to whether defendant was at Pop\u2019s Bar on the night in question. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow James Velasquez, who presumably knew Pelarigo and his reputation in the community, to testify as to his reputation for honesty and truth, was error requiring a new trial, since we believe that there was a significant probability that the jury would have acquitted defendant were it not for this error. <em>(People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230, 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The prosecutor all but concedes that the trial court erred in disallowing this testimony, but seeks to justify the ruling by arguing that the rule should no longer be followed because \u201cits vegetating and non-utilitarian status over the past five decades or so indicate^] a tacit recognition that this type of evidence is generally ineffective and insignificant from the standpoint of influencing the trier of facts.\u201d We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Initially, we note that the weight to be given evidence presented at trial is a matter for the jury. The known reputation of a key witness for honesty and truth should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>considered in testing his credibility. The court\u2019s action, however, in denying the defendant an opportunity to challenge the veracity of a key prosecution witness who had testified to a purported damaging admission, deprived the jury of evidence which would assist them in evaluating the credibility of this important witness. Furthermore, an examination of existing law indicates that the majority of jurisdictions follow this or a less restrictive rule in allowing a key witness to be impeached. (McCormick, Evidence [2d ed], \u00a7 44, p 90; 98 CJS, Witnesses, \u00a7 512, p 417.) Additional evidence of the continuing value of this type of impeachment evidence is found in rule 608 (subd [a], par [1]) of both the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Proposed Code of Evidence for the State of New York, which provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by extrinsic testimony that the witness\u2019 reputation in the community for truth and veracity is bad.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We reaffirm today the rule first established in <em>People v Hinksman (supra) </em>which permits the introduction of relevant evidence which is probative of a witness\u2019 credibility (McCormick, Evidence [2d ed], \u00a7 41, p 81) but does not carry with it the danger that numerous collateral issues will have to be resolved, causing the trial to become unnecessarily protracted and clouding the main issues. In light of this, defendant\u2019s conviction for assault in the first degree should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">While it is unnecessary to determine whether defendant\u2019s remaining allegations of error constitute an independent basis for reversal, we briefly address them for purposes of providing guidance to the trial court at defendant\u2019s new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">At a <em>Sandoval </em>hearing prior to trial, the court ruled that three of defendant\u2019s prior convictions could not be offered in evidence against him in the event he chose to testify. The court also ruled, however, that defendant could be questioned with respect to his indictment on charges of attempted murder, assault in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, all of which were allegedly committed after the incident at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While evidence of other crimes cannot be proffered solely for the purpose of showing that a defendant is of such a criminal bent that he is likely to have committed the crime charged <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371, 375; <em>People v Schwartzman, </em>24 NY2d 241, 247, cert den 396 US 846, <em>supra), </em>it is within the discretion of the Trial Judge to decide whether the probative worth of evidence of other crimes on the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice to him <em>(People v Williams, </em>56 NY2d 236; <em>People v Pollock, </em>50 NY2d 547). Furthermore, questioning concerning other crimes is not automatically precluded simply because the crimes to be inquired about are similar to the crimes charged. <em>(People v Rahman, </em>46 NY2d 882; <em>People v Sorge, </em>301 NY 198, 200, <em>supra; </em>cf. <em>People v Williams, supra, </em>at p 239.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Inasmuch as the Trial Judge precluded the prosecutor from questioning defendant about three prior convictions and specifically stated that the pending charges could be inquired into \u201cas far as credibility is concerned and only for the purpose of credibility\u201d, it cannot be said that the court abused its discretion in ruling as it did. <em>(People v Pollock, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">With respect to the actions of the prosecutor during the course of the trial, two errors were committed. The question put to Officer O\u2019Connor by the prosecutor as to whether defendant refused to make a statement after being read his rights was clearly improper and violative of defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. <em>(People v Von Werne, </em>41 NY2d 584; cf. <em>People v Al-Kanani, </em>26 NY2d 473.) While the trial court properly sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections prior to the question being answered, it denied defendant\u2019s request for curative instructions. Such curative instructions should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The more egregious error committed by the trial court was in permitting the prosecutor, over objection, to assert in his summation that James Irwin and John Staganelli testified that defendant pistol-whipped them when, in fact, Irwin and Staganelli testified that defendant was not one of the persons who attacked them. Defendant\u2019s remaining allegations of improper prosecution tactics are either unpreserved or without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Finally, defendant assigns as error the fact that the person assigned to interpret the testimony of witness Pelarigo was not qualified to perform the task. The record reveals that the interpreter conceded that Pelarigo\u2019s accent was different than that used in Brazil where she learned to speak Portuguese. Moreover, in response to the question whether she had any special training with regard to the Portuguese language as spoken in Portugal, the interpreter replied: \u201cWell, we understand it, it\u2019s the same language, but sometimes like I said before, it may be a little difficult for the person to understand. This gentleman, he speaks a very difficult Portuguese and I almost can\u2019t understand what he is talking about. That is why I ask him to repeat what he is telling me.\u201d Then, when asked if she could interpret Pelarigo\u2019s testimony without deviation, she repeated: \u201cIt depends if I understand very well what he is saying.\u201d Under these circumstances, it was error, as a matter of law, for the court to deny defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify the interpreter and appoint a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, affirming a judgment of the Supreme Court, Queens County, convicting the defendant of one count of assault in the first degree, should be reversed and a new trial ordered in respect thereto, and as to the conviction of the defendant of the two counts of assault in the second degree, those counts of the indictment should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jones, Wachtler, Meyer and Simons concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Order reversed, the counts of the indictment charging assault in the second degree dismissed and case remitted to Supreme Court, Queens County, for a new trial in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\">. On January 29, 1981, Joseph Pavao and Pasquale Tridico were acquitted of all charges following a nonjury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. While inartfully worded, we believe this statement was sufficient to alert the Trial Judge to the fact that Velasquez was going to testify concerning Pelarigo\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and not simply to show that Pelarigo\u2019s general reputation was bad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">. The fact that the crimes sought to be used to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility were allegedly committed after the shooting involved in the present case occurred is irrelevant. A defendant who acts in a manner demonstrating that he is willing to place his own self interests ahead of the interests of society, whether he has done so before or after the crime he is facing trial on was committed, may be willing to do so again on the witness stand. We also note, however, that defendant made no objection to the court\u2019s ruling on the ground of self incrimination. That issue is, therefore, not preserved for our review. <em>(People v Martin, </em>50 NY2d 1029; <em>People v Tutt, </em>38 NY2d 1011.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
