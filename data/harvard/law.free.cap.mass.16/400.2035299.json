In March, 1817, the demandant caused the premises to be attached as <em>Bartlet\u2019s </em>on mesne process; and within thirty days after the recovery of judgment, caused his execution to be extended thereon by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>appraisement, the appraisers having no regard to the encumbrance, and making no deduction on that account. In April following, the tenant, <em>Bond, </em>caused the same premises to be attached as the property of <em>Bartlet, </em>and within thirty days from the rendition of judgment in his favor sued out his execution, upon which [ * 401 ] he caused <em>Bartlet\u2019s </em>right in equity * to be seized; and the same was duly advertised by the officer for sale; but before the day appointed for the sale, learning that <em>Bartlet </em>had paid to the bank the debt for which the land had been mortgaged, he caused his execution to be extended on the premises by appraisement, and entered thereon by virtue of the said extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">If the Court should be of opinion, that the land thus encumbered with the mortgage was liable to be taken and set off by appraise ment on the demandant\u2019s execution, so as to give him a good title against the tenant, judgment was to be rendered for the demandant upon the default of the tenant. Otherwise the demandant was to become nonsuit, and costs to be taxed for the prevailing party.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\"><em>Hammond, </em>for the demandant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMN\">contended that the extent of the demandant\u2019s execution was valid, and vested in him an estate in fee against all persons but the mortgagees. The mortgagor is seised of the land, subject to the claim of the mortgagee. He can maintain an action for the possession; and his widow is dowable <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. None but the judgment creditor himself can be a sufferer by this mode of extending the execution. When the debt is paid, for which the land was mortgaged, the estate is as if it had never been encumbered. In the case of <em>Warren </em>vs. <em>Childs </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>, <em>Sewall, </em>C. J., expresses a strong inclination of opinion, that such an extent would be good if made, as was the case here, without any deduction for me encumbrance, supposing the judgment creditor willing to lose the value of the encumbrance, and to take the estate as absolute in his debtor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-7\"><em>Burnside, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASc\">The demandant acquired no title by extending his execution in the manner he did. It is clear, from the case of <em>Warren </em>vs. <em>Childs, </em>that he gained by his extent no right to redeem the land from the lien which the bank had upon \u2022 it. If, then, he did not acquire the right of redemption, it remained in <em>Bartlet, </em>and was legally taken from him by Bond, [ * 402 ] \u25a0 The payment of * the mortgage money affected <em>Bond\u2019s </em>lien no otherwise than as it led to a different mode of satisfying the execution.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b340-10\"> 6 <em>Johns. </em>290. \u201411 <em>Johns. </em>534. \u201415 <em>Johns. </em>319.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\"> 11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>222.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A9K\">Parker, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMa\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The objection to the demandant\u2019s title is, that, at the time his execution was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>extended upon the land of <em>Bartlet, </em>the debtor, it was under mort gage, and therefore not capable of being extended upon in satisfac tian of an execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In the case of <em>Warren </em>vs. <em>Childs, </em>cited, in the argument, a doubt is expressed by Chief Justice <em>Sewall, </em>whether the provision by statute for the sale upon execution of rights in equity to redeem mortgaged land did not supersede the levy by extent and appraisement. He, however, seems to admit that this mode may be pursued, if the land be appraised without any deduction on account of the debt for which it is mortgaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">It was so done in the present case; and we are of opinion that the demandant\u2019s title is valid under the extent. The land is the property of the mortgagor, as to every person\u2019s claims but the mortgagees. If the creditor chooses to take it subject to the mortgage, and without allowing any thing for the debt, there seems to be no reason against it. If he pays the debt, and takes a release from the mortgagee, his title will be complete. He may also be considered as assignee of the mortgagor, and will have a right to his bill in equity to redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>Tenant defaulted</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
