Damages laid at fifty dollars. At the trial in the Common Pleas, upon the general issue, the plaintiff\u2019s right to use the way was in question. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at eleven dollars. The plaintiff moved for the allowance of full costs ; but the Court adjudged him entitled to one fourth part of the damages, as costs. He excepted to this decision, md the cause being brought here, under the provision of the statute of 1783, c. 42,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-12\"><em>Reed, </em>in support of the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtDQ\">cited the case of <em>Rummer </em>vs. <em>Foster </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> ; which was trespass <em>guare clausum fregit, </em>and full costs were given, on the ground that the title to real estate might be concerned. In this case the title to real estate had actually been in question ; and so the case is clearly within the exception in the statute <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b378-14\"> 7 <em>Mass.
