And afterwards, at said <em>Boston, </em>on the 23d day of April, 1810, the said <em>Jeffrey, </em>then in full life, for a valuable consideration, assigned, transferred, and set over to said <em>Joseph, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s testator, then in full life, all his the said <em>Jeffrey\u2019s </em>right, title, and interest of, in, and to the note aforesaid, and the contents thereof; of which the said <em>Swan </em>had notice. And the said <em>Joseph </em>thereby became and was entitled in law to demand and receive the contents of said note according to its tenor and effect. And also for that, at said <em>Boston,\u201d </em>&amp;c. [reciting the making of the same note]\u2014\u201c And thereafterwards on the same day of the date of said note, at said <em>Boston, </em>the said <em>Jeffrey 8f Russell, </em>by their endorsement in writing on the back of said note, by them subscribed in the name of their said firm of that date, ordered the contents of said note to be paid to the plaintiff\u2019s said testator, then in full life ; and then and there, for value received, delivered the same, being then due and unpaid, to the plaintiff\u2019s testator; of which the said <em>Swan </em>then and there had notice. By reason of all which the * said <em>Swan </em>[*315] became liable in law to the plaintiff\u2019s testator to pay him the contents of said note, according to its tenor and effect; and being so liable, then and there, in consideration thereof, the said <em>Swan </em>undertook and faithfully promised the plaintiff\u2019s said testator, then in full life, to pay him said sum, according to the- tenor and effect of said note. Yet, though often requested, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-8\">To each count the defendant pleads <em>actio non accredit infra sex annos. </em>The plaintiff replies to the pleas severally, that the defendant made and signed the note declared on, in presence of one witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>who then and there attested the same. The defendant demurs generally to these replications, and the demurrer is joined.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-5\"><em>Mason, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOho\">The first count is bad, in that it sets forth no endorsement of the payees, which is absolutely necessary to the transfer of a negotiable security; nor any promise to the supposed assignee <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azz\">As to the second count, the plaintiff relies on the statute of limitation <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. The exception, however, in that statute of notes attested by one or more witnesses, is expressly limited to actions brought by the original promisee, his executor or administrator. The present action is by an endorsee, and is not saved by the statute. Nor does it make any difference, that the endorsee was one of the promisees. After the endorsement, he acts in a new character, and has a new relation to the promisor. The attestation of the witness relates wholly to the original promise, and has no concern with the promise declared on.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-7\"><em>Sohier, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al4x\">was not disposed to deny that the first' count seemed open to some technical objections. But he argued that one copartner might well assign his share in a contract of this nature to the other; and that other still retain the character of promisee, and in that character might endorse the note to a third person, or maintain an action in his own name upon, the original promise. In this latter case, he will be entitled to all [ * 316 ] the * benefits belonging under the statute to an original promisee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">As to the second count, the plaintiff sues as executrix of one of the original promisees. Her right of action is wholly founded on \" the original note, and that is so attested as to take it out of the operation of the statute. The plaintiff has as much privity with the defendant, as if her testator had been sole promisee. In short, the defendant\u2019s objection rests in the letter of the statute, while its whole spirit and intent are favorable to the claim of the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b270-11\"> <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>101. \u20147 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>481, <em>Tyler </em>vs. <em>Binney.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"pA9-\"> <em>Stat. </em>1786, c. 52, \u00a7 5</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b270-9\">Parker, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AjR\">delivered the opinion of the Court. It is very clear that the first count in the declaration cannot be supported. It sets forth an assignment of a chose in action, without averring such facts, as alone constitute an assignment, so as to give a right of action to the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">The second count is maintainable; for it avers an endorsement of the note by <em>Jeffrey &amp; Russell, </em>the payees, to <em>Joseph Russell, </em>one of them; and it is certainly competent for partners, or other joint payees of a negotiable note, to assign it to one of the firm, or one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of the joint payees, with the same effect that an assignment to any other person would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The only question is, whether it appears in the second count, that the action is brought by the plaintiff, as executrix of the original promisee; for if it is not, the exception in the statute of limitations, on which the replication is founded, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Now, we must consider the plaintiff\u2019s title to be such as she has set forth in her count. She is the executrix of <em>Joseph Russell, </em>one of the payees ; but in this suit he appears only in the character of endorsee. She can have no right of action, as his representative, in any other capacity : for by law the promise would survive to the other payee, on the death of <em>Russell, </em>and his executrix could have no legal interest in the note. If <em>Russell </em>survived <em>Jeffrey, </em>the action should have been brought differently, * aver- [ * 317 ] ring the fact that transmitted the right to <em>Russell </em>by survivorship; and in that case the replication would have been good.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">But we are bound to consider the plaintiff\u2019s only title as derived from the endorsement by <em>Jeffrey Of Russell </em>to <em>Russell; </em>so that the action is not brought by the representative of the original promisee, within the intent of the statute. We are not bound to inquire into the reason of this exception in favor of the first parties to a note; but it is probable, the object of the legislature was to check the negotiability of outstanding notes, and facilitate equitable set-offs by the debtor</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
