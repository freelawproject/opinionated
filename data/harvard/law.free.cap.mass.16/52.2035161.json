His father dying, his mother returned, with her child, then about five years old, to <em>Berkley. </em>In 1755, the pauper being still under age, his mother was married to <em>John Ingell, </em>who had his settlement in <em>Taunton. </em>The pauper removed to <em>Taunton </em>with his mother, and resided a part of the time with her, and. a part of the time with one <em>Jonathan Ingell, </em>until he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>came of age; after which he returned to <em>Berkley, </em>but never acquired a settlement in his own right.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-5\"><em>H.

The pauper, in the case before us, was born between the years 1701 and 1767, during which period the common law with respect to settlements prevailed here. The pauper therefore, at the time of his birth, had his lawful settlement in <em>Berkley. </em>This settlement he retains until the present time, unless he has since acquired a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">It is contended that, as his mother gained a derivative settlement in <em>Taunton, </em>by her marriage with <em>Ingell, </em>this was communicated to the pauper, who was then a minor, and went with his mother to <em>Taunton, </em>and lived with his step-father a part of the time, and part of the time with another person of the name of <em>Ingell, </em>in <em>Taunton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">But it appears to be well settled, that at the common law, minor children, although they be removed with the mother to the place of settlement of her husband, did not thereby acquire a derivative settlement under the mother. They might be continued with the mother for nurture ; but their settlement was not changed thereby. This is distinctly settled in the cases cited by Mr. <em>Williams </em>for the defendants. The pauper, therefore, in this case, never gained a settlement in <em>Taunton </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b53-12\"> <em>Com.
