The said <em>Amasa </em>was born in <em>Nova Scotia </em>in the year 1780. In 1797, the said <em>David </em>' removed from <em>Nova Scotia </em>to <em>Manchester, </em>the said <em>Amasa </em>removing with him, as a member of his family. The next year <em>Amasa, </em>being then 18 years of age, left'the family of his father, with his consent, and went to <em>Boston </em>* for the purpose of going a [ * 231 ] voyage to <em>India, </em>and was absent from <em>Manchester </em>seven years, following the occupation of a mariner. On the third of April, 1804, he married <em>Jane, </em>daughter of <em>Thomas Ur an, </em>who was an inhabitant of, and legally settled in <em>Boston. </em>She was born in <em>Boston </em>in 1784, and at the time of her said marriage was the widow of one <em>Wilson, </em>who was an alien. The said <em>Amasa </em>returned to <em>Manchester </em>in 1805, and resided there, with his wife and children, pursuing his occupation as a mariner, until his death in 1816. He possessed no real estate, but paid a poll tax more than five years in <em>Manchester. </em>In the year 1802, <em>David, Burges </em>purchased real estate in <em>Manchester </em>of the value of 350 dollars, which he occupied until his death in 1816; and he paid all taxes that were assessed upon it. Notice from the plaintiffs to the defendants, that the said <em>Jane </em>and her children had become chargeable, and the denial of their settlement in <em>Boston, </em>were duly and seasonably made. Judgment upon default or nonsuit was to be entered, as the opinion of the Court should be, on the question whether the legal settlement of the said <em>Jane </em>and her children was in <em>Boston, </em>at the time the expense was incurred by the plaintiffs, viz. in April, 1816.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-5\"><em>Saltonstall, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-0\"><em>Jane Burges, </em>having been born of parents legally settled in <em>Boston, </em>and having acquired no settlement by her first marriage, she and her children have still a settlement in <em>Boston, </em>unless they have a derivative settlement in <em>Manchester, </em>under her last husband, <em>Amasa Burges. </em>He was born in a foreign country, a subject of the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>to whom he owed allegiance, and was never naturalized. He might, at any time, have returned lo <em>Nova Scotia, </em>or any part of the <em>British </em>empire, and enjoyed all the rights of a <em>British </em>subject. He comes within the definition of an alien, as settled from the time of <em>Calvin\u2019s case </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. \u201cAn alien is a subject born out of the ligeance of the king, and under the hgeance of another.\u201d He did not derive a settlement in <em>Manchester </em>from his father <em>David B., </em>who * was also an [ * 232 ] alien after the treaty of peace, and was never a citizen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the <em>United States. David </em>was removed from the territory of the <em>United States </em>at the age of two years, and voluntarily continued a <em>British </em>subject.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\"><em>Thatcher, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amy\">It will not be disputed that <em>Amasa B. </em>acquired a legal settlement in <em>Manchester, </em>if he was originally a citizen of any one of the <em>United States. </em>His father was a citizen of <em>Connecticut </em>by birth, and he never lost his settlement. He was carried to <em>Nova Scotia </em>in his infancy, before he could exercise any volition. He never relinquished his intention of returning to the <em>United States: </em>he never joined their enemies, nor did any act incurring the forfeiture of his citizenship, nor was he proscribed by the laws of <em>Connecticut </em>or of the <em>United States. </em>On the contrary, he returned to this his native country, purchased an estate, and was permitted to enjoy it without question until his death <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. Having been during his absence entitled to the rights of a citizen legally settled in <em>Connecticut, </em>his son <em>Amasa, </em>born during that period, inherited the same rights from him, and afterwards acquired a legal settlement in <em>Manchester </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\"><em>Saltonstall, </em>in reply. <em>Amasa Burges </em>was not originally a citizen of the <em>United States. </em>He was .born out of the country, after the declaration of independence. He did not derive a settlement from his father, because he was never lawfully settled in <em>Manchester, </em>or a citizen of. the <em>United States. David Burges </em>continued voluntarily under the allegiance of the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>until after the treaty of peace. He is completely within the principle of the cases of <em>Kilham </em>vs. <em>Ward &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark><em>(4)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and <em>Gardner vs. Same </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>. He elected to adhere to the king, and was virtually included in the treaty on h\\s part. He was then domiciled in <em>Nova Scotia, </em>and it does not appear that he had any intention of coming to the <em>United States. </em>He was twenty years of age at the peace, and did not leave <em>Nova Scotia </em>until fourteen years after. He did not elect within a reasonable time to return, and claim his right as a citi- [ * 233 ] zen. * The principle settled in the two cases last referred to is, that those persons, who left this territory, and voluntarily remained in other parts of the king\u2019s dominions at the treaty of peace, were his subjects. The voluntary situation at that period determined their future relation; and allegiance cannot, at the same time, be due to two sovereigns.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b203-6\"> 7 Co. 31</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\"> 9 <em>Mass.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AII\">delivered the opinion of the Court. .The question in this case is, whether <em>Jane Burges, </em>the pauper, and her children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>have a derivative settlement in the town of <em>Manchester, </em>under her late husband, <em>Amasa Burges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Her proper settlement prior to her marriage was in <em>Boston, </em>she having been born of parents who were legally settled in that town. She acquired no new settlement by her first marriage, her husband being confessedly an alien. Had then <em>Amasa B., </em>her second husband, a settlement in <em>Manchester ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">He could have none in his own right; for he was born in <em>Nova Scotia, </em>within the dominions of the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>and so. by the principles of the common law, was a subject of that king, and owed perpetual allegiance to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">But it is said that his father was a citizen of the <em>United States, </em>and so was capable of gaining a settlement in <em>Massachusetts; </em>and that, having lived in <em>Manchester, </em>and paid taxes there long enough to gain a settlement under the statute of 1793, <em>c. </em>34, he became settled in that town, and communicated his settlement to his son <em>Amasa, </em>who removed with him as one of his family from <em>Nova Scotia, </em>being then a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">We are then to inquire, whether <em>David B., </em>the father, was ever lawfully settled in <em>Manchester. </em>He was born in <em>Connecticut </em>before the year 1759; at which time a colonial or provincial government subsisted there, and all the inhabitants were subjects cr the king of <em>Great Britain. </em>The father of <em>David </em>in that year removed to <em>Nova Scotia, </em>* and carried his son, then about [ * 234 j two years old, with him as part of his family. <em>David </em>remained there until the year 1797, when he removed to <em>Manchester ; </em>so that, being born under allegiance to the king, he voluntarily continued that allegiance during the whole revolutionary war, and until long after the treaty of peace, which established the final separation between the two countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Under these circumstances' he cannot be said ever to have been a citizen of the <em>state </em>of <em>Connecticut; </em>for he appears never to have been within that jurisdiction, after the rights of sovereignty were assumed there. According to the cases of Kilhamvs. <em>Ward Of Al., </em>and <em>Gardner </em>vs. <em>Same, </em>his voluntary residence, at the time of the ratification of the treaty, within the territories of <em>Great Britain, </em>determined his allegiance.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The case of <em>Ainslie </em>vs. <em>Martin </em>has been cited, as establishing a different doctrine. But it does not appear to be applicable to the case before us. The question here is, whether <em>David Burges </em>was a citizen of the <em>United States, </em>by reason of his having been born within the territory of <em>Connecticut. </em>It has not been shown to us, that the law of <em>Connecticut, </em>in this respect, is similar to that laid down in the case cited; and it is the law of <em>Connecticut </em>which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>determine whether <em>David Burg s </em>was a citizen of that state, merely on account of his birth there.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">But there may also be a distinction, arising from the different in tent and view, with which the citizenship was to be applied in the two cases. In the case of <em>Ainslie </em>vs. <em>Martin, </em>recovery of land was the object. The tenant undertook to prove that the demandant was an alien; and he was obliged to do this according to the strict principles of the common law. But in the cases of <em>Gardner KiTham </em>vs. <em>Ward Al., </em>the question related to the exercise of political rghts and power; and the principle adopted was, 1 hat the inhabitants of this country, born under the allegiance of the king of <em>Great Britain, </em>remained his subjects, if. they removed within his territo- [ * 235 ] ries, and continued * there voluntarily until after the treaty of peace was ratified, with intention' to remain there. The doctrine of these cases is suitable to be applied to the case before us; for it is the civil and political relations of the citizens, and their municipal connections, on which is founded their settle ment in any town.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Conformably to this principle, it is very clear that <em>David Burges, </em>if he ever was a citizen of <em>Connecticut, </em>ceased to be such on the ratification of the treaty, and could not therefore obtain a settle ment in <em>Massachusetts, </em>never having been a citizen thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">This view of the case makes it unnecessary to consider the effect of the statute of the <em>United States, </em>which was referred to in the argument. But it may be well to suggest the construction which that statute would probably have received, if it had been necessary to consider it. The fourth section provides that the children of all such persons, as now are or have been citizens of the <em>United States, </em>shall be citizens, whether born within the <em>United States </em>or not. Without doubt, the object of congress, in making this provision, was to naturalize the children of actual citizens, who might be born abroad ; wl ether their parents were living or not, at the time of passing the act. It cannot be a fair construction, to make it apply to the case of all who had been born within the territory of any particular state, and who had quitted that territory for another country long before any sovereignty existed. The term, citizens of the <em>United States, </em>must be understood to intend those who were citizens of a state, as such, after the union had commenced, and the several states had assumed their sovereignties. Before that period there was no citizen of the <em>United States; </em>and it may be reasonably doubted, whethei this section can refer to any citizenship, but such as existed accord ing to the laws of the states, at the time of the adoption of the con etilution of the <em>United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>* By the construction contended for by the counsel for [ * 236 ] the defendants, we do not see but that all the children of all the refugees and conspirators, although remaining in <em>Nova Scotia </em>or elsewhere, must be citizens of the <em>United. States; </em>and consequently supported as paupers, if they should come to reside within (his state <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\n<em>Defendants defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(6)\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> <em>[Ainslie </em>vs. <em>Martin, </em>9 <em>Mass. 154. \u2014Martin </em>vs. <em>Woods, </em>9 <em>Mass. 377. \u2014Cummington </em>vs. <em>Springfield., </em>2 <em>Pick. 394. \u2014Auchmuty </em>vs. <em>Mulcaster, </em>5 <em>B. &amp; Cr. </em>775. <em>Bright\u2019s Lessee </em>vs. <em>Rochester, 7 Wheat. 535. \u2014Thomas </em>vs. <em>Acklam, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; Cr. </em>779. <em>\u2014Kilham </em>vs. <em>Ward, </em>2 <em>Mass. </em>268. \u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
