The said <em>Cory </em>was born in Chelmsford, and had still his legal settlement in that town, unless he had acquired one in <em>Andover. </em>The evidence to prove him settled in this latter town was, that- he removed thither about the year 1762, being then twelve years of age, and had continued to dwell there until the time that the plaintiffs incurred the expense for his support; that from the year 1806 to the year 1814 inclusive, with the exception of the year 1810, he had been taxed in <em>Andover </em>forty-two cents each year for the repairs of the highways, and had in every instance paid said taxes by his labor on the highways. Upon this evidence the court oelow instructed the jury, that the residence of <em>Cory </em>in <em>Andover </em>for ten years, and the paying of these taxes for any five years within that period, gave him a settlement there, within the intent of the legislature, in the twelfth mode of acquiring a settlement, pointed out in the statute of 1793, <em>c. </em>34, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-10\"><em>Spaulding, </em>for the plaintiffs, contended that laboring in the repairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>[ * 237 ] of highways was not the payment of a tax * within the meaning of the statute. <em>Payment </em>of taxes means a payment in money. But the law contemplates that these highway taxes are to be worked out, and with that view requires the surveyors to give \u201c six days\u2019 notice of the times and places he shall appoint for laboring, &amp;c., to the end each person may have opportunity to work on the highways,\u201d &amp;c. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. This point has been directly decided by the Supreme Court of <em>New York, </em>in the case of <em>The Overseers of Amenia </em>vs. <em>The Overseers of Stanford </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. The only difference between the law of <em>New York </em>and that of <em>Massachusetts, </em>as to this subject, is that payment of taxes for two years there gives a settlement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-5\"><em>B. Merrill, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASA\">The highway taxes are assessed, like all other taxes, in money; and they must be paid in money, unless the party assessed avails himself of the privilege the statute gives, of commuting the tax by his labor. In the case of <em>Billerica </em>vs. <em>Chelmsford </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>, the Court say, that <em>\u201c </em>the settlement does not depend upon the quantum of tax paid, or the species of tax ; but upon the assessment and payment of some tax, for the poll or estate.\u201d</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\"> <em>Stat. </em>1786, <em>c. </em>81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"Al4\"> 6 <em>Johns. </em>92.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"Arl\"> 10 <em>Mass. </em>396.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A18\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AKg\">The direction of the Court of Common Pleas, upon the facts, was unquestionably right. The payment of a highway tax for the requisite number of years, coupled with the prescribed term of residence, is sufficient to give a settlement, within the 12th rule. That rule requires the payment for five years of such taxes only as shall be assessed. The case cited from <em>New York </em>does not apply. The statute of that state requires that the party shall have paid <em>\u201c </em>his share towards the public taxes of such city or town,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
