The plaintiff afterwards recovered judgment in his said action, and delivered his execution in due season to the defendant. The vessel was sold on- <em>Cutter\u2019s </em>execution, and produced more than sufficient to satisfy that judgment; * but the whole balance of the [ * 182 J proceeds of the sale was appropriated by <em>Train </em>towards satisfying an execution in favor of one <em>Nathaniel Goddard </em>against the said <em>Calvin Turner.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">The defendant alleged that the vessel had been attached by <em>Train, </em>upon a writ in favor of said <em>Goddard, </em>after the attachment made for said <em>Cutter, </em>and before that made for the plaintiff. It appeared that, on the 22d of August, 1816, in the afternoon, the writ in favor of <em>Goddard </em>was delivered to <em>Train, </em>with directions to go to the shipyard where the said vessel was building, and attach all the timber and lumber in the yard. He was not directed to attach the vessel, <em>Goddard </em>supposing that he could hold the vessel without any attachment; because the said <em>Calvin </em>was building it for him upon a certain contract, and he, <em>Goddard, </em>had advanced large sums of money towards the work and materials expended in the building. <em>Train </em>accordingly made the attachment, that afternoon, of the said lumber and timber, but did not attach the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-9\">On the evening of the same day, <em>Cutter, </em>having procured his writ, went to one <em>Hunnewell, </em>another deputy of the defendant, requesting him to attach the vessel. <em>Hunnewell, </em>being informed that <em>Train </em>had been making an attachment in the same place, proposed to <em>Cutter </em>that they should first go and see <em>Train, </em>promising to go and make the attachment, unless <em>Train </em>would agree to do it immediately. They went accordingly, and called <em>Train </em>out of bed, it being late in the evening; and upon inquiry were informed by him, that he had not then attached the vessel for <em>Goddard; </em>and one of the witnesses, who was present, testified that <em>Train </em>mentioned as a reason, that <em>Goddard </em>considered the vessel as already his. Two other witnesses present at the time, did not testify that they heard the remark; and <em>Train </em>himself testified that he had never seen <em>Goddard </em>at that time, that his orders for that first attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>[ * 183 ] were received from * <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>attorney, and that he did not know there was any vessel there, until he went to the yard to attach the timber and lumber for <em>Goddard. Cutter </em>then desired him to go and attach it on his writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\"><em>Train </em>testified that he was at first unwilling to go, being much fatigued, and that he preferred to let <em>Hunnewell </em>do it; but that afterwards, on reflecting that the timber and lumber, which he had attached on <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>writ, was insufficient to satisfy that debt, he thought it best to go himself, that he might attach the vessel also for him as well as for <em>Cutter; </em>fearing, as he testified, that if <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>debt should not be fully secured, he might himself be made responsible for omitting to attach the vessel, when shown to him as the property of the debtor. He went accordingly with Cutter, and attached the vessel on his writ; and immediately afterward, as he testified, he attached it for <em>Goddard. </em>This was done about midnight, and twenty or thirty minutes before the defendant came there with the plaintiff\u2019s writ. There was no one then in the yard, but <em>Cut</em>ter, and a man whom <em>Train </em>had left there in the afternoon, to keep the timber and lumber he had attached. <em>Train </em>at that time knew nothing of the plaintiff\u2019s having any action or demand against <em>Calvin Turner </em>He did not mention to <em>Cutter, </em>nor afterwards on that night to the plaintiff and defendant, when he met them together, that he had attached the vessel for <em>Goddard; </em>and it did not appear that any inquiry was made of him about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">The plaintiff contended that the supposed attachment, made in the manner above mentioned on <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>writ, and without any orders for that purpose from him, was not valid and effectual to defeat the subsequent attachment made for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">The judge instructed the jury, that <em>Train, </em>after having taken the vessel upon the attachment made for <em>Cutter, </em>might attach it again upon <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>writ, without any open act or ceremony [ * 184 ] whatever. He reminded them of *the delicacy of the trust which the law reposed in officers in such cases, and of the ease with which it might sometimes be abused; and directed them to find a verdict for the plaintiff, unless they were fully satis fled that <em>Train </em>did really and <em>bond fide </em>make the attachment for <em>Goddard, </em>in manner above mentioned ; but that, if they were satis fled of that fact, their verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff moved for a new trial on account of the said opinion and direction of the judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">When <em>Train </em>was offered as a witness by the defendant, he was objected to as incompetent. It appeared that the defendant had given him a release of all demands on account of this action ; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the plaintiff objected that he was still an incompetent witness, by reason of his agency in the transactions complained of in the declaration. This objection was overruled, and the plaintiff moved for a new trial also on account of the admission of the said witness.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-5\"><em>Bigelow, </em>sen., for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH\">contended that it was not competent for the officer thus, by a mere act of his mind, and without any visible act or ceremony whatever, to defeat or vary the rights of parties. Still less could he do so in this case, having received no directions from <em>Goddard </em>to make that particular service of his precept. On the contrary, he had explicit orders to attach the timber and lumber in the yard, not the ship on the stocks. His attaching the ship was then contrary to the directions and even to the wishes of <em>Goddard. </em>In the case of <em>Smallcomb </em>vs. <em>Buckingham, &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it was settled that if two writs of execution are delivered to the sheriff on \"the same day, he has not an election to execute which he pleases, but he must execute that which was first delivered. Now, in the case at bar, the plaintiff\u2019s writ was first delivered to the officer, so far as respects the attachment of the vessel. It is true that, by the case just cited, <em>Goddard </em>was entitled to the money arising from the sale of the vessel; # but the [ * 185 ] officer is answerable to the plaintiff for his misconduct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\"><em>Train </em>was not a competent witness. If he swore falsely, it would be impossible, in the nature of things, to convict him of perjury. This of itself should have excluded him. The action might as well have been brought against him as against the sheriff; and until the latter released him, if not since, he maintained the defence at his own cost <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-7\"><em>Peabody, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkW\">cited the case of <em>Bond </em>vs. <em>Ward, </em>7 <em>Mass, jRep. </em>123, as to the validity of <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>attachment; and in support of the competency of <em>Train, </em>he referred to the American edition of <em>Phillips\u2019s Law of Evidence, </em>94, 98, and to <em>Gilb.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtF\">delivered the opinion of the Court. We are of opinion that <em>Train, </em>the deputy of the defendant, being released by him, to whom alone he would be directly accountable in consequence of a verdict in the action for the plaintiff, was a competent witness ; although undoubtedly standing in a very questionable point of light as to credit, as was suggested to the jury by the judge who sat in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">We are then to consider the fact to have been legally proved, that before the plaintiff\u2019s writ was tendered to the deputy for ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>vice, he had made two attachments of the vessel; and it appears Jiat the judgments, recovered in the two actions, were sufficiently large to consume the whole proceeds of the property attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The verdict was then unquestionably right, if the opinion of the judge, excepted to at the trial, was correct; <em>viz. </em>that no overt act was necessary to constitute an attachment, the sheriff having previously in his possession or custody ihe property, upon another attachment. That such is the law, we have no doubt; and the practice has uniformly conformed to it. It has its inconveniences, particularly in exposing officers to the temptation of preferring favorite [ * 186 ] creditors, when several writs are put into their hands, * with a view to cause the same property to be attached. But the law has been long enough known, to attract the attention of many successive legislatures; and it remains unaltered.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">It is in the power of parties to protect themselves, in some measure, from fraudulent practices, by demanding of the officers, when about delivering a writ to him, whether he has any other writs in his possession, or has made any prior attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">It has been suggested that, as the writ in favor of Goddard, upon which the second attachment was made, had endorsed upon it a special direction to attach other property, the officer was not bound to attach the vessel, and might lawfully, on that account, have postponed <em>Goddard\u2019s </em>attachment to the plaintiff\u2019s. But allowing he was not bound to attach the vessel, yet having done it, although without a special direction, he would have been liable to <em>Goddard, </em>had he knowingly done any thing to impair the effect of the attachment. A special direction may justify the officer for not going beyond it; but it does not deprive him of the legal authority to obey the general command in the precept, to attach sufficient to secure the demand, if he has opportunity to do it, and chooses to avail himself of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
