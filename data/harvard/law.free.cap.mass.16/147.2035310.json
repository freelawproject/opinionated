That an unlawful taking was not necessary to support this process, he relied on the case of <em>Badger </em>vs. <em>Phinney </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>, as conclusive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-7\"><em>Webster </em>and <em>Metcalf, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao9\">thought the case at bar might be distinguished from the case cited; but if not, [ * 148 ] they were inclined to go behind that decision, and * hoped to satisfy the Court, by a reference to common law authorities, that a tortious taking was necessary to be averred and proved by the plaintiff in replevin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-8\">This writ lies in no case where trespass could not equally be maintained; a mere wrongful detention is no foundation for the suit <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-9\">If an unlawful detention alone were sufficient, <em>non cepit </em>would not be the general issue, but <em>non detinet </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-10\">The only exception is the case of detaining a distress after tender of amends and refusal; and even there the distrainer is considered as a trespasser <em>ah initia </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b132-11\">Against the principle contended for, there <em>may be </em>cited an <em>obiter dictum </em>of the late Chief Justice <em>Parsons, </em>in the case of <em>Ilsley &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Stubbs </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>, asserting as a general principle, that the owner of a chattel may take it by replevin from any person whose possession is unlawful; with two exceptions, not applying to the present case. This <em>dictum </em>is given apparently as an inference from our statute of replevins <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>, which, in the preceding paragraph, he had stated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>have altered the common law in this respect. Yet in that same paragraph he truly limits that alteration to the cases of chattels attached or taken in execution; and even this he says has been productive of much practical inconvenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-5\">The objection is founded in the highest reason. Possession being <em>prima facie </em>evidence of property, the possessor ought not to be deprived of it, and the burden of proving his property thrown upon him. If the law is not with the defendants on this point, then any person may make a compulsory purchase of property belonging indisputably to another, and at his own price; for the plaintiff in replevin may fix- the amount of the bond to be given, and elect his own sureties. This would be a singular case * in [ * 149 j a country professing to be governed by the common law.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b132-12\"> 15 <em>Mass.

In the case referred to, it is said that the replevin affirmed the property to remain, so that the executor might well have the action ; and as the\" testator\u2019s property is transferred to the executor, the right to recover the possession must be transferred also.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">For the same reason a husband may have replevin for the goods which belonged to his wife, while she was sole ; for the property is vested in himself by the marriage. And the better opinion is, that he may sue alone, notwithstanding h\u00e9 never had the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">There is another case perhaps stronger. The lord may have replevin for the cattle of his villain; notwithstanding the lord had neither the possession nor the property before the action. The action itself is considered as amounting to a claim in law, and vests the property accordingly; although it is a general principle, that the plaintiff must have the property in the goods at the time of the taking <footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">But there is another case more like the case at bar. An abbot is permitted to have replevin for goods taken in the time of his predecessor <footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The objection most insisted on is, that there has not been a tortious taking: that the goods came into the defendant\u2019s [*150] possession as deacon of the church, and as the * proper person to hold them; and as there has been at most but a wrongful detention, that the writ of replevin should be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">But what is to be considered as an unlawful taking ? Is it confined to a case of taking <em>vi et armis </em>? Or may one be considered constructively taking goods, who came lawfully into possession, but keeps them from the owner against right ?</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Now, I hold that he who will not redeliver goods to the owner, but abuses the trust, is answerable either in replevin for the goods specifically, or in trover for damages ; and that it is at the election of the owner, and not of the tort-feasor, which of these remedies shall be applied <footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark>. For otherwise it would be in the power of one to take advantage of his own wrong; and the party injured might never recover a complete satisfaction for the injury. It has been decided accordingly, when the eminent Chief Justice <em>Parsons </em>presided in this Court and gave the opinion, that, as a general principle, the owner of a chattel may take it by replevin from a person, <em>whose possession is </em>unlawful, unless it is in the custody of the law, or unless it has been taken by replevin from him by the party in possession <footnotemark>(11)</footnotemark> ,<footnotemark>(12)</footnotemark>. Conformably to this, the same great judge afterwards held that the consignor might maintain trover or replevin against a shipmaster, who stopped short of the port of delivery with out reason, and refused to proceed thither <footnotemark>(13)</footnotemark>. That was a case where the goods came lawfully into the hands of the defendant, by delivery for a special purpose; and he neglecting to perform the trust, the owner was permitted to recover the goods specifically, or the damages, at his election.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Nor is this new doctrine. \u201cIf,\u201d says <em>Littleton, </em>\u00a7 71, \u201cI lend one my sheep to tathe his land, or my oxen to plow the land, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>killeth them, I may have an action of trespass against him, <em>notwithstanding the lending\u201d </em><footnotemark>(14)</footnotemark>. And Lord <em>Coke, </em>remarking upon this, says, \u201c In these * cases a man may have an [ * 151 j action of trespass on the case for this conversion, at his election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In the case of <em>Badger </em>vs. <em>Phinney, </em>the same principles are recognized. It is true, that the facts in that case would have warranted a decision for the plaintiff, on the ground of the original tortious taking, under color of a purchase, which was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We have reviewed and reconsidered the principles, which have been adopted in this Court, applicable to this action, and are satisfied with their correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The cases, which have been cited by the counsel for the defendant from the decisions of the Supreme Court of <em>New York, </em>have, from the unfeigned respect we feel for that tribunal, been examined with attention. In the first <em>[Goodenow </em>vs. Buttrick], it was decided that replevin was not to be confined to cases of distress; but would lie for <em>any </em>unlawful taking. The point now under consideration did not arise ; for the taking there was tortious ; and the possession,\" as well as the property of the plaintiff, was proved. But what, or whether any thing, should be equivalent to a tortious taking, made no part of the inquiry. The next case <em>[Hopkins </em>vs. Hopkins] was replevin for taking the plaintiff\u2019s sheep. The defendant justified the taking them damage feasant. The plaintiff replied that the defendant abused the distress afterwards, so as to make him a trespasser <em>ab initia. </em>The abuse consisted in impounding the sheep, before the damages had been ascertained by the fence-viewers; which was required by the statute of <em>New York, </em>and had been so decided in the case of <em>Sackrider </em>vs. <em>M\u2019Donald </em><footnotemark>(15)</footnotemark>. And the Court were clearly for the plaintiff. Chief Justice <em>Kent, </em>in delivering the opinion, stated that the action of replevin is grounded on a tortious taking (which as a general remark is certainly true), and that where a defendant in replevin has abused a license of the law, he shall be considered a trespasser <em>ab initia, </em>as he would be if the action were trespass. And the chief justice proceeds to cite <em>*Fitz. N. B. </em>69, and 8 <em>Co. </em>146, where a party .s not to [ * 152 j be adjudged a trespasser <em>ab initia, </em>but is liable in replevin merely for the unlawful detention. \u201c As if a man take cattle dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>age feasant, and the other tender sufficient amends, and he refuses to deliver them back; if he sue replevin, he shall recover damages only for the detention, and not for the taking, for that was lawful,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">It has been contended for the defendant, that in the case last cited, the defendant became a trespasser <em>ab initia, </em>because he abused a license of the law ; and so the original taking was to be considered as tortious; and thus this case is to be reconciled to the general doctrine requiring a tortious taking to enable the plaintiff to maintain replevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">But the writers, who mention this case, speak of it as one where replevin will lie ; and where damages are recovered for the unjust detention, and not for the unjust taking <footnotemark>(16)</footnotemark> ; which certainly would be the rule, if the defendant was to be considered a trespasser <em>ab initia </em><footnotemark>(17)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Now, I do not perceive how the distinction between the abuse of the license of the law, and the license of the party, will be very material <footnotemark>(18)</footnotemark>. The rule is very well stated in 12 <em>Edw. </em>4. <em>8. pl. </em>20. Where a man does a thing by the authority of the law, and after-wards misdemeans himself, <em>his first act </em>shall not be tortious.\u201d In a subsequent case, 21 <em>Edw. </em>4. 19. <em>Pigot </em>(who was a counsellor) contended that there was no difference between the license of the law and of the party <footnotemark>(19)</footnotemark> ; but the Court adhered to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>To apply the rule to the case at bar; the goods came to the defendant\u2019s hands by the license of the law, or of the party. Suppose by the license of the law ; then if, by detaining them unjustly, he becomes a trespasser <em>ab initia, </em>the plaintiff is to maintain his replevin on the ground of an original tortious taking. But suppose they came to the hands of the defendant by the license of the church, which in effect is the party, then he is to be punished only so far as he abused the authority. From that time * only he becomes a trespasser, not from the beginning; [ * 153 ] but, as Lord <em>Coke </em>expresses it in the case above cited,</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u201che shall be punished <em>for his abuse </em>of it.\u201d The distinction, therefore, goes only to the damages to be recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">There is another case cited by the counsel for the defendant from the <em>New York </em>decisions, and the most difficult to reconcile with our views of the law, and of the cases before considered. I refer to the case of <em>Gardner </em>vs. <em>Campbell, </em>where it was decided that replevin would not lie against an officer, who had taken goods on an execution, but who afterwards received the full amount of the same, with all charges, and then refused to deliver them to the debtor. The Court say that the defendant took the goods lawfully, which was certainly proved, and that he did not become a trespasser <em>ab initia </em>by refusing to deliver them. Be it so. Neither did he, who refused to deliver the cattle after tender of amends, become a trespasser <em>ab initia. </em>But he was answerable in replevin for the un lawful detention; and upon the same law and reason, I cannot perceive why the officer ought not to have been. The debtor could recover no damages for the original taking; for that was lawful. But after he had paid all the demands, which the officer had against the goods, his detention of them was equivalent to a taking of them without any authority, from that moment; and he was answerable for the damages accordingly <footnotemark>(20)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In the case of <em>Meany </em>vs. <em>Head, </em>which was replevin for some merchandise, the defendant pleaded property in one <em>Green, </em>who put them into the defendant\u2019s store for storage merely. The plaintiff recovered ; but the Court was of opinion that, if the defendant had pleaded <em>non cepit, </em>the verdict must have been for him, on the ground that there was no tortious taking. In that case the defendant had no lien or claim upon the goods. He refused to deliver them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>although <em>Green </em>was desirous that the plaintiff should have them. There the authority was derived from the party; and one who abuses the license of the party is to be punished [ * 154 ] * for the abuse. But if such should be the application of the rule, it is apprehended that the plaintiff would be punished by the loss of his goods, and not the defendant for abusing the trust <footnotemark>(21)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">It is said in 2 <em>Roll. </em>566, <em>Tit. Trespass, pl. </em>9, \u201c that if a man take my goods and carry them on his own land, I may justify my entry into the same land, to take my goods again.\u201d And the reason is given ; \u201c for they came there by his own act.\u201d Suppose that one should send his horse to a blacksmith to be shod, and after the smith had done his work and received payment for it, he should refuse to deliver him, but should put the horse into his own pasture ; would it not be lawful for the owner to go into the pasture, and take the horse ? The answer is given above ; the horse came into the pasture by the act of the smith. The owner may take him without being a trespasser. If so, may he not maintain trover or replevin at his election ? He is surely not obliged to do justice to himself by his own hands <footnotemark>(22)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">It is said in <em>Com. Dig. Pleader </em>3, <em>K. </em>12, that the defendant may plead bailment to him by the plaintiff, for which detinue lies, and not replevin. The chief baron cites no authority for this. His own is of great weight. We remark, however, that detinue is an action which has fallen into disuse. In this state it is never brought <footnotemark>(23)</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The mischiefs and perjuries, arising from the wager of law allowed in that action, were among the many strong reasons for substituting the action of trover. And besides, the remedy was incomplete; for while it purported to permit the plaintiff to recover his goods specifically, the very object of the suit was defeated by the conditional judgment; which, at the election of the defendant, allowed him to keep the goods, if he chose to pay the price <footnotemark>(24)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The question recurs, whether it be competent for one, who detains goods wrongfully, to say that he never took them. It is very evident that it is the same thing to the owner; <em>he is deprived of his goods. </em>Now there are cases, *where a <em>withhold- </em>[ * 155 ] <em>ing </em>is considered as a <em>talcing. </em>In rescous, for example, if one distrain beasts damage feasant, and while driving them to the pound they go into the house of the owner, who withholdeth them, and will not let them be impounded, this withholding is a rescous <footnotemark>(25)</footnotemark> ,<footnotemark>(26)</footnotemark>. And in replevin it is well settled that, wherever a man has the cattle in his possession wrongfully, the plaintiff may charge him with taking them there <footnotemark>(27)</footnotemark> ,<footnotemark>(28)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">It has been argued that there is no pleading in replevin, which would protect the rights of a defendant, who had a lien upon the property; and the opinion of Lord <em>Redesdale, </em>the late distinguished chancellor of <em>Ireland, </em>has been cited to this point <footnotemark>(29)</footnotemark>. But we do not perceive the difficulty suggested. A defendant in replevin may set forth his right in his avowry, and may have a return, if it be well founded; notwithstanding the property of the goods may be in the plaintiff. He may plead that he took the cattle damage feasant, and the goods for tolls, custom, services, and for many other causes; and he may have a return until his demands are satisfied. So he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>may plead that the plaintiff\u2019s goods were wrecked; and that the defendant took them for the owner, to prevent the thieves from stealing them ; and that he gave notice to the owner, when discovered, offering to deliver the goods upon payment of a reasonable salvage <footnotemark>(30)</footnotemark>. So that the plaintiff\" may reply <em>de injuria sua propria </em><footnotemark>(31)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Now, this case is applicable to the case before us in two points. First, that replevin will lie, where the original taking of the goods was lawful; and secondly, that the defendant may well avow for his reasonable claim or lien upon the goods, and for a return until satisfaction be made. And so in any other supposable case, a defendant may justify, and have a return until his lawful demands upon the goods are paid. And when the party, who took the goods, is no longer entitled to the thing for which he took them, he is not permitted to detain them, but he may justify for the taking [ * 156] of them. Thus it is said in 19 <em>H. 6, pl. </em>*83, \u201cIf I distrain for homage, and he who ought to do the homage die, and his executors sue replevin, there I ought to justify ; because the thing, for which the taking was had, is gone by his death.\u201d But he could not in that case have a return. Here is a case in which replevin will lie, where the goods were lawfully taken, but unlawfully detained. The lord had a right to seize for the services due from his tenant; but when the tenant died, the right to the services died with him. The lord could not rightfully detain, therefore, after the death of the tenant; but is liable to the replevin of the executor <footnotemark>(32)</footnotemark>. He is nevertheless to be excused for the taking ; for that was lawful <footnotemark>(33)</footnotemark>. The truth is, that the pleadings and proceedings in this action seem peculiarly well adapted to promote justice and protect the rights of the parties, both of whom are actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The argument from inconvenience has been much pressed upon this occasion. It has been argued that, under color of a replevin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>every man may have his house stripped of his family pictures, and be completely robbed of his goods under color of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">That would indeed be a great abuse of legal process, requiring exemplary punishment. But what good thing is not liable to be abused? On the other hand, the inconvenience would be intolerable, if the action would not lie to recover specifically the goods, which should be unjustly withheld. Suppose that one should send his ship to be repaired ; if the shipwright should afterwards think it better for him to keep her, or to send her freighting on his own account, must the owner submit to the change of property against his consent ? Shall he be obliged to accept a judgment for the damages, which may never be paid ? And so of a thousand things, the value of which cannot be fully compensated by money. Take, for example, a chronometer or other instrument of rare and curious workmanship, or a picture, or a manuscript, unlawfully detained <footnotemark>(34)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">*But the argument from inconvenience, which had so [ * 157 ] great an influence upon the Lord <em>Redesdale, </em>has no application here <footnotemark>(35)</footnotemark>. If, indeed, a replevin was a judicial writ, or grant-able only at the discretion of the Court, it might be necessary to consider that question. But as it is issued, like all other original writs, upon the demand of the plaintiff, it is not in the power of the Court to prevent any of the inconveniences, which are anticipated from the abuse of the process. All that can be done is to punish such abuse, when it occurs, as is done in other like cases. A plaintiff in replevin can always set forth a sufficient cause of action ; and upon giving the security required by law, he has a right to have the goods delivered to him. If the writ were to be abated, the defendant would have the same difficulty in regaining his goods, as he would have if he defeated the plaintiff upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The statute of 1789, <em>c. </em>25, seems to proceed upon these principles, authorizing a replevin for goods taken, detained, or attached ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>adopting the common law, where they are taken or detained; and extending the remedy, where they are attached <footnotemark>(36)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Upon the whole matter, we are satisfied that the plaintiffs may well maintain this action, and that the defendant must therefore answer over <footnotemark>(37)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Respondeos ouster awarded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(7)\">\n<p id=\"b133-12\"> 1 <em>Sid. 81, Arundell </em>vs. <em>Trevil, Vin.
