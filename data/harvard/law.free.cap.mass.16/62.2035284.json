It will not escape the observation of the Court, that the persons summoned are not the executors of the defendant\u2019s father. The reasoning of the Court in the case of <em>Barnes </em>vs. <em>Treat &amp; Tr. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> is confined to the case of executors and administrators. The plaintiff\u2019s demand in this case, being for the board of the defendant, gives him a peculiar claim on this fund.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\"> 2 <em>Mass.

They are to appropriate the sum of 500 dollars to the support of the defendant, at their discretion, during his life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and afterwards to distribute it among the other children of the donor. There may be good reasons for paying nothing to the defendant; and it is in every event entirely at the discretion of the respondents, when and how much they shall pay him. Further, it would be im possible to ascertain for how great a sum the respondents should be charged, if they were held to be chargeable in this suit. Upon the ground, that there is no absolute right in <em>Paul Jenkins </em>to any part of the sum, and that he can maintain no action against the respond ants, we discharge them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
