On the final settlement of the respondent\u2019s administration account in the probate office, the appellants, being creditors to the estate of the intestate, insisted that he should be held to account for the value of those buildings. The judge of probate, being of opinion that the said buildings were not liable to the debts of the deceased, decreed accordingly; and the appellants, dissatisfied with the said decree, appealed to this Court!</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-9\"><em>Wood, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOAH\">referred to the case of <em>Wells &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Banister &amp; Al. if Trustee </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-10\"><em>Eddy, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\"> 4 <em>Mass.
