Such a hiring may be by parole.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">Assumpsit on a policy of insurance upon 500 barrels of flour, on board the schooner <em>Blucher, </em>at and from <em>Newcastle </em>on the <em>Delaware </em>to <em>Boston. </em>The policy was dated February 12th, 1816, and the vessel warranted to have been at <em>Newcastle </em>on the 1st of January preceding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">There were several counts in the declaration; but the only one relied on was that, in which the loss is averred to have arisen from the barratry of the master, the insured not being the owner of the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">The barratry was clearly proved at the trial before the chief justice, so as to entitle the plaintiffs to recover for a total loss; unless <em>Lemuel S. Jennings, </em>the master, * was so the [ * 337 ] owner of the vessel that he could not commit barratry m the voyage insured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-11\">The vessel was at <em>Newcastle </em>on the day warranted, and had on board 500 barrels of flour, the property of the plaintiffs; but instead of coming to <em>Boston, Jennings </em>carried the vessel to <em>St. Jago de Cuba, </em>where - he sold vessel and cargo, and has never accounted for the proceeds to the owners or shippers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-12\">Messrs. <em>Fiske Sf Bridge, </em>being the general owners of the vessel, in November or December, 1816, made an agreement with <em>Jennings, </em>that he should take the vessel and employ her from time to time, until the middle of May then next. He was to victual and man her, and to be at all expense during the term, except keeping the vessel in repair; and for the use of her he agreed to pay to the general owners one half of her earnings. There was no charter-party, nor any agreement in writing; but witnesses were present when the. bargain was made. At that time the vessel was in <em>Boston, </em>partly laden for <em>Philadelphia ; </em>and it was understood by the owners, that she should make a second voyage to <em>Philadelphia </em>and back to <em>Boston </em>within the time. She was so committed to <em>Jennings, </em>although there was no express agreement to this effect. <em>Fiske Bridge </em>had never known <em>Jennings, </em>before the above bargain was made; and it did not appear that any notice was given that the vessel was let to him, until after it was ascertained that he had run away with her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-13\">This evidence was objected to, on the ground that a charter, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>letting to hire of a vessel, could not be proved but by some instrument in writing. The chief justice overruled the objection, and inslincted the jury, that if they were satisfied from the testimony, that the vessel was actually let to Jennings, and continued in his possession under the contract, until the voyage to <em>Boston </em>was abandoned, no barratry was committed for which the underwriters could be charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">[ * 338 ] * The verdict, under this instruction, which was given for the purpose of having the law of the case settled by the whole Court, was for the defendant; and a new trial was moved for, on account of the admission of improper evidence, and because the instruction to the jury was incorrect in point of law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-7\"><em>Webster, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_S\">The evidence was improperly received; and if not, the charge to the jury was wrong. The evidence did not go to prove <em>Jennings </em>the owner of the vessel. Nothing but written documents is proof of property in the case of ships. The <em>general </em>marine law requires that a ship shall always be furnished with her documents, that those who have a right to examine her, may be satisfied respecting her character; as cruisers in time of war, and officers of the customs at all times. They are equally necessary at home, in questions arising qp insurance of freight, and a variety of other contracts. \u201c A bill of sale,\u201d says Sir <em>W. Scott, \u201c </em>is the proper title, to which the maritime courts of all countries would look. It is the universal instrument of transfer of ships, in the usage of all maritime countries ; and in no degree a peculiar title deed or conveyance known only to the law of <em>England. </em>It is what the maritime law expects, what the Court of Admiralty would, in its ordinary practice, always require \u201d <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">The contract in this case was not a letting of the vessel to hire, but merely an agreement in what manner the master was to receive his wages, <em>viz. </em>in a moiety of the profits. If this had been a regular hiring, some agreement would have been made respecting demurrage. The whole plan of the employment of the vessel was settled by <em>Fiske &amp; Bridge, </em>as much as by <em>Jennings. </em>To exonerate general owners, here must be a formal demise of a ship <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. Where the master and mariners of a whaling ship were to receive part of the profits for their services, yet it was helcl to be in the [ * 339 ] nature of wages, not of a partnership <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. * If in the</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-9\">case at bar, in the regular pursuit of the voyage, no freight had been earned, the master would have lost nothing. But the vessel would still be liable for the wages of the seamen.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Curtis, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQBH\">Where a master of a ship is owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>he cannot commit barratry <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>. But to constitute such ownership, the hirer should have actual possession of the vessel, victual and man, and have the exclusive control of her <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">Ships, as all other personal chattels, may be transferred by parole, and will pass by delivery <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmH\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The general question is, whether the case contains proof of barratry, committed by the master of the vessel, on which the goods insured were shipped. If it does, the defendant is answerable, the plaintiffs not being owners of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The misconduct of the master was undoubtedly barratrous; unless he was himself the owner, so that barratry, technically considered, could not be committed by him. .He, was, however, owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>unless a charter-party, or some instrument in writing, be necessary to make him such; because, according to the terms of the parole contract, he had possession of the vessel, and the entire control of her for a period, including the time when the act took place, which caused the loss complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">* Now we have not been able to find, that a vessel [ * 340 ] may not be hired for a voyage, or for a time certain, without writing. By the common law, the whole property of a chattel may be transferred by parole, accompanied by a delivery. In the admiralty it is usual to require a bill of sale, as evidence of property ; and by statute in <em>England </em>a bill of sale is made necessary <footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark>. Here a sale and delivery may be good between the parties, so as to change the property, without a bill of sale or other ' instrument in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Without doubt, then, by the common law, a ship may be hired by a parole contract, so as to be binding on both parties ; and there is no statute of this commonwealth, or of the <em>United States, </em>which makes a charter-party, by deed or writing, essential evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>contract. It is probable that coasting and fishing vessels are not unfrequently hired, without the expense of a charter-party, or other writing between the parties; and a contract to that effect, proved by witnesses, must be valid <footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In the case before us, it appears that <em>Jennings </em>had acquired a right to the use of the vessel, from November, 1815, to May, 1816. There was no stipulation as to the employment in which she was to be kept; although it was expected that, during this time, she should make two trips from <em>Boston </em>to <em>Philadelphia </em>and back. The whole management of the vessel was committed to <em>Jennings ; </em>and within the time stipulated, he had a lawful right to exclude the general owners from the possession. For the hire of the vessel, he was to pay over to them one half of her earnings, without any deduction, except for repairs. There was no relation of master and owners between <em>Jennings </em>and <em>Fislce Sf Bridge; </em>and although <em>Jennings </em>would be accountable to them for any act which tended to deprive them of the fruits of the contract, or for not returning the vessel at the end of the term for which he had hired her, yet the offence of barratry could not be committed by him. For [ * 341 ] he, as master, violated no duty to them, as * owners, but merely committed a breach of his contract with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">To test this principle, let us suppose that <em>Jennings </em>had sold his cargo in the <em>West </em>Indies, had returned with the vessel, delivered her to the owners within the time stipulated, and offered to pay them one half the earnings during the time; what injury would the owners have suffered, or what cause of complaint would they have had against him ? Certainly none ; and yet his contract with the shippers would have been broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">If there had been a stipulation at the time of the hiring, that the vessel should be employed in coasting between <em>Philadelphia </em>and Boston, still a departure from that course would not have been barratrous, for want of the relation between him and the owners. According to the terms of the contract, as far as they appear, <em>Jennings </em>might have employed any other person as master; and in such case barratry might have been committed against him, but not against those of whom he hired the vessel <footnotemark>(11)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(9)\">\n<p id=\"APH\"> <em>Stat </em>34 <em>Geo. </em>3, <em>c. </em>68</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(10)\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> [Vide <em>Ohl </em>vs. <em>The Eagle Ins.
