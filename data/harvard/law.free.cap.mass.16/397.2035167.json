Ives, </em>attached a certain still, as the property of said <em>Ives, </em>and afterwards sold it upon execution. One <em>R. Ives, </em>claiming property in the said still, sued his action against <em>King </em>for so taking and selling the same, * and recovered judgment for the value there- [ * 398 ] of and costs. The said <em>Fowler &amp;/\u25a0 AL </em>undertook by their promise, in writing, to save <em>King </em>harmless from all cost and trouble on account of the last-mentioned suit; and <em>King\u2019s </em>action is brought upon that promise. The said <em>R. Ives </em>sued out his execution upon the judgment against <em>King, </em>who, having no means of satisfying it from his own property, made a legal assignment of the said promise of <em>Fowler Sf Al. </em>to the said <em>R. Ives </em>in satisfaction of his said execution ; and the action so instituted in <em>King\u2019s </em>name is prosecuted for the benefit of him, the said <em>Ives. </em>While <em>Ives\u2019s </em>execution was in the hands of the sheriff, <em>Fowler </em>was informed of <em>King\u2019s </em>intention to make the said assignment, and, afterwards, of his having made it, by the attorney of <em>Ives; </em>and made no suggestion that he had any claim upon <em>King, </em>nor was such claim known to <em>Ives, </em>until after the action in the name of <em>King </em>was entered in the Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-9\"><em>Fowler\u2019s </em>action against <em>King </em>was upon a promissory note, given by <em>King </em>to <em>Fowler, </em>prior to any of the before-recited transactions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-10\">If the Court, upon these facts, should be of opinion that <em>Fowler </em>was entitled to have his claim against <em>King, </em>or any part thereof, set off in <em>King\u2019s </em>action against <em>Fowler Al., </em>it was to be so done, and judgment rendered for the balance. Otherwise, judgment was to be rendered in each action according to the declaration.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-11\"><em>Bliss </em>and <em>Blair, </em>of counsel for <em>Fowler &amp;/\u25a0 AL,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATB\">argued that the</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0x\">Court have a general authority to set off one judgment against another between the same parties; and in cases, too, where the parties are not precisely the same <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. And they do this, notwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>standing one of the demands may have been assigned to a stranger <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. In the case of <em>Steward </em>vs. <em>Anderson </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>, which was an action by the assignee of a negotiable promissory note against the maker, it was decided that the latter might set off a note of the assignor, which he held at the time of receiving notice [ * 399 ] of the assignment of his own note; although * the note thus set off was not due at the time of the notice, but became due before the note on which the suit was brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">It matters not that the contract with <em>King </em>was made with him as a deputy sheriff; for it was still only for his personal benefit. The assignee of a chose in action, not negotiable, takes it subject to all the liabilities of the assignor. <em>Fowler </em>has lost none of his legal rights by his silence, however he may have betrayed a want of frankness commendable as belonging to good neighborhood. He was not the debtor of <em>King, </em>beyond the balance of their mutual demands <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-6\"><em>E. H.

The assignment by <em>King </em>to <em>Ives </em>was for a valuable consideration ; and <em>Fowler </em>having had notice that it was about to be made, should have given notice of his counter demand against <em>King, </em>in season to prevent <em>Ives </em>from giving up his remedy upon execution. Instead of which he was silent not only then, but on the day when the assignment was made, having had previous notice for a week. Further, after formal notice that the assignment was actually made, he does not object, but conceals his intention, until a suit is commenced against him and the other defendants by <em>Ivts. </em>This conduct must be considered in equity, as a waiver of any right to set off, and an acquiescence in the. assignment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
