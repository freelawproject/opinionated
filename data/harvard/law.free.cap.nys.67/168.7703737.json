Plaintiff\u2019s evidence relating to the making of the second agreement is amply supported by the evidence of disinterested witnesses, and, as a contract under seal may be annulled by a substituted parol agreement followed by actual performance (McCreery v. Day, 119 N. Y. 1, 23 N. E. 198, 6 L. R. A. 503), the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
