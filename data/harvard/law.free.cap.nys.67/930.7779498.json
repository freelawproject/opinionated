'Section 1298 of the New York City consolidation act requires that when the defendant, or either of several defendants, in a municipal court, is not a resident of the city, the summons must be returnable in not less than two, nor more than four, days from its date. The summons in this case did not comply with this requirement, being returnable ten days after its date. Under such a summons, the municipal court never acquired jurisdiction to award any judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>against the defendant. Willins v.
