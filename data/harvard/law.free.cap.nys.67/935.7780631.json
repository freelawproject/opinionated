Our attention has been called to several alleged errors upon the trial, but it will not be necessary to examine all of them. At the request of the plaintiff, the court charged the jury that they might grant punitive damages if they found that the representations had been made willfully, and with knowledge that they could not be carried out, up to the amount of $1,200. This was clear error. There was nothing in the case to warrant the submission of the question of punitive damages to the jury, and, from the very large verdict rendered, we cannot but assume that this error prejudiced the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">The plaintiff insisted upon the trial, and still insists, that his action is for damages for false representation, and not for breach of contract. If upon'the facts of the case he can recover at all upon this theory, he certainly cannot so recover against the defendant Lena Solomon; for, although she may have been interested in the sale to plaintiff, the evidence fails to show that she had made any representations whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-17\">The evidence as to a prior transaction, in which one Bollman was concerned, was improperly admitted; for it nowhere appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>the landlord\u2019s aversion to permitting the store to be used for a butcher shop was ever communicated to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants in this court and in the court below to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
