Plaintiff\u2019s husband died on February 17, 1900, and it is conceded that no dues were paid by him from the 30th of the preceding June. The only section of the by-laws invoked by the defendant to sustain its contention that the decedent was disqualified at the time of his death is section 58, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">\u201cAny member whose dues remain unpaid for thirteen weeks shall be allowed until the following meeting after said thirteen weeks time to pay the same, and, if not then paid, shall not be entitled to receive the benefits of this lodge until four weeks after paying the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">It is evident that two things must concur to deprive a member of the benefits of the association under this provision of the by-laws: First, he must be in arrears in the payment of his dues for 13 weeks; and, secondly, he must fail to pay such arrears by the next succeeding meeting. The disqualification is not effected by the member being 13 weeks in arrears, but by his neglect to pay the same by the following meeting. There is no evidence in the case showing that any meeting has taken place since the decedent became indebted for the 13 weeks, and that was part of the defendant\u2019s case. It being conceded that the deceased was a member of the defendant\u2019s lodge at the time of his death, the burden was on the defendant to establish the violation or neglect of some law by which the rights of the plaintiff\u2019s deceased were impaired or forfeited. Elmer v. Association (Sup.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 289, affirmed in 138 N. Y. 642, 34 N. E. 512; Demings v. Supreme Lodge, 60 Hun, 350, 14 N. Y. Supp. 834; Meagher v. Life Union, 65 Hun, 358, 20 N. Y. Supp. 247. It was correctly held, therefore, that the defense was not established, and the judgment for the plaintiff must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
