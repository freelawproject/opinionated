His testimony, which was the sole testimony on that point, was contradicted by the defendant. If this was the whole case,, we would not interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>the decision of the justice, who had the witnesses before him-; but the plaintiff is contradicted by his letters of the 19th and 20th of April, 1900, in which letters he does not claim that there had been a new leasing, but claims the right to hold the defendant under the old lease. It seems to us that if the plaintiff had made an oral lease with the defendant, as claimed by him (the plaintiff), he would not have written the letters above referred to. In both of the letters he puts his right to hold the defendant upon the ground that, because of defendant\u2019s failure to give him a three-months notice of his (the defendant\u2019s) intention not to renew a lease, he thereby became responsible for the rent of the premises for a full year, commencing May 1st. In his letter of April 20th plaintiff says: \u201cI decline to release you from the payment of rent of said building upon the ground set forth in my letter of yesterday, viz. that under the terms of the lease, if it was your intention to vacate, you should have given me notice on or before February 1st last.\u201d A careful perusal of the evidence convinces us that there was no new leasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">Judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
