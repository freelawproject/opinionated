The defendant was indebted to plaintiff\u2019s assignor in the sum of $81.79. She offered to settle the indebtedness for $50. The creditor\u2019s collector accepted the money, giving a receipt in the following words: \u201cReceived from Dora Heuer $50 for full settlement of above amount, providing other creditors do the same.\u201d Assuming that this receipt may be construed as intended for. a release of the balance of the indebtedness over the amount paid, it is clear that it is ineffectual and void because founded on no consideration. In paying the $50 the defendant did no more than she was legally liable to do in any event. The performance of an act which a party is under a previous legal obligation to do is not a sufficient consideration, for a new contract. Vanderbilt v. Schreyer, 91 N. Y. 392-401; Halliday v. Hart, 30 N. Y. 474. The reference to other creditors in the receipt, and the fact that other creditors did in fact accept less than the face amounts of their claims, do not help the defendant. There is no evidence to show that the creditors ever agreed among themselves to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>\u2022general scheme of adjustment of defendant\u2019s obligations. Indeed, the evidence, so far as it goes, would negative such a presumption, since no' uniform percentage of reduction seems to have been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
