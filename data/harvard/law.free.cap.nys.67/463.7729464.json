Plaintiff claims that he was wrongfully discharged on October 25, 1898. The burden of proof to establish the contract of employment for the aforesaid period was on the plaintiff. The plaintiff, to substantiate said contract, testified as a witness on his own behalf that one Millard F. Smith, who acted for and on behalf of the defendants, told him, \u201cYou will have a commission upon every sale, and in addition to that you will have, by the 1st of January, a certain profit upon the showing department,\u201d and also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">\u201cAfter I was about four months in the employ of the defendants, said Smith told me, \u2018You run this department until the 1st of January;\u2019 and Smith asked me. \u2018How long will it take you to stop?\u2019 (meaning to finish the work which I then had on hand). I said I might be able to get through this work in a week, in a month, or perhaps not until the first of January.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">Thomas McCord, a witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, testified \"as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">\u201cI heard Mr. Lee [the plaintiff) ask for a specific engagement, and I heard Mr. Smith say that his word was good enough for an engagement up to the end of the year. I do not know what his idea was. He said that his word was good enough to the end of the year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">This is all the evidence in the case in regard to the establishment of the contract of employment. The defendants deny that- there was an employment for a fixed period. In our opinion, this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>deuce is insufficient to establish a contract of employment for the period mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The verdict, therefore, is not sustained by the evidence, and the judgment and order appealed from are reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">McCARTHY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
