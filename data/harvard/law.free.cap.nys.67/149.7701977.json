Although it appears a specific contract had been entered into between the parties, the plaintiff was not confined to an action for damages for the breach thereof. Where a contract has been partially performed, and the defendant prevents the completion thereof, the aggrieved party may sue on a quantum meruit for the work done. Farron v. Sherwood, 17 N. Y. 227. As the item allowed for the expenses in returning the machine to Baltimore have not been incurred, and are not reasonably certain to be incurred, they should have been withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. The judgment will therefore be reduced to $171.79, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
