The tide ebbs and flows in said Jamaica Bay, and the defendant has received the full approval of the federal authorities to the construction of its said structure, and proposes to construct the same upon land which it owns .and has acquired under long-time leases from the owners of such land. The plaintiff owns certain land on Jamaica Bay, and land under water in said Jamaica Bay, distant three or four miles from the proposed structure of the defendant, and claims that the erection of such structure by the defendant will delay the movement of the high tide some fifteen minutes. It does not appear that such detention of tide will cause any damage to the property lying upon or underneath Jamaica Bay, nor does it appear that any special damage will be occasioned to the property of this plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s proposed work, therefore, being done under proper authority of law, and the plaintiff not sustaining any general or special damage, I direct that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed, and that the temporary injunction heretofore granted herein be vacated and set aside, and that the defendant have its costs as taxed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b583-9\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"APX\">.The plaintiff brought this action to enjoin the construction of a turnpike road which the defendant purposed to build across Jamaica Bay from the dividing line of Kings and Queens counties to Rockaway Beach. He is the owner of property \u2022situate on the shore of the bay and of adjacent land under water about four miles distant from the route of the turnpike. He contends that the turnpike would be an unlawful interference with public waters of the state and with the navigation of the bay, and would cause injury to his property. The court dismissed the complaint, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">We are clearly of the opinion that the plaintiff has no standing to maintain an action of this character, for the reasons stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice JENKS, hereto appended, before whom the case was tried. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
