The action appears to have been tried and submitted to the jury upon the theory that the carelessness and negligence complained of were due to the manner in which the car was operated, and there is no exception to the charge of the court to the jury, in which this view of the case is taken. Upon the trial, however, plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to prove that other accidents of a like nature had happened in the locality, and the exceptions. taken to the exclusion of evidence present the only questions upon this appeal. Assuming that the exceptions raise the question, we are of opinion that reversible error is not shown, under the circumstances of this case. The theory upon which evidence of previous accidents is admitted is to show that a condition of facts present at the time of the accident was in fact dangerous, and that notice of the danger had been brought, actually or constructively, to the attention of the party who owed the duty of maintaining the particular place in a condition of safety. Proceeding upon the theory that the accident was due to the defendant operating its car with great speed and in a careless and negligent manner, the plaintiff asked the witness William Salzer, who had testified as to the general location and the condition of the surroundings of the track: Won say, before the accident you frequently were on the cars of this company by this spot,\u2014this gate? A. Yes, sir. Q. Were you ever upon a car of this company prior to this accident, a month or two prior to Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ber, when the car ran off the track at that point?\u201d This was objected to as \u201cincompetent, immaterial, and irrelevant, and nothing to do with this issue.\u201d The court suggested that \u201cthere ought to be some defect proved in the track, first,\u201d whereupon the witness was withdrawn, and Michael J. Mack, a civil engineer, was called, who testified generally as to the condition of the track in the vicinity of the accident, but with no special reference to the exact point at which the car left the track; and, so far as his testimony goes, there is nothing to indicate that the track was not constructed in the usual manner. Mr. Salzer was recalled, and questioned as follows: \u201cNow, I ask you the question that I asked you before: Do you remember being on a car of this company at this point in question previous to the accident when the car went off the track?\u201d This was objected to as \u201cimmaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent; proof of another accident having nothing to do with this cause of action, and not pleaded. It is not shown that the facts or circumstances were the same.\u201d The court asked the witness: \u201cDid you look at the tracks? A. No, sir; but what I can state, why I rode on them.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel interposed an objection, and the court excluded the answer, to which plaintiff excepted. There was no evidence to show that the facts and circumstances were the same at the time mentioned in the question. The exact point at which the car left the track wras not shown. To have allowed the witness to tell of previous accidents in the same general locality* without\u2019 establishing the fact that the conditions were the same, would have been to introduce mere speculation into the case, and to permit the jury to consider facts in no way related to the present cause of action. If it had been shown that there was some peculiarity in the construction of the track at a given point, and that the car on which the plaintiff was riding left the track at that point, it would have been proper to introduce evidence tending to show that other cars had left the track at the same point under similar conditions, as this would have a tendency to show that there was a defect in the track, and that the defendant had had notice of this defect by reason of the fact that other accidents had happened there, and a failure to remedy the defect would constitute negligence, or at least the jury would be justified in finding that the defendant had failed in the discharge of its duty to the plaintiff; but beyond this it is doubtful if the authorities in this state sanction the introduction of evidence of independent accidents. This is clearly the doctrine of this court in Lundbeck v. City of Brooklyn, 26 App. Div. 595, 50 N. Y. Supp. 421, where we held that it was competent for the plaintiff to show that a stump in one of the streets of Brooklyn \u201cwas so located that it was a constant menace to the safety of pedestrians, and to this end it was proper to show that others had stumbled over this stump \u25a0while in substantially the same condition as that which existed at \u2022the time of the accident.\u201d It was there said that \u201cevidence of tin's .character was calculated to establish the length of time this obstruction had remained, and of the opportunity which had been afforded \u25a0the city of knowing of its existence. It was equally important in .establishing the character of the obstruction, and the probabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of its operating to produce the result which is alleged to have been produced in the case at bar.\u201d So, in the case of Wooley v. Railroad Co., 83 N. Y. 121, 130, it was held that \u201cit was not error to receive testimony of the fact that there had been other accidents at the same switch\u201d; but the evidence related to accidents at a given place, and at the place where the plaintiff received the injury for which he sought to recover, and involved the same principle as in the case of Lundbeck v. City of Brooklyn, supra. The location of the switch, the manner of its construction, and the fact that it stood above the level of the street, were all in evidence. It was also in evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s mishap occurred at this particular switch, and evidence of the previous accidents was admissible to show that the defendant must have had notice of the dangers which its continued use in the then condition entailed. There were no such facts before the jury in the case at bar, and the exclusion of the evidence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
