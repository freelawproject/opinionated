The proof shows that said replevin suit was tried on June 18, 1897, before Mr. Justice McAdam and a jury, and during the course of the trial defendant withdrew the claim for damages in the sum of $165. A verdict was rendered on June 18, 1897, for the defendant, for the return of the property claimed, and assessing the value thereof at $350, with 6 cents damages. The defendant thereupon entered judgment for the said sum of $350, the further sum of 6 cents damages, and $165.47 costs. Thereafter the defendant herein paid said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>judgment, which, was duly satisfied of record. Thereafter this action was brought for the alleged wrongful and malicious institution oh the said replevin action, and also for the alleged unlawful and malicious taking of the said chattels.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The plaintiff here having, in his answer in the replevin action, demanded a return of the chattels replevied, or the value thereof, and. for damages for the detention thereof, and the verdict and judgment entered having awarded him the return of the chattels replevied, or the value, together with six cents, his damages, another-action for the recovery of damages by reason of the taking and detention of the chattels may not be maintained; and in this action-the plaintiff will be precluded from again litigating a question decided in the replevin action. The cause of action, however, that is set forth in the complaint is for a malicious prosecution (although-damages are also claimed for the taking of the chattels), and the-plaintiff is entitled to maintain the action, and recover the damages-he may have sustained by reason of the malicious prosecution, without probable cause, of an unfounded proceeding; and, if the jury were satisfied that the plaintiff had proven a malicious prosecution-on the part of the defendant, then, at least one item of damage was-shown, viz. the fee of $150 paid the attorney for defending the action. Upon the pleadings and evidence it was the duty of the trial justice to submit the case to the jury, and, having refused to do so, it follows that the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be sustained, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event.
