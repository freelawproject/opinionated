Trial\u2014Question for Jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b980-10\">Where the issue whs whether plaintiffs had delivered goods to defendants on the day required by the contract, and the only evidence was the testimony of a witness, who stated he offered the goods on that day, and later stated he offered them on a subsequent day, a finding that they were delivered on the agreed day was error, since the question was for the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b980-11\">8.

The only evidence as to delivery is that of the witness McMahon, called by the plaintiffs, who testifies that he offered the goods on the 25th of September, and that the offer was made after Dewey Day, the 29th. The evidence of the witness Cadwalder is not as to delivery, but merely as to sending the goods out for delivery. The case should not have been submitted to the jury .upon the evidence as to delivery on the 25th. As a finding that there was a delivery on the 25th was not warranted by the evidence, there was no preponderance of evidence that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>The case should not have been submitted to the jury upon the theory of a waiver of performance as to time, as no waiver had been pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">If an amendment conforming the pleadings to the proof were otherwise proper, it should not now be made, in view of the fact that a motion to dismiss was made at the close of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The question asked by the counsel for the defendants, after the denial of his motion, was, in our opinion, an inquiry for information, and in no sense a request or acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">The judgments and orders are reversed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
