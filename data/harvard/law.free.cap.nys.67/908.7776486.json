Under these circumstances, a recovery for work, labor, and services rendered, and materials furnished, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">The plaintiff contends, however, that the sketches were returned in such a mutilated, condition that they are practically valueless. Even conceding this to be so, damages upon that theory cannot be recovered in the action as now framed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
