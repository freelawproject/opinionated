Proc. \u00a7 3343, subd. 10, defines an \u201cinjury to property\u201d as an actionable act whereby the estate -of another is lessened, other than a personal injury, or the breach of a contract; and section 501, subd. 2, provides that a counterclaim in an action on contract must be a cause of action arising out of the transaction set forth in the complaint, or any other cause of action on contract existing at the commencement of the action. <em>Held </em>that, in an action to recover for goods sold and delivered, defendant cannot sustain a counterclaim for an injury to realty, being in tort, which did not arise out of the transaction set forth in the complaint, and which was not connected with the subject of the action.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1000-9\">Appeal from municipal court, borough of Manhattan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1000-10\">Action by Edward Cufi against the Craftman\u2019s Club.

The answer, in addition to a general denial, sets up a counterclaim for $238, as follows: $188 for injury to real property caused by the alleged removal by the plaintiff of his fixtures therefrom, and $50 for the plaintiff\u2019s share of the 'Croton water rent of said premises while occupying the same as a tenant of the defendant. Upon the trial the parties agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s share of said water rent was $45, and the defendant admitted the correctness of plaintiff\u2019s claim, except as to an item for a range, amounting to the sum of $45, which the latter conceded was not delivered to the defendant. The justice dismissed the remainder of the counterclaim, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim, less $30 for a range and $45 for plaintiff\u2019s share of the water rent. The defendant thereupon appealed to this court. We think the justice properly dismissed the counterclaim- for injury to real property, since it proceeded, not upon contract, but in tort (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3343, subd. 10), and did not arise out of the transaction set forth in the complaint, nor was it connected with the subject of the action (Id. \u00a7 501, subd. 2; Telegraph Co. v. Milliken, 14 Daly, 170; De Forest v. Andrews, 27 Misc. Rep. 145, 58 N. Y. Supp. 358).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
