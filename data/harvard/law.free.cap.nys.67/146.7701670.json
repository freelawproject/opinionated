Enc. Law, 642. But the plaintiff in this case is in no position to invoke the benefit of this rule. He was a person directly connected with the transaction. He was the only winner in the game, and there is no authority going to the extent of permitting a winner to recover from a loser, no matter what form the loan may take.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
