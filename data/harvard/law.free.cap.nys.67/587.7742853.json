Subdivision 5 of section 791 of the Code provides that an action is entitled to a preference in which an infant is the sole plaintiff. The pleadings show that this is such a cause. The record shows, and it is not disputed, that the notice of motion for preference was served with the notice of trial, as required by section 793 of the 'Code. The claim of preference thus perfected thereupon became an absolute right. Rhoads v. Railway Co., 50 App. Div. 160, 63 2T. Y. Supp. 724; Levy v. Hanneman, 47 App. Div. 32, 62 N. Y.
