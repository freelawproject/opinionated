The complaint avers that there was no such overdraft of $6,400, and that the defendant, having exclusive control of the partnership books, would not permit the plaintiff to examine them. After issue was joined, the plaintiff applied for an order directing the defendant to accord him an examination of the hooks in the office of the defendant\u2019s attorneys, by depositing them there for plaintiff\u2019s inspection. In support of the application it is stated that the plaintiff during \u25a0 the partnership had been ill, and never had a full opportunity to examine the books, and had relied upon defendant\u2019s statements when be gave the note for $3,200, which statements he now alleges were untrue. In opposition to the application the defendant stated that the partnership had been dissolved by mutual consent, and the question of accounts left to an arbitrator, who found that the plaintiff bad overdrawn, and recommended a compromise; that the plaintiff had access to the note for $3,200. The defendant\u2019s affidavit also contains the statement that owing to the plaintiff\u2019s illness he has not devoted to the partnership business, from its formation to its dissolution, more than five days in a period of two years. The plaintiff\u2019s application for an examination was denied, and from the order so entered he appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b311-16\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Kelly v. Eckford, 5 Paige, 548; Stebbins v. Harmon, 17 Hun, 445. And it is only where it can be seen that the application is made, in bad faith that he will be refused the privilege. The fact that the partnership is dissolved does not change the rule, the courts recognizing the right of a former partner to have access to the books at all reasonable times. Bearns v. Burras, 86 Hun, 258, 33 N. Y. Supp. 262. It is conceded that a partnership existed here between the parties, that it was dissolved, and that during its existence the books were in the exclusive custody and control of the defendant; and it is thus apparent that without opportunity for examination the plaintiff cannot obtain the facts necessary to prove the allegation of the complaint that by false representations he was induced to give a note for a larger amount than he actually owed. It was suggested at special term that the evidence desired could be obtained on the trial by a subpoena duces tecum. Although this is the remedy that would ordinarily be accorded to a third person who sought to examine the firm\u2019s books, it has no application where one of the partners is asking for an opportunity to see and examine what are really his own books. Nor do we think the further objection that a casual inspection was on one occasion granted the plaintiff is a sufficient reason for refusing his request, because, apart from the fact appearing that he was unable on that occasion to get the information desired, he is entitled at all reasonable times to an examination of the partnership books. They belong to him just as much as to the defendant, and the fact that the latter has taken control and possession of them is not sufficient ground for preventing the plaintiff; within proper bounds, having access to them. Here the plaintiff wished to have the books deposited in the office of the attorneys for the defendant,\u2014a disposition which, without their consent, the court could not make. The fact, however, that the place designated was not proper or suitable, is not sufficient cause for denying an examination at some other place, either by requiring the deposit of the books in court, or by the parties agreeing upon some place where, without injury to the defendant,\u2014if those same books are still being used by him,\u2014the plaintiff could obtain the \u25a0 examination asked for. If the parties cannot agree as to the place, it will be fixed by the court on the settlement of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We think the order should accordingly be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
