Two years prior to the bringing of the action the Colorado Coal &amp; Iron Company consolidated with the Colorado Fuel Company to form a new corporation, known as the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company, of which J. 0.

Either the defendant, by its action in consolidating, made it impossible for the plaintiff to perform, and so become liable as for a breach, or there was a breach of the contract, caused by the plaintiffs\u2019 discharge through Osgood. At all events, it is quite clear that the plaintiff did not and could not perform his contract after the consolidation, and, as the action is to recover as for performance, the complaint should have been dismissed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
