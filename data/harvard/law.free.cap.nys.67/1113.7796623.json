Code \u00a7 996. The defendants properly pleaded a good defense in fact and law,\u2014an adjudication in bankruptcy; and a number of questions to witnesses at the trial, tending to lay a foundation for introduction of the best evidence to substantiate such defense, were objected to, ruled out, and exceptions duly taken. Most of these objections were well made, but we find that the papers on appeal carry a sufficient weight of competent testimony proffered by appellants, but ruled out, to justify the assertion of error below. It seems to us that the appellants were not given an entirely fair opportunity for making their proofs and completing their right to introduce documentary evidence, that they ought to be allowed it by a second trial, and that they are duly protected by the record made below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-16\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-17\">O\u2019DWYER, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
