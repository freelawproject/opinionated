Railroad Co., 41 App. Div. 89, 58 N. Y. Supp. 113); but, as the defendant could not be harmed thereby, it need not receive further consideration. The judgment must be reversed, however, for error committed in allowing the witness Nott to express an opinion as to whether the defendant\u2019s car or the tender could have first crossed the point of intersection where the collision occurred. This bore directly upon the vital question in the case, and was not a subject requiring or permitting the expression of expert skill or knowledge. Dougherty v. Milliken, 163 N. Y. 527, 57 N. E. 757. The respondent admits that there was a sharp conflict in the evidence, and/ under the circumstances, we think that the admission of this testimony, over defendant\u2019s objection and exception, was prejudicial. The witness was thereby permitted to encroach upon the province of the jury, and, being an eyewitness of the occurrence, his opinion, improperly received, may have unduly impressed the jury in deciding the issues in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
