The action was properly brought against the defendant individually. Paper Co. v. Hunt, 9 N. Y. St. Rep. 31, A demand was not necessary to be made upon the assignors, and the evidence shows that the capes in question were not sold to the defendant\u2019s assignors, but, on the contrary, came into their possession on memorandum, for account of the plaintiffs. There was no conflict in the evidence upon the question of value, and defendant did not ask to go to the jury on that question. The form of the judgment conforms sufficiently to the facts and verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-19\">Judgment appealed1 from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
