It thus appears that the services were rendered for the underwriters composing the People\u2019s Fire Lloyds, and not for this defendant. The verdict is against the weight of evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>.and must be set aside, and a new trial ordered.
