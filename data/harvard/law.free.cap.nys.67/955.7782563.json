An examination of the case shows that there is evidence which, if believed by the jury, warranted it in finding for the plaintiff. Hone of the exceptions was well taken. The letter offered in evidence by the plaintiff tended to contradict the defendant\u2019s testimony, and therefore was admissible. The evidence excluded at folio 92 was not excepted to. The exception at folio 86 was not well taken. The question asked had no bearing upon the case. The exception to the charge was not well taken. The trial judge, in effect, told the jury that if the plaintiff was insolent towards his employer, or if he refused to obey his employer, he was not entitled to recover. This was a direct exposition of the law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-20\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
