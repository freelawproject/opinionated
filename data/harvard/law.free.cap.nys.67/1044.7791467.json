As the requests in question were improperly excluded from the record by the trial justice, and are, therefore, not before us, we cannot assume that they were but repetitions of the instructions given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
