The remaining allegations of the petition are purely formal, and a commission of three persons is asked for under the provisions of the village law. The answer of the village of Larchmont admits the formal allegations of the petition, denies having sufficient information to form a belief as to the ownership of the said lot 16, and denies that the defendant had, in fact, changed the grade of said Addison avenue in \u2022front of the premises alleged to. be owned by the petitioner. The issues joined were, therefore, aside from the ownership of the premises, whether any change of grade had been effected in Addison avenue at the place and time alleged; and, if so, whether by the due authority of the village. Upon the trial the learned court at special term found as a matter of fact that \u201cduring the months of November and December, 1899, the said village of. Larchmont changed the grade of the said Addison avenue in front of the premises above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>described, which change consisted in the raising of the roadbed of said Addison avenue, which change of grade damaged and injuriously affected the land above described and the use thereof.\u201d As \u00e1 conclusion of law the learned court held \u201cthat the change of grade as aforesaid in the street known as \u2018Addison Avenue\u2019 in front of the petitioner\u2019s premises is in law a change of grade as contemplated by the statute,\u201d and that \u201cthe petitioner is entitled to have three commissioners appointed to determine. the compensation to which he is entitled by reason of the said change of grade.\u201d The defendant excepted to this finding of fact and conclusions of law, and upon this appeal we are called upon to determine whether the court has erred in its disposition of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The ordinary meaning of the term \u201cgrade\u201d is the amount of difference between grade line and a level or horizontal line, and to grade a street is to bring the surface of the street to the grade line. \u202214 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 1106, and authorities there cited. Therefore, when the village of Larchmont contracted with one Michael Decicco \u201cfor the construction of sewers and drains on a portion of the Boston post road, a portion of Chatsworth avenue, Addison street or avenue, and a portion of Collins avenue; also the outlet and the grading of Addison street and a portion of Chatsworth avenue,\u201d\u2014 it may be understood as a contract to bring those streets and avenues to the established grade line, and not as an authority for changing the grade. This is made manifest by the provision of the contract that \u201cportions of 'Chatsworth avenue and Addison street are to be graded as shown by the profiles of street filed in the office of the\" engineer and marked on the ground by him, the cross-sectional form- of the streets to be made as directed by him.\u201d There is no suggestion in this of a change of the established grade, but a provision that the streets shall be brought to the grade line. There are no resolutions or ordinances of the village of Larchmont directing a change of grade. The contract, as we have seen, makes no such suggestion, and we are called upon, therefore, to examine the oral evidence to determine whether a change in fact has been accomplished under such circumstances that the village may be properly held to have taken private property in the contemplation of section 159 of the general village law (chapter 414, Laws 1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Alonzo Reynolds, a witness sworn in behalf of the petitioner, testified: That he had been employed as an assistant in surveying for a period of 6-\u00a1- years, and that he had subsequently been employed by the defendant as a police officer. That he resigned as such officer on the 15th day of November, 1899. That he was\" familiar with the location of the premises of the petitioner. That he saw the work going on under the contractor, Michael Decicco. That he was familiar with the grade of Addison avenue as compared with the lot of the petitioner. That the lot in comparison with the street was practically level. That the situation was changed by the filling in front of the premises. That \u201cI cannot say exactly how much the street was changed in front of ,this lot,-\u2014-approximately a foot and a half. I saw the street in front of this lot after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>\u00a1work was done. I did not measure it with a tape measure. I measured it with my eye. I observed a foot and a half.\u201d Being-pressed for a definite answer, the witness testified that the street was raised a foot. On cross-examination he testified as follows: \"\u201cDo you swear there was any filling done in the roadway,\u2014that the roadway was raised at all? A. In front of Mr. Bissell\u2019s property the road has been altered by being raised. Q. Was it raised one foot? A. As nearly as I ,can tell. Q. Was it raised six inches? A. Using my best judgment. Q. No; positively no? A. By using my best judgment, I say a foot. Q. It was raised a foot in front of Bissell\u2019s lot? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did the filling consist of? Was it done in the middle or the sides ? A. Most of it was done on \u25a0the side.\u201d He further testified that the street was 60 feet wide, \u00a1and that when he first saw it it was not filled in to the full width -of the street. Francis J. Clarke, a dealer in real estate, sworn in \u2022behalf of the petitioner, testified: That he knew the parties. That be was familiar with the street, and with the location of the petitioner\u2019s premises, and with real-estate values in the village of Larchmont. That in reference to Addison avenue, on his observation, he did not think \u201cthe road was its original width. There used \u2022to be a couple of planks down for a walk. They were about one foot from the level of the lot. At the present time the road has been raised about one foot and ten inches.\u201d Asked whether this was \u2018fin the middle of the road or on the side,\u201d witness answered, \u201cOn the side.\u201d Asked how it had been changed in,.the middle, the witness replied: \u201cIt has a slight crown. I could not tell you that without measuring. It has been raised somewhat in the middle. Formerly it slanted down. I mean to say that the original two planks that were there were level with the road. They were on the side of the road.\u201d Asked, \u2018What was done that you saw in December last?\u201d the witness replied: \u201cThe planks were taken away, and the whole business was raised; both the road and what had been a vacant place under the planks.\u201d That the whole side of the road was raised. That the middle of the road was raised. That the side of the road from the planks out to the property line was raised a foot or ten inches. That the middle of the road was raised from ten inches to a foot. On cross-examination it appeared that the witness was the agent of the petitioner to sell this property, and he insisted that the grade was changed by being raised one foot. This is the evidence of the petitioner upon this point, which is the only one important to be considered here. The defendant placed its engineer upon the stand, who testified: That he had been a civil engineer for 10 or 15 years. That he was such in 1898, and that in the early part of that year \u201cI made surveys for the village of Larchmont of what is known as \u2018Addison Avenue.\u2019 I have a memorandum of what the grade of Addison avenue was in front of lot 16 in \u00cd898 .and 1899, both, and in 1900 also. I have the .original -levels in front \u25a0 of lot 16 as they stood in 1898. I also have them in the first part of 1900.\u201d Asked, \u201cWhat lyas the grade in 1898, as shown in your survey?\u201d witness answered: \u201cYou mean in figures or as to change? Q. As to change. A. There was none. They were absolutely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>same within less than one inch. The road in Addison avenue was not altered in any particular that I could And with the level. I am testifying absolutely in regard to lot No. 16 at the same points as held on a level in 1898.\u201d On cross-examination this witness testified that his testimony referred to the road grade; that there was a little material filled in on the side of the street .in front of Mr. Bissell\u2019s property. Michael Decicco testified that he did some contract work on the streets of the village of Larchmont under the contract in evidence. Asked if he did any grading whatever in Addison avenue in front of the Bissell lot, he replied: \u201cNot that I know of, with the exception of the sewer. I laid a sewer in that street.\u201d Asked if he changed the grade of the street by raising or lowering it, the witness answered: \u201cNo, sir. The only change that we made we had a deep cut, and some surplus stuff, and there was a place on the side of Addison avenue where there was a plank walk, and there was a very bad place in there. It was a bad place, and by authority of the board of trustees we got an order to widen out that piece. I could not tell you whether it raised the side of the road above the grade of the road in the center. We had so much stuff left from the sewer there on the middle of the road, and we graded down to the old grade, and probably there was a lot of stuff left there.\u201d On cross-examination this witness testified that he filled the side of the road in front of this property to the extent of a foot and a half, or a little over. If we assume that the grade of Addison avenue had been established at \"the time the work of constructing the sewer upon the street was undertaken, it appears clearly that the full width of the street had not been brought to the grade line; that there was a low spot in front of the petitioner\u2019s property, making it necessary to raise his sidewalk at least 12 inches above the level of the ground in order to conform approximately with the level of the traveled roadway. The evidence, it seems to us, is conclusive that the center of the traveled roadway was not materially changed, and it was within the rights of the municipality to fill up this depression, and to bring the highway to the common grade level at any time. There is no evidence that the profile of Addison avenue referred to in the contract for these sewers made any change in the grade of this street at the point mentioned in the petition, and the evidence is overwhelming that no such change was actually made, except in so far as the excess of material after the sewer excavation was deposited in front of the petitioner\u2019s property, bringing it up to approximately the common level of the traveled portion of the highway. O\u2019Reilley v. City of Kingston, 114 N. Y. 439, 445, 21 N. E. 1004; Whitmore v. Village of Tarrytown, 137 N. Y. 409, 415, 33 N. E. 489, 490. In the case last cited the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1009-3\">\u201cThe grade of the street having been established in 1882, it was not altered or changed by the cutting down of the embankment on either side of the street for the purpose of making the whole street conform to the grade thus established. Such an improvement of a street is not, within the fair meaning of the statute, a \u2018change or alteration\u2019 of the grade thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">The principle is not different because in the case at bar there was a slight fill instead of an excavation, and we are of opinion that it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>was error to hold that the petitioner had brought himself within the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">\u25a0 The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and the order appointing commissioners should be vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
