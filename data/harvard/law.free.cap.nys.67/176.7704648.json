The answer contains a general denial as to part of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, and interposes a counterclaim for the value of services alleged to have been rendered plaintiff by defendant. The action therefore does not fall within either section 982 or 983 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Both parties reside in the county of Herkimer, and under section 984, Id., that is the proper place for the trial of the issues. Oneida county is designated in the complaint as the place of trial. Defendant, with his answer, served a demand that the place of trial he changed to Herkimer, the proper county. Plaintiff having failed to consent to such change, defendant duly made a motion to change the place of trial in accordance with said demand. Plaintiff was permitted, in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion, to read affidavits showing that the convenience of witnesses required that the place of trial be retained in Oneida county, and the court denied defendant\u2019s motion upon that ground. This was error. The proper or\u2022derly practice in such cases is to grant the order changing the place of trial to the proper county. Plaintiff could then have made a motion to change the place of trial back to Oneida county for the convenience of witnesses, and this would have given defendant an opportunity to meet the moving affidavits which he could not have -under the practice adopted in this case excepting by the special favor of the court in granting a postponement of the hearing.
