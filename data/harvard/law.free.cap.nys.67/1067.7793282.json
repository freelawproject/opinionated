The plaintiff, in 1892, became the indorsee of the payee of a promissory note made .by the defendant. This action was brought in 1896, and came to trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>in 1899. At the trial the defendant offered in evidence \u201cthis assignment for the benefit of creditors made by Isabella M. Burton to Theodore M. Henry, filed January 9,1897. Objected; sustained; exception.\u201d It is contended that this was error. I think that the action might be continued in the name of the original party. Section 756, Code.Civ. Proc.; Lawson v. Town of Woodstock, 37 Hun, 352;. Cuff v. Dorland, 7 Abb. N. C. 194. There is a further consideration mentioned in the first authority cited, which makes such continuance-proper, aside from the privilege afforded by the statute. Under such an assignment, the assignor is still interested. If the assignee collect anything, it pays the assignor\u2019s debts, and any surplus would go to the assignor. In McGean v. Railway Co., 133 N. Y. 9, 30 N. E. 647, where the objection raised was that the plaintiff had transferred his realty pending the trial, the court held that section 756 was sufficient authority, unless the court directed that the grantee be made a party,, and that such question could not be raised for the first time upon trial, but must be presented either by motion or by- supplemental pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">The judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with, costs. All concur, except 'SEWELL, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
