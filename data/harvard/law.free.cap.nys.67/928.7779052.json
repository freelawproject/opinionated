This disclosure was contrary to section 835 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The evidence was offered for the purpose of aiding the defendant in his contention, and it may have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-18\">Therefore the judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
