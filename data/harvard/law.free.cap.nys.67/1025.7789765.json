The proceeding should have been dismissed on the ground that the petition on which the precept was issued did not state that Harris Cohen and Abraham Cohen were the landlords\u2019 of the premises from which it was sought to dispossess the tenant. The petition was made by one Harris Budner, who \"respectfully says that .he is the agent for Harris Cohen and Abraham Cohen, landlord of the following premises.\u201d This is not an allegation that Harris Cohen and Abraham Cohen were the landlords of the premises. In the case of Cunningham v. Goelet, 4 Denio, 71, which was also a summary proceeding, the petition was as follows: \"City and County of New York\u2014ss.: Patrick Henry, agent for Peter Goelet, being duly sworn, doth depose and say.\u201d It was there held that the petition was defective, and that the court acquired no jurisdiction by reason of it. See, also, Potter v. Society, 23 Misc. Rep. 671, 52 N. Y. Supp. 294, and Ross v. Same, 23 Misc. Rep. 683, 52 N. Y. Supp. 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-15\">The final order is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
