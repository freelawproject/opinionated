Another witness testified there were seven watchmen, including plaintiff, and that C. worked there before and after plaintiff was removed; that there were only six watchmen after plaintiff left, and C. was doing the same work. He admitted there were eight men who did the work before plaintiff left, and seven afterwards, but one of the men was not a watchman. <em>Eeld </em>not to show that plaintiff\u2019s place was filled by another, to whom plaintiff\u2019s salary was paid, as defense to an action against a city for wages as watchman.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b637-10\">Appeal from trial term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-11\">Action by Thomas McEvoy against the city of New York.

Annexed to the complaint, and set out in extenso, are copies of the order for the mandamus and of the writ. The answer of the defendant admits the original appointment of the plaintiff as a watchman, as alleged in the complaint, but, on information and belief, denies that the plaintiff occupied that position continuously or during all of the time since he was so appointed, or that he has rendered such services for the defendant during all of said time; but, on the contrary, on information and belief, that he was removed from his said position as watchman on the 4th of January, 1899, and did not act as such watchman, or render any services thereafter as said watchman, until after the 8th of May, 1899, when he was restored to his position of watchman, and that during all of the time between the 4th of January, 1899, and the 8th of May, 1899, another person, duly appointed and employed by the defendant, occupied said position, and discharged the said duties of watchman, being the duties of the same position which the plaintiff was before and afterwards employed to discharge, and that before the plaintiff was restored to said position of watchman the defendant, in good faith, paid the person so discharging the duties of watchman between January 4, 1899, and the 8th day of May, 1899, in full for services, at the rate of $2.50 per day. The answer then contains this averment, namely: \u201cIt alleges the facts to be as above stated, and denies each and every allegation to the contrary in said complaint contained.\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">It is now urged that the plaintiff was not entitled to a verdict because of a failure to prove the allegations of the complaint respecting the issuance of the order for the mandamus and the writ. It was unnecessary for the plaintiff to do so under the pleadings. There is no denial of the allegations of the complaint relating to them. The answer denies merely each and every allegation of the complaint con- ' trary to what is alleged in the answer. It is not alleged in the answer that-the order was not made and the writ of mandamus not issued. There is no general denial in the answer, and the quoted allegations put nothing in issue respecting the adjudged rights of the plaintiff under the writ of mandamus. By the adjudication made when the writ was issued, it was determined that the plaintiff was entitled to his position as watchman and to his salary, and the requirement was made that his name be put upon the pay roll, in order that he might receive his salary. In the face of that adjudication, we do not see how the plaintiff\u2019s right to recovery can be questioned. But, even if that were not so, the defendant failed to prove that the plaintiff\u2019s position from the 4th of January, 1899, to the 8th of May, 1899, was filled by another appointee, to whom the wages or salary of that position was paid, or who was paid for rendering the same service. One of the defendant\u2019s witnesses testifies that during this interval another man, subsequently identified as one Coogan, did the same class of work that the plaintiff was engaged to do,\u2014that is, the work of a watchman; that there were seven watchmen altogether, and that, after the plaintiff\u2019s removal, seven persons were engaged in doing the same work; and that each of those persons was paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the city. But this witness was not willing to swear that there were-more than six w\u00e1tchmen after the plaintiff\u2019s removal. There were seven men who did the work of watchmen, but one of them may have been under some other title. Another witness, who was keeper of. the reservoir (at which place the plaintiff had always worked), swore there were seven men, including McEvoy, who were watchmen at that place, and that Coogan was working there before and after the plaintiff was removed; that there were only six watchmen, after the plaintiff went away, but that Coogan was doing the same work; but this same witness, in answer to a direct question by the court as to how many men patrolled the reservoir before the plaintiff was removed, gave the following answer: \u201cThere were eight before and seven afterwards.\u201d This witness also stated that before McEvoy left there were seven watchmen, and that the eighth person was patrolling, but that he did not call him a watchman; that he was not appointed as a watchman; that he was an assistant foreman. The proof shows that there were eight persons doing patrolling or watching before January 4th; that between January 4 and May 18, 1899', there were only seven persons; and it is impossible to infer from this-evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s position as watchman was filled by somebody else, and that the salary as such was paid to that other person. There is no evidence that any new man was appointed, and the plaintiff was entitled to the direction of a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">RUMSEY, O\u2019BRIEN, and McLATJGHLIN, JJ.,. concur.
