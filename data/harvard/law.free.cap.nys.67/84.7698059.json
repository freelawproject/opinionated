The defense was that the plaintiff left the defendant\u2019s employ before the expiration of the month for which she was employed, and the justice decided the issues in favor of the defendant. We think that this determination is amply supported by the evidence, and the applicant\u2019s contention that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence cannot be viewed as \"well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">The justice had the power to permit an amendment of the answer setting up the plea of payment (Milch v. Insurance Co., 13 Misc. Rep. 231, 34 N. Y. Supp. 15; Thedford v. Read, 28 Misc. Rep. 563, 59 N. Y. Supp. 537); but, in any event, the amendment did not affect the result, since the issues were determined upon a different ground of defense, and payment was not in the case, except so far as involved in the defendant\u2019s gratuitous payment into court of a sum to which the plaintiff was not actually entitled as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
