It may be that, if the petition had alleged the assignment as of a date prior to the alleged holding out, liberal construction might warrant a conclusion that the petition sufficiently presented an allegation of constructive possession; but as to the time of the assignment the petition is not specific, beyond that it was after May 6,1899.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">There was no evidence of actual possession, and so the final order was right, and is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
