J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">This action was for goods sold and delivered, valued at $214.50. The answer admitted the sale and delivery of goods to the amount of $176.50. The answer further alleged \u201cthat the defendant is ready and willing to pay plaintiff said sum, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>that he refused to accept the same, and now defendant brings said sum of $176.50 into court, ready to be paid to plaintiff if he will accept the same.\u201d The answer was served May 24, 1900; trial had June 22,1900. It appears that said sum of $176.50 was not paid into court until at the end of the trial, when it was then offered to the trial justice. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff for said sum of $176.50, for which amount judgment was entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor, together with $103.26 costs as taxed; making in all the sum of $279.76. The defendant appeals from this judgment, and now contends that it should be modified by striking therefrom the sum of $103.26 costs taxed therein in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and that a provision should be added thereto awarding costs to defendant, to be taxed, upon the theory that, having tendered the sum of $176.50 before action,, and further again making such tender in his answer, by reason of the fact that the jury only awarded judgment for that sum, he is entitled to the usual taxation costs, and not the plaintiff. Conceding that defendant\u2019s tender, made before trial, was a sufficient one, to be available in this instance to plaintiff it should not only have been pleaded, but he should have, before or with his plea, paid said sum into court, so that it might be subject to plaintiff\u2019s order, and thus stop interest and prevent costs. His failure to do so until during the trial rendered his plea of tender useless to him, and therefore the judgment entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor was correct. Becker v. Boon, 61 N. Y. 317; Wilson v. Doran, 110 N. Y. 106, 17 N. E. 688; Halpin v. Insurance Co., 118 N. Y. 178, 23 N.
