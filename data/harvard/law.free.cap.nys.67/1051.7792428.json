J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW-V\">The action was for the recovery of damages to real property by the maintenance of a nuisance. The jury rendered a verdict of $25 for the plaintiff, and judgment was entered on the verdict for the amount of the defendants\u2019 taxable costs, less the .amount of the verdict. The plaintiff made a motion to set aside the verdict and the judgment entered thereon, on the ground that it was .a quotient verdict, reached by having each juror name the amount \u25a0of the damages, and dividing the aggregate by 12. The court denied the motion, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-16\">The only evidence in support of the motion is the affidavit of a Mr. Storey that he had conversed with three of the jurors, and that they had stated that \u201cin their opinion the verdict was reached by \u25a0compromise,\u201d and that one of the jurors said that \u201csome one suggested that each man should take a slip of paper, put down the amount he was willing to give; that this was done; that the different amounts were added together and divided by twelve; and that that was the way in which the verdict of twenty-five dollars ($25) for the plaintiff was obtained.\u201d The defendant produced the affidavit of \"Mr. Laskey that he had conversed with each of the three jurprs, and that each denied having the conversation stated in Mr. Storey\u2019s affidavit. The law is well settled that the affidavits of jurors will not be admitted to impeach the verdict. Williams v. Montgomery, 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>N. Y. 648; Dalrymple v. Williams, 63 N. Y. 361. It is quite as clearly settled that affidavits of statements made by jurors may not be received for the like purpose. Clum v. Smith, 5 Hill, 560; Mitchell v. Carter, 14 Hun, 448. The subject of a quotient verdict was considered, also, in an able opinion by the Third department (Mr. Justice Herrick writing), in Hamilton v. Waterworks, 22 App. Div. 573, 48 N. Y. Supp. 106, where the court reversed an order setting aside a verdict which appeared to be quotient. The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Order affirmed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
