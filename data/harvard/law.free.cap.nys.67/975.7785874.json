The appellant entered into a contract with one Lawrence C. Blake, by the terms of which the latter agreed to blast, excavate, and remove rock from the former\u2019s said land for the sum of $28,500, to be paid for as the work progressed, every two weeks, at the rate of $1.20 per cubic yard of rock removed, as certified by the surveyor. The contract provided that from the amount due to Blake from time to time the appellant or his agents should pay the claims of laborers and material men. Payments were regularly made pursuant to the surveyor\u2019s certificate as submitted to the appellant. Another payment was made to Blake on May 17, 1900. He had then stopped work, although the rock had not all been removed, and at that time he had been paid in excess of the said sum of $28,500. The evidence for the plaintiff in each case shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>\u25a0on May 14, 1900, a committee representing the men called upon the appellant, and, complaining that they were not paid, threatened to stop work. The appellant protested, and finally persuaded the men to return, saying: \u201cGo to work. I will pay you. Keep working, and I will pay you.\u201d The appellant denies this, but the justice resolved the conflict in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. It is claimed by counsel for the respondents that the indebtedness in suit accrued after such promise was made. The plaintiff Sullivan testified that the men quit work on May 17, 1900, and it is practically admitted on both sides that work on the job was stopped on that date. Such being the case, the appellant, if liable at all, would be liable, at most, for work performed from the time of the alleged promise, viz. May 14th, to the date last above mentioned. From the bill of particulars and the evidence it appears that the claim of the plaintiff in each action, and of their assignors, 28 in number, is for work performed by them for periods ranging from <em>3</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>days to 24 days. The record, however, fails to disclose when the work in suit was performed, except that done by the plaintiff Sullivan as foreman. Whether any of it was done between May 14th and May 17th is open to conjecture, but, even if it was then done, the judgments cannot stand, since the recovery is based in each case upon the entire period sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Apart from all this, the proof is insufficient to support the finding of the trial justice in favor of the plaintiffs for the full amount claimed in each case. Thus, in the White case, the claim of the plaintiff was not proven. There the bill of particulars states that the Terone claim is for eight days\u2019 work, whereas the proof shows a performance of but five days\u2019 work. In the Sullivan case the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is still more defective. The claims of Craco and Frank Solini were not proven, and there are variances between the bill of particulars and the proof concerning the claims of the plaintiff, Eossi, Frank George, and William George, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The judgment in each case must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-17\"> Opinion rendered by the Associate Justices after the death of Presiding Justice BEEKMAN.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
