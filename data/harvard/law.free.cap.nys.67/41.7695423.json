The special term filed its decision, stating concisely the grounds upon which the issue was decided, and directing judgment for the plaintiff pursuant to the procedure authorized by section 1022, Code Civ. Proc., and this was done. The defendant failed to file any exception to such decision as provided for in the said section of the Code, and the \u201ccase\u201d does not contain any certificate that it contains all of the evidence, or all of the evidence upon the questions sought to be reviewed. This point is made by the appellant, and we are concluded from any review of the fact's or of the law, save as raised by the exceptions to the rulings. Otten v. Railroad Co., 150 N. Y. 395, 399, 44 N. E. 1033; Frederick v. City of Johnstown, 47 App. Div. 222, 62 N. Y. Supp. 66; Waydell v. Adams, 23 App. Div. 508, 48 N. Y. Supp. 635. As to the latter point, see Rosenstein v. Fox, 150 N. Y. 354, 359, 44 N. E. 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">One of the objections to the plaintiff\u2019s title was that the premises were charged with a legacy for $500. The plaintiff offered in evidence a quitclaim deed execute'd by the legatees of the premises after this action was commenced, tendered it to the defendant, and offered to insert therein the name of the defendant. \u201cObjected to by defendant. Objection overruled. Defendant excepts.\u201d There is no error in this ruling. Haffey v. Lynch, 143 R. Y. 241, 247, 248, 38 R. E. 298. There was also objection that the mortgaged premises were subject to an inchoate right of dower. The plaintiff offered in evidence a release of such dower executed subsequently to the commencement of the action. \u201cObjected to by defendant. Objection overruled.\u201d There was no error. Haffey v. Lynch, supra. A witness was called by the plaintiff, and was asked whether he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the person who executed the quitclaim deed then in evidence. \u201cObjected to. Objection overruled.\u201d I tail to see any force in the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">I have now noticed all the exceptions that appear in the record. The defendant urges that the judgment is erroneous, in that it compelled payment by defendant to the plaintiff, without directing an .assignment to the defendant of the bond and mortgage. As I read the judgment, it does so provide. The delivery adjudged involves .an assignment. It is alleged that the judgment is erroneous, in that it ordered the defendant to execute and to deliver the note that was the payment provided for by the contract, payable in six months, in that said note would have matured before the signing of the judgment. Were it not for the fact that no exception is filed to the decision, and that thereby we are precluded from modifying the .'judgment, there would be much force in this criticism of the appellant. However, the contract provides for four successive renewals of the note, and this privilege, in part, is still open to the defendant, notwithstanding that the provision for renewals is not inserted in the judgment. The provision for notice in case of renewal must be reasonably construed, so that defendant be not precluded from giving such notice by the fact that at the time of the judgment the original debt is, in terms, actually due.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
