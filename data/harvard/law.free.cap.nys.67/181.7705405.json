See Sully v. Schmitt, 147 N. Y. 248, 41 N. E. 514. To the same effect is Insurance Co. v. Sherman, 46 N. Y. 372, in which case it was held that any interference on the part of the landlord which impairs the beneficial enjoyment of the premises, such as the creation of a nuisance in another portion of the same building, is a sufficient disturbance to constitute an eviction. The evidence shows that there was a pump directly under that portion of the premises occupied by the defendant; that this pump caused a vibration, and made a rumbling noise, which some of the witnesses designated as a thumping, disagreeable noise, which could be heard all over the premises occupied by the defendant, and which continued for several hours each day. Whether this noise was or was not a nuisance was a question to be determined, by the jury, and therefore plaintiff\u2019s motion to direct a verdict in Ms favor was rightly denied. There were no exceptions to the charge of the court, and therefore it must be held that there was -no error in such charge. TMs case is to be distinguished from McLaughlin v. Bohm, 20 Misc. Rep. 338, 45 N. Y. Supp. 745, in which case it was held that there was a question of fact as to the disturbance of the tenant\u2019s possession, while in this case there' is no such question.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
