Payments had been made on an unexplained account, which, if on account of purchase price, would indicate a modification of such agreement, and place defendant in default. <em>Held, </em>that the burden of proof was on plaintiff, and hence, in the absence of a showing wherein there was a modification, he could not recover.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-10\">Appeal from municipal court, borough of Manhattan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-11\">Action by the Western Union Sewing-Machine Company against Annie Sachs and another to recover certain goods.

It appears that the whole agreement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the parties was not evidenced by the writing. There was a payment of $2 and one of $10 on an unexplained account. If it was an account of rental, as indicated on Exhibit 6, there was no default shown. If it was on account of purchase price, there must have been a modification of the agreement suggested by Exhibit 6, and, as it does not appear in what respect there was a modification, it cannot be said that the plaintiff was entitled to the property. In addition,, it may be said that there was no evidence of a refusal to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
