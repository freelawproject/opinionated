Hurley v. Brown, 54 App. Div. 619, 66 N. Y. Supp. 295 ; 44 App. Div. 480, 60 N. Y. Supp. 846. The decision of the appellate division announcing the reversal was in these words: \u201cJudgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed.\u201d In taxing the defendant\u2019s costs upon this decision, the county clerk allowed only the costs of the appeal, and his action in refusing also to tax the costs of the trial has been sustained by the court at special term. In thus construing our decision the clerk and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>court below have correctly interpreted its meaning, and have given to it the effect which we intended. We were of the opinion that there should be no costs at special term, whichever way the case ought to have been decided there, but that the prevailing party upon the review should receive the costs of the appeal. If we had intended to award him trial costs also, the decision would have read: \u201cJudgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs.\u201d If this had been an action at law, in which a defendant would be entitled to costs, as a matter of .course, upon the rendition of judgment in his favor, our direction for the dismissal of the complaint would necessarily have carried with it an award of all the costs of the trial court; but in the decision of an equity suit on appeal, even where the appellate division deals finally with the whole subject of the litigation and disposes of the action on the merits, it may withhold the costs of the trial from the successful party, just as the special term can do if, in the exercise of a judicial discretion, such a course seems proper under the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. In Von Keller v. Schulting, 45 How. Prac. 139, which was an equitable action for an accounting, the plaintiff recovered a judgment upon the trial bef\u00f3te a referee, who expressly directed, however, that it should be without costs. The general term reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. The plaintiff then appealed to the court of appeals, which affirmed the order of reversal made against him in the court below, and directed \u201cjudgment absolute in favor of the defendants, with costs.\u201d See reference to this case (which is rather meagerly reported in Howard) in Jermain v. Railroad Co., 31 Hun, 558, 562. The material difference between that case and the case at bar is that the appellate court there expressly directed that the absolute judgment which it ordered for the defendants should be with costs, while here we carefully withheld such a direction, although awarding costs on the reversal of the previous judgment the other way. In Schoonmaker v. Bonnie, 51 Hun, 34, 3 N. Y. Supp. 492, upon which the appellant also relies, there does not appear to have been any express direction for final judgment in the decision, of the general term, although the effect of the reversal without ordering a new trial was held to be equivalent in effect to such a direction. In construing the order of reversal which awarded costs to the successful defendants, the court was of the opinion that under such circumstances all the costs taxable in the supreme court, whether at general term or trial term, were included. There was nothing in that case, however, as there was in the order of reversal in the present action, to indicate that the appellate court intended to distinguish between the costs on appeal and the costs of trial, and to allow the former but not the latter. The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
