The barrel was to the left of him and when it slipped he felt a wrench in the back of his neck; \u201d that there was an injury to his left eye might have been deduced from his testimony that with the wrench in the back of his neck \u201ca pain seemed to start in the muscle at the back of his neck, going through his head and out of his eye. . . . The pain seemed to go through his head with so much force that he thought it would throw his eye out,\u201d and by the medical testimony that the strain described by the employee would be an adequate cause for. the injury to the eye; that the accident happened February 25, 1916, this is sustained by the testimony of the employee, corroborated by the records of the town of Brookline which show that day as the only day for which the employee was paid half time.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The finding, that the employee was totally incapacitated for work by reason of the injury, is supported by the fact that the other eye was lost as the result of a previous injury, and by the medical testimony that \u201cfor practical work, Mr. Duffy has no sight; he can do anything that a blind man can do.\u201d <em>Braconnier\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 273. That the normal vision was reduced to one tenth, might have been found from the testimony of the medical expert, \u201cI could not reckon it in per cent; it would be so small \u2014 less than one per cent\u201d in response to the question \u201cWhat per cent would you say that [there] is in this eye? To what per cent is the sight of his eye reduced?\u201d Tha the was entitled to weekly payments of $10 from March 10,1916, could be found upon conflicting testimony as to the days of the employee\u2019s actual service after March 10, and by the agreement that the average weekly wages were $15.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A chronological statement of facts discloses that the injury to the employee, from which the loss of his eye later followed as a natural consequence, happened February 25, 1916; that the employee was in bed five days suffering great pain \u201cthrough his head;\u201d that the pain stopped on March 1; that he worked without pain March 2, 3 and 4; that the next week he worked March 7,8,9 and 10; that during \u201c this last week his eye seemed to be getting worse; \u201d that a newspaper looked as though there were dirt on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>it; that March 10 he went to see Dr. McKenzie; that March 11, Saturday, he worked; that March 12, as he testified, \u201cI went to church and the priest went up to the pulpit to preach and I could not tell who it was, and I told my wife. I knew I would have to quit work and I sent my wife up to the Hall on Monday morning;\u201d that March 17, a written notice of the injury was given; that he \u201cwent to the hospital Monday, the fifth week;\u201d that he first felt his sight was impaired, that he could not see or read any more, \u201cFriday, the fifth week; . . . the sight did not go altogether until the Friday of this fifth week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The question presented is, whether there is any evidence to support the finding of the Industrial Accident Board \u201cthat the notice given, under the circumstances as they appear in this case, complies with the statutory requirement that such notice be given as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the injury.\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 15, provides \u201cNo proceedings for compensation for an injury under this act shall be maintained unless a notice of the injury shall have been given to the association or subscriber as soon as practicable after the happening thereof.\u201d The employee does not claim that the association, subscriber or agent had knowledge of the injury. And the provision, St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 5, that \u201cThe failure to make a claim within the period prescribed by section fifteen [supra] shall not be a bar to the maintenance of proceedings under this act if it is found that it was occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause,\u201d cannot be applied to the failure to give the statutory notice. The words \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d import the necessity of knowledge of the attendant facts, in order that there may be a compliance with the statutory direction that the notice \u201cshall state in ordinary language the time, place and cause of the injury.\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 16, as amended by St. 1912, c. 172. A trivial scratch or bruise of the finger ignorantly placed in contact with an infectious substance, may be followed by an insidious and slow development of a most terrible disease, the nature and peril of which may be entirely unknown to the injured employee. The injury may take place in the absence of witnesses and be of a character temporarily to disable the employee in the use of his understanding; and it may be and perhaps usually is of such character that its nature and degree is known or may be determined with reasonable certainty. It is obvious that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>feasibility of giving notice forthwith, immediately, speedily, or with reasonable diligence, must depend on the facts of each case. We are of opinion that the words \u201cas soon as practicable after the happening thereof,\u201d as used in the statute, import action according to the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Although the case at bar is close upon this point, we cannot say as a matter of law that there was no evidence to support the finding. <em>Herrick\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 111. <em>Nickerson\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 158. <em>Kenney\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 401. <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
