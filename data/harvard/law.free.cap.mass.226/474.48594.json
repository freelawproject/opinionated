Writ dated June 1, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-7\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Callahan, </em>J. It appeared that at the time of the accident there were on the defendant\u2019s car number plates of one Fontaine, a dealer in motor vehicles. The evidence in regard to this and other circumstances of the case is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">\u201c1. If the defendant was operating-an automobile which had been placed in the care and control of a garage owner and dealer and the garage owner had placed a dealer\u2019s plate upon the automobile, while upon the highways of Fall River and at the time of the accident, then there was no violation of the law and the automobile was lawfully upon the highways.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">\u201c2. That the plaintiff must prove that the defendant was negligent in the operation of the automobile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-10\">\u201c3. That if the defendant was operating an unregistered automobile, that said operation was only evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence but not conclusive.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-11\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and left the case to the jury with other instructions which are described and quoted in the opinion. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $485; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-12\">The case was submitted on briefs at the sitting of the court in October, 1916, and afterwards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-13\"><em>D.

That Fontaine was a dealer could be found from the testimony of one Briggs, who answered \u201cGarage, yes, dealer and repairs\u201d in response to the question ^Let\u2019s see, this Fontaine is a dealer in automobiles, isn\u2019t he?\u201d The fact that \u201cNowhere does it appear in evidence what knowledge Briggs had of the nature or character of Fontaine\u2019s business except above testimony\u201d does not prove that the statement was not true. The knowledge of Briggs may well have been intimate and accurate, and the weight to be given to his testimony was therefore a matter for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AaPA\">That Fontaine was in control of the motor car of the defendant for the purpose of sale, or for renting or for use, could be found from the uncontradicted fact that Fontaine put his own registered number plates on it and from the testimony of the defendant that \u201che gave his car to Mr. Fontaine for sale, to sell it or use it or let it... that jf Fontaine sold it he would get a commission, the same as any one who sells a machine or a house for some one else,\u201d that he asked Fontaine to use the car, \u201cthat if Mr. Fontaine had let the car the money for letting it would have to go to Mr. Quellette,\u201d the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>In reference to the first request, \u201cIf the defendant was operating an automobile which had been placed in the care and control of a garage owner and dealer and the garage owner had placed a dealer\u2019s plate upon the automobile, while upon the highways of Fall River and at the time of the accident, .then there was no violation of the law and the automobile was lawfully upon the highways,\u201d the presiding judge after reading to the jury St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 4, continued, \u201cThe section which I have just read is pertinent, because there had been introduced by the defendant in this case some evidence which the defendant offered for the purpose of showing that the automobile passed into the general control of another person. In other words, the defendant sought, as he had a right to do, to claim that at the time of the accident his machine had passed into the control of another, whose general distinguishing mark or number was upon the machine at the time of the accident, and that that being true, the burden was upon the plaintiff to show that the other person had not registered the machine in accordance with the requirements of the law. If the defendant offered sufficient evidence upon that point, it would be my duty to submit to you the question of whether Mr. Fontaine had control of this machine, within the meaning of the statute, at the time of the accident. But I rule that the defendant offered no sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Fontaine was a manufacturer or dealer within the meaning of those terms as employed by the statute, and that even if there had been such evidence there was no sufficient evidence that the physical control of the machine passed from this defendant to Mr. Fontaine. I, therefore, instruct you, that you would not be justified in finding that the defendant\u2019s automobile had passed from his control so as to exempt him from the laws relating to registration; and I further instruct you, that in using the machine without registration, as provided for in \u00a7 2, which I have read, he was engaged in an act contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The evidence required the submission to the jury of the issues, whether Fontaine was a dealer in motor vehicles, whether he controlled as a dealer the motor car of the defendant, and whether at the time of the accident the motor car had upon it a distinguishing number or mark given to the dealer by the highway commission; as also, whether the dealer\u2019s right to use the num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ber or mark was in force. In the opinion of a majority of the court, the withdrawal of these issues from the consideration of the jury was error, and the exceptions must' be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Should the jury find that Fontaine was not a dealer in motor vehicles or was not the registered holder of number plates for the year 1914 or was not in control of the defendant\u2019s machine, or should it find that the motor car did not in fact bear the number or mark of the dealer, the defendant\u2019s requests <em>\u201c2. </em>That the plaintiff must prove that the defendant was negligent in the operation of the automobile\u201d and \"3. That if the defendant was operating an unregistered automobile, that said operation was only evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence but not conclusive,\u201d could not have been given, because, if the machine was unregistered by owner or dealer, its presence on the highway was in itself unlawful and against the right of all other persons who were lawfully using the highway. It was <em>\u201c </em>outside the pale of travellers\u201d and was an outlaw, <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Northampton Street Railway, </em>202 Mass. 443, <em>Holden </em>v. <em>McGillicuddy, </em>215 Mass. 563; and because as a wrongdoer and creator of a nuisance the defendant is liable at least for all the direct injury resulting from such act, although such resulting injury could not have been contemplated as the probable result of the act done, and therefore was not the result of an act of negligence. \u201c If I am sued for a nuisance and the nuisance is proved, it is no defence on my part to say and to prove that I have taken all reasonable care to prevent it.\u201d <em>Rapier </em>v. <em>London Tramways Co. </em>[1893] 2 Ch. 588, 600. <em>Amberg </em>v. <em>Kinley, </em>214 N. Y. 531. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Kemp, ante, </em>75.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
