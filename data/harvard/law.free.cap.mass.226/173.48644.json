Writ dated August 14, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-14\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Keating, </em>J. The plaintiff testified that, before starting to cross Prospect Street to go to Summer Street, he stopped a few minutes on the comer of Gardner and Prospect streets; that \u201c the automobiles were going quite fast there, lots of them going there that night; so I watched them go by each way and looked for an opening for a chance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>go across and a car (an electric car) came along (from his right). I let the car go, perhaps it got twenty-five or thirty feet ahead of me, and there was nothing coming behind it, so I looked up to Broadway (to his left) and did not see anything and I started, and when I was off the sidewalk to the tracks almost, something struck me and I was stunned.\u201d The evidence in regard to the defendant\u2019s negligence is described in the opinion. The defendant asked the judge, among other requests, to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">\u201c1. On all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>On the evidence introduced by the plaintiff, he is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">\u201c4. The evidence introduced by the plaintiff does not prove that the defendant was negligent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">\u201c 9. On all the evidence the jury must find that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-9\">\u201c11. If the jury finds that the plaintiff did not look to his left before or while crossing Prospect Street, then the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care, and the jury must find for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and submitted the case to the jury with instructions to which no exceptions were taken. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,497.36; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-11\"><em>W. Powers, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b198-12\"><em>H. W.

Liggett Co. </em>224 Mass. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"ATI\">It appeared from the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he saw the plaintiff step off the sidewalk to cross over the street \u201cten or twelve feet ahead of the automobile,\u201d while another witness for the defendant placed the distance as \u201cabout twenty-five to thirty feet.\u201d The jury on all the evidence could find that notwithstanding this knowledge of the situation, and with the plaintiff in plain sight the defendant neither gave any warning of the car\u2019s approach nor slackened speed, but kept on under such momentum that when the plaintiff was struck he was carried on its front for about fifty feet before the car came to a stop. The question of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>negligence was plainly an issue of fact, and all of the requests, in so far as argued, were refused properly. <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>189 Mass. 583, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
