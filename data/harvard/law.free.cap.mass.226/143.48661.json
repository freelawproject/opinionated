Humphrey, an employee, upon her claim under the workmen\u2019s compensation act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">The case was heard by <em>Fox, </em>J., who made a decree in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident Board. This decree was entered on August 5, 1916. There was an attempted appeal by the insurer, on which were indorsed the words, \u201cFiled by consent and allowed, Aug. 28, 1916.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">In the same proceeding the employee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and asked the judge to rule that \u201c the insurer\u2019s failure to prosecute appeal claimed on August 28, 1916, to the Supreme Judicial Court for the Commonwealth, constitutes a failure, to comply with the statutes governing appeals to said court, and that the appeal ought to be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">The judge refused to make this ruling, \u201cbut ruled and ordered that the appeal be entered at the January term of the Supreme Judicial Court, and unless so entered to be dismissed.\u201d The employee alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 19, as amended by St. 1911, c. 284, \u00a7 1, is as follows: \u201cSection 19. A party who is aggrieved by a final decree of a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court or a final decree of the Superior Court may, within twenty days after the entry thereof, appeal therefrom. An appeal from a final decree of a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court shall be entered on the docket of that court, and an appeal from a final decree of the Superior Court shall forthwith be entered in the Supreme Judicial Court. The copies and papers in the cause shall be prepared by the clerk of the court and transmitted to the Supreme Judicial Court and entered on the docket of the full court. When such appeals have been entered as aforesaid, all proceedings under such decree shall be stayed, and the cause shall thereupon be pending before the full court, which shall hear and determine the same, and affirm, reverse or modify the decree appealed from. Upon the reversal of a final decree, the court may remand the cause to a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court or to the Superior Court, with such directions as are necessary and proper further to proceed therein, or the court may refer it to a master or take [sic] such other order relative to future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>proceedings therein as equity and the just and speedy determination of the case require.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-W\">R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A96\">There was a final decree entered in the Superior Court. An appeal could be taken under the law only within twenty days from the date of entry of the decree. St. 1911, c. 284, \u00a7 1. The appeal actually was taken twenty-three days thereafter. The indorsement is, \u201cFiled by consent and allowed.\u201d Appeal from a final decree is matter of right and does not depend upon the allowance or discretion of the judge. It was said by Chief Justice Gray, \"The time for claiming an appeal cannot be extended by consent of parties or by the justice whose decree is appealed from. ... If an appeal is not taken within the time prescribed, the full court cannot acquire jurisdiction thereof, otherwise than upon a petition for leave to appeal according to the statute.\u201d <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>121 Mass. 568, 573. That petition must be made directly to the full court within one year after the entry of the decree from which an appeal is desired. R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 28. The correctness of this statement of the law is not open to doubt. There is nothing in <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>157 Mass. 68, which justifies this court in assuming a jurisdiction which it does not possess under the law. A court which is without jurisdiction over a case cannot decide it authoritatively and as a court. See <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 545, 546, 547. Since the procedure under the workmen\u2019s compensation act is according to equity, <em>Gould\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 480, the appeal was not seasonably claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Exceptions were taken to the refusal to grant a motion to dismiss the appeal because not seasonably entered in the full court after being claimed. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>222 Mass. 218. These exceptions must be dismissed because no appeal had been taken. Hence there was nothing before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\n<em>Exceptions dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
