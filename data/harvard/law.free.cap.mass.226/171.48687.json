Writ dated March 8, 1912.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>McLaughlin, </em>J. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the defendant rested and moved that a verdict be ordered for the defendant. The judge refused to order such a verdict. The parties thereupon waived a jury trial and submitted the case to the judge for determination on the evidence presented before the jury, both parties agreeing that, if the judge should have granted the defendant\u2019s request that a verdict be ordered in its favor, his finding should be for the defendant; but that, if the judge was right in refusing to grant the request, he should find for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,000. The judge accordingly found for the plaintiff in that amount and at the request of both parties reported the case for determination by this court. If at the close of the evidence the judge should have ordered a verdict for the defendant, judgment was to be entered for the defendant; if he was right in refusing the request, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-6\"><em>S.

It was the defendant\u2019s duty to use due care toward him while he was using the platform at its invitation for the purposes described. <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>181 Mass. 422. <em>MacLaren </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">And the judge was further warranted in finding that the defendant\u2019s station master was negligent in permitting the baggage truck to remain on ice covered ground or on the platform, which also was icy and slippery, so near to the track that either by the jar and vibration of the passing train before it stopped, or by contact with it, the truck was thrown against the plaintiff, breaking his leg. Or more succinctly, the judge could believe the plaintiff, who testified that \u201cthe truck was about two feet from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the track. . . . The first thing I knew the rear car of the train struck the truck and drove it into me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The plaintiff is to have judgment \u201cin the sum of $1,000\u201d as stipulated in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>So </em>ordered.,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
