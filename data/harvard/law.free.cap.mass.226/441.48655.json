The plaintiff offered in evidence the report of an auditor in favor of the plaintiff. The exception of the defendant to the admission of portions of the auditor\u2019s report as well as other ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ceptions of the defendant are stated in the opinion. The judge admitted in evidence the whole of the auditor\u2019s report. Evidence was introduced by the defendant at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-3\">\u201cThe defendant asked to be allowed to put in evidence to show that the general reputation for honesty and veracity\u201d of the witness Donkin, mentioned in the opinion as having testified before the auditor, was bad. The judge refused to allow this, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">The defendant asked the judge to give the following instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">\u201c6. As bearing on the entries on plaintiff\u2019s books and sale slips (with reference to the defendant guaranteeing Donkin\u2019s account) the jury may take into consideration the contents of plaintiff\u2019s letters to the defendant dated February 24th and 26th, 1913, wherein it states: \u2018From our standpoint, it looks as though the goods were used in your houses and that you should pay,\u2019 and give it such weight as they think it is entitled to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">\u201c13. The plaintiff, not being a party to the contract annexed to the auditor\u2019s report, cannot take advantage of it. That contract did not inure to the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, and it was improperly and erroneously admitted in evidence by the auditor and annexed to his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-7\">\u201c 14. If the jury find, as a fact, that any of the findings of the auditor is based on the contract annexed to his report, then I charge you that you are to disregard such findings <em>in tofo </em>unless you find, as a fact, that such findings are supported by other competent evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-8\">The contract referred to in the thirteenth and fourteenth requests and the judge\u2019s instructions on the subject are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">The jury returned verdicts for the plaintiff in both cases, in the first case in the sum of $263.63 and in the second case in the sum of $433.16.

The cases were tried before an auditor who found for the plaintiff. In the Superior Court the defendant objected to certain findings of the auditor and to their introduction in evidence. The judge per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>mitted the whole report to be read to the jury. There was no error in this ruling. Ordinarily if either party objects to the report, a motion, should be made to recommit it to the auditor for change or modification; otherwise the entire report is received. <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Manhattan Ins. Co. </em>112 Mass. 320. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>204 Mass. 34, 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">One Donkin, who was not a witness at the trial before the jury, had testified before the auditor. The defendant asked to be allowed to put in evidence that his general reputation \u201cfor honesty and veracity\u201d was bad. This evidence was not competent; but, even if the question had asked for Donkin\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity, it would have been incompetent. The credibility of a witness may be impeached by showing that his reputation for truth and veracity is bad, but the credibility of one who is not a witness at the trial cannot be so impeached, although he testified at the former hearing before the auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The plaintiff asked a witness, called by the defendant, whether any lumber was sold to the defendant to be used on two of the houses in question; he introduced evidence showing that the defendant purchased the hardware used in the erection of the houses; and the defendant admitted he purchased all the hardware. This evidence was excepted to by the defendant. It was properly admitted. It tended to show that Donkin was not acting as the owner of the property, but as Fuller\u2019s agent; and that Fuller in fact was the owner of the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The letters of November 1, January 8 and January 13 from the plaintiff to the defendant were excepted to. The letter of November 1 was written before the note in suit was given. It refers to the enclosed statement and asks for a check or thirty days\u2019 note. As bearing on the consideration of the note this letter was admissible. No harm was done the defendant by the letters of January 8 and January 13, even if they were inadmissible, which we do not intimate, especially in view of the defendant\u2019s own evidence, that after giving the note the plaintiff demanded of him the amount due on the account annexed, and the defendant\u2019s letter of January 8, wherein he denied responsibility for the materials furnished, except as paid for by the promissory note, and asserted that Donkin was the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The defendant\u2019s sixth request was based on a certain detached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>portion of the evidence which the judge was not required to give. A contract in writing between Helen P. Foster and S. Isabella Fuller, relating to a lot of land in Watertown, was in evidence before the auditor. Helen P. Foster was a sister-in-law of Donkin, and S. Isabella Fuller was the wife of the defendant. The judge fully instructed the jury that the relations between Fuller and Donkin were of no importance except as bearing on the question of agency; that the ownership of the houses was in itself of no importance except as throwing light on the question as to whether Donkin was or was not Fuller\u2019s agent. The eighth request was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The thirteenth and fourteenth requests were refused properly.</p>\n<p id=\"AR6l\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
