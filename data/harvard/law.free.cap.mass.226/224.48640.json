Christie was dated October 29, 1912. The testatrix died on August 31, 1913, and her will was allowed by the Probate Court. The defendant was appointed executor and gave bond for the performance of his trust on October 2, 1913. The will contained the following provision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-13\">\u201cSecond: I give and devise to Elias Richardson and Helen M. Richardson, his wife, of said Cambridge, in fee simple, my house and land numbered 100 on Western Avenue in said Cambridge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The case was heard by <em>Fox, </em>J. The evidence is described in the opinion. He found that, when the agreement was made and at the death of Mrs. Christie, the house which she agreed to devise to the plaintiffs in fee simple was subject to a mortgage made by her on which there was due $600. He found, if it was material, that the plaintiffs did not know of the existence of that mortgage when they executed the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-5\">The judge ruled that by the true meaning of the agreement Mrs. Christie agreed to devise a clear title, and that there was a breach of the agreement in that the property devised by her was subject to the $600 mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-6\">The property, 100 Western Avenue, being all the real estate of Mrs. Christie, was inventoried at $3,200 and her personal property at $2,681. This personal property \u201cwas sufficient to pay all the debts of the estate and the costs of discharging said mortgage.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">After the appointment of the defendant as executor, he was requested by the plaintiffs to discharge the mortgage, which he refused to do. As the interest fell due upon the mortgage, he was requested to take care of the interest, but he refused to do so; and the plaintiffs paid as interest on the mortgage up to March 1, 1916, the sum of $75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">The remaining question was whether the case had been brought prematurely, as it appeared ;that the bill was .brought less than a year after the appointment of the executor. On this the judge ruled that, even if it were conceded that the plaintiffs, by reason of the agreement, had a preferred claim upon the real estate, he could see no ground for holding that they had a preferred claim upon the $600 which the executor must pay out of the personal property in his hands in order to clear the title. The judge ruled that under R. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, the suit was brought prematurely, and therefore should be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">As to the respondent\u2019s cross bill the judge found that the bill of Dr. Marcy for $57 for attendance upon Mrs. Christie during her last illness, which had been paid by the executor, was an obligation which properly rested upon the plaintiffs under their agreement. But, since it appeared that the plaintiffs had paid $75 as interest upon the mortgage since Mrs. Christie\u2019s death, the two claims should be offset.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-10\">He made an order that both the bill and the cross bill should be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>dismissed without costs, and at the request of the plaintiffs reported the case for determination by this court, such decree to be entered as justice and equity might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1\">R L. c. 141, \u00a7 1, is as follows: \u201cAn executor or administrator shall not be held to answer to an action by a creditor of the deceased which is commenced within one year after his giving bond for the performance of his trust, unless such action is brought for the recovery of a demand which would not be affected by the insolvency of the estate or, after the estate has been represented insolvent, for the purpose of ascertaining a contested claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4\">St. 1914, c. 699, \u00a7 1, is as follows: \u201cSection one of chapter one hundred and forty-one of the Revised Laws is hereby amended by striking out the words \u2018one year/ in the third line, and inserting in place thereof the words: \u2014 six months, \u2014 so as to read as follows: Section 1. An executor or administrator shall not be held to answer to an action by a creditor of the deceased which is commenced within six months after his giving bond for the performance of his trust, unless such action is brought for the recovery of a demand which would not be affected by the insolvency of the estate or, after the estate has been represented insolvent, for the purpose of ascertaining a contested claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A70\">Section 9 of that statute is as follows: \u201cThis act shall take effect on the first day of September, nineteen hundred and fourteen, but the provisions thereof shall not apply to the estates of persons who have deceased prior to said date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-10\">In the present case the executor filed his bond on October 2, 1913, and the bill was filed on February 17, 1914, so that the suit would have been brought prematurely, even if the amendment had applied to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-11\">R.

Christie, and the plaintiffs entered into a written agreement, by the terms of which the plaintiffs (who are husband and wife) were to provide a suitable maintenance and support for the testatrix in her home at number 100 Western Avenue in Cambridge, during her life; and in consideration of such maintenance and support so furnished, the testatrix was to pay the plaintiffs the sum of $300, and also was to make a will devising the premises numbered 100 Western Avenue, Cambridge, to them \u201cin fee simple.\u201d When this agreement was entered into, Mrs. Christie was a widow without children, about eighty-four years old, and was suffering from injuries received by reason of a fall; she died testate on August 31, 1913. The second clause of her will is as follows: \u201cI give and devise to Elias Richardson and Helen M. Richardson, his wife, of said Cambridge, in fee simple, my house and land numbered 100 on Western Avenue in said Cambridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">On the date when the agreement above referred to was made, the above described real estate was subject to a mortgage. Upon this mortgage there was a balance due of $600, which amount still remains unpaid. This suit is brought against the defendant, as executor of the will of Mrs. Christie, for the purpose of compelling him to pay the mortgage. The case was heard by a judge of the Superior Court who made certain findings, including a finding that the plaintiffs did not know of the existence of the mortgage when they executed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">' It is agreed that Mrs. Christie was cared for and supported by the plaintiffs until her death in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The first question presented is: Are the plaintiffs entitled to the real estate discharged of the mortgage thereon?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">It is plain that, in the absence of anything to show a contrary intention, the plaintiffs were entitled upon the performance of their part of the agreement, to have the real estate devised to them free from any incumbrances. This conclusion results from the express terms of the contract or by necessary implication therefrom. The agreement that the testatrix would make a will devising the prem-</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ises to the plaintiffs means that they should receive title thereto free from incumbrances. She did not agree to devise her right, title and interest in the property, or any other interest less than the whole estate. She did not agree to devise to the plaintiffs merely an equity of redemption, nor can such an intention be inferred. Swan <em>v</em>. <em>Drury, </em>22 Pick. 485. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>6 Cush. 199. <em>Callaghan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>136 Mass. 378. <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>147 Mass. 231. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>197 Mass. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">That the plaintiffs are entitled to the real estate free from the mortgage, is obvious independently of the provision that the devise is to be \u201cin fee simple.\u201d The words \u201cfee simple\u201d relate to the quantity or extent of the interest in land: it is the largest estate and greatest interest that can be enjoyed in land. A fee simple is an absolute estate of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The only question remaining is whether this suit, having been commenced within one year after the defendant gave bond for the performance of his trust, was prematurely brought. R. L. c. 141, \u00a7 1. St. 1914) c. 699, \u00a71.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">It is the contention of the plaintiffs that they are entitled to maintain the bill under R. L. c. 148, \u00a7 1; that they are not creditors of the deceased, and that the recovery which they seek would not be affected by the insolvency of the estate. We are unable to agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The second prayer of the bill is \u201cthat the defendant as executor of the will of Mary A. Christie be ordered to pay off and discharge said mortgage given by Mary A. Christie to the Cambridgeport Savings Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The suit is against the executor as the representative of the estate of the testatrix. What the plaintiffs seek is exoneration from the amount due upon the mortgage that they may hold the real estate relieved from the incumbrance; in order that this may be accomplished, the amount due will have to be paid out of the estate, thereby depreciating it accordingly. Manifestly such a demand would be affected by the insolvency of the estate, and it cannot be doubted that the plaintiffs are creditors within the meaning of the statute. It follows that the suit was prematurely brought, and must be dismissed. <em>National Bank of Troy </em>v. <em>Stanton, </em>116 Mass. 435. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>134 Mass. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"AKX\">The cross bill cannot be maintained, as it appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>amount of debts paid by the executor is less than the amount paid by the plaintiffs as interest on the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The rulings made by the judge of the Superior Court were correct. In accordance with the terms of the report, a decree is to be entered dismissing the bill and cross bill both without costs and without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
