Writ dated December 10, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-11\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Chase, </em>J., who at the close of the evidence, the substance of which is described in the opinion, ordered a verdict for the defendants and by agreement of the parties reported the case for determination by this court. If the case should have been submitted to the jury, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,500, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>clusive of costs. If the ordering of the verdict by the judge was right, final judgment was to be entered for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-5\"><em>P. H.

The measure of care required, before the neglect of the alleged wrongdoer to take proper precautions rises to the degree of negligence in the discharge of a duty which he owes to other persons, depends upon the circumstances of each case. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>208 Mass. 159, 162, and cases cited. Doubtless the jury could find, from the account of the accident given by the decedent to his father, that, while on his way to play in the yard beyond, the grating fell upon him and that he was ignorant of the cause, yet there is no evidence warranting a finding that the defendants were aware that any change from its original position had occurred or had any reason to anticipate that the children of tenants or their juvenile visitors or whoever used the way would interfere with the stability of the grating which, because of its weight and security of position, could not be toppled over or so tilted as to fall of its own weight upon a passing pedestrian without the exertion of much physical effort and force. We are unable on this ground to distinguish in principle the present case from <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>177 Mass. 228, where the plaintiff, who was not an employee but who was assumed <em>to </em>have been rightfully on the premises, took hold of the chain of a locked door of a freight house, and while rattling it to see if he could get in, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>received personal injuries as he turned away caused by a piece of iron weighing about seven hundred pounds, which for some time had stood on the platform nearly upright against the side of the house, falling upon him, was held not entitled to recover; or from <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Wheelock, </em>181 Mass. 474, and <em>Hofnauer </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>186 Mass. 47, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The entry must be judgment for the defendants on the verdict.,</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
