And the defendant further says that since said award and since said performance thereof by the defendant, the plaintiff has raised new matters of controversy and in consequence thereof is attempting to repudiate said award.\u201d The case was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J. The material evidence is described in' the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff asked the judge to rule that \"On all the evidence there never was a proper and legal arbitration, prior to the bringing of this bill, by the parties.\u201d The judge refused to make this ruling and found \u201cthat there was a valid oral reference to arbitration of some of the matters recited in the bill as in dispute between the parties, and an award properly made which has been performed by the defendant. As to the other matters I find for the defendant. Consequently the plaintiff cannot maintain Hs bill and hold[V| under the lease therein set out only so much of the basement in question as lies under his store and between the street walls and the partition placed therein by the defendant after the award.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">The judge ordered that a decree be entered dismissing the bill; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-8\"><em>A.

There was evidence to show that the matters in dispute were referred to arbitrators, and that the attorney for the plaintiff and the attorney for the defendant were agreed upon by the parties as such arbitrators, and they-have made an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It' is the contention of the defendant that the award is binding upon the parties and is a defence to this suit, which is a bill in equity in which the plaintiff seeks, among other things, to restrain the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s use of the cellar of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">At the close of the evidence the plaintiff asked the judge to rule that \u201cOn all the evidence there never was a proper and legal arbitration, prior to the bringing of this bill, by the parties.\u201d This request was refused, and the judge found \u201cthat there was a valid oral reference to arbitration of some of the matters recited in the bill as in dispute between the parties, and an award properly made which has been performed by the defendant. As to the other matters I find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The defendant\u2019s attorney, who, as before stated, was one of the arbitrators, testified that soon after the arbitrators were agreed upon they went to the leased premises and met the parties, who then stated their respective claims; that the plaintiff complained that the defendant was occupying wrongfully the whole of the cellar; that the defendant had not placed sufficient electric light fixtures in his (the plaintiff\u2019s) store; that the defendant had failed to install the required number of toilets in the leased premises; that certain doors were not properly fitted nor provided with keys; that the defendant contended he had made an agreement with the plaintiff by which the defendant was to perform certain extra work that was not required under the lease and the plaintiff was to relinquish his claim to occupy any part' of the cellar; that the defendant also contended that he was not required to install further electric light fixtures in the plaintiff\u2019s store, and that the plaintiff had waived his right to have one of the toilets installed on the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>The arbitrators afterwards made an award in which they determined what portion of the cellar the parties should occupy respectively, and ordered a partition to be built therein by the defendant. They made no award concerning any other matter in dispute between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">If we assume, without deciding, that there could be a valid oral reference to arbitration of the matters in dispute as found by the judge, it is manifest that the award as announced to the parties was confined to a determination of their respective rights to the use of the cellar, and did not include all the matters embraced in the submission. The parties were entitled to a decision upon all the disputed questions submitted by them. The arbitrators properly could not ignore any such matter because deemed of small importance, or for any other reason, without announcing their conclusion with reference thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">It is well settled that such an award'is invalid. It is no bar to the present suit. <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>6 Allen, 69. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Holcomb, </em>99 Mass. 552. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>104 Mass. 431. <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Sessions, </em>105 Mass. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">As the award did not include all matters submitted, there was not a legal and valid arbitration, and the ruling requested by the plaintiff in substance should have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
