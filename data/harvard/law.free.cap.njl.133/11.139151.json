Nowels, Referee of the State of New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Commission.\u201d The reasons filed are twenty-four in number but need not be reproduced at length. The history of the ease shortly stated is, that the Compensation Commission, in the execution of its duties under the statute <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1936, <em>ch. </em>270; <em>R. S. </em>43 :21), established a contribution rate for the prosecutor corporation for 1942. Prosecutor protested the rate and applied for a hearing in the usual manner, and the Commission, pursuant to its own regulations, sent the matter to a \u201creferee.\u201d The statute does not seem to provide for a \u201creferee\u201d by that name, but does provide for a \u201csalaried examiner:\u201d and the power to make such appointment is not the subject of any attack here. Idle question for decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>seems to be 'whether in cases like the present one, a reference to the referee is irrevocable. We answer it in the affirmative. Eor the defendants, reference is made to the Commission\u2019s \u201cRegulations and Rules relating to Referee and Commission Hearings\u201d which contains ' this sentence: \u201cThe Executive Director or the Commission may remove to himself or itself for determination, any proceeding before a Referee.\u201d The question then arises, whether the statute has endowed the Commission with power to make that regulation. We answer it in the negative. If such power exist it must be derived from <em>R. 8. </em>43:21-6 (e), a paragraph too long to be reproduced here at length, which empowers the board of review to remove to itself * * * the proceedings on any <em>claim </em>(italics ours) pending before an appeal tribunal. But we think that clearly this language, and indeed the whole of paragraph 6 (e) refer only to claims for benefits filed by employees and have no application to the fixation of contribution rates for employers. The order under review will therefore be set aside, but without costs, the defendant Commission being a state agenc}\u2019, and the individual defendants being the members of the Commission. <em>Tenement House Board </em>v. <em>Schlechter, </em>83 <em>N.
