W. Rainnie and an assault upon one Junior Harris, and with resisting arrest, fixed to the end that the said Pete Dixon would obtain probation rather than commitment to States Prison * *</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The overt act charged done in pursuance of the conspiracy was the payment by Dixon to Mungioli of the sum of $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The statutes of this state respecting conspiracies are to be found in <em>R. S. </em>2:119-1 and 2. It was necessary to charge an overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy. The act charged was the payment of money by one conspirator to another. The conspiracy was to commit an act injurious to the public, the perversion or obstruction of justice. Hence, the act done \u2014 the payment of money \u2014 may have been lawful, still the evil purpose charged makes the indictment sufficient. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>92 <em>N. J. L. </em>341 (at <em>p. </em>355); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hemmendinger, </em>100 <em>Id. </em>234.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The act done in such case need not be unlawful. Suffice it, that the charge was that the conspiracy was to prejudice the public. <em>State </em>v. <em>Continental Purchasing Co., </em>119 <em>N. J. L. </em>257; <em>affirmed, </em>121 <em>Id. </em>76. See, also, an exhaustive study of indictments for conspiracy in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellenstein, </em>121 <em>Id. </em>304.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The writ will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
