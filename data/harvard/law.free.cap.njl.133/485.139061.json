The <em>locus </em>is in an area zoned for business under an ordinance adopted pursuant to 72. <em>8. </em>40:55-30, <em>et seq., </em>which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that in the business districts therein delineated \u201cno building or premises shall be used, and no building shall be erected which is arranged, intended, or designed to be used\u201d for certain \u201ctrades, industries or uses\u201d \u2014 among others \u201cMerry-GoEounds, Ferris Wheels or similar amusement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The building inspector denied the permit on the ground 'that the proposed use is not permissible in a business zone; and respondents now aver that such an interdict is to be found in the general words \u201cor similar amusement.\u201d The point is not well made.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It is the settled rule in aid of interpretation that, barring a clear contextual manifestation to the contrary, general words in a clause such as this are restricted to things <em>ejusdem generis. </em>Under the principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>general words following particular and specific words are not given their natural and ordinary sense, standing alone, but are confined to persons and things of the same kind or <em>genus </em>as those enumerated. <em>Students Oil Co., Inc., </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>286; <em>Syms </em>v. <em>Town of West Hoboken, </em>90 <em>Id. </em>130; <em>Craft </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 <em>Id. </em>302; <em>Livermore </em>v. <em>Freeholders of County </em>of <em>Camden, </em>29 <em>Id. </em>245; <em>affirmed, </em>31 <em>Id. </em>507.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Here, the use of the qualifying adjective \u201csimilar\u201d is indicative of a purpose to limit the operation of the general words to amusements of a kind and character like those already specified. As thus used, \u201csimilar\u201d connotes homogeneity, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cnearly corresponding; resembling in many respects; having a general likeness.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed.). </em>There are substantial differences, grounded in the considerations to be served- by zoning, that suffice to exclude amusements of the one class and not the other from the areas zoned for business; at all events, it cannot be said that such classification is utterly lacking in reason and therefore arbitrary. There is no resemblance between those enumerated in the zoning regulation and the proposed use except that they take the general category of \u201camusements.\u201d Merry-go-rounds and ferris wheels are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>only of a radically different nature, but their operation is much more public than the one suggested here, and not in keeping with the normal uses assigned to a business district, while a housed skating rink is not a discordant use. Bespondents find similarity in that both classes of amusement \u201cattract large crowds\u201d for \u201cdiversion, to the accompaniment of music,\u201d \u201cnoise,\u201d and traffic congestion; but these are wholly artificial standards not found in the regulation itself. Unless the action taken by the administrative agency is in pursuance of a definite and certain policy and uniform rule of action laid down for its guidance in the legislative grant of authority, and so confined, it is in essence the exercise of legislative power, and therefore unlawful. <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Princeton, </em>133 <em>N. J. L. </em>230. If these words were to be so interpreted, practically all amusements would fall within the ban; and thus the language employed to express the local legislative design would not receive its ordinary and natural meaning. Evidently, there was no intention, by this provision, to reach all amusement devices and places of entertainment. Use restrictions upon real property must find their justification in some aspect of the police power, exerted for the public welfare, and must be clearly and explicitly expressed. <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Montclair, </em>124 <em>Id. </em>135; <em>affirmed, </em>125 <em>Id. </em>367.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">It is also urged that, since the projected use is \u201cnot expressly prohibited\u201d in industrial zones under section 4 of the ordinance, it is interdicted by section 3 (r), proscribing in business districts \u201cAny trade or use permitted in an industrial zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">But this, plainly, would be distortive of the expressed legislative intent. The exclusion of amusements of the stated class from the uses permissible in the business areas necessarily implies the inclusion of all others of the general category. The obvious purpose of section 3(r) was to bar from the business districts uses peculiarly appropriate to industrial zones, and thus to maintain the fundamental distinction between the two areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">And there is no merit in the contention that until relator invokes the remedy of an appeal to the local zoning board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of adjustment from adverse action of the building inspector, provided by the zoning ordinance, <em>mandamus </em>will not be available to secure the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">As we have seen, the zoning ordinance has no application; and, since there was full compliance with the local building code (such is conceded), it was the peremptory duty of the building inspector to issue the permit in question. <em>Losick </em>v. <em>Binda, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>157; <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>Kaltenbach, </em>101 <em>Id. </em>316; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Moffett, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>692.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">A peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is awarded, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
