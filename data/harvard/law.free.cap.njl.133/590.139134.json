The accident occurred on July 19th, 1941, and as a result thereof the petitioner lost the sight of his right eye. The Bureau found that the petitioner was entitled to fifteen weeks\u2019 compensation for temporary disability and to 100 weeks\u2019 compensation based on 100 per cent, loss of the right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">In the Court of Common Pleas, he was awarded compensation on the basis of 40 per cent, of permanent total disabilty for 200 weeks with 24 4/7 weeks temporary disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">The sole question for our determination is the weight of the medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">The petitioner\u2019s eye specialist testified with respect to the visual activity of the left eye with which there had been prior to the accident considerable difficulty. He testified that part of the vision in the left eye would never be normal, and that, therefore, he was totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">The testimony also shows that after the injury to the right eye a greater use of the left eye was forced by nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">We rest our determination in this case upon the testimony of Dr. Elbert S. Sherman, who had treated the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>after the injury to his right eye. Ife placed the present disability o\u00ed the left eye as six per cent, of normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Obviously the rule laid down in <em>Combination Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Obser, </em>95 <em>N. J. L. </em>43, is inapplicable. See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Essex National Trunk, &amp;c., Co., Inc., </em>119 <em>Id. </em>47.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The judgment of the Essex County Court of Common Pleas will be reversed, and the judgment of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
