Ellis.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b349-11\">Colie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVrJ\">John A. Ilofbauer seeks a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review the action of the Civil Service Commission in approving the action of the Board of Police Commissioners in dismissing prosecutor from his office as a patrolman in the City of East Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">The facts are that prosecutor became a member of the force in 1938 at which time he subscribed an oath that he would \u201cin all respects, conform to and observe the rules and regulations which have been or may be established by the said Board of Police Commissioners.\u201d The City of East Orange by ordinance established a Board of Police Commissioners among whose dirties it was \u201cto make and alter rules and regulations for the government of said [police] department.\u201d <em>Pampk. L. </em>1908, <em>ch. </em>250, \u00a7 37, saved from repeal by <em>R. S. </em>40:103-5. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>In compliance with its duty the Board in 1932 promulgated a rule that \u201cmembers of the police department shall * * * devote their entire time to police service engaging in no other business or occupation.\u201d Admittedly prosecutor had knowledge of the aforesaid rule or regulation and admittedly he worked as a toolmaker in an outside, part-time capacity. In January, 1944, a \u201cgeneral order\u201d issued over the signature of the chief of police calling attention to the rule prohibiting outside work and ordering those so engaged to stop immediately. In June, 1944, prosecutor was called before the Board of Police Commissioners, reprimanded and warned that charges would be preferred against him if he continued his part-time employment. In the face of this warning he persisted in the same course of conduct, whereupon he was charged with insubordination and willful disobedience of orders. After a hearing before the Board of Commissioners, he was found guilty and dismissed from the force. On appeal the Civil Service Commission approved the dismissal and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The argument that the power given the Board of\u2018 Police Commissioners to formulate rules and regulations is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative duties has no merit. <em>Cf. Alcutt </em>v. <em>Police Commissioners, </em>66 <em>N. J. L. </em>173; <em>affirmed, </em>67 <em>Id. </em>351. Prosecutor was not entitled to the protection cf <em>B. 8. </em>40:47-5 and 6 relating to tenure of office. His admitted conduct removed him from the classification of an officer holding office during \u201cgood behavior\u201d and placed him in the classification of those guilty of \u201cdisobedience of rules and regulations established for the government of the police force.\u201d We have examined into all the reasons advanced and find no merit in any of them. The application is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
