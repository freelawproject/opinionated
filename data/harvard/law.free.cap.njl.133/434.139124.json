Broad &amp; Branford Corporation, hereinafter referred to as landlord, owned and leased to J. J. Hockenjos Co., hereinafter referred to as tenant, store premises in Newark, New Jersey. The landlord sued the tenant for non-pajunent of rent and in that suit the tenant filed an answer by way of defense and counterclaimed for damages based on the landlord\u2019s allegedly unreasonable refusal in withholding written consent to the tenant to sublet the leased premises. In that suit the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Judge directed a verdict for the landlord and on appeal to the Supreme Court it reversed and remanded for a new trial. See <em>Broad &amp; Branford Place Corp. </em>v. <em>J. J. Hockenjos Co., </em>132 <em>N. J. L. </em>229. Following out the mandate of the Supretne Court, the cause was set down for trial before the court and a jury. At the conclusion of the case, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the landlord and against the tenant in the sum of $35 which was the money difference between the landlord\u2019s claim of $260 and the tenant\u2019s counter-claim of $225. On the same dajg May loth, 1945, judgment was entered. Nine days later the landlord made an application to the District Court Judge who issued a rule to show cause reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">\u201cApplication having been made to me by the plaintiff in the above entitled cause, and good cause appearing therefor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cIt is, on this 24 day of May, 1945, on motion of Milton M. Unger, Attorney of Plaintiff, ordered that the defendant show cause before this court on the 3.1st day of May, 1945, at 10 :00 o\u2019clock in the forenoon or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard why the verdict entered in the above entitled cause should not be set aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence and as illegal and invalid, and why judgment should not be then and there entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201cIt is further ordered that a copy of this order be served upon the attorney for the defendant within two days from the date hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The above rule to show cause was duty served and on the adjourned return date counsel for the respective litigants appeared and thereafter on June 27th, 1945, the rule to show cause was made absolute and a now trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Prosecutor argues that the court was without jurisdiction. It is said that because of <em>B. 8. </em>2 :32-121 requiring that \u201can application for a new trial * * * shall be made within thirty days after judgment\u201d the order under review is invalid since the judgment was entered more than thirty days prior to the order granting a new trial. The above statute limits to thirty days the time within which <em>application </em>for a new trial shall be made. It puts no time limit on the time within which the order granting a new trial shall be made. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>case the application was made within nine days of the judgment. It is also said that the application was limited to one for a judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>and that being so the court should not have granted some other relief, in this case a new trial. The rule dated July 24th, 1945, is one \u201cto show cause why the verdict * * * should not be set aside as contrary to the weight of the evidence and as illegal and invalid.\u201d It requires no citation of authority for the proposition that an application to set aside a verdict as contrary to the weight of the evidence is in essence an application for a new trial. The inclusion of an application for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>does not confine the scope of the rule to that form of relief only.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We have examined all of the reasons urged and find them without merit. The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
