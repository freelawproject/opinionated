Plaintiff explained his injury and disability to him telling him that the doctors all said his condition was permanent. The defendant then told the plaintiff that the doctors did not know anything about such matters and that he would treat him and guarantee to cure his disability. The defendant said his fee would be $60, but plaintiff then told him \u201cif you cure me I will give you $100 not $60.\u201d Defendant further agreed with plaintiff that the fee would be returned to plaintiff if plaintiff\u2019s disability was not cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">The plaintiff paid $80 on account which he sought to recover. The defendant counter-claimed on a <em>quantum meruit. </em>No cure seems to have been effected and the trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff. The facts proved support -the judgment. This is sufficient reason not to disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The eases are numerous that the Supreme Court will not review findings o\u00ed the District Court upon questions of fact, if there be legal evidence to support them. <em>Siccardi </em>v. Caruso, 120 <em>N. J. L. </em>111; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Browell Bus Co., </em>130 <em>Id. </em>193.</p>\n<p id=\"A7I\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
