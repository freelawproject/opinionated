We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The plaintiff, Marion Willoughby, brought this action against the defendant, the city of New Haven, in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, in order to recover underinsured motorist benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:97CV00668 (D. Conn. July 29, 1999). The District Court certified four issues for this court to determined <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to the applicable certification procedures; Public Acts 1999, No. 99-107;3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we agreed to decide those issues. We conclude that a municipality that is a self-insurer, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-371 (c), is not required to provide underinsured motorist benefits for the emergency vehicle at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The District Court\u2019s certification order included the following stipulated facts. At the time of the incident underlying this case, the plaintiff was a firefighter employed by the defendant\u2019s fire department. On November 23, 1994, responding to an injured person call, the plaintiff was driving a fire emergency vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>(vehicle),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> specifically, a Ford Yankee coach F-350, equipped with a Ford Ambulance Preparation Package. The vehicle, which was owned by the defendant through its department of fire protection services, was an \u201c[a]uthorized emergency vehicle\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (4),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and was registered with the department of motor vehicles as a municipally owned motor vehicle with registration number 125-NH. The vehicle was a truck-type vehicle with a maximum payload of more than 4000 pounds and less than 6000 pounds, and was used by firefighters employed by the defendant primarily to transport medical emergency equipment and technicians to emergency calls.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The plaintiff was driving the vehicle on a public highway when a collision occurred between it and a motor vehicle owned and operated by Anthony Palluzzi, who was not an employee, officer or agent of the defendant. As a result of the collision, which was caused by the negligence of Palluzzi in failing to yield the right-of-way to the vehicle as required by law, the plaintiff sustained serious and permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The plaintiff exhausted the $100,000 liability coverage possessed by Palluzzi, and recovered approximately $270,000 from the defendant pursuant to its workers\u2019 compensation plan, for which it is a self-insurer. Those payments have not fully compensated the plaintiff for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The following stipulated facts relate to the defendant\u2019s status as a self-insurer on and prior to November 23, 1994, the date of the incident. The defendant, a political subdivision of the state of Connecticut, was a self-insured municipality in accordance with the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-371 for automobile and motor vehicle liability protection. The defendant owned more than twenty-five motor vehicles, and all of the motor vehicles, including the vehicle at issue in the present case, were protected by the defendant\u2019s self-insurance plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The defendant had established a specific fund for its self-insurance plan to pay for claims against it arising out of its compensation and public liability. The self-insurance plan had not been reduced to a written document outlining the limitations of the defendant\u2019s exposure for its motor vehicles. The defendant had not filed any written document that outlined the limitations of its liability exposure or uninsured and underinsured motorist exposure for its vehicles. The defendant did not request that its uninsured and underinsured motorist liability limits be less than its liability limits for its motor vehicles. At all times relevant to the circumstances of the present case, the defendant owned \u201c[ajuthorized emergency vehicle[s]\u201d as defined by \u00a7 14-1. In a letter dated August 9,1985, the defendant notified the insurance commissioner that it was self-insured for its \u201cauto fleet.\u201d In a letter dated February 23, 1990, in response to an inquiry from the insurance commissioner, the defendant reaffirmed its self-insurance plan for \u201cauto liability.\u201d On November 23, 1994, the defendant did not possess any commercial insurance policies that would protect it or its employees against losses incurred as a result of either the negligent operation of a motor vehicle or other types of liability. The vehicle possessed a document of self-insurance in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>The questions certified to this court present questions of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. ... Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755-56, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bortner </em>v. <em>Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 258-59, 736 A.2d 104 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The dispositive certified question raises the issue of whether a municipality that is a self-insurer, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-371 (c), is required to provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for a New Haven fire department emergency vehicle. The plaintiff claims that such coverage is required because the vehicle at issue is a \u201c[pjrivate passenger motor vehicle\u201d within the definition of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (e) (6).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff also claims that, even if the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>is not a private passenger motor vehicle, the self-insurance statutes require such coverage. The defendant argues, on the contrary, that the vehicle is not a private passenger motor vehicle and, therefore, does not fall within that class of motor vehicles required to provide underinsured motorist coverage as such. The defendant further argues that the sell-insurance statutes do not require such coverage. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Although this question requires our analysis of several statutoiy and regulatory provisions, our starting point is our underinsured motorist coverage statute, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 38a-336 (a) (1) pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>vides in relevant part: \u201cEach automobile liability insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>anee policy shall provide insurance, herein called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334 . . . .\u201d Although \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) states generally that automobile liability insurance policies must provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, it provides that such coverage is governed by \u201cthe regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334 .. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We therefore turn to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Insurance Commissioner shall adopt regulations with respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies issued after the effective date of such regulations and covering private passenger motor vehicles, as defined in subsection (e) of section 38a-363, motor vehicles with a commercial registration, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>defined in section 14-1, motorcycles, as defined in section 14-1, motor vehicles used to transport passengers for hire, motor vehicles in livery service, as defined in section 13b-101, and vanpool vehicles, as defined in section 14-1, registered or principally garaged in this state. . . .\u2019\u2019By its language, \u00a7 38a-334 (a) specifically requires the commissioner to promulgate regulations regarding, inter alia, \u201cuninsured motorists coverages\u201d provided by \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies . . . covering\u201d those classes of vehicles previously enumerated in that subsection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Those specific classes of motor vehicles enumerated in \u00a7 38a-334 are \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicles,\u201d \u201cmotor vehicles with a commercial registration,\u201d \u201cmotorcycles,\u201d \u201cmotor vehicles used to transport passengers for hire,\u201d \u201cmotor vehicles in livery service,\u201d and \u201cvanpool vehicles,\u201d as those vehicles are defined in their respective sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Section 38a-334-6 (a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides that the uninsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>coverage that it requires \u201cshall insure the occupants of every motor vehicle to which the bodily injury liability coverage applies. . . .\u201d It is therefore necessary to refer to \u00a7 38a-334-5 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which covers liability coverage. Section 38a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>334-5 (a) of the regulations provides that its liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>coverage requirements apply to <em>\u201cmotor vehicle[s] </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>owned or long-term leased by the named insured. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201c[m]otor [vjehicle,\u201d as used in the regulations, is defined as: \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle . . . commercial motor vehicle . . . motorcycle . . . public service motor vehicles . . . motor vehicle in livery service . . . and vanpool vehicle .. . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38a-334-2 (c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Reading \u00a7\u00a7 38a-334 and 38a-336 together, as we must, we proceed in our analysis with the understanding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>only those classes of motor vehicles enumerated in \u00a7 38a-334 fall within the mandate of \u00a7 38a-336 requiring underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We must therefore determine whether the vehicle at issue in the present case falls within one of the enumerated classes of vehicles in \u00a7 38a-334. Specifically, we consider whether the vehicle falls within the class of \u201c[p]rivate passenger motor vehicle[s],\u201d as defined in \u00a7 38a-363 (e).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 38a-363 (e) defines a private passenger motor vehicle as a: \u201c(1) Private passenger type automobile; (2) station-wagon-type automobile; (3) camper-type motor vehicle; (4) high-mileage-type motor vehicle, as defined in section 14-1; (5) truck-type motor vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen hundred pounds or less, registered as a passenger motor vehicle, as defined in said section, or as a passenger and commercial motor vehicle, as defined in said section, or used for farming purposes;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or (6) a vehicle with a commercial registration, as defined in subdivision (12) of said section. It does not include a motorcycle or motor vehicle used as a public or livery conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">We constrain our analysis to whether the vehicle at issue is a private passenger motor vehicle by virtue of subdivision (6) of \u00a7 38a-363 (e); see footnote 16 of this opinion; which includes within the definition of private passenger motor vehicle \u201ca vehicle with a commercial registration, as defined in subdivision (12) of [\u00a7 14-1 (a)]. . . .\u201d Section 14-1 (a) (12) provides: \u201c \u2018Commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>registration\u2019 means the type of registration required for any motor vehicle designed or used to transport merchandise, freight or persons in connection with any business enterprise, unless a more specific type of registration is authorized and issued by the commissioner for such class of vehicle . . . .\u201d We conclude that the definition of commercial registration does not encompass the type of registration possessed by the vehicle at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The first clause of \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) sets forth a general definition, which defines \u201ccommercial registration\u201d as \u201cthe type of registration required for any motor vehicle designed or used to transport merchandise, freight or persons in connection with any business enterprise . . . .\u201d The second clause of \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) then begins with language of exception, namely, the term \u201cunless.\u201d By this language, the second clause carves out an exception to the general definition contained in the first clause. Specifically, the second clause of \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) excepts from the general definition of commercial registration \u201ca more specific type of registration [that] is authorized and issued by the commissioner for such class of vehicle . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the term \u201ccommercial registration\u201d were meant, as the plaintiff contends, to <em>include </em>a \u201cmore specific type of registration . . . authorized and issued by the commissioner for such class of vehicle,\u201d that language would be rendered meaningless, because the more general phrase, \u201cthe type of registration required for any motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>designed or used to transport merchandise, freight or persons in connection with any business enterprise,\u201d would subsume the more specific. General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12). Therefore, our treatment of the second clause as an exception does not result in redundant language and gives meaning to every clause of the statute. \u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature \u2018did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u2019 <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute. See <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 418, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990) (\u2018[a] statute should be read as a whole and inteipreted so as to give effect to all of its provisions\u2019); <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>180 Conn. 474, 476, 429 A.2d 952 (1980) (it is a \u2018well established principle that statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant\u2019).\u201d <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 100-101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Finally, the phrase within the exception, \u201csuch class of vehicle,\u201d refers to \u201cany motor vehicle designed or used to transport merchandise, freight or persons in connection with any business enterprise,\u201d contained in the first clause of \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12). Therefore, the second clause incorporates the notion that only those motor vehicles designed or used in connection with a business enterprise fall within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">To summarize, we are presented with \u00a7 38a-336, which requires underinsured motorist coverage according to the regulations promulgated by the insurance commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 38a-334. Section 38a-334 (a) encompasses various classes of motor vehicles, namely, private passenger motor vehicles, motor vehicles with a commercial registration, motorcycles, motor vehicles used to transport passengers for hire, motor vehicles in livery service and vanpool vehicles. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>private passenger motor vehicle classification is defined in \u00a7 38a-363 (e) (6), which brings within the classification \u201ca vehicle with a commercial registration, as defined in subdivision (12) of [\u00a7 14-1 (a)]. . . .\u201d Section 14-1 (a) (12) excepts from its general definition of commercial registration \u201ca more specific type of registration . . . authorized and issued by the commissioner\u201d for the class of vehicle previously described in the general definition, namely, \u201cany motor vehicle designed or used to transport merchandise, freight or persons in connection with any business enterprise . . . .\u201d The parties stipulated to the fact that the vehicle at issue, which possessed a municipal registration, was used by firefighters employed by the defendant to transport medical emergency equipment and technicians to emergency calls. It therefore cannot be said, nor does either party contend, that the vehicle was designed or used in connection with a business enterprise. Thus, the vehicle at issue in this case is not a \u201cmotor vehicle with a commercial registration\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 38a-363 (e) (6), and therefore does not fall under the private passenger motor vehicle classification in \u00a7 38a-334 for which underinsured motorist coverage is mandated pursuant to \u00a7 38a-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 \u00a7 38a-334 and 38a-336 lends further support to our conclusion that those statutes do not require the defendant to maintain underinsured motorist coverage on the vehicle at issue here. The legislative history suggests that only those classes of vehicles enumerated in \u00a7 38a-334 fall under the mandatory uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In 1967, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1967, No. 510, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Minimum Provisions for Private Passenger Automobile Liability Insurance Policies.\u201d This legislation, later codified at \u00a7\u00a7 38a-334 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>through 38a-336, 38a-338 and 38a-340,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> required uninsured motorist coverage in all automobile liability insurance policies covering private passenger automobiles. In 1979, the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 38-175c, now \u00a7 38a-336, to mandate the inclusion of underinsured motorist coverage. See Public Acts 1979, No. 79-235.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In 1971, the legislature amended General Statutes (Sup. 1969) \u00a7 38-175a, now \u00a7 38a-334, to add insurance policies covering commercial motor vehicles to the ambit of the statute. See Public Acts 1971, No. 364. In 1985, the legislature further amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 38-175a, now \u00a7 38a-334, to include within its mandate insurance policies covering motorcycles, public service motor vehicles, motor vehicles in livery service, and vanpool vehicles. See Public Acts 1985, No. 85-12.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The history of this amendment demonstrates that \u201c[t]he apparent purpose of No. 85-12 of the 1985 Public Acts was ... to extend to the insurance commissioner the ability to authorize regulations, including the mandatory inclusion of uninsured motorists coverages, for [inter alia] motorcycle policies, where no such authority existed before. By so amending the statute, the legislature further mandated that such policies include underinsured motorist coverage . . . .\u201d <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 61, 523 A.2d 477 (1987). \u201c[T]his bill would require the [insurance [c]ommissioner to adopt regulation establishing a minimum provision to be included in motorcycle liability policies and commercial automobile liability policies covering public and livery conveyances. Motorcycles and public and livery conveyances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>already are subject to the State mandatory liability insurance law, but unlike private passenger vehicles, <em>no minimum provisions for such policies have been </em>established.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 28 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1985 Sess., p. 763, remarks of Senator Donald E. Schoolcraft. \u201cThis bill and its amendment is simply intended to <em>give the [ijnsurance [c]ommissioner the ability to draft the amount of liability coverage that should be carried for the vehicles that are defined in the amendment. </em>What the amendment does is refer to those areas of the statutes, in which the vehicles we refer to are defined. The commissioner will then come up with the amount of liability that must be covered and will notify those who must carry the insurance. As you\u2019ll remember last year, we required that motorcycles carry liability insurance. We did not, however, determine how much they must carry, and as with auto coverage, the commissioner himself determines the minimum amount of coverage that a person must have. <em>What this does is it gives him the ability to also regulate these other areas.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1985 Sess., pp. 1575-76, remarks of Representative Morag L. Vance. The legislative history supports our conclusion that only those insurance policies covering those classes of motor vehicles expressly enumerated in \u00a7 38a-334 must provide underinsured motorist coverage. In this connection, it is significant that the legislature has not chosen to include the particular emergency vehicle at issue in the present case within the classes of motor vehicles covered by \u00a7 38a-334.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with this court\u2019s decision and underlying rationale in <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 45. In <em>Beloff, </em>a consolidated appeal, the insureds, each of whom was injured while operating a motorcycle and struck by another motor vehicle, claimed that General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a through 38-175e, now \u00a7\u00a7 38a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>334 through 38a-336, 38a-338 and 38a-340, applied to the insurance policies covering the operated motorcycles so as to require the inclusion of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 52-53. The applicable statute, General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 38-175a, provided in relevant part that it applied to those insurance policies \u201ccovering private passenger automobiles and commercial motor vehicles, as defined in subsection (7) of section 14-1 . . . .\u201d On the basis of the statutory language and legislative history of the underinsured motorist statute, we concluded that a motorcycle was not a private passenger motor vehicle. <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 55-61. We further concluded that, because at the relevant times, motorcycles did not fall within any class of motor vehicles enumerated in \u00a7 38-175a, motorcycle policies were not mandated to provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. Id., 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The plaintiff contends that the vehicle at issue in the present case is a private passenger motor vehicle pursuant to subdivision (6) of \u00a7 38a-363 (e), which brings within the scope of private passenger motor vehicles those vehicles with a commercial registration. The plaintiff argues that the term commercial registration under \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) <em>\u201cmay include </em>\u2018a more specific type of registration . . . authorized and issued by the commissioner for such class of vehicle,\u2019 \u201d and that the municipal registration possessed by the vehicle here is \u201c \u2018a more specific type of registration\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff also argues that the business enteiprise language in the first clause of the definition of commercial registration pursuant to \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) is inapplicable to the second clause. We disagree with the plaintiffs interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">First, the plaintiffs construction deems the term \u201cunless,\u201d as used in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12), to mean \u201cincluding.\u201d We decline to read language of exception, namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201cunless,\u201d to be synonymous with language of inclusion. Second, the plaintiffs construction disregards the language in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12), namely, \u201cany motor vehicle designed or used ... in connection with any business enterprise,\u201d and \u201csuch class of vehicle\u201d in the latter portion of the definition, indicating that only those vehicles involved in a business enterprise are addressed by the definition of \u201ccommercial registration.\u201d Finally, even if we were to agree with the plaintiff that the second part of the definition served as an inclusion, and not as an exception, our conclusion that the vehicle at issue here is not \u201ca vehicle with a commercial registration\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 38a-363 (e) (6) would remain unchanged. It is our construction, which deems the term \u201cunless\u201d to mean \u201cexcept,\u201d and not \u201cincluding,\u201d that renders the last clause of the definition meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff claimed, for the first time, that the classification of private passenger motor vehicle in \u00a7\u00a7 38a-334 (a) and 38a-363 (e) was drawn because of the no-fault insurance statutory scheme, which was repealed by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-297, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 29, effective January 1, 1994. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 38a-369. In other words, in the plaintiffs view, only that class of vehicles\u2014the private passenger motor vehicle\u2014fell under the no-fault system.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Although the plaintiff is correct in stating that the piivate passenger motor vehicle classification seived the no-fault scheme, the plaintiff is incorrect in asserting that this classification served only that one function. On the contrary, the classification of private passenger motor vehicle already had been implemented by the creation of the uninsured motorist statute, which predated the no-fault system. As stated previously, in 1967, the General Assembly adopted legislation mandating the inclusion of, inter alia, uninsured motorist coverage in \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>covering <em>private passenger automobiles </em>registered or principally garaged in this state. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1967, No. 510, \u00a7 1. By its language, that uninsured motorist legislation expressly carved out a specific class of motor vehicle, namely, \u201cprivate passenger automobiles,\u201d that would fall under its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Evidence of the continued viability of the private passenger motor vehicle classification can further be found in the fact that, notwithstanding the repeal of the no-fault insurance statutory scheme, the classification was left in place. Furthermore, the classification continues to be used in the statutes in a variety of motor vehicle and insurance areas. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-12b (\u201c[presentation of insurance identification card or policy and statement that minimum security will be continuously maintained required for issuance of registration\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 14-12c (\u201c[verification of security coverages\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 14-14 (\u201c[registration of motor vehicles owned by minors\u201d; proof of financial responsibility); General Statutes \u00a7 14-15b (\u201c[m]otor vehicle rental contracts\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 14-213b (\u201c[o]peration prohibited when insurance coverage fails to meet minimum requirements\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-9 (b) (1) (\u201carbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes between claimants and insurance companies concerning automobile physical damage and automobile property damage liability claims\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-335 (\u201c[statement of coverage for rented motor vehicle\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-364 (\u201c [insurance identification cards\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-370 (\u201c[r]esidual liability insurance\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (\u201c[mjandatory security requirements\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 38a-372 (\u201c[i]nsurers required to declare that policies deemed to provide required security\u201d). We also note that the statutes to which we have just referred either were amended by Public Act 93-297, which repealed the no-fault scheme, or have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>amended since that repeal, further supporting our conclusion that the private passenger motor vehicle classification remains viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Furthermore, when the legislature has intended to include all motor vehicles within a statute\u2019s scope, it has expressly so provided. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-20b (Public Acts 1998, No. 98-182, \u00a7 7, expanded category of vehicles eligible for number plates for veterans from passenger motor vehicles to all motor vehicles). It has not done so with respect to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The plaintiff also questions why the vehicle in issue here, which must comply with various safety and other motor vehicle requirements; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 14-12 (f) and (h); also is not required to comply with insurance requirements. We note that the vehicle at issue must comply with all <em>applicable </em>insurance requirements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We perceive the plaintiffs larger question to be, however, why <em>all </em>motor vehicles are not required to carry underinsured motorist coverage. That is a policy question for the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">We next consider whether the self-insurance statutes require the defendant to provide underinsured motorist coverage on the vehicle at issue here. The plaintiff first argues that, even if this court concludes that the vehicle at issue is not a private passenger motor vehicle, the defendant, as a self-insurer pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-371, must provide underinsured motorist coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>for all of its \u201c[m]otor vehiclefs],\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (47).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Although this issue also requires us to consider several statutory provisions, we first look to the language of \u00a7 14-129<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to determine whether its provisions require the defendant to provide underinsured motorist coverage for the vehicle at issue here. We note that the self-insurance statute, \u00a7 14-129, and the statute mandating uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, \u00a7 38a-336, appear in separate chapters of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Section 14-129 was enacted in 1951; Public Acts 1951, No. 179, \u00a7\u00a7 17,23; uninsured motorist coverage on all automobile liability insurance policies was mandated sixteen years later in 1967; Public Acts 1967, No. 510, \u00a7\u00a71,2,4; and underinsured motorist coverage was mandated twenty-eight years later in 1979. Public Act 79-235. Not only does neither statutory scheme expressly refer to the other, but also \u00a7 14-129 contains no language referring to underinsured motorist coverage. We conclude that \u00a7 14-129, a statute enacted sixteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>before mandatory uninsured motorist coverage and twenty-eight years before mandatory underinsured motorist coverage, does not require self-insurers to provide underinsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We next turn to \u00a7 38a-371 (c)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in order to discern whether that statute requires the defendant to provide underinsured motorist coverage for the vehicle at issue here. We construe such provision mindful of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-388, which provides: \u201cThe provisions of sections 38a-363 to 38a-388, inclusive, shall be construed to be supplementary and not as a substitute for the provisions of chapters 246, 247 and 248 [of which title 14 is a partj. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of said sections and the provisions of chapters 246, 247 and 248, then the provisions of said chapters shall prevail.\u201d We therefore must construe \u00a7 38a-371 in a manner that permits its provisions to serve as a supplement, and not as a substitute, for the provisions of title 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Section 38a-371 (c) provides: \u201cSubject to approval of the Insurance Commissioner the security required by this section, may be provided by self-insurance .... A person who provides security under this subsection is a self-insurer. A municipality may provide the security required under this section by filing with the commissioner a notice that it is a self-insurer.\u201d Although \u00a7 38a-371 (c) does not expressly identify the type or types of motor vehicles to which it applies, the subsection, by its language, applies to \u201cthe security required under this section,\u201d referring to \u00a7 38a-371. We therefore must identify the security required by \u00a7 38a-371.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Subsection (a) of \u00a7 38a-371 sets forth the scope of the security required by that section. Subdivision (1) of \u00a7 38a-371 (a) provides: \u201cThe owner of a private passenger motor vehicle required to be registered in this state shall provide and continuously maintain throughout the registration period security in accordance with sections 38a-334 to 38a-343, inclusive.\u201d Subdivision (2) of \u00a7 38a-371 (a) then addresses the security required by the owner of a private passenger motor vehicle not required to be registered in this state. Reading subsections (a) and (c) together, we conclude, therefore, that the self-insurance provisions of subsection (c) apply only to the ownership of private passenger motor vehicles. As discussed previously, the vehicle at issue here is not a private passenger motor vehicle and, therefore, \u00a7 38a-371 (c) does not include within its scope insurance requirements regarding this vehicle. Our reading of \u00a7 38a-371 does not conflict with the provisions of title 14 and, therefore, is consistent with the directive in \u00a7 38a-388 to construe the provisions of title 38a in a manner that does nothing more than supplement the provisions of title 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">We next look to the legislative history of the relevant statutes. There is nothing in the legislative history of the applicable motor vehicle and insurance statutory schemes to support the argument that the self-insurance statutes impose the requirement that the vehicle at issue here maintain underinsured motorist coverage. To the contrary, the legislative history supports our conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 14-129 and 38a-371 do not require the defendant to provide underinsured motorist coverage for this vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We begin with the legislative history of \u00a7 14-129. The legislature enacted \u00a7 14-129 in 1951, sixteen years before the uninsured motorist statutory scheme was enacted and twenty-eight years before the enactment of underinsured motorist coverage. Furthermore, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>its enactment in 1951, \u00a7 14-129 has not been amended. The legislature enacted Public Acts 1951, No. 179, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Financial Responsibility of Owners and Operators of Motor Vehicles,\u201d which was later codified in part at \u00a7 14-129. A close look at that public act reveals that the legislation was designed to address the financial responsibility of <em>tortfeasors, </em>who cause injury by virtue of their ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. See, e.g., Public Acts 1951, No. 179, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 7, 10.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, we previously have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of the legislature in enacting the financial responsibility provisions of the motor vehicle law was to keep off our highways the financially irresponsible owner or operator of an automobile who cannot respond in damages for the injuries he may inflict, and to require him, as a condition for securing or retaining a registration or an operator\u2019s license, to furnish adequate means of satisfying possible claims against him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 302, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976). In sum, \u00a7 14-129 was part of the legislative effort to impose minimum liability coverage. Nothing in its history suggests that it was ever intended to trump the subsequently enacted, and more specific, provision regarding uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Furthermore, when the legislature passed Modified House Bill No. 5418, eventually enacted as Public Acts 1967, No. 510, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 4, and codified at \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a and 38-175c, now \u00a7\u00a7 38a-334 and 38a-336, no reference was made to any preexisting uninsured motorist requirements. This absence demonstrates the legislative understanding that such requirements were not previously in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>place pursuant to \u00a7 14-129. See generally 12 S. Proc, Pt. 4, 1967 Sess, pp. 1956-58; 12 H.R. Proc, Pt. 8, 1967 Sess, pp. 3295-97; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 3, 1967 Sess, pp. 1006-1007; see also 12 H. Proc, supra, p. 3296, remarks of Representative Thomas C. Salamone (\u201c[T]his bill authorizes the [insurance] commissioner to adopt regulations which would spell out minimum provisions, conditions, exclusions and definitions which appear in automobile liability policies. . . . [Uninsured motorist [coverage] will now become a mandatory part of minimum provision policies.\u201d). The same holds true concerning the genesis of the underinsured motorist legislation, Substitute Senate Bill No. 1084, which eventually was enacted as Public Acts 1979, No. 79-235. See generally 22 S. Proc, Pt. 5, 1979 Sess, pp. 1353-54, 1369-71, 1520; 22 H.R. Proc, Pt. 16, 1979 Sess, pp. 5339-43; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Insurance and Real Estate, 1979 Sess, pp. 81-82, 100-101, 112, 124; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Transportation, Pt. 2, 1979 Sess, p. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 38a-371 also indicates that its provisions do not impose on the defendant security coverage requirements for the vehicle at issue here, but rather, are limited to policies covering private passenger motor vehicles. The most explicit legislative statement on this issue is located in the history of Senate Bill No. 226, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Exemption of Municipalities from the Self-Insurance Certification Filing Requirement\u201d\u2014a bill eventually enacted by Public Acts 1982, No. 82-145. Public Act 82-145 amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 38-327 (c), now \u00a7 38a-371 (c), to permit municipalities that self-insure to file a notice with the insurance commissioner that they self-insure, instead of being required to comply with the more complicated filing requirements otherwise mandated by subsection (c) of \u00a7 38a-371. The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>history demonstrates that the requirements of \u00a7 38a-371 are limited to private passenger motor vehicles. See 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1982 Sess., p. 1998, remarks of Representative Robert G. Jaekle (\u201c[t]he subsection allowed self-insurance instead of providing <em>insurance policies for private passenger motor vehicles\u201d </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Furthermore, \u201cwe note as a general matter that uninsured [and underinsured] motorist insurance operates upon a different set of principles from those upon which automobile liability and property insurance are premised, and that uninsured motorist insurance protects the named insured against risks that are fundamentally different from liability and property insurance. Automobile liability and property insurance covers damage to other persons or motor vehicles for which the named insured or named insured\u2019s covered motor vehicle is, at least in some measure, responsible. See R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law (1988) \u00a7 4.8 (a), pp. 376-77 and \u00a7 4.9 (a), pp. 385-86. In contrast, the purpose of [un]insured motorist coverage is to protect the named insured and other additional insureds from suffering an inadequately compensated injury caused by an accident with an inadequately insured automobile. . . . <em>Florestal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 299, 305, 673 A.2d 474 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sandor v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>241 Conn. 792, 799-800, 699 A.2d 96 (1997). \u201cBecause uninsured motorist insurance operates upon principles that are different from those on which liability and property insurance are premised\u201d; id., 800; we do not agree with the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 14-129 requires self-insurers to provide underinsured motorist coverage on their motor vehicles regardless of whether they fall within the underinsured motorist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Finally, our conclusion is consistent with our precedent that states that \u201cthe funding mechanism by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>an owner ol\u2018 vehicles decides to meet the requirements of Connecticut insurance law is irrelevant to the obligation of that funding entity to comply with such requirements .... [S]elf-insurance is the functional equivalent of commercial insurance.\u201d <em>Hertz Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co., </em>245 Conn. 374, 378 n.4, 713 A.2d 820 (1998); see also <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>243 Conn. 677, 686, 705 A.2d 1020 (1998) (\u201c[t]he legislature intended to create a uniform scheme of uninsured motorist insurance coverage applicable to self-insurers as well as commercial insurance carriers\u201d). Just as we do not base our conclusion\u2014that the defendant is not required to provide underinsured motorist coverage for the vehicle at issue here\u2014on the defendant\u2019s status as a self-insurer, we do not impose on the defendant additional underinsured motorist requirements because of that same status.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 38a-371 (c) does not specify any particular type of motor vehicles to which it applies. As our statutory analysis reveals, however, \u00a7 38a-371 (c), which refers to the security required by \u00a7 38a-371, applies to private passenger motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The plaintiff also argues that because the self-insurance plan of the defendant covered the vehicle at issue here, all vehicles under the plan must be provided the same coverage. In support of this proposition the plaintiff cites to the \u201cuniform scheme of protection\u201d discussed in <em>Conzo </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>supra, 243 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>686, and \u00a7 14-129 (a). As discussed previously, however, the uniform scheme of protection articulated in <em>Conzo </em>concerned the uniform treatment between a self-insurer and a commercial insurance carrier. Our conclusion does not alter that scheme. With respect to \u00a7 14-129 (a), the plaintiff has pointed to no statutory language or legislative history that suggests that all motor vehicles covered by a self-insurance plan must be treated alike for all purposes of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the conclusion we reach today violates \u00a7 38a-388. Section 38a-388 provides that in the event of any conflict between title 38a and title 14, the provisions of title 14 predominate, and that all motor vehicles, as defined in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (47), fall within the scope of \u00a7 14-129. As discussed previously, however, we have not removed, by virtue of any provision in title 38a, any underinsured motorist requirement that existed pursuant to title 14. Instead, we have construed title 38a as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, title 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The first certified question is answered: No. We need not answer the other certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">No costs shall be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In this opinion KATZ, SULLIVAN and VERTEFEU-ILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-129 provides: \u201cSelf-insurance, (a) Any person in whose name more than twenty-five motor vehicles are registered may quality as a self-insurer by obtaining a certificate of self-insurance issued by the commissioner as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">\u201c(b) The commissioner may, in his discretion, upon the application of such person, issue a certificate of self-insurance when he is satisfied that such person is possessed and will continue to be possessed of ability to pay judgments obtained against such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">\u201c(c) Upon not less than five days\u2019 notice and a hearing pursuant to such notice, the commissioner may, upon reasonable grounds, cancel a certificate of self-insurance.

I disagree with the majority opinion and would construe General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 to require the defendant, whose municipal truck the plaintiff was operating, to afford the plaintiff uninsured and underinsured motorist protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Section 38a-334 (a) requires such coverage for private passenger motor vehicles, as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (e), including \u201cmotor vehicles with a commercial registration, as defined in section 14-1 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) defines \u201c \u2018[c]om<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>mercial registration\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201cthe type of registration required for any motor vehicle designed or used to transport merchandise, freight or persons in connection with any business enterprise, unless a more specific type of registration is authorized and issued for such class of vehicle . . . .\u201d Common experience teaches us that the defendant\u2019s Ford Yankee coach F-350, which was equipped with a Ford Ambulance Preparation Package, was designed to cany persons and loads in connection with business enterprises, and it therefore falls under the statutory definition. Because \u201cno part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase ... [so that] no word [or phrase] in a statute is to be treated as superfluous\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771-72, 695 A.2d 525 (1997); we should consider every word in the statute, including the word \u201cdesigned\u201d found in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The type of registration \u201crequired for\u201d the vehicle at issue here was the one that was in fact issued by the commissioner of motor vehicles, a municipal number plate as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 14-12 (k).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would conclude that the exception contained in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12), which exempts from the general definition of \u201ccommercial registration\u201d a more specific type of registration that is authorized and issued by the commissioner for such class of vehicle, does not apply to a truck with a municipal number plate. I do so because municipal plates are authorized and issued to all classes of municipal motor vehicles, including sedans, station wagons, and trucks of all kinds. I would interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>exception contained in \u00a7 14-1 (a) (12) to refer only to \u201cclass[es] of vehicle[s]\u201d for which the commissioner authorized and issued a specific type of registration such as those found in General Statutes \u00a7 14-25a (certain construction equipment); General Statutes \u00a7 14-25b (special mobile equipment); and General Statutes \u00a7 14-26 (motor or service buses, taxicabs, school buses, motor vehicles in livery service and school buses used in part in livery service).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 38a-334 leads to a result where the plaintiff would have been covered while driving \u201ca private passenger motor vehicle\u201d such as a sedan, station wagon or a light pickup truck owned by the defendant, but he is not covered here because the municipal vehicle was a heavier truck. We should not conclude that the legislature intended such a result. Our interpretation should be consistent with the primary intent of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage legislation. \u201cWe must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). That intent, we have recognized, is to make uninsured and underinsured motorist protection available to the broadest number of accident victims. <em>See Harvey v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 250-51, 449 A.2d 157 (1982) (\u201cit is the intent of the legislature to provide broad coverage to victims of uninsured motorists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">This decision exempts every heavy municipal truck from required coverage and deprives a great number of accident victims of that coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-12 (lc) provides in relevant part: \u201c[T]he commissioner shall issue to a municipality, as defined in section 7-245, or a regional solid waste authority comprised of several municipalities, upon receipt of an application by the municipality or regional solid waste authority, a general distinguishing number plate for use on a motor vehicle owned or leased by such municipality or regional solid waste authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
