App. 127, 132, 733 A.2d 892 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. On September 9, 1996, the plaintiff was driving a motor vehicle on Spruce Bark Road in Hamden. Spruce Bark Road runs along the Mill River (river). Upon noticing a scenic area by the river, the plaintiff decided to stop and take some photographs. The plaintiff parked and then walked away from her vehicle.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the plaintiff was taking photographs, she heard a low rumble, turned around, and saw her vehicle roll down an embankment and into the river.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6Thereafter, the plaintiff went to a nearby house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to summon help. At that time, she took some medication to calm herself. At approximately 7:43 p.m., Officer R. J. Cicero of the Hamden police department was called to respond to the plaintiffs location.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Cicero arrived at the scene, he met with the plaintiff. While speaking with the plaintiff, Cicero detected a smell of alcohol on her breath, noticed her stagger as she stood and walked, and observed that her speech was slurred and that her eyes were glassy and bloodshot. The person who allowed the plaintiff to use the telephone also detected the scent of alcohol on the plaintiffs breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Cicero asked the plaintiff if she had consumed any alcoholic beverages. The plaintiff denied drinking, but stated that she was \u201cheavily medicated.\u201d* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cicero then administered certain field sobriety tests to the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed the horizontal gaze nystagmus test<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the alphabet test,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and refused to attempt the walk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>and turn test<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the one leg stand test,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> explaining that she previously had suffered injuries to her right leg as a result of a prior accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Consequently, Cicero placed the plaintiff under arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a. Upon arrest, Cicero advised the plaintiff of her constitutional rights. The plaintiff was then transported to the Hamden police department, at which she, again, was advised of her constitutional rights and also was given an implied consent advisory. The plaintiff nevertheless refused to submit to a breath test for blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In accordance with \u00a7 14-227b (e), the plaintiffs license was suspended for six months for refusing to submit to a breath test. See footnote 3 of this opinion. Subsequently, the plaintiff requested, and was granted, pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (e) and (g), respectively, an administrative hearing to contest the license suspension resulting from her refusal to be tested. Section 14-227b (g) specifies that a hearing to suspend a person\u2019s license \u201cshall be limited to a determination [by the commissioner] of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor; (2) was such person placed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis or did such person submit to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicated that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight; and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (g); see, e.g., <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>252 Conn. 38, 46-47, 743 A.2d 1110 (2000). At the suspension hearing, an administrative hearing officer, acting on behalf of the commissioner,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> found that all four of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (g) were met. Accordingly, the commissioner ordered that the plaintiffs license be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The plaintiff appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause that she had violated \u00a7 14-227a. The plaintiff also claimed that the commissioner erroneously found that she had been operating her vehicle. The trial court found in favor of the commissioner and rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming \u201cthat the trial court improperly (1) concluded that the police officer had probable cause to arrest her for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, (2) held that the hearing officer\u2019s written decision was not defective in that the decision contained merely a recitation of the four standard issues enumerated in \u00a7 14-227b [g] without any further findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>conclusions of law and (3) concluded, independently, that she operated the vehicle.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, supra, 54 Conn. App. 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that the absence of a \u201ctemporal nexus between the plaintiffs operation of [her] motor vehicle and her being under the influence of liquor or drugs\u201d; id., 131; left the police officer without probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. Id., 132. Thus, the Appellate Court concluded that the evidence in the record was insufficient to support a finding that probable cause existed for Cicero to arrest the plaintiff for violating \u00a7 14-227a. See id., 130. Because the Appellate Court resolved the plaintiffs first claim in her favor, it did not address the plaintiffs remaining claims. Id., 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We granted the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that the evidence in the administrative record was insufficient to establish probable cause that the plaintiff had violated ... \u00a7 14-227a?\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>251 Conn. 904, 905, 738 A.2d 1091 (1999). We conclude that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the evidence in the administrative record was insufficient to support a finding that probable cause existed for Cicero to arrest the plaintiff for violating \u00a7 14-227a. We also conclude that the evidence in the administrative record was sufficient to establish that the plaintiff had operated her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The commissioner claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that there did not exist substantial evidence in the record to establish probable cause that the plaintiff had operated her motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor. In contrast, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the evidence in the administrative record was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>cient to establish probable cause. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Our analysis begins with the appropriate standard of review. \u201c[Jjudicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [(UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>48 Conn. App. 391, 399, 710 A.2d 807 (1998). \u201c[R]eview of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the administrative agency on the weight of the evidence or questions of fact. . . . Our ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dolgner </em>v. <em>Alander, </em>237 Conn. 272, 280, 676 A.2d 865 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u201cThe substantial evidence rule governs judicial review of administrative fact-finding under the UAPA. [See] General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5) and (6). An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . The substantial evidence rule imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u201cIt is fundamental that a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the commissioner, on the facts before him, acted contrary to law and in abuse of his discretion [in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>determining the issue of probable cause]. . . . The law is also well established that if the decision of the commissioner is reasonably supported by the evidence it must be sustained.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Demma </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 15, 16-17, 327 A.2d 569 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We have stated that \u201c[p]robable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred. . . . Reasonable minds may disagree as to whether a particular [set of facts] establishes probable cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Eady, </em>249 Conn. 431, 440, 733 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1030, 120 S. Ct. 551, 145 L. Ed. 2d 428 (1999), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 541, 628 A.2d 567 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 513, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992). Thus, the commissioner need only have \u201ca substantial basis of fact from which [it] can be inferred\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>229 Conn. 31, 40, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994); that the evidence in the administrative record supported a finding of probable cause with respect to the plaintiffs violation of \u00a7 14-227a.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In this case, the essence of the plaintiffs argument is that there was insufficient evidence in the record to establish that Cicero had probable cause to believe that the plaintiff <em>operated </em>her motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of \u00a7 14-227a. We begin by noting that the issue of whether one <em>operates </em>a motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227a is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, making \u201c[p]roof of operation ... a factual determination\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Redden </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>45 Conn. App. 225, 227, 695 A.2d 26 (1997); rather than \u201ca question of law . . . involv[ing] the application, interpretation and construction of [the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ute].\u201d <em>O'Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>33 Conn. App. 501, 505, 636 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 909, 642 A.2d 1205 (1994). In addition, there is no requirement that the fact of operation be established by direct evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On the contrary, our case law clearly establishes that sufficient evidence justifying the commissioner\u2019s determination of probable cause may be found where the \u201ctotality of the circumstances existing at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s arrest support [s] [such a finding] . . . .\u201d <em>Kirei </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>47 Conn. App. 451, 457, 705 A.2d 205 (1998); see, e.g., <em>Schuh </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>48 Conn. App. 547, 549, 551, 711 A.2d 743, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 924, 718 A.2d 21 (1998) (sufficient evidence of operation on public highway found when plaintiff discovered in driver\u2019s seat of stopped vehicle located on grassy slope five to six feet from main travel portion of highway); <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 503, 509 (rejecting plaintiffs challenge to sufficiency of evidence of operating motor vehicle when police officer found plaintiff in stationary vehicle after accident but did not witness operation of vehicle).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>For example, in <em>Kirei </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 451, the plaintiff claimed that the trial court improperly concluded that there was substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that he operated his vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227a when the police had discovered him walking a short distance from his vehicle, which was abandoned in a nearby snow bank. Id., 452-53. The plaintiff in <em>Kirei </em>testified at his suspension hearing that his consumption of intoxicating liquor occurred <em>after </em>he had operated his vehicle. Id., 456-57. Nevertheless, the hearing officer was not persuaded by the plaintiffs testimony. Id., 457. The Appellate Court concluded that \u201cit was within the hearing officer\u2019s province to determine whether he <em>believed </em>the plaintiffs testimony regarding when the plaintiff consumed liquor in relation to the time of operating his motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In <em>Kirei, </em>the Appellate Court concluded that \u201cthe testimony of the police officers, the police reports that were admitted into evidence and the totality of the circumstances existing at the time of the plaintiffs arrest support[ed] the hearing officer\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor.\u201d Id., 457. We conclude that there is a similar \u201cbasis in fact\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 455; in this case in which lies the nexus between the plaintiffs consumption of intoxicating liquor and her operation of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In this case, the testimony of the plaintiff, the police reports upon which the commissioner relied and the totality of the circumstances existing when the plaintiff was arrested all support the commissioner\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to believe that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>had violated \u00a7 14-227a. The plaintiffs car was found in the river, her breath smelled of alcohol and she lacked sufficient coordination to pass simple, field sobriety tests. The plaintiff, herself, testified that she was driving past the scenic area when she decided to pull over and take photographs. See footnote 6 of this opinion. She also testified that this occurred at \u201cabout 7 [or] 7:30 [p.m.].\u201d Id. The police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. The commissioner reasonably could have concluded, based on the plaintiffs testimony and other facts in the record, that the plaintiff was under the influence of intoxicating liquor before her vehicle rolled down the embankment and into the river, and that she had operated the vehicle while she was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The absence of witnesses to the plaintiffs operation of the vehicle is not dispositive on the issue of operation. To be sure, it is often the case that police officers investigate \u00a7 14-227a violations after the intoxicated driver has ceased operating the vehicle. See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 503. The circumstantial evidence in this case, including the observations of Cicero and other facts in the record, creates the \u201ctemporal nexus\u201d; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 132; that, according to the Appellate Court, was lacking. It is incumbent upon this court to rely on the circumstantial evidence obtained by the police to determine that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of probable cause. Therefore, we conclude that it was not unreasonable for both the police officer and the commissioner to find that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>was probable cause to believe that the plaintiff drove her vehicle to the location from which the vehicle had rolled into the river, and that the plaintiff had been under the influence of intoxicating liquor when she drove the vehicle to that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We conclude that: (1) the evidence in the administrative record was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 14-227a; and (2) the evidence in the administrative record was sufficient to support a finding that the plaintiff had operated her motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly held that the hearing officer\u2019s written decision was not defective in that the decision contained merely a recitation of the four standard issues enumerated in \u00a7 14-227b (g) without any further findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provides in relevant part: \u201cOperation while under the influence of liquor or drug or while impaired by liquor, (a) Operation while under the influence. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. A person commits the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both if he operates a motor vehicle ... (1) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both or (2) while the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person is ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-5\"> The first of these two issues is the only certified issue in this appeal. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>251 Conn. 904, 905, 738 A.2d 1091 (1999). The plaintiff distinctly raised the second issue before the Appellate Court. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>54 Conn. App. 127, 128-29, 733 A.2d 892 (1999). Both issues, however, are related, and we conclude that, in briefing the first issue, the plaintiff adequately briefed the second issue as an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court. \u201c[Although the plaintiff] failed to preserve [the second issue] for appeal by filing a statement of alternative grounds for affirmance pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-11 (c), which provides in relevant part [that] [a]ny party desiring to present alternative grounds for affirmance . . . shall file a statement thereof within fourteen days from the issuance of notice of certification ... we have refused to consider an issue not contained in a preliminary statement of issues only in cases in which the opposing party would be prejudiced by consideration of the issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 596, 599-600 n.3, 748 A.2d 278 (2000). Therefore, in this case, we consider the plaintiffs alternative ground for affirmance inasmuch as the defendant, commissioner of motor vehicles, has not argued that he was prejudiced by the plaintiffs failure to file a preliminary statement of issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b provides in relevant part: \u201cImplied consent to test.
