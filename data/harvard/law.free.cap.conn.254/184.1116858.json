Amado, 42 Conn. App. 348, 362, 680 A.2d 974 (1996). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification; <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>242 Conn. 906, 697 A.2d 368 (1997); and remanded the case to the Appellate Court for reconsideration in light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>241 Conn. 702, 709, 699 A.2d 57 (1997), in which we held that a conviction for felony murder could not serve as a predicate felony for a conviction of capital felony. On remand, the Appellate Court reversed the intentional murder and capital felony convictions, concluding that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the victims\u2019 right to use reasonable force in defense of premises pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-20,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u00a7 53a-19 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>50 Conn. App. 607, 624, 719 A.2d 45 (1998). Because our remand was confined to the issue relating to our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 702, the Appellate Court did not revisit its previous holding that, as a matter of law, self-defense does not apply to a charge of felony murder. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s felony murder convictions remain in effect, but he stands to receive a new trial on the intentional murder and capital felony counts. The state and the defendant both petitioned for certification to appeal to this court, and we granted both petitions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions concerning the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat and the victims\u2019 right to use force in defense of premises did not constitute clear error of constitutional magnitude, and we reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment in that respect. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>conclude that the Appellate Court, in its earlier opinion, correctly determined that self-defense is not available as a defense to a charge of felony murder. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court in part and affirm it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The evidence that was before the jury is set forth in the first Appellate Court opinion; <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 351-56; and need not be repeated in detail for purposes of this appeal. It is sufficient to note that the jury reasonably could have found the following: \u201cThe defendant, accompanied by several other people, went to the home of Anthony Young in Bridgeport, after the defendant received information that Young had taken a quantity of cocaine from the defendant\u2019s West Haven apartment. As the defendant stood on the porch of Young\u2019s home, Young opened the door. After accusing Young of having his cocaine, the defendant pulled out his [nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun] and fired five shots, wounding both Young and Peter Hall, who was standing behind Young. Both men were alive when emergency medical personnel arrived at the house. Young was [found] clutching afully loaded magazine for an automatic weapon, and Hall was [found] holding a small automatic pistol. Both men later died [from their wounds].</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u201cThe defendant testified that as Young was denying complicity in the theft of the defendant\u2019s cocaine, Hall reached for the waistband of his trousers and started to draw a gun. The defendant claimed that he pulled his gun and fired into the house in self-defense only after Young had taken a step toward him and Hall had started to draw a gun from his waistband.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 613. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">On appeal, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the defendant was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to prevail under <em>State v. Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239\u201440, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), on his unpreserved claim regarding the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning self-defense, in particular, the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat and the victims\u2019 right to use reasonable force in defense of their premises. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. During its instructions on the intentional murder and capital felony charges, the trial court initially charged the jury on the victims\u2019 right to use reasonable force in defense of premises under \u00a7 53a-20. The trial court explained to the jury that \u201cwe all understand that we are here for the trial of [the defendant]. But the trial involves two people who are dead as well, so, we have to look at both positions. . . . [T]he two guys Young and Hall in the house . . . they have a right to be in that home and as such the law protects them from intruders, invaders, trespassers or anybody coming into the home that they do not want into that home even to the extent of using force to repel the persons attempting to come there. . . . The statute reads as follows: A person in possession or control of premises . . . is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes such to be necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass by such other person in or upon such premises. . . . That\u2019s the perspective of Young and Hall in that house. Under the law they have a right to remain there, they have a right to be armed in their house, they have a right to repel anybody that\u2019s coming by the utilization of force, even deadly force, if they reasonably believe that they are going to be subject to a violent act or it is necessary to repel the trespass which is eminent. Now, that applies to them. . . . That\u2019s not self-defense. Self-defense in this case is the self-defense claim that applies to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The trial court then proceeded to instruct the jury as to the defendant\u2019s defense of self-defense with regard to the intentional murder charge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court charged the jury as to the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat under \u00a7 53a-19 (b). The court stated that \u201c[a] person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety. . . . You may not be [justified] in using deadly force if [the defendant] knew that he could avoid the necessity of using such . . . with.complete safety by, one, retreating, except that an actor who used force [would] not be required to retreat if he is in his dwelling .... Now, you have to put that in the context of this case. . . . The law is clear that the issue is what the defendant reasonably believes at the time of the incident. That is the issue. What the defendant reasonably believes at the time of the incident. The question is what he reasonably believed under the circumstances as he saw them but is not the actual danger but what reasonably appeared to be\u2014to the defendant.\u201d The trial court later revisited the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat, stating that \u201c[t]he defendant may not use deadly force even in self-defense unless he has no reasonable basis of avoiding the threatened injury in some other manner. The defendant would not have been justified in standing his ground against the threatened attack to fend it off if he could with complete safety, avoid the confrontation by retreating. However, in considering whether the defendant could have retreated in safety the element of practicality must be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">During deliberations, the jury requested clarification regarding the rights available to lawful residents of the house. The court recharged the jury on the substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>of \u00a7 53a-20, noting that \u201c[t]he statute . . . applies to the people that are within the house . . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, the trial court stated that \u201cthe occupant of the home has no obligation to retreat. When you are in your home and if you reasonably feel there\u2019s an attempt by someone to commit a trespass and you are concerned about the use of deadly physical force you need not retreat. That is distinguished from the requirement when utilizing the defense of self-defense outside the presence of a home or workplace. The first obligation is to consider, is it possible to retreat . . . .\u201d The trial court then instructed the jury that the defendant has a duty to retreat \u201cif he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety .... The law is clear that the issue is what the defendant reasonably believes at the time of the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Appellate Court held that, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the defendant was entitled to prevail on his unpreserved claim that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury violated his constitutional right to present a defense. The Appellate Court stated that \u201c[b]ecause the [trial] court\u2019s instructions and the defendant\u2019s claims regarding both the duty to retreat and the victims\u2019 rights to use reasonable force in defense of their premises are so intertwined, we will discuss them together.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 615. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 651 A.2d 247 (1994), the Appellate Court majority concluded that \u201cit was reasonably possible that th[e] mixture of correct and incorrect instructions [concerning the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat] misled the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 617. The Appellate Court also concluded that \u201c [b]ecause the court improperly interjected instructions as to the victims\u2019 rights to defend their premises ... it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled as to the proper method by which it should have evaluated the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim; that is, by considering solely the defendant\u2019s perspective concerning the circumstances.\u201d Id., 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On appeal, the state argues that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the jury charge because the court never contradicted itself as to the standard to be applied in analyzing the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat. Merely failing to repeat the subjective standard does not amount to a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. The state also argues that the defendant\u2019s claim with regard to the victims\u2019 right to use force in defense of premises does not warrant reversal under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We reaffirm that \u201c[a] fundamental element of due process is the right of a defendant charged with a crime to establish a defense. . . . This fundamental constitutional right includes proper jury instructions on the elements of self-defense so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. . . . A defendant who asserts a recognized legal defense, the availability of which is supported by the evidence, is entitled as a matter of law to a theory of defense instruction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 526, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cAn improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension. . . . [T]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether the jury was misled, [i]t is well established that [a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . The charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 493-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to reiterate that the defendant must have actual knowledge that he can retreat safely may have confused the jury. We disagree. The trial court correctly instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he law is clear that the issue is what the defendant reasonably believes at the time of the incident. . . . The question is what he reasonably believed under the circumstances as he saw them but is not the actual danger but what reasonably appeared to be\u2014to the defendant.\u201d Although the trial court later revisited the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and did not repeat the subjective nature of the inquiry in its instructions to the jury, it subsequently gave another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>instruction that, again, expressly put forth the appropriate standard. On recharge, the trial court reiterated that the defendant has a duty to retreat \u201cif he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety .... The law is clear that the issue is what the defendant reasonably believes at the time of the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We conclude that there was not a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled because the trial court referred to the correct standard each time that it discussed the standard. This court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 484, is distinguishable. In <em>Ash, </em>the trial court misstated the law \u201cwhen it instructed the jury to consider \u2018what was reasonable for the defendant to perceive was available as retreat\u2019 and to view the defendant\u2019s actions \u2018as you would perceive a reasonable person to view the same situation, under the same conditions.\u2019 \u201d Id., 494-95. There we held that \u201c[t]hese words incorrectly suggested that the statute permitted the jury to measure the defendant\u2019s knowledge of his ability to retreat according to an objective standard of reasonableness rather than the subjective standard of the defendant\u2019s actual knowledge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 495. The trial court in <em>Ash </em>also misstated the law to the jury on recharge, through its \u201cuse of the words could perceive . . . rather than directing them to consider what the defendant did perceive . . . [that] further muddied the jury\u2019s understanding of the proper subjective standard. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 496. On appeal, we concluded that although \u201cthe trial court first stated the statutory language correctly. ... [it was] subsequently clouded by the trial court\u2019s misstatements of law . . . .\u201d Id., 495. As a result, this court held that it was reasonably possible that the jury, viewing the charge in its entirety, was misled by the combination of accurate and inaccurate language on the duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In the present case, the trial court never instructed the jury \u201cto view the defendant\u2019s actions \u2018as you would perceive a reasonable person to view the same situation,\u2019 \u201d and the jury was not led to believe that it should measure \u201cthe defendant\u2019s knowledge of his ability to retreat according to an objective standard of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 . . . .\u201d Id. The trial court did not misstate the law with respect to the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat, as the trial count did in <em>Ash, </em>but merely failed to repeat the subjective standard with regard to the defendant\u2019s apprehension of an opportunity to retreat. Each time that the standard was discussed, however, the trial court properly referred to the subjective standard. We conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by these instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Appellate Court also concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the victims\u2019 right to defend the premises may have misled the jury. We disagree. The trial court instructed the jury on the victims\u2019 right to defend the premises in order to inform the jury that the victims did not have the same duty to retreat as did the defendant. This instruction was necessary so that the jury could understand that the victims had the right to repel a forcible entry into their dwelling even with deadly force under certain circumstances. The jury\u2019s knowledge of such an instruction did not \u201cin any way diminish their understanding of the defendant\u2019s right to self-defense . . . [because] the trial court was careful to specify that the instruction on the right to defend property applied to the victims and that the instruction on self-defense applied to the defendant . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 629-30 <em>(Lavery, J., </em>dissenting). The trial court expressly separated its instruction regarding the victims\u2019 right to use force in defense of the premises from its instruction regarding the defendant\u2019s defense of self-defense. Immediately following its discussion of \u00a7 53a-20, the court noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201c[n]ow, that [instruction as to the defense of premises] applies to [the victims]. . . . That\u2019s not self-defense. Self-defense in this case is the self-defense claim that applies to the defendant.\u201d The court then proceeded to discuss the defendant\u2019s defense of self-defense. The instruction regarding the victims\u2019 right to defend their property was separate and clearly did not affect the instructions concerning the defendant\u2019s right to the defense of self-defense. Moreover, the jury was instructed that the subjective standard applied to the person having the duty to retreat and that the victims defending their premises had no duty to retreat. We fail to see how the trial court\u2019s instructions could have led the jury to believe that it should consider a perspective other than that of the defendant in evaluating the claim of self-defense. Thus, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim on cross appeal is that the Appellate Court improperly held, as a matter of law, that a defendant accused of felony murder may not rely on a claim of self-defense. The defendant argues that, because the trial court refused to instruct the jury on self-defense with respect to the felony murder charges, he was deprived of his statutory right to use justification as a defense; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19; and his constitutional rights to be presumed innocent, present a defense, due process and trial before a properly instructed jury. U.S. Const., amends. V, VI, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 19.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Whether self-defense applies to a charge of felony murder is a question of law. \u201cThis court has plenary review of the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>252 Conn. 128, 138, 750 A.2d 448 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The felony murder statute, \u00a7 53a-54c, provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 812, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the jury an instruction on a claim of self-defense as to the defendant\u2019s intentional murder and felony murder charges, concluding that \u201c[o]ne who commits or attempts a robbery armed with deadly force, and kills the intended victim when the victim responds with force to the robbery attempt, may not avail himself of the defense of self-defense. It has long been accepted that one cannot support a claim of self-defense by a self-generated necessity to kill. ... In sum, one who is the aggressor in a conflict culminating in death cannot invoke the necessities of self-preservation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The defendant argues that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Lewis </em>did not establish a bright line rule that a claim of self-defense, as a matter of law, is not available to an individual charged with felony murder. The defendant argues that, because in <em>Lewis </em>we reviewed the evidence concerning the issue of whether the defendant was the initial aggressor pursuant to \u00a7 53a-19 (c), we implicitly limited its holding to the facts of the case and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>hold that self-defense is unavailable to eveiy defendant accused of committing felony murder. We disagree. Although, in <em>Lewis, </em>we reviewed the evidence concerning the determination of whether the defendant was the initial aggressor, we did so only because an instruction on a claim of self-defense may have been proper as to the intentional murder charge against the defendant in that case. We expressly noted that \u201c[e]ven if we were to assume without deciding that this evidence, viewed in the context of all the evidence regarding the killing of the victims, would have permitted a rational jury to find self-defense without resorting to speculation, the defendant was not entitled to an instruction on that theoiy of defense because he was engaged in robbing the victims when his purported justification for killing them arose.\u201d Id., 811-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>34 F.3d 44, 48 (2d Cir. 1994), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that \u201c[o]ne who commits or attempts a robbery armed with deadly force, and kills the intended victim when the victim responds with force to the robbery attempt, may not avail himself of the defense of self-defense.\u201d The defendant in <em>Thomas </em>had argued that the United States District Court improperly omitted a portion of the jury charge regarding the burden of proof in a claim of self-defense, and the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201ceven if the charge failed to place the burden on the government, there was no reversible error . . . because, given the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants committed the killing of [the victim] in an attempt to rob him, the defendants were not entitled, as a matter of law, under the circumstances, to rely on the defense of self-defense.\u201d Id., 47-48. Thus, \u201c[t]he [District Court\u2019s] failure to make clear that the burden on the issue of self-defense rests on the government [could not] have prejudiced the defendants when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>had no right to have the jury consider the issue at all.\u201d Id., 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Other jurisdictions also have denied \u201ca self-defense claim where the defendant was a participant in a felony and committed the homicidal act during the course of the felony.\u201d P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses (1984), \u00a7 132, p. 99; see, e.g., <em>Street v. Warden, </em>423 F. Sup. 611, 613-14 (D.

We disagree. Our holding is premised on the fact that a finding, and not an accusation, of felony murder is incompatible with the defense of self-defense. Our rule as to self-defense assumes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>jury concluded that the defendant was in the course of and in furtherance of attempted robbery when the murder occurred. If the jury concluded that the defendant was not committing a felony at the time of the murder, the jury was instructed to find the defendant not guilty of felony murder. Our holding today does not violate the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Finally, our holding is consistent with the purpose underlying felony murder, which is \u201cto punish those whose conduct brought about an unintended death in the commission or attempted commission of a felony. . . . The felony murder rule includes accidental, unintended deaths. Indeed, we have noted that crimes against the person like robbery, rape and common-law arson and burglary are, in common experience, likely to involve danger to life in the event of resistance by the victim . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>221 Conn. 643, 667, 607 A.2d 355 (1992). Accordingly, when one kills in the commission of a felony, that person cannot claim self-defense, for \u201cthis would be fundamentally inconsistent with the very purpose of the felony murder [statute].\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Loustaunau, </em>181 Cal. App. 3d 163, 170, 226 Cal. Rptr. 216 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In the present case, the jury reasonably found that the defendant was engaged in the attempted robbery of the victims when the shootings occurred. The evidence indicated that the defendant arrived at the victims\u2019 house, armed with a nine millimeter handgun, with the intention of regaining his cocaine. After the defendant accused the victims of having his cocaine, and both denied having the drugs, the defendant began shooting. The jury could, and did, find that the shootings were in the course of and in furtherance of an attempted robbery. The defendant\u2019s testimony that the victims first utilized physical force does not require that he have a defense of self-defense. For purposes of felony murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cit is immaterial whether the victim of the [felony] or the defendant [first utilizes physical force].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 338 N.C. 387. It is inconsistent with the purpose of the felony murder statute to allow a defendant who causes a death in the course of a felony to claim self-defense because the victim attempted to thwart such a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed insofar as it reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting the defendant of murder and capital felony and is affirmed in all other respects, and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of any of the following ...
