Muiphy III, guilty of one count of criminal attempt to commit harassment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 53a-49,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>subsequently, also found the defendant guilty of being a persistent offender under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40d.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdicts and the defendant appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) his conviction of criminal attempt to commit harassment in the second degree violated his right to free speech under the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that it could not convict him on the basis of the content of his speech; and (3) the state failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We reject these claims and, consequently, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant met the victim in 1990 and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>relationship subsequently became romantic. Their relationship, however, was marked by domestic discord, and the defendant was arrested on domestic violence charges in September and December, 1994, and again in February, 1995. Ultimately, the defendant was convicted of two counts of assault in the third degree<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> stemming from those incidents of domestic violence. The defendant received a suspended sentence and was placed on probation. In addition, the defendant was ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and to undergo anger management training. A protective order prohibiting the defendant from contacting the victim also was issued at that time. That order later was modified at the victim\u2019s request to permit contact between the victim and the defendant. By December, 1995, however, the victim had terminated her romantic relationship with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">On January 18, 1996, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s residence without her consent and compelled her to engage in sexual intercourse. Consequently, the defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault in the first degree,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> among other offenses. Although, thereafter, another protective order was issued prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim, the defendant, who remained incarcerated in lieu of bond pending his trial, persisted in his efforts to contact the victim by mail and telephone, often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>entreating her to drop the sexual assault charges. As a result of these contacts, the defendant was charged, in February, 1996, with violating the protective order, and, in May, 1996, with tampering with a witness. In August, 1996, the defendant was found to have violated the terms and conditions of his probation that had been imposed in connection with his third degree assault convictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In October, 1996, the defendant pleaded guilty to sexual assault in the first degree under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 15, 1996, the trial court imposed a sentence of twelve years imprisonment, suspended after five years, and ten years probation. Among the special conditions imposed upon the defendant was a prohibition against any contact with the victim or her children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s prohibition against contact with the victim, the defendant continued to attempt to contact her by telephone and mail. On November 25, 1996, the victim received a birthday card from the defendant, which she opened and read. The victim testified that the defendant\u2019s comments in the card were alarming and offensive,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that she was particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>upset at receiving the card so soon after the defendant had been convicted and sentenced for sexually assaulting her. The victim turned the card over to State Trooper Lynn Lewis, who had investigated the defendant\u2019s sexual assault case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">On January 6, 1997, the victim received three more letters from the defendant. The victim, having been upset by the defendant\u2019s continued attempts to contact her, and assuming that the letters contained statements similar to those in the birthday card, turned the letters over to Lewis without opening them. One of the letters, consisting of seven handwritten pages, contained two poems and a note in which the defendant complained about his misfortunes, professed his love for the victim and her children and appealed to her for help. Another letter, consisting of ten handwritten pages, was angrier in tone and repeatedly accused the victim of lying about the sexual assault and attempting to destroy the defendant\u2019s life. In one passage, the defendant wrote to the victim: \u201c[ Y]ou are afraid of what\u2019s going to happen when I get out. So you figure [you will] lie to keep me in here for as long as [you] can [sic] that\u2019s not the right answer . . . believe me. It\u2019s only going to make matters worse . . . .\u201d The defendant later added: \u201c[W]hat do you think is going to happen then . . . [w]hen I do get out of here after all that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The state filed a three count information charging the defendant with one count of harassment in the second degree and two counts of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree. The birthday card that the victim received in the mail from the defendant on November 25,1996, provided the basis for the count of harassment in the second degree. The defendant\u2019s mailing of the seven page letter that included the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>poems and the note formed the basis for one of the two counts of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree, and the mailing of the ten page letter provided the basis for the second such count. The jury acquitted the defendant of harassment in the second degree and found him guilty of the count of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree predicated on the mailing of the seven page letter. The jury could not reach a verdict on the other count of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree and, as a result, the trial court declared a mistrial as to that count.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction rendered in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree based upon the mailing of the seven page letter to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The defendant first claims that the state violated his first amendment rights by \u201c[unconstitutionally [applying] ... \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) [t]o [his] [s]peech . . . .\u201d Specifically, the defendant contends that his conviction was predicated upon the content of the letter that he sent to the victim rather than his conduct in using the mail to harass the victim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The defendant concedes that his claim is unpreserved and, therefore, seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),* 1*3**********<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the record is adequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim, we conclude that he is not entitled to a new trial under <em>Golding </em>because he has not established a constitutional violation. We further conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated plain error because the alleged impropriety did not implicate the fairness of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) prohibits communications by mail that are made \u201cwith intent to harass, annoy or alarm\u201d and \u201cin a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm . . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) proscribes harassing conduct via mail and does not seek to regulate the content of communications made by mail.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>49 Conn. App. 617, 625, 717 A.2d 240 (1998); see also <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>632 F.2d 938, 942 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1023, 101 S. Ct. 591, 66 L. Ed. 2d 485 (1980) (\u00a7 53a-183 regulates conduct, not mere speech); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>55 Conn. App. 475, 481, 739 A.2d 714, cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>252 Conn. 908, 743 A.2d 619 (1999) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1978-4), </em>34 Conn. Sup. 689, 696, 389 A.2d 1270 (1978) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Nevertheless, in a prosecution seeking a conviction under \u00a7 53a-183, the fact finder may consider the language used in the communication in determining whether the state has proven the elements of the offense, namely, that the defendant intended to harass, annoy or alarm, and that he did so in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm. See <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>supra, 632 F.2d 943; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 484; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewtan, </em>5 Conn. App. 79, 83, 497 A.2d 60 (1985); see also <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>508 U.S. 476, 489, 113 S. Ct. 2194, 124 L. Ed. 2d 436 (1993) (\u201c[t]he First Amendment . . . does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent\u201d). Indeed, the use of such evidence may be \u201cindispensable to a proper determination of whether the statutory requirement of intent to harass ha[s] been proven.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>supra, 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The state introduced a number of letters into evidence, including the letters that formed the basis of the charges against the defendant, as well as certain tape recordings and transcripts of telephone conversations between the defendant and the victim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to the introduction of any of these communications at trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> During closing arguments, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>prosecutor urged the jury to examine the language the defendant used in his letters and conversations with the victim to assist it in ascertaining the defendant\u2019s intent in sending the allegedly harassing letters. At no time did the prosecutor imply that the defendant should be convicted based upon the content of his communications; rather, the prosecutor argued only that those communications were evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to harass, annoy or alarm.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In fact, during closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>arguments, defense counsel also urged the jury to consider the contents of the communications to \u201cget a flavor for all of the words\u201d so that the jury might appreciate the benign intent of the defendant in drafting and mailing the three letters. Indeed, the defendant sought unsuccessfully to introduce into evidence the contents of an additional letter, claiming that it also was relevant to his state of mind, an issue that the defendant accurately characterized as a \u201ccentral focus of [the] proceedings.\u201d Moreover, during closing arguments, defense counsel expressly urged the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s first amendment rights in evaluating the defendant\u2019s repeated requests for the victim\u2019s assistance in obtaining a sentence reduction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Finally, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> emphasizing that the state was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>required to establish that the defendant mailed the letters with the specific intent of harassing, annoying or alarming the victim. At no time did the court suggest or otherwise intimate in its instructions that the jury was free to convict the defendant based upon the content of his communications rather than his conduct in mailing the allegedly offending letters with the intent to harass, annoy or alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The record, therefore, does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that his conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) and 53a-49 was predicated upon the exercise of his right to free speech. Consequently, he cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. See footnote 14 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We also conclude that the defendant is not entitled to relief under the plain error doctrine. \u201cThe plain error doctrine of Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 requires a defendant to demonstrate that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>250 Conn. 807, 814, 740 A.2d 371 (1999). \u201c[W]e consistently have stated that review under the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>249 Conn. 288, 291, 734 A.2d 533 (1999). Because the defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine is predicated on his contention that his conviction was obtained in violation of his first amendment rights, a contention that we already have rejected, he cannot prevail on his plain error claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is related to his first: the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>it could convict him only on the basis of his conduct and not the content of his speech. The defendant contends that, as a result of the trial court\u2019s omission, the jury necessarily convicted him on the basis of the content of his communications in violation of his rights under the first amendment. Because the defendant never requested such an instruction, he seeks a new trial under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although the record is adequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim, we conclude that he cannot prevail thereon because he has not demonstrated that the trial court\u2019s instruction was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\u201cWhen reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995). [I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 170-71, 665 A.2d 63 (1995). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>247 Conn. 616, 625, 725 A.2d 306 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\u201cIn determining whether it was . . . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995) . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>252 Conn. 795, 815-16, 750 A.2d 1037 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In its instructions to the jury, the trial court recited the text of \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) and properly described the elements of the crime of attempt to commit harassment in the second degree.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Indeed, the defendant does not claim otherwise. As we previously have indicated; see part I of this opinion; \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) prohibits conduct, not speech. \u201cWhat is proscribed is the [mailing of the letter], with the requisite intent and in the specified manner. ... To run afoul of the statute, [the letter] must be [mailed] not merely to communicate, but with intent to harass, annoy or alarm and in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 480-81, quoting <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Director, Connecticut State Dept. of Probation, </em>supra, 632 F.2d 941-42. There is nothing in the court\u2019s instructions or in the arguments of counsel that would have caused the jury to reach a contrary understanding.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Because the trial court\u2019s instructions with respect to \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) were proper in all respects, the defendant cannot prevail on his claim of instructional impropriety under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, or the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The defendant also maintains that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had intended to harass, annoy or alarm the victim and that he had communicated with her in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>lished by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\u201cFurthermore, [i]n [our] process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. . . . Indeed, direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. . . . This does not require that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from the evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt . . . because this court has held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\u201cFinally, [a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 239-40, 745 A.2d 800 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The evidence revealed that the defendant had engaged in several acts of domestic violence against the victim. He was convicted of assault in the third degree stemming from that misconduct and a court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>issued a protective order prohibiting the defendant from contacting the victim. Although that order later was modified, the defendant subsequently sexually assaulted the victim by forcing her to have intercourse with him. Thereafter, another protective order was issued. The defendant nevertheless sent letters to the victim and continued to attempt to contact her by telephone.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In his letters, the defendant repeatedly accused the victim of being a liar and of ruining his life. The defendant also persisted in seeking to communicate with the victim after his sexual assault conviction, even though he knew that she did not want him to do so. Indeed, he sent her a birthday card just a few days after sentencing for that offense, which was followed by more letters shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In light of this evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that, by January 6, 1997, the date on which the victim received, inter alia, the seven page letter that led to his conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) and 53a-49, the victim reasonably felt harassed, annoyed and alarmed by the defendant\u2019s repeated attempts to communicate with her despite her requests, and court orders directing, that he cease doing so.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The jury also reasonably could have concluded that the defendant knew that the victim\u2019s receipt of that letter would cause her to feel harassed, annoyed or alarmed, and that he mailed the letter intending to evoke such a reaction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for attempt to commit harassment in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-I83 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when ...

The evidence may also be used ... to identify the person who committed the crime, and you may consider it as to motive. However, motive is not an element of this crime. . . .

You are going to have to decide what it is that you believe that [the defendant] <em>intended when he drafted and prepared that and mailed it </em>to [the victim]. You are going to have to decide whether or not you think that that communication was harassing, annoying or alarming. That is your job. I am asking you ... to do it. If you don\u2019t believe that the evidence that [was] presented here establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] <em>intended </em>to, in fact, harass, annoy, or alarm [the victim], then you should return a not guilty verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201cYou will also have other exhibits that are tape-recorded conversations, transcripts of those conversations. Use these ... in coming to your conclusions <em>as to [the </em>defendant\u2019s] <em>intentions.

What happened was [that the defendant] communicated with [the victim] between January . . . and May of 1996. He requested her assistance. . . . She refused to do that. You have to take that information . . . and consider it carefully ... in thinking about what you believe [the defendant] meant and <em>intended when he sent the letters on November 25, [1996] and the letters that were received January 6, 1997. . . .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\u201cNow . . . you also heard several other [tape-recorded conversations]. . . . Pay close attention to these conversations. . . .

I believe that that evidence is very powerful, very credible. <em>It gives you a very good insight into exactly what [the defendant\u2019s state of mind] was when he was drafting and communicating with [the victim] in November of [1996] and January of [1997].\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The prosecutor made the following remarks regarding the defendant\u2019s communications during her rebuttal closing argument: \u201c[Defense counsel] indicated to you and brought your attention to . . . the birthday card. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Make sure you read [that card] carefully. . . .

A person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he communicates with a person by mail. For you to find [the defendant] guilty of this charge, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to harass, annoy, or alarm . . . [the victim] by communication by mail. For purposes of the statute, \u2018harass\u2019 means to trouble, worry, torment, and \u2018annoy\u2019 means to irritate, vex, bother as by a repeated action, and \u2018alarm\u2019 means to make suddenly afraid or anxious, frightened. The test is whether the alleged communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to a person of common intelligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The trial court also instructed the jury on \u00a7 53a-49, the statute defining criminal attempt. See footnote 2 of this opinion. The defendant does not take issue with the trial court\u2019s instruction on \u00a7 53a-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> In so concluding, we do not mean to suggest that it would have been improper for the trial court to have instructed the jury <em>expressly </em>that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) (2) prohibits conduct rather than speech. Indeed, such an instruction might have been useful to emphasize that fact. We hold, rather, that the trial court\u2019s failure to give such an instruction, sua sponte, did not violate the defendant\u2019s first amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> For example, shortly after the sexual assault, the defendant telephoned the victim from prison and told her that he did not plan to plead guilty to the sexual assault charges and that he would be very angry when he was released from prison. The victim also received several additional telephone calls from the defendant in the ensuing weeks and, as a result, had her telephone number changed. After the victim changed her number, the defendant called her at her place of employment. The victim refused to provide him with her new number and reported this telephone call to State Trooper Lewis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> The victim stated that she was \u201cupset,\u201d \u201clivid\u201d and \u201cfurious\u201d when she received letters from the defendant on January 6, 1997, even though she did not read them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
