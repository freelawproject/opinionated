The panel found the defendant guilty of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>denied him his constitutional right to counsel in granting defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. The defendant also challenges the order of the trial court, <em>Barry, J., </em>vacating its previous order, which had granted the defendant\u2019s pro se motion to be transferred to another correctional facility in order to gain access to a law library. The defendant claims that this action resulted in the failure of the state to fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide pro se criminal defendants with access to the courts. We reject both claims. We conclude that: (1) although it was improper for the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>to have failed to follow strictly the letter of Practice Book (1978-1997) \u00a7 632,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the defendant was not denied his constitutional right to counsel when Judge Espinosa granted defense counsel\u2019s oral motion to withdraw; and (2) the defendant was not constitutionally entitled to access to a law library in order to have meaningful access to the courts. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The record reveals the following pertinent facts and procedural history. The defendant was arrested on September 14, 1995, and charged with felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a), first degree burglary in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and first degree arson in violation of \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (1). In addition, the defendant was charged with tampering with physical evidence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155 (a) (l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant received the assistance of the office of the public defender from the time that he first appeared before the court on September 15,1995, until a privately retained counsel, Attorney William T. Gerace, filed an appearance on the defendant\u2019s behalf on December 19, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">On May 15, 1996, Gerace made an oral motion to withdraw from the case before Espinosa, J., and inaccu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>rately indicated to the court that he had filed a corresponding written motion. Gerace characterized the motion as \u201cmutually agreed upon\u201d and further stated that the state\u2019s attorney did not object to it. He also stated that the motion was \u201cvery oblique\u201d because it involved \u201ca sensitive matter that [he did] not want to make a public record in fear of prejudicing [the defendant\u2019s] case.\u201d Gerace indicated that he had been paid \u201ca substantial retainer\u201d that he wished to return, presumably to the defendant\u2019s brother who, Gerace stated, was present in the courtroom, so that the defendant could retain new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">After the state\u2019s attorney indicated that he had no objection to Gerace\u2019s motion to withdraw, Judge Espinosa stated: \u201cThe matter was discussed with the court. The court believes that it is appropriate that Mr. Gerace withdraw from the case.\u201d Consequently, Judge Espinosa granted Gerace\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Judge Espinosa told the defendant that he would be given time to retain a new attorney, but that the time would not count for speedy trial purposes. The defendant then asked: \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d In response, the trial court further explained the speedy trial implications. After Gerace indicated that the defendant could retain new counsel within two weeks, Judge Espinosa again explained her point: \u201cBut that two weeks then is not going to be counted. Do you understand that . . . ?\u201d The defendant replied: \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Evidently, the defendant did not retain new counsel during the period between May 15 and May 29, 1996. Although the record is unclear at this point, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>that the defendant had asked the court if he could proceed pro se because, on May 30, 1996, Judge Espinosa indicated that she had \u201cnot decided whether . . . [the defendant was going to] be allowed to represent [himself] . . . .\u201d Judge Espinosa then appointed a public defender who would serve as standby counsel<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the event that the defendant was allowed to proceed pro se or who would serve as lead counsel in the event that the defendant was not permitted to proceed pro se. Judge Espinosa then stated that, in the meantime, the public defender could talk to the defendant about the defendant\u2019s decision to proceed pro se. Judge Espinosa also tried to impress upon the defendant the seriousness of his situation and the foolhardiness of proceeding pro se: \u201cYou are not a lawyer and you are going to be going against an experienced lawyer on the other side that wants to convict you and send you to jail for sixty years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">On June 24,1996, the matter of the defendant\u2019s representation still was not finalized. Michael Isko, a public defender, filed an appearance as standby counsel for the defendant, and Judge Espinosa granted another continuance in light of the defendant\u2019s request for more time to retain private counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">On July 10, 1996, however, the defendant appeared in court with Isko and stated that he wanted to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>himself. At that time, the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel before the trial court, <em>Norko, J.5 ***</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Isko remained as standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Throughout the following months, the defendant filed various pro se motions, including a motion for access to a law library on September 18, 1996, which Judge Barry granted on October 2, 1996, \u201csubject to availability of accommodations within the department] of [correction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On October 30,1996, the office of the attorney general appeared on behalf of the commissioner of correction and moved to vacate Judge Barry\u2019s October 2 order granting the defendant access to a law library. Arguments on that motion were heard on October 30. John J. Armstrong, the commissioner of correction, testified that the defendant was then housed at the Walker Reception/Special Management Unit, a high security facility for offenders posing a relatively high risk to public safety and to department of correction personnel. Armstrong further testified that access to the courts was provided to inmates through the office of the public defender and that no correctional facility in Connecticut contained a law library. Armstrong stated that perhaps the largest collection of law books could be found at a facility formerly known as the \u201cstate prison at Somers,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>now the Osborn Correctional Institution, which, in 1996, was being used as a \u201cmedium security facility.\u201d Armstrong expressed concern over transferring an inmate, such as the defendant, who was facing charges of the most serious nature, to a medium security facility: \u201cIt presents an undue risk to public safety in the event of a potential escape [and] an undue risk to staff.\u201d Armstrong indicated that such a transfer \u201cwould just not be sound correctional practice.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Before indicating how he would decide the motion to vacate, Judge Barry again stressed to the defendant the seriousness of his decision to represent himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re unable to retain your own attorney, I presume, a private attorney? Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I do not want to retain. I can afford it, but I do not want to retain him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cThe Court: And you don\u2019t want the services of a public defender ... on a full-time basis?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The defendant indicated that he did not want a public defender, and that he did not wish to receive advice from standby counsel. Judge Barry then inquired of the defendant: \u201cIt may be that your only chance is by retaining an attorney or by having access to the courts through the public defender\u2019s office .... Do you understand?\u201d The defendant replied: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">On November 25 and December 5, 1996, the defendant was brought to court to review the state\u2019s file. At this point, the record is unclear again. Evidently, the defendant\u2019s pro se status had changed because Isko was appointed as the defendant\u2019s public defender on January 8,1997 and filed an appearance \u201cin lieu\u201d of the defendant on January 15, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>On February 4, 1997, the defendant filed another motion to return to pro se status, which was granted by Judge Espinosa on February 5,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Isko again was appointed standby counsel. Jury selection began on February 10, before Judge Norko. After several of his pro se motions had been denied, the defendant, on February 14, before Judge Norko, requested to change his pro se status, and Isko agreed to file an appearance as full counsel. On February 27, Judge Barry granted the commissioner\u2019s motion to vacate the previous order granting the defendant access to a law library.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On March 7, 1997, Isko asked for a continuance, claiming that he lacked sufficient time to prepare for trial in light of his relatively recent change in status to full counsel and the somewhat technical nature of the evidence. To accommodate Isko, Judge Norko ordered the office of the public defender to provide Isko with cocounsel and continued the case until March 14, 1997. On March 14, however, Judge Norko declared a mistrial, relying on the fact that the state\u2019s attorney could be called as a witness because of various communications with the defendant while the defendant was proceeding pro se.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>On April 23,1998, the defendant expressed his desire to proceed pro se again, as well as his desire to be tried by a three judge panel rather than a jury. The defendant then was canvassed by the trial court, Clifford, <em>J., </em>regarding his decision to proceed pro se, the appointment of standby counsel, and his election to be tried by a three judge panel. At this time, the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel and his right to a jury trial. Isko again was assigned to be standby counsel. On May 18, 1998, the defendant\u2019s case was tried before a three judge panel, <em>Devlin, Fasano </em>and <em>Maloney, Js. </em>Isko served as standby counsel during that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On May 29,1998, the panel found the defendant guilty of arson in the first degree and murder. See footnotes 1 and 2 of this opinion and accompanying text. The panel found the defendant not guilty of felony murder, burglary in the first degree and tampering with physical evidence. The defendant was sentenced to a total effective term of fifty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">WITHDRAWAL OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>abused its discretion in granting Gerace\u2019s motion to withdraw. The defendant further claims that the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>failed to comply with Practice Book (1978-1997) \u00a7 632 by: (1) allowing Gerace to withdraw notwithstanding the fact that he had not filed a written motion requesting permission to withdraw; and (2) failing to assert with any degree of specificity good cause in support of its decision to grant Gerace\u2019s oral motion to withdraw. The defendant argues that, as a result of the court\u2019s alleged failure to comply with Practice Book (1978-1997) \u00a7 632, he was deprived of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>his right to counsel under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and under the sixth<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution. Consequently, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction should be reversed. The state argues that any violation of the rules of practice led only to harmless error and that the defendant was not deprived of his right to counsel. We conclude that: (1) the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>did not abuse its discretion in granting Gerace\u2019s motion to withdraw; and (2) although the trial court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>violated Practice Book (1978-1997) \u00a7 632 in failing to require Gerace to file a written motion to withdraw, the defendant suffered no harm from that Practice Book violation, and, consequently, the defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Decisions regarding the withdrawal of counsel are evaluated under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>24 Conn. App. 13, 22-23, 585 A.2d 1235, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 901, 588 A.2d 1076 (1991); cf. <em>State v. Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 610, 504 A.2d 497 (1986) (\u201cIt is the province of the trial court to determine whether there is a factual basis for disqualification of counsel. In such a determination, the trial court is entitled to consider whether the defendant\u2019s effort to displace existing counsel has substantive merit and is being pursued in good faith.\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Casado, </em>42 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>App. 371, 379, 680 A.2d 981, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 920, 682 A.2d 1006 (1996) (\u201cThe trial court is bestowed with broad discretion in determining whether the circumstances warrant the appointment of new counsel. . . . [A]bsent a factual record revealing an abuse of that discretion, the court\u2019s failure to allow new counsel is not reversible error.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]). The defendant suggests, however, that \u201ca de novo standard of review might be appropriate\u201d in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We nevertheless conclude in light of the highly fact-based nature of the trial court\u2019s decision on Gerace\u2019s oral motion to withdraw, that we will not depart from our precedent and that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard of review. \u201cThe trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his [or her] function is to assure a fair and just outcome.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 312, 294 A.2d 312 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The defendant failed to preserve his right to counsel claim in the trial court. He, therefore, seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), under which \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> not preserved at trial only if <em>all of </em>the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40; see also <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 21-22, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967) (refusing to adopt rule providing that \u201cconstitutional errors . . . must always be deemed harmful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The record in this case does not support a finding that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant Gerace\u2019s oral motion to withdraw deprived the defendant of his right \u201cto have the assistance of counsel for his defense\u201d; U.S. Const., amend. VI; under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. The only period of time during the course of the proceedings when the defendant did not have the assistance of counsel, whether standby or otherwise, was during the two week period immediately following Gerace\u2019s withdrawal, by the end of which the defendant was expected to have retained new counsel. Furthermore, this two week period occurred approximately two years before the defendant\u2019s trial. At each step in the process, the court provided the defendant with counsel or accommodated the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se and appointed standby counsel to assist the defendant if the need arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The defendant argues, however, that he was denied his counsel of choice, namely, Gerace. When Judge Espinosa permitted Gerace to withdraw, however, the defendant voiced no objection. He only asked Judge Espinosa to clarify her warning about the effect on the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial arising from the two week delay in the proceedings during which the defendant would attempt to retain new counsel. In light of the fact that the defendant filed approximately forty motions while he was representing himself, it is fair to conclude that the defendant had no difficulty asserting himself before the court, and would have done so had he objected to Gerace\u2019s withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Furthermore, at the hearing to consider the motion to withdraw, Gerace indicated that the defendant\u2019s brother was in the courtroom to accept the return of the retainer.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This fact leads us to two important conclusions. First, because the defendant\u2019s brother was present to accept the unearned portion of the retainer, it seems improbable that the defendant was unaware of Gerace\u2019s intention to withdraw. Second, the returned retainer could have been used to secure replacement counsel, had the defendant so desired, during the allotted two week period.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This time period served as a reasonable opportunity to retain new counsel, which is all that the sixth amendment demands in this context. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 432-33 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1030, 119 S. Ct. 569, 142 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1998). The record does not establish either that Gerace remained the defendant\u2019s counsel of choice or that the defendant did not want Gerace to withdraw. Because the defendant did not object to Gerace\u2019s withdrawal, Judge Espinosa did not inquire further. \u201cBy failing to raise the issue [at the trial court level], where a factual basis could have then been developed, [the] defendant rendered it impossible for us to deal meaningfully with his eleventh hour contention that he was wrongfully deprived of the counsel of his choice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>941 F.2d 36, 45 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Although the defendant cannot point to any time during the proceedings when he indicated that he preferred Gerace over any other attorney, he suggests it now. Even if it is assumed that the defendant\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>object to Gerace\u2019s withdrawal could be interpreted as ignorance of what was happening when Gerace withdrew, rather than acquiescence, the right to counsel of one\u2019s choice is not without limitation. See, e.g., <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988) (\u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right to choose one\u2019s own counsel is circumscribed in several important respects\u201d). We never have held that the right to counsel necessarily encompasses the right to a specific attorney. Thus, even if there were some evidence in the record to establish that Gerace was the defendant\u2019s counsel of choice, that interest would have to be balanced \u201cagainst the need to preserve the highest ethical standards of professional responsibility.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>672 F.2d 1064, 1070 (2d Cir. 1982); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>920 F.2d 619, 626 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 920, 111 S. Ct. 2022, 114 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1991) (\u201c[c]ourts . . . must balance a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to retain counsel of his [or her] choice against the need to maintain the highest standards of professional responsibility\u201d). Ger-ace withdrew from representation in May of 1996. The defendant voiced no objection to Gerace\u2019s withdrawal, and the defendant\u2019s trial did not commence for another two years. Consequently, we find that Gerace\u2019s withdrawal did not materially and adversely affect the defendant\u2019s interests. Furthermore, in light of Judge Espinosa\u2019s articulation, in which she stated that, while she had no specific recollection of Gerace\u2019s withdrawal, she did remember that the reason behind Gerace\u2019s withdrawal \u201cwas of an incriminating nature that would have prevented [Gerace] from effectively representing the defendant in the future and might have placed him in jeopardy of violating . . . [professional] [e]thics,\u201d we conclude that Gerace\u2019s withdrawal was \u201cneed[ed] to preserve the highest ethical standards of professional responsibility.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>supra, 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Without some indication that the trial court \u201cunreasonably or arbitrarily interfered with [the] defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice, [the court] believe [s] [that] reversal is appropriate only when [the] defendant identifies specific prejudice resulting from [the] denial of preferred counsel, <em>and </em>when such prejudice renders the trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Salgado, </em>964 F.2d 993, 1016 (10th Cir. 1992). Not only did the trial court not unreasonably interfere with the defendant\u2019s right to counsel by allowing Gerace to withdraw to avoid potentially violating standards of professional conduct, but the record, as previously described in great detail, reflects that the trial court consistently tried to accommodate the defendant and to educate him about the potential implications of his decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In addition to his claim under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, the defendant argues that he was deprived of his right to counsel under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. However, in light of the textual similarities between the federal and Connecticut constitutional provisions<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the fact that the defendant offers no convincing reason for a broader reading of article first, \u00a7 8, in this context, we will not depart from precedent and will view both provisions as essentially coextensive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Piorkowski, </em>243 Conn. 205, 215, 700 A.2d 1146 (1997) (finding that article first, \u00a7 8, of Connecticut constitution and sixth amendment to federal constitution are textually similar with respect to right to counsel); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 165, 537 A.2d 446 (1988) (\u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court has turned to the historical experience of Connecticut in expanding the right to counsel under the federal constitution\u201d). Thus, on the basis of our sixth amendment analysis above, the defendant was not deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>of the right to counsel under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court, Espinosa, J., did not abuse its discretion in granting Gerace\u2019s motion to withdraw. We further conclude that, with respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of his right to counsel, he cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>because he has failed to establish a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">LAW LIBRARY ACCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The defendant next claims that his lack of access to a law library effectively denied him the right to represent himself under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The state argues that both the relevant federal and state constitutional provisions were satisfied by virtue of the appointment of standby counsel to assist the defendant in the preparation of his defense. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">In <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S. Ct. 1491, 52 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1977), the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201cthe fundamental [federal] constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries <em>or </em>adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id., 828. The court further concluded that the provision of adequate law libraries is just one of the many methods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>satisfying a defendant\u2019s right of meaningful access to the courts. Id., 830. The court encouraged local experimentation with alternatives and also offered a list of possible methods for providing a defendant with meaningful access to the courts, including the use of paraprofessionals, law students, volunteer attorneys, part-time attorney consultants, full-time staff attorneys and inmates trained as paralegal assistants who would work under the supervision of an attorney. Id., 831-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Rather than offering a specific remedy, <em>Bounds </em>recognizes the criminal defendant\u2019s right of access to the courts. See, e.g., <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996); <em>Nordgren </em>v. <em>Milliken, </em>762 F.2d 851, 854 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1032, 106 S. Ct. 593, 88 L. Ed. 2d 573 (1985); <em>Spates </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>644 F.2d 80, 84-85 (2d Cir. 1981); see also <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>238 Conn. 692, 736, 680 A.2d 262 (1996) (\u201creasonable restrictions on inmate telephone calls to attorneys are constitutional, so long as other viable means are available to the inmates to pursue their legal claims\u201d). The right to self-representation in criminal proceedings \u201cdoes not carry with it a right to state-financed library resources where state-financed legal assistance is available [to satisfy the dictates of <em>Bounds].\u201d Spates </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 85 (finding \u201cno adequate basis ... for a conclusion that the programs available to inmates at [a prison in] Somers [Connecticut] do not provide the kind of support and assistance necessary to enable those who wish to act pro se to do so, whether by formal appointment of a standby attorney ... or otherwise\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>39 Conn. App. 674, 681, 667 A.2d 304 (1995) (\u201c[practices or regulations are invalid under <em>Bounds </em>only if the prisoner is denied access to both legal assistance <em>and </em>legal materials\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>As Armstrong testified at the hearing before Judge Barry on the motion to vacate, no law library exists in any correctional institution in the state. The \u201cstate prison at Somers\u201d evidently had more law books than the other state correctional facilities; however, Armstrong highlighted his concerns about the potential safety risks to both the public and department of correction personnel arising from the transfer of an inmate from a high security facility to a medium security facility in order to allow him or her access to those books. See <em>United States ex rel. George </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>718 F.2d 226, 232 (7th Cir. 1983) (\u201crequiring prison officials to accompany inmates to legal research facilities outside of the jail would give rise to a multitude of security problems and to manpower deficiencies . . . [and] [e]ven express constitutional guarantees are subject to reasonable limitation or retraction in light of the legitimate security concerns of penal institutions\u201d). In light of the types of concerns articulated by Armstrong, the state proposed an alternative, namely, the use of the public defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In the present case, the provision of standby counsel afforded the defendant an adequate link to legal information. A public defender served either as standby counsel or as full counsel for the defendant at all times following the two week period after Gerace\u2019s withdrawal, the period of time that the court had given to the defendant as an opportunity to retain new counsel. The defendant failed to retain new counsel during that period, and the court provided him with the services of a public defender. That public defender would serve as full counsel when the defendant so desired and as standby counsel when the defendant wished to proceed pro se. Isleo was appointed as standby counsel so that he could answer the defendant\u2019s questions about the law and offer the defendant advice if he so requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Notwithstanding Isko\u2019s assistance, the defendant also asserts a right to a law library for his own use. The state, however, adhered to the dictates of <em>Bounds </em>by offering the defendant \u201cadequate assistance from [a person] trained in the law [in this case, Isko].\u201d <em>Bounds </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 430 U.S. 828; see <em>Carper </em>v. <em>DeLand, </em>54 F.3d 613, 616 (10th Cir. 1995) (\u201cA state may elect to provide legal assistance to inmates in lieu of maintaining an adequate prison law library .... Legal assistance, however, does not necessarily entail assistance from a lawyer.\u201d [Citation omitted.]); <em>United States ex rel. George </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>supra, 718 F.2d 231 (\u201cthe offer of court-appointed counsel to represent a defendant satisfies the constitutional obligation of a state to provide a defendant with legal assistance under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d); see also <em>Strickler </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>989 F.2d 1375, 1385 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 949, 114 S. Ct. 393, 126 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1993) <em>(\u201cBounds </em>did not hold that there is a right of access to a law library; it held that there is a right of access to the <em>courts\u2019'' </em>[emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">It is not within the province of the judiciary to micromanage prisons. See, e.g., <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 734; see also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 518 U.S. 349. In this regard, the courts evaluate the claims asserted by inmates; the other political branches implement the solutions. \u201cIt is for the courts to remedy past or imminent official interference with individual inmates\u2019 presentation of claims to the courts; it is for the political branches of the State and Federal Governments to manage prisons in such fashion that official interference with the presentation of claims will not occur.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 349. In the present case, however, the defendant has failed to demonstrate how \u201cthe alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d Id., 351. On the contrary, the defendant does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>not claim that he would have proceeded differently or pursued an alternative defense strategy had he been afforded access to a law library. Thus, the defendant is not contending that he was harmed by the denial of access to a law library, but, rather, that the denial of access to a law library was, itself, the harm suffered. In light of the alternative available to the defendant, namely, Isko\u2019s assistance, we conclude that there was no constitutional violation by virtue of the denial of access to a law library. It is not our role\u2014nor is it the role of the defendant\u2014to suggest which mode of access is best. Rather, we must determine whether the particular mode of access available to the defendant in this case deprived the defendant of his constitutional rights. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We recently stated in <em>State </em>v. Shashaty, 251 Conn. 768, 742 A.2d 786 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1094, 120 S. Ct. 1734, 146 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2000), that \u201cwe generally have interpreted the state and federal constitutions as providing essentially equivalent protections with respect to a defendant\u2019s right to self-representation.\u201d Id., 780. Our conclusion in the present case that there was no denial of access to the courts and no denial of the right to self-representation under the United States constitution eliminates the need for us to evaluate the defendant\u2019s claim on state constitutional grounds. As in previous cases, we conclude that standby counsel selves as a legal resource to pro se defendants, thereby enabling them to have meaningful access to the courts while still exercising their right to represent themselves. See id. (\u201cthe trial court\u2019s use of standby counsel to ensure that the defendant had access to legal materials did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation under the state constitution\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 854-55, 661 A.2d 539 (1995) (\u201cstandby counsel can serve a more active role and exercise a larger degree of independent initiative with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>out infringing the right to self-representation ... [as long as] the pro se defendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case he [or she] chooses to present to the jury . . . [and as long as] participation by standby counsel without the defendant\u2019s consent [is] not . . . allowed to destroy the jury\u2019s perception that the defendant is representing himself\u2019 [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In sum, we clarify our holding on this issue in the form of a bright line rule: A criminal defendant who knowingly and intelligently waives the right to counsel and who has been appointed standby counsel is not constitutionally entitled to access to a law library. Rather, the appointment of standby counsel satisfies the state\u2019s obligation to provide the defendant with access to the courts. We also clarify that the role of standby counsel is essentially to be present with the defendant in court and to supply the limited assistance provided for in Practice Book \u00a7 44-5,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the provision governing the function of standby counsel. We further clarify that standby counsel does not, however, have any obligation to perform legal research for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of arson in the first degree when, with intent to destroy or damage a building ... he starts a fire or causes an explosion, and (1) the building is inhabited or occupied or the person has reason to believe the building may be inhabited or occupied . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\"> Practice Book (1978-1997) \u00a7 632 provides: \u201cA motion for withdrawal of appearance shall be served on the prosecuting authority and other attorneys of record, and filed with the cleric in the same manner as entering an appearance.
