The trial court, <em>Hon. Norris L. O\u2019Neill, </em>judge trial referee, denied the defendants\u2019 motion. Thereafter, the trial court, <em>Hon. Robert J. Hale, </em>judge trial referee, granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the restart of unit 2, pending a ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary and permanent injunction. Judge Hale ultimately rendered judgment for the defendants and dissolved the temporary restraining order. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We now vacate the judgment and remand the case to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. The Millstone Nuclear Power Generating Station (Millstone) consists of three nuclear power units. Each unit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>equipped with a \u201conce-through condenser cooling system\u201d that draws large volumes of seawater from Niantic Bay into the units through an intake structure. The water is used to cool the units and is later discharged into Long Island Sound. When the present action was brought on March 11, 1999, units 1 and 2 had been shut down due to safety violations unrelated to the once-through cooling system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The defendants hold a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, authorizing the use of the once-through condenser cooler water system for Millstone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In accordance with the provisions of the federal Clean Water Act; see footnote 4 of this opinion; that certain requirements must be satisfied before a permit may be issued or renewed, the defendants\u2019 permit contains the express findings made by the department that: (1) the use of a once-through condenser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cooling system adequately ensures the projection and propagation of a balanced indigenous population of marine organisms and wildlife; and (2) the cooling water intake structure at Millstone represents the best available technology for minimizing environmental impacts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The defendants\u2019 permit was issued by the department on December 14,1992, and was due to expire on December 13,1997.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants submitted a timely permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>renewal application with the department on June 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>1997. That application is still pending. The 1992 permit, however, will remain in effect until the renewal application has been finally resolved by the department. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (b).* ****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, Fish Unlimited has intervened in the proceeding before the department and has requested a hearing on the defendants\u2019 application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Although Fish Unlimited intervened in the defendants\u2019 permit renewal proceeding before the department, the plaintiffs brought this action<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> alleging that the once-through condenser cooler water system in place at unit 2 causes \u201cunreasonable pollution, impairment and destruction of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state within the meaning of . . . General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs maintained that the system contributes significantly to the virtual demise of the winter flounder population in the Niantic River, and to the serious depletion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>of other aquatic species that are entrained and impinged at the unit 2 intake structure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They also contended that the cooling waters, which are discharged into Long Island Sound as heated effluent, contain toxic contaminants and radioactive waste products that further harm the environment. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that \u201c[a] feasible and prudent alternative to the once-through condenser cooling system is available consistent with the reasonable requirements of public health, safety and welfare within the meaning of . . . General Statutes \u00a7 22a-17.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the restart of unit 2 and to require conversion of the once-through cooling system to a closed cooling system, which they claimed would reduce substantially the occurrence of larval entrainment. The plaintiffs also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>sought an injunction requiring the defendants to install a fish return system, which they claimed would reduce mortality of marine organisms subject to impingement.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">On March 22, 1999, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, asserting that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before the department, and that the department had primary jurisdiction over the issues raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. That motion was denied by Judge O\u2019Neill on the ground that resort to the available administrative remedies would be futile and inadequate in light of the alleged harms created by the once-through condenser cooler water system because of the imminence of the peak spawning season for winter flounder. The court made no ruling in regard to future motions to dismiss that the defendants might submit after the period of peak spawning season had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Thereafter, a trial commenced before Judge Hale on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary injunction. On April 20, 1999, the plaintiffs filed an application for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the restart of unit 2 until after the trial court had ruled on the application for a temporary injunction. Judge Hale granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary restraining order, pending completion and presentation of all the evidence. After thirteen days of testimony, Judge Hale denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application for temporary and permanent injunctive relief, and dissolved the temporary restraining order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that Judge Hale improperly concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled: (1) to present rebuttal testimony; (2) to present summations and closing argument; and (3) to temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>and permanent injunctive relief. The defendants dispute the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and assert, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before the department, and because the department has primary jurisdiction over the issues raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. We agree with the defendants\u2019 alternative argument, namely, that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and, therefore, we vacate the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The defendants contend that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims should have been dismissed by the trial court on jurisdictional grounds because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Specifically, the defendants maintain that the remedies sought by the plaintiffs were available through the permit renewal proceeding pending before the department.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, however, assert that under the circumstances of this case, they were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies because recourse to the administrative remedies would have been futile and inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u201cIt is a settled principle of administrative law that if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>diction to act in the matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>222 Conn. 414, 420, 610, A.2d 637 (1992); <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 622, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990); <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins.

As the United States Supreme Court has stated, [a] complaining party may be successful in vindicating his rights in the administrative process. If he is required to pursue his administrative remedies, the courts may never have to intervene. <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 395 U.S. 185, 195, 89 S. Ct. 1657, 23 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1969).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>supra, 420-21; <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351-52, 542 A.2d 672 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u201cThe [exhaustion] doctrine is applied in a number of different situations and is, like most judicial doctrines, subject to numerous exceptions.\u201d <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 395 U.S. 193; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>48 Conn. App. 102, 112, 710 A.2d 176 (1998). \u201c[W]e have recognized such exceptions only infrequently and only for narrowly defined purposes\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>227 Conn. 545, 561, 630 A.2d 1304 (1993); <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 353; such as when recourse to the administrative remedy would be futile or inadequate. In light of the policy behind the exhaustion doctrine, these exceptions are narrowly construed. See, <em>e.g., Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>234 Conn. 498, 507, 661 A.2d 1018 (1995) (plaintiffs\u2019 mere suspicion of bias on part of defendant, without more, not sufficient to excuse them, on ground of futility, from exhaustion requirement); <em>O &amp; G Industries Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 429, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995) (actual bias, rather than mere potential bias, of administrative body renders resort to administrative remedies futile); <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>supra, 561 (mere conclusory assertion that agency will not reconsider decision does not excuse compliance, on basis of futility, with exhaustion requirement); <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 430 (fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>that commissioner previously indicated how he would decide plaintiffs claim did not excuse compliance, on ground of futility, with exhaustion requirement); <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterlings. </em>Sterling, supra, 204 Conn. 557-60 (futility is more than mere allegation that administrative agency might not grant relief requested).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The plaintiffs recognize the exhaustion doctrine, but assert that they are excused from compliance because the injunctive relief they seek was not available through the administrative process. Specifically, they contend that the permit renewal proceeding was inadequate because: (1) it would not redress the environmental problems associated with the use of a once-through cooling system; and (2) it is unlikely that the department will conduct a hearing on the matter in the foreseeable future, thus causing further harm to the winter flounder population and the waters of Long Island Sound. Although we agree that a party is not required to exhaust an administrative remedy when that remedy necessarily will be futile, we disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of their administrative remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">An administrative remedy is futile or inadequate if the agency is without authority to grant the relief requested. <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 625. The department in this case, however, had the authority to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief during the permit renewal proceeding in which Fish Unlimited had intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">First, pursuant to \u00a7 22a-430 (a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> before renewing the defendants\u2019 permit, the department must review all of its prior determinations that the defendants\u2019 cooling system is consistent with the provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, which requires that the cooling water intake structure represent \u201cthe best available technology for minimizing environmental impacts.\u201d See 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (b).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the department will evaluate the environmental problems associated with the use of a once-through cooling water system. The department also will determine whether these problems warrant the conversion of unit 2 to a closed cooling water system and whether the installation of a fish return system is needed. Adjudication of the claims raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint requires the trial court to make the same determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Second, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-7<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provides the department with broad authority to issue cease and desist orders, with which it effectively could enjoin the defendants from restarting unit 2. Third, \u00a7 22a-430 (b)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>requires the department to provide public notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>its tentative determination regarding a permit renewal application and to provide for a period of public comment before a final determination is made on the application. Pursuant to that same section, the commissioner of environmental protection \u201cmay hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying any application if in his discretion the public interest will be served thereby, and he shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430 (b). Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-437 provides that any person aggrieved by a decision of the department to grant or deny a permit pursuant to \u00a7 22a-430, has the right, after a hearing, to appeal the final determination of the department to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs had the opportunity to raise the issues in their complaint before the department, and that the department had the authority to grant the relief that the plaintiffs requested from the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The plaintiffs also contend that the permit renewal proceeding is inadequate because it is unlikely that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>department will conduct a hearing on the matter in the foreseeable future, thus causing more harm to the winter flounder population and the waters of Long Island Sound. In support of this allegation, the plaintiffs note that although the defendants\u2019 permit expired two years ago, the department has not yet begun hearings addressing their renewal application. We repeatedly have held, however, that \u201c[d]irect adjudication even of constitutional claims is not warranted when the relief sought by a litigant might conceivably have been obtained through an alternative [statutory] procedure . . . which [the litigant] has chosen to ignore.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 563; <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 354. In the present case, the plaintiffs could have obtained relief through an alternative statutory procedure, namely, past permit renewals. Millstone has been the subject of department reviews, approvals, and permits for more than twenty-five years. The plaintiffs, however, have failed to intervene in any of these proceedings, many of which addressed the very issues that they claim justify the trial court\u2019s intervention. The plaintiffs cannot now benefit from this deliberate decision to wait until the eleventh hour, claim futility or inadequacy, and then request that the trial court step in and issue relief that is properly within the authority and expertise of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The plaintiffs, at oral argument before this court, acknowledged that they could have intervened in the defendants\u2019 earlier permit renewal proceedings before the department. They claim, however, that it would have been futile to pursue that option because the department would have denied the relief requested. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that, as a result of the \u201cclose coordination\u201d between the department and the defendants, the department is biased in favor of granting the defendants\u2019 permit renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Although a party is not required to exhaust an administrative remedy that is futile or inadequate, \u201cwe have never held that the mere possibility that an administrative agency may deny a party the specific relief requested is a ground for an exception to the exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Ster</em>ling, supra, 204 Conn. 559. Rather, we have held that, \u201c[i]t is futile to seek a remedy only when such action <em>could not </em>result in a favorable decision and <em>invariably </em>would result in further judicial proceedings.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 507. Here, the plaintiffs have failed to show, in effect, that the outcome of the defendants\u2019 permit renewal application has been predetermined by the department. Indeed, the plaintiffs have offered no evidence of bias. Their allegation is merely speculative. See <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 429 (when party\u2019s suspicion of bias on part of zoning commission is purely speculative, such suspicion does not render exhaustion of administrative remedies futile); <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 84-85, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986) (\u201cthe statutory remedies are not rendered futile by the plaintiffs conclusory assertion that requesting and attending a hearing before the defendant board would have been pointless in the face of the board\u2019s earlier decision to terminate his employment\u201d). \u201cWe presume that administrative board members acting in an adjudicative capacity are not biased.\u201d <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>supra, 508; <em>O&amp;G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 429. The plaintiffs\u2019 unsupported allegation that the department was predisposed to renew the defendants\u2019 permit is not enough to overcome that presumption. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 mere assertion of bias on the part of the department, without more, is not sufficient to excuse them, on the ground of futility, from exhausting available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 70, this court explained why unsupported allegations that an administrative agency is biased are insufficient to establish that exhaustion of administrative remedies would be futile or inadequate. The plaintiff in <em>LaCroix </em>was a tenured teacher who challenged, on due process and breach of contract grounds, the termination of his contract by the defendant board of education (board). Id., 71-72. A hearing was scheduled after the board voted to terminate him. Id., 73. The record does not indicate whether a hearing was held in the plaintiffs absence. Id., 73 n.4. Thereafter, the board notified the plaintiff that, following the board\u2019s last regular meeting, it had terminated his employment, and further advised him that he could request a hearing. Id., 73-74. The plaintiff did not request a hearing, however, contending that exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required because the remedy would have been inadequate or futile in light of the board\u2019s previous decision to terminate his employment. Id., 84-85. We rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, stating: \u201cHad the plaintiff requested and attended a hearing following the board\u2019s . . . letter, he would have been able to raise the issue of lack of impartiality in an administrative appeal. \u2018By not appearing before the board, the plaintiff not only deprived the defendant board of the opportunity to hear, analyze and review a matter within its responsibility and expertise, but also deprived [him]self of the opportunity to put on [his] case and to make a proper record on which to seek judicial relief in the event [he] was terminated.\u2019 <em>[Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 241-42, 502 A.2d 410 (1985).]\u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In the present case, by failing to exhaust their administrative remedies, the plaintiffs, like the plaintiff in <em>Lacroix, </em>deprived the department of the opportunity to review a matter within its responsibility and exper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tise. The plaintiffs also denied this court the benefit of the department\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning the environmental problems associated with the use of a once-through cooling system, an area that is clearly better addressed by the department. See <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 420 (\u201c \u2018[t]he doctrine of exhaustion is grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions\u2019 \u201d); <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 557 (same). In addition, the plaintiffs denied themselves the ability to make a record on which to seek judicial relief, in the event that the department renewed the defendants\u2019 permit. Finally, had the plaintiffs requested relief from the department, they would have been able to raise the claim of bias on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">We conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that their failure to do so was not excused by any exception to the exhaustion requirement. The trial court, therefore, did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs\u2019 application for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-5\"> The plaintiffs in this case are: Fish Unlimited, a national clean water fisheries conservation organization based in Shelter Island, New York, with a satellite office in Waterford, Connecticut; three environmental interest groups, namely, Don\u2019t Waste Connecticut, based in New Haven, Connecticut, STAR Foundation, based in East Hampton, New York, and North Fork Environmental Council, Inc., based in Mattituck, New York; and Fred Thiele, a New York State assemblyman, of Sag Harbor, New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\"> Northeast Utilities Service Company owns and operates three nuclear generating units that comprise the Millstone Nuclear Power Generating Station in Waterford, hereinafter referred to as unit 1, unit 2 and unit 3.

Such permits: (1) Shall specify the manner, nature and volume of discharge; (2) shall require proper operation and maintenance of any pollution abatement facility required by such permit; (3) may be renewable for periods not to exceed five years each in accordance with procedures and requirements established by the commissioner; and (4) shall be subject to such other requirements and restrictions as the commissioner deems necessary to comply fully with the purposes of this chapter, the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. An application for a renewal of a permit which expires after January 1, 1985, shall be filed with the commissioner at least one hundred eighty days before the expiration of such permit. The commissioner, at least thirty days before approving or denying an application for renewal of a permit, shall publish once in a newspaper having substantial circulation in the area affected, notice of (A) the name of the applicant; (B) the location, volume, frequency and nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>of the discharge; (C) the tentative decision on the application, and (D) such additional information the commissioner deems necessary to comply with the federal Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.). There shall be a comment period following the public notice during which period interested persons and municipalities may submit written comments. After the comment period, the commissioner shall make a final determination that (i) continuance of the existing discharge would not cause pollution of the waters of the state, in which case he shall renew the permit for such discharge, or (ii) continuance of the existing system to treat the discharge would protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall renew a permit for such discharge, (iii) the continuance of the existing system to treat the discharge, even with modifications, would not protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall promptly notify the applicant that its application is denied and the reasons therefor, or (iv) modification of the existing system or installation of a new system would protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall renew the permit for such discharge. Such renewed permit may include a schedule for the completion of the modification or installation to allow additional time for compliance with the final effluent limitations in the renewed permit provided (I) continuance of the activity producing the discharge is in the public interest; (II) the interim effluent limitations in the renewed permit are no less stringent than the effluent limitations in the previous permit; and (III) the schedule would not be inconsistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act. No permit shall be renewed unless the commissioner determines that the treatment system adequately protects the waters of the state from pollution. Any applicant, or in the case of a permit issued pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, any person or municipality, who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner where an application for a renewal has not been given a public hearing shall have the right to a hearing and an appeal therefrom in the same manner as provided in sections 22a-436 and 22a-437. Any applicant, or in the case of a permit issued pursuant to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, any person or municipality, who is aggrieved by a decision of the commissioner where an application for a renewal has been given a public hearing shall have the right to appeal as provided in section 22a-437. Any category, type or size of discharge that is exempt from the requirement of notice pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for the approval or denial of a permit shall be exempt from notice for approval or denial of a renewal of such permit. The commissioner may hold a public hearing prior to approving or denying an application for a renewal if in his discretion the public interest will be best served thereby, and he shall hold a hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least twenty-five persons.

Appointment of master or referee, (a) When the plaintiff in any such action has made a prima facie showing that the conduct of the defendant, acting alone, or in combination with others, has, or is reasonably likely unreasonably to pollute, impair or destroy the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state, the defendant may rebut the prima facie showing by the submission of evidence to the contrary. The defendant may also prove, by way of an affirmative defense, that, considering all relevant surrounding circumstances and factors, there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the defendant\u2019s conduct and that such conduct, is consistent with the reasonable requirements of the public health, safety and welfare. Except as to the aforesaid affirmative defense, nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the principles of burden of proof and weight of the evidence generally applicable in civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">\u201c(b) The court before which such action is brought may appoint a master or referee, who shall be a disinterested person and technically qualified, to take testimony and make a report to the court in the action.

The doctrine of primary jurisdiction, however, arises in cases in which a plaintiff, in the absence of a pending administrative proceeding, invokes the original jurisdiction of the court. <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>196 Conn. 253, 255-56, 492 A.2d 171 (1985). In this case, Fish Unlimited has intervened in the defendants\u2019 permit renewal proceeding before the department, and the remaining plaintiffs are free to do the same. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Therefore, because an administrative action is pending, the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> See footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-7 provides in relevant part: \u201cCease and desist orders.
