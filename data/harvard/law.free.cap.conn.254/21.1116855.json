We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The following facts are pertinent to this appeal. Millstone is made up of three nuclear power units. Each unit is equipped with a \u201conce-through condenser cooling system\u201d that draws large volumes of seawater from Niantic Bay into the units. This water is used to cool the units and is later discharged into Long Island Sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act; see footnote 4 of this opinion; no person or municipality may initiate a discharge into the waters of the United States without first obtaining a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The department issues these permits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>et seq. and has issued such permits in the past to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>defendants, thereby authorizing the discharge of water that is required for the operation of Millstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The defendants\u2019 most recent NPDES permit was issued by the department on December 14, 1992, for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>maximum term of five years.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The five year term was due to expire on December 13, 1997. Prior to that date, however, the defendants submitted a timely renewal application pursuant to \u00a7 22a-430 (c). That application is still pending. Accordingly, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendants\u2019 1992 permit will remain in effect until the renewal application has been finally resolved by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">On June 2, 1999, the plaintiffs brought the present action in the trial court, alleging that water intakes and discharges at Millstone were causing unreasonable pollution, impairment and destruction of the air, water and other natural resources of the state within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-16. They also alleged that, although the defendants had timely applied to renew their 1992 NPDES permit, their application was legally deficient. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that, in their renewal application, the defendants had represented that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>had \u201csought a permit to generate electricity\u201d at Millstone, but that Millstone was not in fact producing electricity at the time of the renewal application. Therefore, according to the plaintiffs, the defendants were not engaged in an activity of a \u201ccontinuing nature\u201d that, pursuant to \u00a7 4-182 (b), would, in effect, save the 1992 permit from otherwise expiring.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, the plaintiffs contended that the defendants had been discharging water from Millstone without a valid permit. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had acted in bad faith in their efforts to renew the permit. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants and the department together had acted in bad faith and in collusion, which caused the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state to be undermined, leaving the plaintiffs essentially with no adequate remedy at law. Consequently, according to the plaintiffs, they were \u201cforced\u201d to seek a temporary and permanent injunction against the operation of Millstone and a declaratory judgment that Millstone was operating without a valid NPDES permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that: (1) the plaintiffs lacked standing; (2) the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies; (3) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata; and (4) the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the prior pending action doctrine. The trial court, <em>Hon. Robert J. Hale, </em>judge trial referee, dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this action directly in the Superior Court under \u00a7 22a-16, and that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. In addition, the trial court noted that, if the plaintiffs had proven collusion between the defendants and the department, they might have established an exception to the exhaustion requirement. The trial court concluded, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that the plaintiffs had failed to prove collusion, and thus, were not entitled to the exception. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of dismissal. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this action directly in the Superior Court and, therefore, we affirm its judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The plaintiffs contend that they have standing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 to bring this action directly in the Superior Court. The defendants, however, claim that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a), this action must be brought by way of intervention in the permit renewal proceedings* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and, therefore, the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The issue of standing implicates this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>192 Conn. 591, 595, 473 A.2d 787 (1984). Traditionally, citizens seeking to protect the environment were required to show specific, personal aggrievement to attain standing to bring a legal action. See <em>Sheridan </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>159 Conn. 1, 13, 266 A.2d 396 (1969). The Connecticut Environmental Protection Act; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-l et seq.; however, waives the aggrievement requirement in two circumstances. First, any private patty, including a municipality, without first having to establish aggrievement, may seek injunctive relief in court \u201cfor the protection of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16. Second, any person or other entity, without first having to establish aggrievement, may intervene in any administrative proceeding challenging \u201cconduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Although \u00a7 22a-16 abrogates the aggrievement requirement for bringing an action directly in the Superior Court, our case law explains the limitations of \u00a7 22a-16, and elaborates why the plaintiffs must pursue their claim by intervening in an administrative hearing before the department pursuant to \u00a7 22a-19. In <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 595, the plaintiffs brought an action under \u00a7 22a-16 to enjoin a utility company and its parent company from burning certain oils containing hazardous materials without first obtaining permits from the department, including a wastewater discharge permit pursuant to \u00a7 22a-430, the same section under which the defendants in the present case have sought a renewal of their permit. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>court dismissed the action because the plaintiffs lacked standing <em>to </em>enforce the statutory environmental permitting scheme. We agreed. Id. Citing to <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 250, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984), wherein this court held that \u00a7 22a-19 \u201cmust be read in connection with the legislation which defines the authority of the particular administrative agency,\u201d the court in <em>Middletown </em>concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the defendants\u2019 failure to obtain the necessary permits pursuant to, inter alia, \u00a7 22a-430. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 597. Only in the absence of an appropriate administrative body may an independent action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 be brought. Id. Because the permitting statutes at issue, including \u00a7 22a-430, conferred extensive authority over permitting issues on the department, the court concluded that \u00a7 22a-16 did not provide the plaintiffs with standing to challenge the defendant\u2019s failure to obtain a permit under any statute other than the Environmental Protection Act itself. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In the present case, the plaintiffs seek to use \u00a7 22a-16 to afford standing to raise permitting claims governed by \u00a7 22a-430. The department, however, has statutory and regulatory authority to issue water discharge permits,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to determine the completeness of renewal applications<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>and to pursue any one of several remedies if it concludes that a discharge is creating unreasonable pollution<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>is occurring without a valid permit.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, in the present case, cannot use \u00a7 22a-16 as an \u201copen sesame\u201d to litigate environmental issues that are governed by \u00a7 22a-430, and which clearly have been placed within the exclusive domain of the department. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 597. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-13\"> The plaintiffs in this case are Fish Unlimited, a national clean water fisheries conservation organization based in Shelter Island, New York, with a satellite office in Waterford, Connecticut, the environmental groups, Don\u2019t Waste Connecticut based in New Haven, Connecticut, STAR Foundation, based in East Hampton, New York, and North Fork Environmental Council, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Inc., based in Mattituck, New York; Fred Thiele, a New York State assemblyman, of Sag Harbor, New York; Green Parly of Connecticut; town of East Hampton, Now York; and Coalition Against Millstone, an organization located on Long Island advocating the permanent, closure of the Millstone Nuclear Generating Station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16 provides: \u201cAction for declaratory and equitable relief against unreasonable pollution.

There shall be a comment period following the public notice during which period interested persons and municipalities may submit written comments. After the comment period, the commissioner shall make a final determination either that (A) such discharge would not cause pollution of any of the waters of the state, in which case he shall issue a permit for such discharge, or (B) after giving due regard to any proposed system to treat the discharge, that such discharge would cause pollution of any of the waters of the state, in which case he shall deny the application and notify the applicant of such denial and the reasons therefor, or (C) the proposed system to treat such discharge will protect the waters of the state from pollution, in which case he shall, except as provided pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, require the applicant to submit plans and specifications and such other information as he may require and shall impose such additional conditions as may be required to protect, such water, and if the commissioner finds that the proposed system to treat the discharge, as described by the plans and specifications or such other information as may be required by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (j) of this section, will protect the waters of the state from pollution, he shall notify the applicant of his approval and, when such applicant has installed such system, in full compliance with the approval thereof, the commissioner shall issue a permit for such discharge, or (D) the proposed system to treat such discharge, as described by the plans and specifications, will not protect the waters of the state, in which case he shall promptly notify the applicant that its application is denied and the reasons therefor. The commissioner shall, by regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, establish procedures, criteria and standards as appropriate for determining if (i) a discharge would cause pollution to the waters of the state and (ii) a treatment system is adequate to protect the waters of the state from pollution. Such procedures, criteria and standards may include schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, operating and maintenance procedures, management practices and other measures to prevent or reduce pollution of the waters of the state, provided the commissioner in adopting such procedures, criteria and standards shall consider best management practices.

An application for a renewal of a permit which expires after January 1, 1985, shall be filed with the commissioner at least one hundred eighty days before the expiration of such permit.

Such renewed permit may include a schedule for the completion of the modification or installation to allow additional time for compliance with the final effluent limitations in the renewed permit provided (I) continuance of the activity producing the discharge is in the public interest; (II) the interim effluent limitations in the renewed permit are no less stringent than the effluent limitations in the previous permit; and (III) the schedule would not be inconsistent with the federal Water Pollution Control Act. No permit shall be renewed unless the commissioner determines that the treatment system adequately protects the waters of the state from pollution.
