Valinski, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was convicted, after a trial in part to the court and in part to the jury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of one count each of driving under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug (driving under the influence) in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of the infraction of failure to drive on the right in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-230 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment only as to the defendant\u2019s conviction of driving under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) and remanded the case for a new trial on that count. <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, 53 </em>Conn. App. 23, 42, 731 A.2d 311 (1999). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal; <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>249 Conn. 924, 733 A.2d 847 (1999); and now conclude that the Appellate Court improperly had determined that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof with respect to the driving under suspension count. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the following relevant facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cThe parties stipulated that on December 15, 1994, the defendant was convicted of [driving] under the influence ... in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result of the conviction, the department of motor vehicles (department) suspended the defendant\u2019s operating priv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ileges on January 13, 1995.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On January 14, 1995, the department issued a work permit to the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cOn Saturday, May 13, 1995, State Trooper Kevin Albanese stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle on Route 44 in Canaan after twice observing it swerve in and out of the oncoming lane and nearly strike a guardrail post after it drifted over the white shoulder line. While waiting for the defendant\u2019s license and registration, Albanese asked the defendant where he had been. The defendant replied that he was returning from a fishing trip with his dog. After Albanese reviewed the work permit that the defendant handed him and noticed the restrictions on the permit, he again inquired of the defendant where he had been. This time, the defendant replied that he was returning from a fishing trip with several business associates, but, when asked, was unable to supply their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u201cAfter receiving the defendant\u2019s information, Albanese contacted Troop B in North Canaan and confirmed that the defendant\u2019s right to operate a motor vehicle was under suspension. Albanese detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the defendant\u2019s eyes were red and glassy. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>erratic driving, the strong odor of alcohol and the appearance of the defendant\u2019s eyes, Albanese believed that the defendant was operating while under the influence of alcohol. After administering three field sobriety tests, Albanese confirmed his belief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, Albanese arrested the defendant and transported him to Troop B, where the defendant refused to submit to any further testing.\u201d Id., 26-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The following procedural histoiy is relevant to this appeal. The defendant was charged in the first part of a two part information with two counts of driving under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215, one count of driving under the influence in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a), and with the infraction of failure to drive on the right in violation of \u00a7 14-230 (a). \u201cIn [the second] part ... of the information, the state alleged that the defendant was subject to an enhanced penalty based on a previous conviction for [driving] under the influence . . . .\u201d Id., 25. \u201cFollowing a jury trial, a verdict of guilty was returned on the three noninfraction counts: two counts of [driving] under suspension and one count of [driving] under the influence .... [With respect to] the [infraction] of failure to drive on the right, the court made a finding of guilty.\u201d Id., 28. The defendant subsequently entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere as to the second part of the information. Id., 25. Thereafter, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the verdict with respect to one of the two counts of driving under suspension. Id., 28. The trial court sentenced the defendant to one year imprisonment, execution suspended after serving the mandatory minimum of thirty days, and two years probation, for the remaining count of driving under suspension, and, for the count of driving under the influence, one year imprisonment, execution suspended after serving the mandatory minimum of ten days, consecutive to the remaining count of driving under suspension, and two years probation. Id., 28 n.9. The trial court imposed a $35 fine for the infraction of failure to drive on the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that, with respect to his conviction for driving under suspension,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c(1) as a matter of law, \u00a7 14-215 is inapplicable to the facts of this case [and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by charging him with a violation thereof], (2) the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to sustain a guilty verdict, (3) the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by misrepresenting to the jury that it would call a certain witness and (4) the trial court\u2019s unchallenged instructions were misleading and confusing.\u201d Id., 25; see also id., 28-29 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s first claim, namely, that he was exempt from prosecution under \u00a7 14-215 inasmuch as he possessed a work permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 14-37a. Id., 28-29. The Appellate Court also rejected the defendant\u2019s related claim that the prosecutor had engaged in misconduct by charging him with a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) because the prosecutor knew that the defendant had been issued a work permit. Id., 28 n.10, 30-31. The Appellate Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>not reach the defendant\u2019s second and third claims. See generally id., 31. The Appellate Court, however, reversed in part the trial court\u2019s judgment based on the defendant\u2019s fourth claim; the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury that the defendant was required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he was driving his vehicle within the scope of his work permit. Id., 38, 41-42. The Appellate Court held that, with respect to the driving under suspension count, the trial court\u2019s instructions unconstitutionally diluted the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., 38. Because the Appellate Court based its partial reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment on the trial court\u2019s improper instruction with respect to the defendant\u2019s burden of proving that he was driving within the scope of his work permit, the Appellate Court did not consider the defendant\u2019s claims that: (1) the trial court failed to instruct the jury properly regarding the effect of the defendant\u2019s stipulation that he previously had been convicted of a violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a); id., 36 n.18; and (2) the sequence of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions improperly had diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that, with respect to the judgment of conviction for [driving] under suspension, the trial court\u2019s instruction, placing the burden of persuasion on the defendant regarding whether he was operating under a work permit, impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We answer the certified issue in the negative and, accordingly, reverse the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment with respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction for driving under suspension. Therefore, we remand the case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the Appellate Court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims, which the Appellate Court did not reach in the defendant\u2019s initial appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The state claims that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions did not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proving any element of the offense of driving under suspension. The state supports this claim by arguing that driving within the scope of a valid work permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 14-37a is an affirmative defense to the offense of driving under suspension and, therefore, that it was proper for the trial court to instruct the jury that the defendant bore the burden of persuasion on this issue. The state further argues that the affirmative defense of driving within the scope of a valid work permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 14-37a is constitutional because it does not negate any of the elements of the offense of driving under suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The defendant counters that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions were improper because they unconstitutionally<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to live driving under suspension count. In support of this claim, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions improperly shifted the burden of persuasion to him on the issue of whether he had been driving his vehicle within the scope of a valid work permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 14-37a. The defendant argues that such a shift was improper because driving within the scope of a work permit is not an affirmative defense to the offense of driving under suspension. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following additional, relevant facts necessary to our disposition of this appeal. \u201cIn its charge, the trial court instructed the jury on the law governing the case and its application during deliberations. The court first instructed the jury regarding the state\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[the jury] on the specific charges against the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Following the instruction on the charge of [driving] under the influence . . . the court instructed the jury on direct and circumstantial evidence and that the cumulative effect of reliance on either type of evidence must be the conclusion that the elements were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Immediately thereafter, the court instructed the jury regarding the scope of the work permit and the defendant\u2019s burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was operating a motor vehicle within that scope.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cLater in the charge, the court repeated that \u2018the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating the motor vehicle\u2019 and \u2018it has been the obligation of the state to prove all of the elements charged against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 33-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing [a] challenged juiy instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the juiy in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established mies of law. ... As long as [the instmctions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instmctions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995). \u201c[I]n appeals involving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>247 Conn. 616, 625, 725 A.2d 306 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We begin by providing the relevant constitutional framework applicable to our determination of whether the jury instructions in this case were proper. \u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). \u201cIt is axiomatic that the state is required to prove all the essential elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt in order to obtain a conviction. . . . A jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and . . . afford [s] proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 410, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993). \u201cFurthermore, it is well established that [a]n instruction that dilutes the state\u2019s burden, or places a burden on the defendant to prove his innocence, is unconstitutional. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 512-13, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In contrast, \u201c[i]t is constitutionally permissible for the state to place the burden on a criminal defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence elements which would constitute an affirmative defense but which do not serve to negate any essential element of the crime which the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 210, 97 S. Ct. 2319, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>53 L. Ed. 2d 281 [1977].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 430, 435 A.2d 967 (1980). \u201cIf the State . . . chooses to recognize a factor that mitigates the degree of criminality or punishment . . . the State may assure itself that the fact has been established with reasonable certainty. To recognize at all a mitigating circumstance does not require the State to prove its nonexistence in each case in which the fact is put in issue, if in its judgment this would be too cumbersome, too expensive, and too inaccurate.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In this case, the trial court unequivocally instructed the jury that it was the defendant\u2019s burden to prove that he was driving his vehicle within the scope of the work permit when he was arrested. See footnote 15 of this opinion. Thus, we must determine whether the legislature intended the work permit exception of \u00a7 14-37a to be an affirmative defense to a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), and, if so, whether such a scheme is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We first consider whether the legislature intended \u00a7 14-37a to constitute an affirmative defense to a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c). This issue requires us to construe \u00a7\u00a7 14-215 (c) and 14-37a, and the relationship between the two provisions. \u201cStatutory construction . . . presents a question of law over which our review is plenary. . . . According to our long-standing principles of statutory construction, our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. . . . In determining the intent of a statute, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coelho </em>v. <em>ITT Hartford, </em>251 Conn. 106, 110, 752 A.2d 1063 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>We begin our analysis with the text of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-215 (c), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who operates any motor vehicle during the period his operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state is under suspension or revocation on account of a violation of subsection (a) of section 14-227a . . . shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars and imprisoned not more than one year, thirty consecutive days of which may not be suspended or reduced in any manner.\u201d Thus, the text of the statute unambiguously indicates that the state can establish a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c) by proving that the defendant operated a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension for a violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-37a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person whose operator\u2019s license has been suspended pursuant to any provision of [chapter 246 or 248 of the General Statutes, governing motor vehicles and vehicle highway use, respectively] . . . may make application to the commissioner of motor vehicles [commissioner] for a special permit to operate a motor vehicle to and from such person\u2019s place of employment or, if such person is not employed at a fixed location, to operate a motor vehicle only in connection with, and to the extent necessary, to properly perform such person\u2019s business or profession. . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 14-37a authorizes the commissioner to grant a limited driving privilege to a person who has had his or her operators\u2019 license suspended, in order to allow such person \u201cto properly perform [his or her] business or profession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We next consider the relationship between the text of \u00a7\u00a7 14-215 (c) and 14-37a. We begin by noting that there is nothing in the text of \u00a7 14-215 (c) to suggest that the state is required to prove that a person charged with violating its provisions was operating his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>motor vehicle outside the parameters of a work permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 14-37a. By contrast, were we to follow the reasoning of both the defendant and the Appellate Court, the state would be required to prove that a defendant was not operating his or her motor vehicle within the parameters of a work permit in every prosecution in which that defendant is charged with a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), notwithstanding the absence of any such element in the text of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S. Ct. 874, 66 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1981), we concluded that \u201c[i]t is the general rule that where exceptions to a prohibition in a criminal statute are situated separately from the enacting clause, <em>the exceptions are to be proven by the defense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 402.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In its review of this case, the Appellate Court distinguished <em>Tinsley </em>by stating that <em>uTinsley </em>involved a discussion of [a statute that] states the elements necessary to prove the crime charged and, in a separate clause, sets forth exceptions to a violation of the statute. Section 14-215, however, does not include exceptions to its violation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 39. The Appellate Court, however, did not provide any rationale for why the placement of the work permit exception to the prohibition of driving under suspension in a separate statute should make it any more likely for such an exception to be an element of \u00a7 14-215 (c) than if the exception were located in \u00a7 14-215 (c), itself. Nor can we find one. On the contrary, if, as we stated in <em>Tinsley, </em>the defendant must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the application of an exception that resides <em>within the statute defining the substantive offense, </em>but not within that statute\u2019s enacting or prohibiting clause, then, surely, a defendant properly may be required to prove the application of an exception that, as in this case, is located <em>in a completely separate statute. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>24 Conn. 522, 529 (1856) (because general rule is that exceptions not within enacting clause of criminal statute are to be proven by defendant, <em>\u201cif a subsequent statute, </em>or even a clause of exception in the same statute excuse [s], or except[s], persons particularly circumstanced, out of the general words, such excuse, or exception, must come by way of plea, or evidence [offered by the defendant]\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freter, </em>31 F.3d 783, 788 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1048, 115 S. Ct. 646, 130 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1994) (\u201ca defendant who relies upon an exception to a statute . . . whether in the same section of the statute <em>or elsewhere, </em>has the burden of establishing and showing that he comes within the exception\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The distinct effect on the allocation of the burden of persuasion stemming from words of a criminal statute that state an exception to culpability and appear as part of the enacting or prohibiting clause of the statute, on the one hand, and words that create an exception to culpability elsewhere, on the other hand, is well established. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>179 Conn. 516, 427 A.2d 403 (1980), we stated: \u201cIt is a general guide to the interpretation of criminal statutes that <em>when an exception is incorporated in the enacting clause of a statute, </em>the burden is on the prosecution to plead and prove that the defendant is not within the exception.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 520, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vuitch, </em>402 U.S. 62, 70, 91 S. Ct. 1294, 28 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1971); see also <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>v. <em>Beauton, </em>170 Conn. 234, 241, 365 A.2d 1105 (1976) (\u201cA significant factor in reaching our conclusion is that the words of the statute [requiring the state to prove a negative] <em>appear as part of the enacting or prohibition clause of the statute. </em>It is not an exception but a descriptive negative defining the corpus delicti.\u201d [Emphasis added.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As the foregoing cases make clear, the state must disprove an exception to culpability as an element of the crime when charging the defendant under a statute in which that exception is located within the enacting or prohibiting clause; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 520; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beauton, </em>supra, 170 Conn. 241; whereas the defendant bears the burden of persuasion if the exception is not found within the enacting or prohibiting clause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 403. Therefore, we agree with the state that there is nothing in <em>Tinsley, </em>nor in any other case in our jurisprudence, to suggest that the legislature cannot define a substantive offense in one statute and provide an exception to culpability for a violation of that offense in another statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>176 Conn. 451, 465, 408 A.2d 232 (1979) (\u201cwhere the legislature defines a crime as including certain elements, A and B, and gives notice that proof beyond a reasonable doubt of those elements will subject the violator to punishment, the existence of an affirmative defense, C, does not detract from the given nature of the crime, but rather adds another factor to the case which, if proved, may exonerate the accused\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">A comparison of the two statutes at issue in this case reveals that the legislature defined the substantive offense of driving under suspension in \u00a7 14-215 (c) and provided an exception to culpability for a violation of that offense in \u00a7 14-37a. See footnotes 1 and 2 of this opinion. Thus, following the general rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhere exceptions to a prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>in a criminal statute are situated separately from the enacting clause, the exceptions are to be proven by the defense\u201d; <em>State </em>v. Tinsley, supra, 181 Conn. 402; we conclude that the legislature intended the work permit exception in \u00a7 14-37a to constitute an affirmative defense, for which the defendant bears the burden of persuasion, to the offense of driving under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Other jurisdictions likewise have concluded that a defendant charged with driving under suspension has the burden of proving a work permit defense by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>State </em>v. Shy, 761 S.W.2d 280, 282 (Mo. App. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bonn, </em>101 Ohio App. 3d 69, 72, 654 N.E.2d 1346 (1995). In contrast, the defendant has not cited to any case in any jurisdiction in which a court has concluded that the government bears the burden of disproving a work permit exception beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument, which was accepted by the Appellate Court; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 40-41; that the state should bear the burden of disproving a work permit exception because \u201c [a] defendant has the burden of persuasion only when it is <em>declared to be an affirmative defense </em>in the statute . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 40. In support of this argument, the Appellate Court and the defendant rely on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b), which provides: \u201cWhen a defense <em>declared to be an affirmative defense </em>is raised at a trial, the defendant shall have the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of establishing such defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">This argument fails because \u00a7 53a-12 (b) does not require the legislature expressly to declare that an exception to culpability is an affirmative defense for it to operate as an affirmative defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>199 Conn. 631, 640, 508 A.2d 1376 (1986) (concluding that statute of limitation was affirmative defense to crime notwithstanding legislature\u2019s failure expressly to declare it affirmative defense). Nor have we ever construed \u00a7 53a-12 (b) to require that all affirmative defenses be statutorily prescribed. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-4 (\u201c[t]he provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as precluding any court from recognizing other principles of criminal liability or other defenses not inconsistent with such provisions\u201d); see also State v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 464-65 (recognizing, as matter of common law, that defense of abandonment constitutes affirmative defense for which defendant bears burden of persuasion). Although the Appellate Court cited to <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 611, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>50 Conn. App. 312, 319-20, 718 A.2d 457 (1998), aff'd, 254 Conn. 88, 755 A.2d 202 (2000), for the proposition that \u201c[i]t is the prerogative of the legislature, <em>not the courts, </em>to establish affirmative defenses\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 41; neither case expressed any view regarding the legitimacy of judicially recognized affirmative defenses. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>supra, 611; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>supra, 319-20. Rather, both cases stand for the proposition that the legislature may prescribe affirmative defenses by statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>supra, 611; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>supra, 319-20. Thus, if \u00a7 53a-12 (b) does not prohibit the recognition of common-law affirmative defenses, it would be unreasonable to conclude that \u00a7 53a-12 (b) abrogates the rule of statutory construction that \u201cwhere excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tions to a prohibition in a criminal statute are situated separately from the enacting clause, the exceptions are to be proven by the defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that, because he did not <em>declare </em>to the trial court that the work permit exception to the prohibition of driving under suspension constituted an affirmative defense, it may not be considered as such by the trial court. In support of this argument, the defendant again relies on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b), which provides: \u201cWhen a defense <em>declared </em>to be an affirmative defense is raised at a trial, the defendant shall have the burden of establishing such defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The short answer to this argument is that \u00a7 53a-12 (b) does not evince an intent to allow <em>a defendant </em>to decide those elements upon which he or she wishes to bear the burden of persuasion. Rather, the text of \u00a7 53a-12 (b) logically can be interpreted to mean simply that a \u201cdefendant bears the burden of proof of an affirmative defense . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>236 Conn. 342, 353, 673 A.2d 463 (1996). The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-12 (b) effectively would allow all defendants to assign to the state the burden of proving the nonexistence of a defense merely by not declaring to the trial court that such a defense is an \u201caffirmative\u201d defense, the legislature\u2019s designation to the contrary notwithstanding. We have never suggested that \u00a7 53a-12 (b) authorizes a defendant to shift the burden of persuasion to the state simply by not declaring a defense to be an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The defendant finally notes that there are several other motor vehicle offenses similar to the offense with which the defendant was charged in this case, for which a claim of the absence of a condition is a general, rather than an affirmative, defense. For example, the defendant points to General Statutes \u00a7 14-213, which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>vides: \u201cEach operator of a motor vehicle shall carry his operator\u2019s license while operating such vehicle. Failure to carry such operator\u2019s license as required by the provisions of this section shall be an infraction.\u201d The defendant argues that, to establish a violation of \u00a7 14-213, the state would be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the operator was not carrying his license. Similarly, the defendant argues that, in this case, the state is required to prove that the defendant was not operating his motor vehicle pursuant to a work permit. We disagree. The obvious difference between the \u00a7\u00a7 14-213 and 14-215 (c) is that driving without carrying an operator\u2019s license <em>is </em>an element of a \u00a7 14-213 offense, whereas driving outside the parameters of a work permit <em>is not </em>an element of a \u00a7 14-215 (c) offense. Just as the state would have been required to prove all of the elements of a \u00a7 14-213 offense beyond a reasonable doubt had it charged the defendant with a violation of \u00a7 14-213, the state, in this case, was required to prove all of the elements of a \u00a7 14-215 (c) offense, the offense with which the defendant actually was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Having concluded that the legislature intended the work permit exception found in \u00a7 14-37a to serve as an affirmative defense to a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c), we next must determine whether requiring the defendant to bear the burden of persuasion with respect to such an affirmative defense is constitutional. \u201cThe proper approach to resolving this question, as dictated <em>by Patterson </em>[v. <em>New </em>York, supra, 432 U.S. 210], is first to determine the elements of [driving under suspension], and second to determine whether the defense of [driving pursuant to a valid work permit] necessarily negates any of those elements.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Arn, </em>788 F.2d 338, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>343-44 (6th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 917, 107 S. Ct. 1370, 94 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1987).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u201cIn order to establish a violation of \u00a7 14-215 (a), the state must prove two elements: (1) that the defendant was operating a motor vehicle; and (2) that the defendant\u2019s license or operating privileges were under suspension at the time. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>[31 Conn. App. 797, 805, 627 A.2d 474 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 824, 644 A.2d 331 (1994)]. . . . The only additional element required to prove a violation of subsection (c) is the requirement that the suspension at issue be on account of a violation of one of our statutes prohibiting the operation of motor vehicles by intoxicated operators.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>36 Conn. App. 710, 715, 653 A.2d 829 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Thus, we must consider whether proof that the defendant was driving within the parameters of a work permit necessarily entails disproof of an element of the offense of driving under suspension. We begin by noting that \u00a7 14-37a expressly conditions a person\u2019s ability to apply for a work permit on the fact that the person\u2019s license has been suspended. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Furthermore, there is nothing in the text of \u00a7 14-37a to suggest that a person\u2019s license is reinstated upon receiving a work permit. Id. On the contrary, even after the issuance of a work permit, a person\u2019s operator\u2019s license remains suspended and the person drives pursuant to that work permit rather than his or her operator\u2019s license. Therefore, proof that a person was driving pursuant to a valid work permit does not negate any element of the offense of driving under suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>We conclude that, because \u00a7 14-37a does not \u201cserve to negate any essential element of the crime which the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict [in this case]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 430, citing <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 432 U.S. 210; the requirement that the defendant bear the burden of persuasion with respect to the affirmative defense of driving pursuant to a valid work permit is constitutional under <em>Patterson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction for driving under suspension is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-215 provides: \u201c(a) No person to whom an operator\u2019s license has been refused, or whose operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state has been suspended or revoked, shall operate any motor vehicle during the period of such refusal, suspension or revocation.

In addition, there has been evidence offered to you concerning the element of that [driving] under suspension, and I will instruct you that a person commits the crime of [driving] under suspension when he operates a motor vehicle on a public highway when his right or privilege to operate has been suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u201cNow, in one of those counts, there is the claim that the defendant was [driving] under suspension when his license was suspended for a conviction of a violation of ... \u00a7 14-227a. There is a stipulation for you to consider on that that . . . relates directly to those facts, those elements.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\"> The trial court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, in this case, there was submitted to you, and will be submitted to you, by way of a document and by way of testimony, that, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and place alleged in the information, that is, in May of 1995,1he defendant was operating under a [work] permit. Now, [a work permit] issued in accordance with \u00a7 14-37a . . . permits a person to operate a motor vehicle to and from his place of employment or, if he\u2019s not employed at a specific or fixed location, to operate a motor vehicle in connection with, and to the extent necessary, to perform his business or profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\u201cNow ... if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was operating his motor vehicle within the context of a [work] permit, you may find the defendant not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u201cNow, proof by a preponderance of the evidence means, considering all of the evidence fairly and impartially, enough evidence as produces in your mind a reasonable belief that is sought to be proven is more likely true than not true. This means you take all the evidence offered on this issue by both the defendant and state, you weigh it and balance it. If the better and weightier evidence inclines in the defendant\u2019s favor, then he has sustained his burden in proving that defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\"> \u201cThis rule had its origin in an article by Theron Metcalf published anonymously in the American Jurist [of] October, 1832. After he was elevated to the bench in Massachusetts, Metcalf restated the rule in the leading case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>65 Mass. (11 Cush.) 130, 134 (1853). See [annot.] 153 A.L.R. 1218, 1222 [1944]. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>24 Conn. 522, 529 (1856), this state recognized the rule.
