We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. During the evening of September 16, 1996, the victim,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> walked the short distance from her home in East Haddam to J.R.\u2019s Cafe in Moodus. The defendant, with whom the victim was not acquainted, already was at the bar when she arrived. The victim remained at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>J.R.\u2019s for approximately one and one-hall' to two hours during which time she had several drinks, danced and conversed with acquaintances. The victim also asked the defendant to dance, tugging his arm to encourage him to join her on the dance floor. After dancing with the victim, the defendant bought the victim a drink and they conversed for a few minutes thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">At approximately 12:30 a.m. on September 17, 1996, the victim left the bar and started walking home. The defendant exited the bar immediately after the victim. As the victim walked down one of the driveways leading away from J.R.\u2019s, the defendant drove up next to her and offered to drive her home. The victim accepted his offer and voluntarily entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The victim gave the defendant directions to her home, but he failed to turn onto her road as instructed. The victim attempted to exit the moving car by opening the door, but the defendant grabbed her by the aim and pulled her back into the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The defendant then drove the victim to a remote area of Cockaponset State Forest, where he pulled her out of the car onto the wet ground<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and pulled her shorts and underpants down around her ankles. The defendant squeezed his hands around the victim\u2019s neck, choking her, and then performed oral sex on her. The defendant also touched the victim\u2019s breasts, vagina and buttocks with his hands, mouth and penis. During this period the defendant told the victim that she \u201cdeserved it.\u201d While the defendant again attempted to perform oral sex on her, the victim managed to kick him away and flee through the woods, pulling up her shorts and underpants as she ran. As the victim ran away, she lost one of her shoes, a sock and her driver\u2019s license, which she had kept in her sock. The victim hid for a period of time beneath a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Eventually, the victim walked to a house adjacent to the woods where she knocked on the door and asked for help. The victim, who had mud on her clothes and body, and marks around her neck, appeared to have been involved in a struggle. Georgia Marica, one of the occupants of the house, testified that the victim appeared to be terrified. Inside the house, the victim telephoned her father and told him that she had just been raped. Marica notified the police, who arrived shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In response to the victim\u2019s report of a sexual assault, the police conducted a search of the area for any suspects or vehicles. During the early morning of September 17, 1996, the police located the defendant\u2019s vehicle approximately 100 feet off a road leading into Cockaponset State Forest. The vehicle\u2019s windows were rolled down and the interior was wet due to the rain. A canine search of the vicinity around the vehicle uncovered the victim\u2019s shoe, sock and driver\u2019s license and the defendant\u2019s set of keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">At approximately 6 a.m. on September 17, 1996, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Toni Bartlotta, reported the defendant\u2019s vehicle as stolen to the state police. Officers went to the defendant\u2019s apartment in Deep River in response to the stolen vehicle report and, upon arriving at the apartment, observed Bartlotta cleaning broken glass panes from the front door. The defendant provided the officers with oral and written statements alleging, inter aha, that he had parked his vehicle outside the Old Lyme Tavern in East Lyme the previous evening and later went home with a friend. The defendant further claimed that, when he returned to the Old Lyme Tavern the next morning to retrieve his vehicle, it was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Later the same day, a detective for the state police went to the defendant\u2019s home and requested that the defendant go down to the state police barracks in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>to identify his vehicle and further discuss the previous night\u2019s events. At the barracks, the defendant told police that in his previous statement he had lied about his vehicle being stolen because he had been out with another woman the previous evening and did not want his girlfriend to find out.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendant then provided the police with a second version of the previous evening\u2019s events, claiming that he had met the victim at J.R.\u2019s, engaged in conversation with her and offered her a ride home when he saw her walking outside the bar. The defendant further stated that they drove to Cockaponset State Forest, parked the vehicle and began kissing and caressing. The defendant then removed the victim\u2019s shirt and shorts and performed consensual oral sex on her in the front seat of the vehicle. The defendant claimed that they then decided to have sexual intercourse and the victim laid down on the wet ground next to the car. The defendant further told police that when he was unable to maintain an erection, the victim became angry and got dressed. The defendant claimed that he had then realized that the victim had taken his car keys and, as the victim started to walk away from the car, he reached out, attempting to recover his keys from her. The defendant alleged that as he reached out, he tripped over a rock and accidentally grabbed the victim\u2019s neck. The victim then ran away, and the defendant, unable to find his keys, walked home, breaking the glass in his front door in order to gain entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The following day, the defendant contacted the state police and again revised portions of his earlier statement. The defendant provided a third version of the events, claiming that when he left J.R.\u2019s he found the victim passed out in the front seat of his car. The defendant woke up the victim and she agreed to go for a ride with him. The defendant did not alter his previous statements concerning the rest of the evening\u2019s events. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The defendant was arrested later that day. Additional facts will be provided as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The defendant first claims that the state withheld exculpatory impeachment evidence in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and thereby deprived him of a fair trial. We conclude that the undisclosed evidence was not material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment under the third prong of <em>Brady </em>and, therefore, the state\u2019s failure to disclose did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On January 9,1997, Michael Dankulich, a victim\u2019s advocate, interviewed the victim in order to assess her counseling needs and compensation issues, to provide her with information, and to assist her in obtaining information from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Prior to the interview, the assistant state\u2019s attorney, Timothy Liston, wrote a brief note to Dankulich, requesting that he clarify with the victim \u201cwhere and why she got in the car with [the defendant].\u201d Following his interview with the victim, Dankulich wrote a responsive note to Liston, stating that the victim indicated that \u201cshe got into [the defendant\u2019s] car in the parking lot of the bar, not while walking down the road [and that] when asked why she got in the car she related that she had been drinking and that [James Lawrence] who was in the bar told her that [the defendant] appeared to be OK to accept a ride from. [Lawrence] is a friend of [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>victim\u2019s.\u201d Thereafter, the notes were placed in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">On December 23, 1996, the defendant, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 40-11<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 40-13,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> formerly \u00a7\u00a7 741 and 743, respectively, filed a request for disclosure and production. In response to the request, the state provided the defendant with numerous documents including police reports, test results and photographs. Over the ensuing months, the state continued to provide relevant documents in compliance with the production request. On January 28, 1998, following the return of the jury\u2019s verdict and just prior to sentencing, Liston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>turned over to the defendant the notes exchanged between himself and Dankulich, enclosing them in a letter indicating that he recently had found the correspondence in his file.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Immediately thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for a mistrial, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-43,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> formerly \u00a7 887, and a motion for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-53,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> formerly \u00a7 902. At the hearing on the motion, the defendant argued that the state\u2019s failure to disclose the correspondence had deprived him of his rights to due process and a fair trial according to the standard enunciated in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87. The trial court concluded that the defendant had met the first two prongs of the <em>Brady </em>standard by demonstrating (1) that the notes, which were eventually turned over on January 28, 1998, had been suppressed, and (2) that, because the notes contained impeachment evidence, they were favorable to him. Nevertheless, because it concluded that the defendant had not estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>lished the materiality of the notes in accordance with the third <em>Brady </em>requirement, the trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On appeal, the defendant renews his claim that the state suppressed evidence in violation of <em>Brady </em>,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s failure to produce the notes violated his right to the disclosure of exculpatory and impeachment evidence pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 40-11; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>footnote 12 of this opinion; and a prosecutor\u2019s common-law and constitutional duties to disclose such information.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We begin with the pertinent standard, outlined by <em>Brady </em>and its progeny, by which we determine whether the state\u2019s failure to disclose evidence has violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. \u201cIn <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 87, the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . . . violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. To establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant must show that (1) the government suppressed evidence, (2) the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defendant, and (3) it was material [either to guilt or to punishment]. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>229 Conn. 125, 134-35, 640 A.2d 572 (1994); <em>Demers </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 143, 150, 547 A.2d 28 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>235 Conn. 802, 813-15, 670 A.2d 301 (1996); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Conn. 258, 263, 480 A.2d 526 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 964, 83 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The trial court determined that the defendant had satisfied the first two prongs of <em>Brady. </em>Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal challenges only the trial court\u2019s assessment of materiality.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the victim\u2019s statements in the notes were material to his guilt because they would have permitted him to impeach substantially the victim\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The test for materiality is well established. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court ... in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985), [held] that undisclosed exculpatory evidence is material, and that constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, if there is a reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. The United States Supreme Court recently discussed several aspects of materiality under <em>Bagley </em>that bear emphasis. <em>See Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). The court explained that a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal. Id. The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. Id. The United States Supreme Court also emphasized that the <em>Bagley </em>test is not a sufficiency of evidence test. Id. A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict. . . . One does not show a <em>Brady </em>violation by demonstrating that some of the inculpatory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict. Id. [434-35].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 814-15; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>251 Conn. 579, 595, 742 A.2d 312 (1999). Accordingly, the focus is not whether, based upon a threshold standard, the result of the trial would have been different if the evidence had been admitted. We instead concentrate on the overall fairness of the trial and whether nondisclosure of the evidence was so unfair as to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>supra, 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The defendant argues that the notes were material because they contained evidence that he could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>used to impeach further the victim\u2019s credibility at trial. In particular, the defendant cites to the inconsistencies, regarding the circumstances under which the victim had entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle, between the victim\u2019s explanation to Dankulich, her testimony at trial and her statements to other individuals immediately following the assault. We conclude that the impeachment value of the evidence was cumulative and, therefore, insufficient to render the notes material according to the <em>Brady </em>and <em>Bagley </em>standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u201cIt is well established that impeachment evidence may be crucial to a defense, especially when the state\u2019s case hinges entirely upon the credibility of certain key witnesses. . . . The rale laid out in <em>Brady </em>requiring disclosure of exculpatory evidence applies to materials that might well alter . . . the credibility of a crucial prosecution witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 815-16. However, \u201c[ejvidence that may first appear to be quite compelling when considered alone can lose its potency when weighed and measured with all the other evidence, both inculpatory and exculpatory. Implicit in the standard of materiality is the notion that the significance of any particular bit of evidence can only be determined by comparison to the rest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 400, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 143, 531 A.2d 125 (1987) (materiality determination not made in vacuum).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In the present case, the victim\u2019s statement to Dankulich was not substantially inconsistent with her testimony at trial. Additionally, the defendant had sufficient opportunity to cross-examine the victim regarding any inconsistencies in her various statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The victim testified at trial that she had been walking down the access road or driveway away from the bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>for approximately two minutes when the defendant drove up next to her and offered her a ride. The victim further testified that the defendant had not forced her into the car, but, rather, that she had accepted the ride and voluntarily entered the defendant\u2019s car \u201c[bjecause it\u2019s a small town and it was raining. Everybody in our town . . . basically knows everybody. Nothing ever happens bad in our town.\u201d The note from Dankulich indicated, however, that the victim had told him that she had entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle in the \u201cparking lot,\u201d rather than the driveway, of the bar. Additionally, although at trial the victim testified that she had left the bar intending to walk home, Dankulich\u2019s note indicates that she previously had discussed the possibility of receiving a ride from the defendant with Lawrence, her friend, who told her that the defendant was \u201cOK to accept a ride from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We disagree with the defendant that these differences between the victim\u2019s trial testimony and her conversation with Dankulich are sufficient to impeach the victim so substantially as to \u201cput the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 435. Essentially, the differences between the victim\u2019s trial testimony and what she had told Dankulich were: (1) that she had entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle while walking down the driveway of the bar rather than in the parking lot; and (2) that she had planned on walking home from the bar, although she told Dankulich that she had asked Lawrence whether the defendant was a person from whom it would be OK to accept a ride. Accordingly, the victim\u2019s statements in the note did not substantially differ from her testimony at trial and, therefore, the impeachment value of the information contained in the notes was limited. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 42, 475 A.2d 269 (1984) (not every inconsistency is exculpatory); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>32 Conn. App. 483, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>492-93, 630 A.2d 96 (1993) (victim\u2019s inconsistencies regarding details of location of assault not so contradictory as to constitute <em>Brady </em>violation), aff'd, 231 Conn. 195, 647 A.2d 342 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u201cThe defendant also had ample opportunity to cross-examine the victim as to all details of the assault\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 493; and regarding any inconsistencies between her trial testimony and her prior conversations. For example, during cross-examination defense counsel asked the victim whether she recalled telling Marica,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Carol Flaim, a nurse at Middle-sex Hospital, and Derek Allen, a state police detective, that the defendant had forced her into his vehicle. The victim indicated that she did not remember having any such conversations. Additionally, Allen testified that he did not recall the victim stating that the defendant had pulled her into the vehicle. Accordingly, through cross-examination and the submission into evidence of the victim\u2019s statement to the police, wherein she indicated that she voluntarily had entered the defendant\u2019s car, the defendant had sufficient opportunity to question the victim as to the details of her entry into the defendant\u2019s vehicle. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 266 (in sexual assault case, \u201cdefendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the victim fully and question her reliability before the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Furthermore, the defendant was able to highlight any inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s trial testimony and her previous statements regarding other details of that evening. During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the victim about whether she had danced and conversed with the defendant at the bar earlier in the evening. The victim testified that she could not remember doing either of those activities at the bar that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>evening. During cross-examination of Shane Weeks, the bartender at J.R.\u2019s, defense counsel later elicited that the defendant and the victim had engaged in conversation and that the defendant had bought the victim a drink. Additionally, Lawrence testified that the victim had asked the defendant to dance with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Therefore, \u201cthe ability to impeach [the victim], by prior inconsistent statements was available to the defendant despite the nondisclosure of the [notes] and, in fact, the defendant used that information extensively during his cross-examination of [the victim]. Although the undisclosed material might have contributed further to an attack on the credibility of [the victim], the primary ammunition for that attack was already available to the defendant. The slight additional amount of inconsistent material contained in the [notes] was merely cumulative and, therefore, not significant in a constitutional sense to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 817; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 108 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201csuppressed impeachment evidence is not material where [it] merely constitutes \u2018an additional basis on which to impeach a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amiel, </em>95 F.3d 135, 145 (2d Cir. 1996) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Moreover, this was not a case in which \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s case hinge[d] entirely on the testimony of [the victim] . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 136-37. Although the victim\u2019s testimony obviously was paramount, the prosecution presented independent physical evidence and the testimony of other witnesses that corroborated the victim\u2019s version of events and supported the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Amiel, </em>supra, 95 F.3d 146 (independent evidence tied defendant to crime despite nondisclosure of impeachment evidence); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>231 Conn. 43, 54, 646 A.2d 835 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1038, 115 S. Ct. 1404, 131 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 291 (1995) (state\u2019s case not entirely dependent on witness\u2019 testimony and credibility); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 495 (substantial physical evidence and corroborating testimony supporting verdict in addition to victim\u2019s testimony). In particular, the testimony of a number of witnesses corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had kidnapped and physically and sexually assaulted her. Marica, the resident of the dwelling where the victim sought help, testified that when the victim appeared at her door she had mud on her clothes and knees and \u201cmar-ks around her neck\u201d that looked like someone had \u201cgrabbed her right around the neck.\u201d Marica described the victim as \u201cvery upset, scared, nervous\u201d and \u201cjust basically terrified . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Flaim testified that during her care of the victim at the hospital she had observed \u201cabrasions on [the victim\u2019s] extremities\u201d and \u201caround her neck.\u201d Flaim explained that the abrasion around the victim\u2019s neck looked like \u201ca new bruise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Valerie I\u2019Anson, the emergency room physician who treated the victim, noted the victim\u2019s emotional state as \u201cvery distressed.\u201d She also described in detail the bruises around the victim\u2019s neck and explained that some of the bruises were small rings caused by blood vessels that had ruptured under pressure and were attributable to compression of the neck area. During her examination of the victim, she also noticed a large abrasion on the victim\u2019s elbow and \u201cmultiple cuts and bruises over both lower extremities.\u201d Additionally, I\u2019An-son testified that the victim had mulch and other debris around the entrance to her vagina and concluded that these observations were consistent with the version of events that the victim had provided. Her diagnosis was that the victim had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Sergeant Marcia Youngquist of the Connecticut state police also described the victim\u2019s physical appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>at the hospital. Youngquist explained that the victim\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and that blood blisters and red circles vented her entire neck. Youngquist also testified that the victim had bruises and scratches on her knees and arms that were consistent with a physical altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In addition to the descriptions of the physical evidence supporting the victim\u2019s version of events, police found the defendant\u2019s car off a road leading into Cockaponset State Forest, the place that the victim had described as the location of the assault. The police also recovered the victim\u2019s sock, shoe and driver\u2019s license in the vicinity, all of which corroborate her description of fighting off the defendant and running through the woods. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s statement to police and his later revisions of the statement cast into doubt the truth and accuracy of his explanation of the evening\u2019s events. Although the credibility of the victim in sexual assault cases is often critical because \u201csuch offenses are seldom undertaken in public view or in the presence of witnesses\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 267; we cannot say that the slight additional impeachment value of the information contained in the notes substantially undermined our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Finally, the information provided by the victim to Dankulich as described in the notes was of limited value. The contents of the notes simply relate to the circumstances under which the victim had entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle. Although the victim previously had told some individuals that the defendant had forced her into the car, at trial she admitted to having entered the defendant\u2019s car voluntarily. The contents of the note regarding her discussions with Lawrence about whether it was safe for her to accept a ride from the defendant simply provided further evidence of a fact that the vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>tim already had admitted\u2014that she voluntarily had accepted a ride and entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The defendant also intimated at oral argument that the fact that the victim had asked Lawrence whether she could safely accept a ride from the defendant suggests that she had consented not only to entering the defendant\u2019s vehicle but also to a sexual encounter with him. We reject the defendant\u2019s insinuation that either the victim\u2019s inquiry of Lawrence or her decision to accept a ride from the defendant demonstrated that she also consented to the defendant\u2019s sexual advances. Moreover, we note that the victim\u2019s question to Lawrence regarding whether the defendant was \u201csafe\u201d may have demonstrated the opposite, that is, that the victim did not want any sexual contact with the defendant and even inquired about him with a trusted acquaintance to ensure that this did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Additionally, the defendant elicited other testimony at trial regarding the defense theoiy that the victim had consented to having sex with the defendant. Therefore, the additional information contained in the notes that the defendant claims supports this theory would have been cumulative. For example, Weeks testified during cross-examination that he had observed the victim and the defendant conversing with a larger group of people at the bar-. Additionally, Lawrence testified that the victim had tugged the defendant\u2019s arm and encouraged him to dance with her. He also testified that the defendant and the victim had spoken with each other briefly. Finally, Lawrence stated that the defendant had bought the victim a drink, which she accepted, and that they spoke for a few minutes thereafter. Accordingly, the defendant, attempting to support the defense theory of consensual sex, elicited testimony at trial demonstrating that he and the victim had interacted at the bar. The victim\u2019s inquiry of Lawrence that she relayed to Dankulich would have added little to this theory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the information contained in the notes was not material under the third prong of <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The defendant also briefly claims on appeal that the trial court improperly imposed a fixed, rather than an indeterminate, term of imprisonment for the kidnapping conviction in violation of \u00a7 53a-37.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See footnote 8 of this opinion. Because the defendant failed to preserve this claim in the trial court and has not requested review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989) (providing review of unpreserved claims of constitutional error if certain requirements met); or under the plain error doctrine; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>250 Conn. 807, 814-15, 740 A.2d 371 (1999); we decline to review the defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence. Nevertheless, we note that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the indeterminate sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>fencing requirements the defendant cites do not apply to convictions rendered after July 1, 1981, when the legislature instituted determinate sentencing for felony convictions. Accordingly, the trial court was required to impose a determinate sentence for all of the defendant\u2019s convictions and, in fact, complied with this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt for the kidnapping, sexual assault by cunnilingus and attempted sexual assault by vaginal penetration counts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 239, 745 A.2d 800 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Additionally, \u201c[a]s we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Finally, \u201c[w]e do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. . . . <em>State </em>v. Henning, 220 Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991). This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 258, 681 A.2d 922 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The defendant claims there was not enough evidence to support his conviction of kidnapping in the first degree because the state failed to produce sufficient evidence of the restraint element of kidnapping. Essentially, the defendant contends that any evidence that he restrained the victim was incidental to the sexual assault and, therefore, insufficient for a separate charge of kidnapping. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">A person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), if \u201che abducts another person and . . . restrains the person abducted with intent to . . . inflict physical injury upon him or violate or abuse him sexually . . . .\u201d Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2) defines \u201cabduct\u201d as \u201crestrain[ing] a person with intent to prevent his liberation by either (A) secreting or holding him in a place where he is not likely to be found, or (B) using or threatening to use physical force or intimidation.\u201d The term \u201crestrain\u201d is also defined in \u00a7 53a-91 (1) as \u201crestrict[ing] a person\u2019s movements intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty by moving him from one place to another, or by confining him either in the place where the restriction commences or in a place to which he has been moved, without consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The defendant essentially urges us to preclude a conviction for kidnapping where restraint of the victim was incidental to a sexual assault. We previously have considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s argument on a number of occasions. \u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 170, 377 A.2d 263 (1977), we noted that the legislature had not seen fit to merge the offense of kidnapping with other felonies, nor impose any time requirements for restraint, nor distance requirements for asportation, to the crime of kidnapping.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 304-305, 503 A.2d 146 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 350-51, 622 A.2d 1014 (1993). \u201c[W]here the elements of two or more distinct offenses are combined in the same act, prosecution for one will not bar prosecution for the other. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dubina, </em>[164 Conn. 95, 100, 318 A.2d 95 (1972)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fico, </em>147 Conn. 426, 430, 162 A.2d 697 [1960]. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>supra, 169. Where the intent required to constitute kidnapping in the first degree is present, the fact that the peipetrator\u2019s underlying motive for the detention is the consummation of [sexual assault] . . . does not preclude a conviction for kidnapping. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>[177 Conn. 335, 344, 417 A.2d 354 (1979)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>supra, 305; see <em>State </em>v. <em>DeWitt, </em>177 Conn. 637, 641, 419 A.2d 861 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201cThe proper inquiry is not whether the kidnapping was incidental to the sexual assault, but whether the restraint was accomplished with the requisite intent to constitute kidnapping, as well as the state of mind required for sexual assault. Whether the essential elements of kidnapping are proved beyond a reasonable doubt is a question for the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra, [177 Conn.] 343. The analysis, therefore, is not simply transactional. A defendant may be convicted of two crimes that derive from the same conduct as long as the state [is] able to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all of the essential elements of each crime.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In the present case the state presented evidence that the defendant forcibly grabbed the victim\u2019s arm in order to prevent her from exiting the vehicle. The state also presented evidence that the defendant restrained the victim in the woods and that the victim was required to kick the defendant and struggle with him in order to free herself. The jury was entitled to believe the testimony of the victim. Accordingly, on these facts, the jury reasonably could have found the restraint and intent elements necessary to support a conviction for kidnapping in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The defendant also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of sexual assault in the first degree by cunnilingus because the state failed to produce any evidence of penetration. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), a defendant is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree if he \u201ccompels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force ... or by the threat of use of force . . . which reasonably causes such person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>fear physical injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) defines \u201csexual intercourse\u201d as including \u201cvaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus . . . .\u201d This court previously has defined \u201ccunnilingus\u201d as the \u201c \u2018stimulation of the vulva or clitoris with the lips or tongue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 764, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982). Although evidence of penetration is required for vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse and fellatio,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u201cpenetration is not an essential element of the crime [of sexual assault in the first degree] where cunnilingus is charged.\u201d Id., 765; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 463-64, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). Accordingly, the state was not required to present evidence of penetration to support the charge of first degree sexual assault by cunnilingus.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The victim testified at trial that after the defendant choked her, he put his mouth on her vagina and his tongue into her vagina. Additionally, the victim testified that the defendant later put his mouth on her vagina again and that during both of these periods she attempted to fight him off. The victim also stated that the defendant told her that if she \u201cdidn\u2019t shut up\u201d he would continue performing those acts. On the basis of this testimony, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant compelled the victim to engage in cunnilingus by the use of force or the threat of the use of force in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). See <em>State v. Kish, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 766. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence to support the juiy\u2019s verdict that the defendant committed first degree sexual assault by cunnilingus.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The defendant\u2019s final argument on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for attempted sexual assault in the first degree by vaginal intercourse. We conclude that sufficient evidence was presented to support the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201cUnder [\u00a7] 53a-49 (a) (2), [a] person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime he . . . intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. The act or acts must be something more than mere preparation for committing the intended crime; they must be at least the start of a line of conduct which will lead naturally to the commission of a crime which appears to the actor at least to be possible of commission by the means adopted. . . . Furthermore, the actor\u2019s intent can be inferred from his or her verbal or physical conduct and the surrounding circumstances. . . . [T]he attempt is complete and punishable, when an act is done with intent to commit the crime, which is adapted to the perpetration of it, whether the purpose fails by reason of interruption . . . or for other extrinsic cause.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Conn. 18, 27, 557 A.2d 917 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In the present case, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant intentionally engaged in conduct that amounted to a substantial step in the commission of sexual assault in the first degree by vaginal intercourse. The victim testified at trial that the defendant removed her shorts and underwear and then choked her around the neck. The victim also testified that the defendant had touched her vagina with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>hands and penis, and that when she turned over as she was trying to get away, he \u201cjumped back\u201d on top of her and did not have his pants on. The victim further testified that the defendant had touched her buttocks with his genital area, and that after he attempted to perform cunnilingus on her for a second time, she managed to kick him and run away.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The jury reasonably could have concluded from this course of conduct that the defendant had intended to engage in vaginal and anal intercourse with the victim using his penis and hand and that his plan had been thwarted only because the victim had managed to fight him off and flee. Although \u201cmere preparation\u201d is insufficient to constitute a substantial step toward perpetration of a crime, the defendant\u2019s conduct in the present case advanced well beyond mere preparation, and the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions in removing the victim\u2019s shorts and underwear, removing his own pants, and touching the victim\u2019s vagina and buttocks with his hands and penis constituted \u201ca substantial step strongly corroborative of his criminal purpose.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapia, </em>202 Conn. 509, 516, 522 A.2d 272 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>57 Conn. App. 463, 470, 749 A.2d 83 (2000) (defendant\u2019s acts of taking victim into bedroom, removing victim\u2019s diaper, lowering his own pants and underwear, and having sexual contact with victim constituted substantial step toward commission of sexual intercourse interrupted only when victim\u2019s aunt entered room). Accordingly, we conclude that sufficient evidence existed to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted sexual assault in the first degree by vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In this opinion NORCOTT, VERTEFEUILLE and ROBAINA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and ...

Accordingly, because the information in the notes was not a statement within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 40-15 and 40-13, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim under those subsections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em> </em>Although the state does not dispute that the correspondence was favorable to the defendant, we note that the state does claim, as an alternate ground for affirmance, that it did not suppress the notes within the meaning of the first prong of <em>Brady, </em>because it had instituted an \u201copen file\u201d policy, giving the defendant unfettered access to the state\u2019s file. During a hearing on August 18,1997, the trial court noted that \u201cit\u2019s the court\u2019s understanding that the file is open to the defense and all statements and police reports are likewise, available to the defense.\u201d The state\u2019s attorney represented at that hearing that he had provided the defendant with a copy of the materials in the file. Because we conclude that the notes are not material under the third prong of the <em>Brady </em>standard and, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s claim on that basis, we need not determine whether the trial court properly concluded that the state had suppressed tire evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We take this opportunity, however, to discuss briefly our conclusion regarding the use of the open file policy. Although we encourage the use of open file policies and recognize that \u201cthis practice may increase the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal process\u201d; <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 283 n.23, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1999); because of the inherent difficulties accompanying so-called open file policies, we caution prosecutors not to substitute an open file policy for a conscientious effort to turn over all required materials to the defendant. Although the policy provides defendants with access to the entire file, in the absence of an accurate index that both parties agree upon, should an issue arise such as in the present case, the ability to determine whether a particular document was in the file, while it was open to the defendant, will be severely compromised. We, therefore, urge parties not to consider implementation of an open file policy as satisfaction of the defendant\u2019s discovery requests or the state\u2019s constitutional obligation to disclose exculpatory materials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> Marica was one of the occupants of the house where the victim sought help after the assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Specifically, the defendant claims that because the sentence for the kidnapping conviction was the first of several consecutive sentences, the trial court was required to impose a minimum and maximum sentence for that conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a provides: \u201cImprisonment for any felony committed on or after July 1, 1981: Definite sentences; terms authorized.

The majority finds that the statements were not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">I recognize that there may be strong circumstantial evidence that the victim did not consent to sexual activity with the defendant. The crucial evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction, however, was the victim\u2019s direct testimony that she did not consent to any sexual activity with the defendant. She was the crucial witness for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The statements were documented in a January 9, 1997 interview in which a victim\u2019s advocate asked the victim, at the request of the state\u2019s attorney, when, where and why she got into the car with the defendant. A note from the victim\u2019s advocate to the state\u2019s attorney reported: \u201c[The victim] indicated that she got into [the defendant\u2019s] car in the parking lot of the bar, not while walking down the road [and] when asked why she got in the car, she related that she had been drinking and that [her friend, James Lawrence] who was in the bar, told her that [the defendant] appeared to be OK to accept a ride from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The statements differ from the victim\u2019s testimony at trial in 1997, that she had been walking home from the bar when the defendant drove up to her on the road and offered her a ride. It also contradicts other statements that she had made concerning how she came to be in the defendant\u2019s car. On the night of the alleged incident, September 16,1996, the victim gave Detective Derek Allen of the Connecticut state police a sworn statement. The victim told Allen that she had left the bar and was walking along the road when the defendant pulled over and asked her if she wanted a ride. She then accepted his offer. That same night, the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>was taken to the hospital and treated by Valerie I\u2019Anson, an emergency room physician. I\u2019Anson testified that the victim said that after leaving the bar and walking down the road, the defendant forced her into his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">At trial, the victim also testified that she could not remember whether she had talked, danced or accepted a drink from the defendant while at the bar. There was, however, testimony from Shane Weeks, the bartender, and from Lawrence, the victim\u2019s friend, that indicated that she had talked, danced and accepted a drink from the defendant. The jury was, however, unaware of any evidence that Lawrence had told the victim at the bar that the defendant was \u201cOK\u201d to give her a ride home. The victim and Lawrence were not questioned about this conversation at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cIt is well established that impeachment evidence may be crucial to a defense, especially when the state\u2019s case hinges entirely upon the credibility of certain key witnesses. . . . The rule laid out in <em>Brady </em>[v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)] requiring disclosure of exculpatory evidence applies to materials that might well alter . . . the credibility of a crucial prosecution witness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>235 Conn. 802, 815-16, 670 A.2d 301 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The majority finds that the statements would have been \u201ccumulative\u201d because there was other evidence at trial to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony. While this evidence may have impeached the victim at trial, I disagree that the impeachment evidence contained in the interview was cumulative. The statements were made shortly before trial to the prosecutor\u2019s representative and were not the same kind of evidence for impeachment as the prior statements as they contained yet another version of the events. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>253 Conn. 700, 746-47 n.32, 756 A.2d 799 (2000), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>80 F.3d 514 (D.C.

Dickens, Dombey and Son (1848) c. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The defendant\u2019s right to have his guilt determined by a jury is paramount and the statements might have impacted the jury\u2019s assessment of the victim\u2019s testimony. The majority rejects the defendant\u2019s argument as to the effect of the statements upon the victim\u2019s testimony but we should be mindful that it is not our function to pass on credibility or find facts\u2014that responsibility belongs exclusively to the jurors \u201cas the sole triers of fact and credibility . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Provost, </em>251 Conn. 252, 256, 741 A.2d 295 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>235 Conn. 595, 604, 669 A.2d 562 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">I would conclude the statements \u201ccould reasonably [have been] taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.
