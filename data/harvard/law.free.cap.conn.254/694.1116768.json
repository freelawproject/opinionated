A jury found the defendant guilty of murder and felony murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict and sentenced the defendant to a prison term of sixty years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also determined, from the evidence presented at trial, that the defendant had used a firearm during the commission of the murder in violation of \u00a7 53-202k. Accordingly, the trial court, pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, imposed a five year sentence to run consecutively to the defendant\u2019s sixty year sentence, for a total effective term of imprisonment of sixty-five years. On appeal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) denied his motion to suppress certain handwritten notes that were seized from his car; (2) permitted the state to introduce evidence regarding his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>termination of a police interview prior to Ms arrest but after he had been advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rights; (3) permitted the state to introduce into evidence the testimony of a mental health worker regarding a statement that the defendant had made, wMch, he claims, was protected by the psycMatrist-patient privilege; (4) quashed a subpoena duces tecum issued by the defendant without conducting an in camera inspection of the materials sought thereunder; (5) instructed the jury on reasonable doubt; (6) concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support Ms conviction for felony murder; and (7) failed to mstruct the jury regardmg the elements of \u00a7 53-202k. We reject these claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the followmg facts. The victim, Gayle Isleib, resided at 863 Tolland Turnpike in Manchester with her husband, Douglas Isleib. The victim was employed by a local Wal-Mart store, where she worked m the shoe department. On April 30, 1996, the victim worked the evening sMft. The victim\u2019s husband expected the victim to return home from work at approximately 10:15 p.m. that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">At about 10:50 p.m., the victim drove her Jeep Cherokee (Jeep) hurriedly into her driveway. The defendant followed her into the driveway in his wMte MitsubisM Mirage. The defendant, who worked with the victim in the Wal-Mart shoe department, exited Ms car and approached the victim\u2019s Jeep, carrying a twenty-two caliber Norinco rifle. The victim activated the automatic garage door and sounded her car horn for several seconds. The defendant then fired seven shots at the victim, five of wMch struck her m the head, three from very close range. The victim also suffered defensive gunshot wounds to her left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>After hearing the car horn and the gunshots, the victim\u2019s husband looked outside and saw the defendant standing next to the driver\u2019s side of the victim\u2019s car. The victim\u2019s husband immediately ran back inside to call 911. In the meantime, the defendant ran to his car, entered it and sped off. The victim\u2019s husband then went outside, where he found the victim unresponsive and slumped across the front seat of her Jeep. The victim died at the scene as a result of the bullet wounds to her head. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendant first contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress three handwritten notes seized from his car<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in violation of the fourth amendment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the United States constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress at which the following relevant facts were established. On May 2, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>officers of the Manchester police department obtained a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s impounded car.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the course of executing the search warrant, the officers observed certain items that were not specifically mentioned therein, but which appeared to have evidentiary value, including a knife, an ice pick, duct tape, latex gloves, a cake dish and three handwritten notes. The notes were found in three separate locations in the defendant\u2019s car, namely, the glove compartment, an ashtray and under the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Detective Joseph Amato of the Manchester police department found the first note in the front of the glove compartment as he opened the door to that compartment to search it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After reading \u201c[p]ortions\u201d of the note, Amato concluded that it contained evidence relevant to the investigation and seized it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Amato then observed a second note, tom and partially burned, in an ashtray located immediately to the right of the driver\u2019s seat and in close proximity to the automatic gear shift.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Amato did not attempt to read the note or remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>it from the ashtray based on the note\u2019s condition. Instead, the police photographed the ashtray and its contents and removed the entire ashtray, including the note, from the car. Amato testified that he had seized the second note because of the likelihood that it contained trace evidence of the kind enumerated in the warrant. See footnote 11 of this opinion. The investigating officers also discovered a third handwritten note under the front passenger seat. Amato read portions of that note, but did not seize it at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">After seizing the first two notes, the police sought a second search warrant for the defendant\u2019s car. The application for the second warrant included the representation that, during the execution of the first warrant, several pieces of paper had been uncovered that contained information relating to a plan to kidnap the victim and to kill her husband.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The police obtained the second warrant, which authorized the seizure of, among other things, \u201chandwritten notes and instructions; cutting instruments; icepicks; rubber gloves; duct tape, glass cake dish . . . [and] wom[e]n\u2019s clothing . . . .\u201d The police then searched the defendant\u2019s car a second time and seized the third handwritten note that they had discovered under the front passenger seat while executing the first warrant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>The defendant moved to suppress the notes discovered in the glove compartment and in the ashtray on the ground that the seizure thereof was not expressly authorized by the first search warrant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant also sought to suppress the handwritten note found under the front passenger seat notwithstanding that the second search warrant authorized the seizure of that particular note. Specifically, the defendant maintained that the seizure of the third note was unlawful because the probable cause upon which the seizure of that note was predicated derived solely from the information contained in the notes that allegedly were seized illegally from the glove compartment and the ashtray, and from the information gleaned by the police in reading the third note prior to obtaining the second warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the three handwritten notes. With respect to the note that the police had discovered in the ashtray, the trial court determined that its seizure was authorized under the first search warrant because it \u201ccould reasonably be [a receptacle] for just the type of trace materials and fluids <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>listed as the object of the warrant . . . .\u201d The court concluded that the police were authorized to seize the note found in the glove compartment under the plain view doctrine because that note had been discovered during the course of a lawful search and its evidentiary value was immediately discernible.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, although the trial court did not expressly state its reason for refusing to suppress the note that had been discovered under the front passenger seat, the defendant\u2019s failure to establish that the second search warrant was the product of prior police misconduct necessarily was fatal to his claim with respect to that note.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the seizure of the note found in the ashtray. The fourth amendment to the federal constitution requires that search warrants describe with particularity the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. \u201cThe [particularity requirement of the fourth amendment] was a direct response to the evil of the general warrant, one of the abuses by the Crown that led to the American revolution: [T]he problem [posed by the general warrant] is not that of intrusion per se, but of a general exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings .... [The fourth amendment addressed the problem] by requiring a particular description of the things to be seized. <em>Andresen </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 480, 96 S. Ct. 2737, 2748, 49 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1976)____\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>214 Conn. 692, 706-707, 573 A.2d 1197, vacated on other grounds, 498 U.S. 933, 111 S. Ct. 334, 112 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1990). \u201cThis requirement makes gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>eral searches . . . impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Andresen </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">However, \u201c[t]he description of items to be seized in a warrant need only be as specific as the circumstances and the nature of the activity under investigation permit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>[227 Conn. 207, 225, 630 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1025, 114 S. Ct. 637, 126 L. Ed. 2d 595 (1993)]. In construing the terms of a warrant, the circumstances and nature of the activity under investigation dictate a practical margin of flexibility. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>675 F.2d 593, 595 (4th Cir. 1982). This principle, which applies in the law of the execution of warrants, is consistent with the concomitant principle, which applies in the law of the validity of warrants, that probable cause is to be determined based on the totality of the circumstances, viewed in a common sense and practical manner. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>[231 Conn. 115, 142, 646 A.2d 169 (1994)]. Furthermore, when police search for an item, they are entitled to search any container that logically could hold the item sought. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomez-Soto, </em>723 F.2d 649, 655 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 977, 104 S. Ct. 2360, 80 L. Ed. 2d 831 (1984). In addition, the police do not exceed the scope of a warrant when they provide the issuing magistrate with the most particular description of the item sought that they reasonably can provide, and then seize only those items that fall generally within that description. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Emmons, </em>24 F.3d 1210, 1216 (10th Cir. 1994) ([w]hen the circumstances of the crime make an exact description of the fruits and instrumentalities a virtual impossibility, the searching officer can only be expected to describe the generic class of items he is seeking); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>903 F.2d 770, 775 (10th Cir. 1990) (same).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 323, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>principles, as applied to the execution of the first warrant in the present case, compel the conclusion that the police acted well within permissible bounds in seizing the partially burnt note found in the ashtray. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The defendant does not dispute that the first search warrant properly authorized the police to seize from his vehicle any and all items that the police reasonably believed were likely to contain traces of certain identified substances, including blood, saliva, physiological fluids and secretions, and glass and plastic fragments. Rather, the defendant claims that there was no reasonable likelihood that the note discovered in the ashtray contained traces of such substances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The police knew that the victim had been shot numerous times at close range, and that there was a considerable amount of blood spatter and broken glass at the crime scene. The police also had sound reason to believe that the defendant had shot and killed the victim, and that he had driven to and departed from the victim\u2019s home in his car. On the basis of this information, and in light of the close proximity of the ashtray to the driver\u2019s seat, it was reasonable for the police to believe that the defendant, while operating his vehicle, inadvertently transferred trace amounts of one or more of the substances identified in the warrant to the note found in the ashtray. In light of the almost impossible task of determining with specificity, prior to searching the defendant\u2019s vehicle, what items actually contained traces of the substances listed in the warrant, the warrant identified those items with as much particularity as reasonably could be expected. See id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">This is not to say, of course, that the police necessarily were authorized to seize anything and everything from the defendant\u2019s vehicle that conceivably could have contained trace evidence of the substances identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>fied in the warrant, no matter how unlikely the discovery of such evidence might have been. The ashtray and its contents, however, including the note, were in such close proximity to the driver\u2019s seat and the gear shift that it was reasonably probable that the defendant came in contact with the note while operating the car, smoking a cigarette or disposing of something in the ashtray. Accordingly, the trial court did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress with respect to the note discovered in the ashtray.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We next turn to the seizure of the note found in the glove compartment. As we stated with regard to the seizure of the note from the ashtray, \u201c[t]he description of items to be seized in a warrant need only be as specific as the circumstances and the nature of the activity under investigation permit.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 225. \u201cMoreover, when the items that were seized were discovered during a lawful search authorized by a valid warrant [and when] they were discovered, it was immediately apparent to the officer that they constituted incriminating evidence . . . the seizure [is] authorized by the plain-view doctrine. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 142, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990). The police meet the immediately apparent requirement if, [up] on discovery, they have probable cause to associate the property in plain view with criminal activity without further investigation. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>[480 U.S. 321, 324-27, 107 S. Ct. 1149, 94 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1987)] .... In other words, objects not named in the warrant, but found within an officer\u2019s plain view, may be seized if the . . . officers had a reasonable basis for believing that the seized evidence was reasonably related to the offense which formed the basis for the search warrant. . . . This doctrine is based upon the premise that the police need not ignore incriminating evidence in plain view while they are operating within the parameters of a valid search war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>rant or are otherwise entitled to be in a position to view the items seized.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the seizure of the note found in the glove compartment was authorized under the plain view doctrine.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the police were authorized to search the glove compartment. See footnote 17 of this opinion. While conducting that search, Amato came upon the note and conducted a lawful, cursory examination of it to ascertain its identity. Upon conducting such an examination, it was immediately apparent to Amato that the note contained evidence of criminal activity and he therefore seized it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The defendant contends that Amato\u2019s cursory examination of the note constituted a separate and independent search and, consequently, that his examination of the note cannot be justified under the plain view doctrine. In support of this claim, the defendant relies on <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>supra, 480 U.S. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">In <em>Hicks, </em>police officers lawfully entered the respondent\u2019s apartment without a warrant under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to search for a murder suspect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>weapons and victims. See id., 323. Once inside the apartment, one of the officers observed two sets of stereo components that he believed had been stolen. Id. The officer then moved some of the components, including a turntable, to ascertain and record their serial numbers. Id. The officer called those numbers into police headquarters and, upon learning that the turntable, in fact, had been reported stolen, seized it immediately.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Id. The United States Supreme Court concluded that the officer\u2019s act of moving the equipment was \u201caction . . . unrelated to the objectives of the authorized intrusion, which exposed to view concealed portions of the apartment or its contents . . . [and] produce[d] a new invasion of [the defendant\u2019s] privacy unjustified by the exigent circumstance that validated the entry.\u201d Id., 325. Therefore, the movement of the stereo equipment \u201cconstituted a search separate and apart from the search . . . that was the lawful objective of [that] entry.\u201d Id., 324-25. Because the officer, prior to moving the stereo components to ascertain their serial numbers, had only reasonable suspicion, and not probable cause, to believe that the equipment had been stolen, the court concluded that the search was unreasonable. See id., 328. Consequently, the court upheld the suppression of the turntable as a product of the unlawful search. Id., 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Hicks </em>is misplaced. As the court explained in <em>Hicks, </em>\u201c[m]erely inspecting those parts of the turntable that came into view . . . would not have constituted an independent search, because it would have produced no additional invasion of [the respondent\u2019s] privacy interest.\u201d Id., 325. Thus, in <em>Hicks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>it would not have been improper for the officer to have read and recorded the serial numbers on the components if he would had been able to do so without moving those components to obtain access to the serial numbers. Thus, of critical importance for fourth amendment purposes is \u201cthe distinction between <em>looking </em>at a suspicious object in plain view and <em>moving </em>it even a few inches . . . (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In contrast to the officer\u2019s actions in <em>Hicks, </em>Amato\u2019s reading of portions of the note that he discovered in the glove compartment was not an additional invasion of the defendant\u2019s privacy rights. The note was in plain view when Amato came upon it in the glove compartment during the execution of a lawful search, and he was entitled to examine it to determine whether it contained evidence subject to seizure under the authority of the first search warrant. Upon commencing that examination, Amato immediately ascertained that the note contained other incriminating evidence, and, therefore, was justified in seizing it. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Escobar, </em>805 F.2d 68, 70, 72 (2d Cir. 1986) (permissible for government agents executing arrest warrant at defendant\u2019s residence to seize papers in plain view that contained code words recognized as pertaining to drug conspiracy); <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>State, </em>683 N.E.2d 557, 558 (Ind. 1997) (police executing search warrant properly seized calendar1 containing suspect\u2019s nickname under plain view doctrine); <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrei, </em>574 A.2d 295, 296-98 (Me. 1990) (officer conducting lawful search properly examined four lines of diary that were in plain view); <em>Commonwealth v. D'Amour, </em>428 Mass. 725, 730-32, 704 N.E.2d 1166 (1999) (police executing search warrant properly seized incriminating letter under plain view doctrine); see also <em>United States v. Menon, </em>24 F.3d 550, 563 (3d Cir. 1994) (permissible for government agents to review documents \u201ccarefully enough\u201d to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>whether they were among class of documents subject to seizure under terms of search warrant). Consequently, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress with respect to the note found in the glove compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Finally, the defendant claims that the third handwritten note, which was discovered under the front passenger seat of the defendant\u2019s car, was seized unlawfully. He contends that, although the note was seized pursuant to the second search warrant, its seizure nevertheless was improper as aproduct, or \u201cfruit,\u201d of the alleged, prior police illegality; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>246 Conn. 547, 553, 716 A.2d 101 (1998) (under exclusionary rule, evidence will be suppressed if found to be product of prior unlawful police conduct); namely, the seizure of the first two notes and the reading of the third note prior to obtaining the second search warrant. As we concluded previously, however, the seizure of the first two notes was lawful. Consequently, the seizure of the third note pursuant to the second search warrant was constitutional. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the third note also must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to introduce evidence of his refusal to continue answering questions posed to him by the police prior to his arrest, but after he had been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The defendant contends that this impropriety constituted a violation of his rights under the fifth<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> amendments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>United States constitution and, further, that the error was harmful, thereby entitling him to a new trial. Although we agree with the defendant that the state should not have been permitted to elicit testimony regarding his termination of the police interview, we nevertheless conclude that he is not entitled to a new trial because the impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Several hours after the shooting, the defendant was admitted to Cedarcrest Hospital, a state psychiatric facility in Newington.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> On the day of admission to Cedarcrest Hospital, Detective Paul Lombardo, along with Detective Sergeant Howard Beeler, both of the Manchester police department, interviewed the defendant for approximately thirty minutes in an office at Cedarcrest Hospital. At that time, the defendant was not in police custody and was free to leave the office at any time. Lombardo began the interview by reading the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights from a card issued by the Manchester police department. The defendant stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>understood his rights and agreed to speak with the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In response to Lombardo\u2019s questions, the defendant denied that he had killed the victim. The defendant admitted that he had purchased a twenty-two caliber rifle at Wal-Mart, but stated that he had sold it several days earlier to a person in Hartford. The defendant, however, was evasive in his response to Lombardo\u2019s questions regarding the identity of the person to whom he had sold the rifle and when he had done so. The defendant also admitted that, on one occasion, while riding with the victim in her car, he had placed a BB gun to her side and jokingly said, \u201c[s]ee how easy it is for someone to hijack you.\u201d Thereafter, Lombardo asked the defendant whether the killing of the victim had been premeditated or a crime of passion. The defendant did not respond verbally to Lombardo\u2019s question, but tears welled up in his eyes, he began to shake and signaled for a nurse to terminate the interview. The police then asked the defendant no further questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The defendant contends that the testimony regarding his refusal to continue answering Lombardo\u2019s questions violated his right to due process under a line of cases beginning with <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201cIn <em>Doyle . . </em>. the United States Supreme Court held that the impeachment of a defendant through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process. The court based its holding in two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is insolubly ambiguous and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important, it observed that while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial. [Id.], 617-19. The court . . . reaffirmed <em>Doyle\u2019s </em>reasoning in <em>Wainwright </em>v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284, 290, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986), in which it held that the defendant\u2019s silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings could not be used at trial to rebut his defense of insanity. The court reasoned: The point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity. Id., 292. Consistent with this rationale, the court has concluded that [the] use at trial of silence prior to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process. Fletcher <em>v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, [607] 102 S. Ct. 1309, 71 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1982) (postarrest silence); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, [240] 100 S. Ct. 2124, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1980) (prearrest silence); see <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 291 n.6.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 465-66, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">In <em>Plourde, </em>we concluded that <em>\u201cDoyle </em>applies whenever <em>Miranda </em>warnings have been given regardless of an arrest or custody.\u201d Id., 466. As we stated in <em>Plourde, \u201cDoyle </em>and subsequent cases have . . . made clear that breaching the implied assurance of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings is an affront to the fundamental fairness that the Due Process Clause requires. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, [474 U.S.] 291; see <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 763, 107 S. Ct. 3102, 97 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1987). The unfairness of using a defendant\u2019s silence following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>Miranda </em>warnings is not mitigated by the absence of custody. <em>Miranda </em>warnings inform a person of his right to remain silent and assure him, at least implicitly, that his silence will not be used against him. . . . <em>Doyle </em>bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 291; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>supra, [455 U.S.] 606; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 407-408, 100 S. Ct. 2180, 65 L. Ed. 2d 222, reh. denied, 448 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 27, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1173 (1980). Custody is therefore not a prerequisite to a <em>Doyle </em>violation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 467; see also <em>State v. Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 710, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 318-19, 613 A.2d 242 (1992). Furthermore, although <em>Doyle </em>prohibits <em>impeachment </em>of a defendant with evidence of his post-Miranda silence, we expressly stated in <em>Plourde </em>that it also is fundamentally unfair, and, therefore, a deprivation of due process, for the state to use evidence of a defendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence \u201cas <em>affirmative proof </em>at trial . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 468; see also <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 292 n.8 (noting that state\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence as affirmative proof in its case-in-chief gives rise to \u201cconstitutional violation [that] might . . . be especially egregious because, unlike <em>Doyle, </em>there [is] no risk that exclusion of the evidence [would] merely provide a shield for perjury\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Szymaniak, </em>934 F.2d 434, 439 (2d Cir. 1991) (\u201c[i]t follows [from <em>Doyle] </em>that statements of a suspect\u2019s intent to remain silent [after he has been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings] are inadmissible in the government\u2019s case-in-chief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">This case is indistinguishable from <em>Plourde. </em>In <em>Plourde, </em>the police gave the defendant, Galen Plourde, who was a suspect in a murder investigation, <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>warnings even though he was not in custody. <em>State </em>v. Plourde, supra, 208 Conn. 464. In its case-in-chief, the state adduced evidence that the police thereafter asked Plourde if he wished to give a statement about the homicide. See id. Plourde responded that he was willing to listen to what the police had to say. Id. After the police had detailed for Plourde the evidence linking him to the crime, tears welled up in his eyes and he began to shake. Id., 464-65. Plourde indicated that he would give a statement to the police, but stated \u201cthat he wanted to call his lawyer [first] to see if he could get the best deal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 465. We concluded that Plourde\u2019s conduct clearly demonstrated his intent to invoke his right to remain silent; id.; and that the state\u2019s use of Plourde\u2019s silence as evidence in its case-in-chief violated Plourde\u2019s right to due process under <em>Doyle </em>and its progeny. Id., 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In the present case, the police advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to interviewing him and prior to his arrest. Although the defendant initially responded to Lombardo\u2019s questions, he subsequently decided to stop answering questions and terminated the interview. There is no question that the defendant, in concluding the interview, was invoking his right to remain silent.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Consequently, the evidence adduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the state regarding the defendant\u2019s refusal to answer any further questions was fundamentally unfair and thus in violation of his rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>\u201cDoyle </em>violations are, however, subject to harmless error analysis. . . . The harmless error doctrine is rooted in the fundamental purpose of the criminal justice system, namely, to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent. . . . Therefore, whether an error is harmful depends on its impact on the trier of fact and the result of the case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201c[B]efore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The state bears the burden of demonstrating that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . That determination must be made in light of the entire record [including the strength of the state\u2019s case without the evidence admitted in error]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\u201cA <em>Doyle </em>violation may, in a particular case, be so insignificant that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible question or comment upon a defendant\u2019s silence following a <em>Miranda </em>warning. Under such circumstances, the state\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s <em>[post-Miranda] </em>silence does not constitute reversible error. . . . The [error] has similarly been [found to be harmless] where a prosecutor does not focus upon or highlight the defendant\u2019s silence in his cross-examination and closing remarks and where the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not strike at the jugular of the defendant\u2019s story. . . . The cases wherein the error has been found to be prejudicial disclose repetitive references to the defendant\u2019s silence, reemphasis of the fact on closing argument, and extensive, strongly-worded argument suggesting a connection between the defendant\u2019s silence and his guilt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>231 Conn. 195, 211-13, 647 A.2d 342 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1099, 115 S. Ct. 770, 130 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We conclude that the <em>Doyle </em>violation in the present case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor did not attempt repeatedly to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence. Nor did the prosecutor mention that evidence during his closing argument. Instead, the prosecutor focused on the state\u2019s strong case against the defendant, including the incriminating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>responses that the defendant gave to the police before terminating the interview with Lombardo.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Furthermore, the other evidence introduced by the state overwhelmingly demonstrated the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The victim\u2019s husband identified the defendant as the perpetrator, indicating that he was \u201c100 percent\u201d certain of his identification.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Prior to the murder, the defendant had told the manager of the shoe department at Wal-Mart that he was attracted to the victim and made statements of a sexual nature about her. In addition, the defendant frequently visited Wal-Mart on his days off so that he could be near the victim when she was working. On one occasion, the victim gave the defendant a ride home, and the defendant placed a BB gun to her side and told her that it would be easy for someone to \u201chijack\u201d her. Moreover, in the months leading up to the murder, the defendant spoke to other Wal-Mart employees about killing someone and not getting caught.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The evidence also established that the defendant persuaded Salvatore Cavaliere, a manager in the sporting goods department at Wal-Mart, to place a special order for a .22 caliber Norinco rifle, a weapon that Wal-Mart; generally did not carry. When the rifle arrived at the store approximately one week later, Cavaliere did not enter the gun into the store\u2019s inventory records and did not enter the sale of the rifle into the gun logbook when the defendant purchased it on April 26,1996. In addition, the defendant did not use his employee discount number when he paid for the rifle, presumably to leave no indication of his identity on the cash register tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>In addition, on the day before the murder, Cavahere and a coworker ran into the defendant at a Circuit City store and observed that he had beige cream or lotion on his face that made his skin appear lighter. On that occasion, Cavaiiere gave the defendant a ride to the comer of Slater Road and Tolland Turnpike, the location at which the victim resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The jury also heard evidence regarding the seizure of the three handwritten notes from the defendant\u2019s vehicle, all of which directly implicated the defendant in a kidnapping and murder plot. In addition, the police found other incriminating evidence in the defendant\u2019s car, including a knife, a can of Mace, latex gloves, duct tape and an ice pick. The state also adduced evidence that, during a search of the defendant\u2019s residence, the police found three, .22 caliber shell casings, beige makeup, a piece of paper containing the victim\u2019s social security number and an invoice, dated March 25, 1996, for a manual entitled \u201cHit Man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Moreover, on August 24,1996, the .22 caliber Norinco rifle that the defendant had purchased shortly before the shooting was recovered in Middletown.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A ballistics expert testified that the seven shell casings found at the murder scene all had been fired from that rifle. In addition, ballistics tests revealed that the three casings found by the police at the defendant\u2019s home also had been fired from that same rifle. Finally, the defendant, while incarcerated pending his trial, told a cellmate, Jeremiah Lopez, numerous details about the crime and the victim. Among other things, the defendant told Lopez that he had purchased the murder weapon at Wal-Mart, that he had shot the victim as she sat in her Jeep in the driveway of her home, that the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>husband came outside immediately after the shooting and that the police had seized notes from his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and in view of the fact that the objectionable testimony was not repeated and the fact that the prosecutor did not seek to capitalize on that testimony during closing arguments, we are satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the <em>Doyle </em>violation in this case affected the outcome of the defendant\u2019s trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under <em>Golding </em>and thus is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to elicit testimony from a mental health worker regarding a statement that the defendant had made to a third party after he had been admitted to Cedarcrest Hospital. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state\u2019s use of that evidence was improper because the defendant\u2019s statement is protected from disclosure under the psychiatrist-patient privilege. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d et seq.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude the testimony of Elaine Janas, a mental health assistant at Cedarcrest Hospital. The trial court conducted a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion outside the presence of the jury. At the hearing, Janas testified that, pursuant to a psychiatrist\u2019s instructions, she was assigned to monitor the defendant on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u201cone-to-one\u201d basis on May 1, 1996, the day after the homicide. Pursuant to those instructions, Janas was to remain within \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d of the defendant at all times and to take notes regarding the defendant\u2019s activities every fifteen minutes. Janas further testified that \u201cone-to-one\u201d supervision is ordered for a patient\u2019s protection, usually when that patient is suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Between 7 and 8 p.m., on the evening of May 1, the defendant made a series of telephone calls to people outside of the hospital while Janas was monitoring the defendant in accordance with the instructions she had been given. During one such telephone conversation, Janas overheard the defendant say to the party on the other end of the telephone line: \u201cDon\u2019t forget I was with you last night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The defendant claimed that Janas\u2019 testimony was barred by the psychiatrist-patient privilege. The state, which sought to use the defendant\u2019s statement as evidence of the defendant\u2019s attempt to concoct a false alibi, maintained that the statement did not fall within the scope of communications protected by that privilege. The trial court agreed with the state, concluding that the statement was not a protected communication for purposes of \u00a7 52-146d (2); see footnote 33 of this opinion; because it was in no way related to the defendant\u2019s diagnosis or treatment and because it was not a communication made to a psychiatrist or someone acting under the supervision of a psychiatrist who was engaged in the defendant\u2019s diagnosis or treatment. The trial court consequently denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, and Janas thereafter testified in the presence of the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s statement. On appeal, the defendant renews his claim that, because Janas was assigned by a psychiatrist to observe him and to record his behavior, anything that the defendant said within her earshot necessarily related to his diagnosis and treatment. We are not persuaded by this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u201c[A]s with any claim of privilege, a statutory privilege has the effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder .... Accordingly, although a statutory privilege must be applied so as to effectuate its purpose, it is to be applied cautiously and with circumspection because it impedes the truth-seeking function of the adjudicative process.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hospital, </em>251 Conn. 790, 819, 742 A.2d 322 (1999). We previously have stated that the purpose of the psychiatrist-patient privilege is to safeguard \u201cconfidential communications or records of a patient seeking diagnosis and treatment\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 379, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988); so as \u201cto protect [the] therapeutic relationship.\u201d <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>190 Conn. 813, 819, 462 A.2d 1060 (1983). It therefore is axiomatic that \u201c[communications that bear no relationship to the purpose for which the privilege was enacted do not obtain shelter under the statute and are admissible [under] the normal rules of evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Under General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e (a), all \u201ccommunications and records as defined in section 52-146d shall be confidential\u201d and, except in certain circumstances not applicable in this case, \u201cno person may disclose or transmit any [such] communications and records or the substance or any part or any resume thereof . . . without the consent of the patient or his authorized representative.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e (a). General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2) defines \u201c \u2018[communications and records\u2019 \u201d as \u201call oral and written communications and records thereof relating to diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s mental condition between the patient and a psychiatrist, or between a member of the patient\u2019s family and a psychiatrist, or between any of such persons and a person participating under the supervision of a psychiatrist in the accomplishment of the objectives of diagnosis and treatment, wherever made, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">As the trial court concluded, the communication at issue was not between the defendant and a psychiatrist or Janas, but, rather, between the defendant and an unknown third party located outside of the hospital. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s instruction to that third party not to \u201cforget [he] was with [the third party] last night\u201d bore no relation to the defendant\u2019s diagnosis or treatment. The mere fact that Janas was assigned to observe the defendant for his own protection does not transform the defendant\u2019s statement into a protected communication under the psychiatrist-patient privilege. A contrary determination would extend that privilege well beyond the plain statutory language that defines it. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly permitted the state to elicit Janas\u2019 testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly quashed a subpoena duces tecum issued by the defendant, seeking certain materials related to a lawsuit filed by the victim\u2019s husband and the victim\u2019s estate against Wal-Mart. The defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request that the court conduct an in camera review of those materials violated his rights under the compulsory process and confrontation clauses of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This claim also is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The record reveals the following facts relevant to this issue. Subsequent to the victim\u2019s death, the victim\u2019s husband, acting as executor of the victim\u2019s estate, filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>a lawsuit against Wal-Mart alleging that Wal-Mart had failed to follow proper procedures in its sale of the Norinco rifle that was used to shoot and kill the victim. The defendant issued a subpoena duces tecum to Richard Kenny, the attorney representing the victim\u2019s estate in that lawsuit, seeking all materials in Kenny\u2019s file regarding the lawsuit.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Kenny moved to quash the subpoena, claiming that the materials sought by the defendant were protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. In response, the defendant claimed that his \u201csubstantial need\u201d for the materials \u201coutweigh[ed] any claims that [the victim\u2019s husband] might have in protecting the confidentiality of his civil file . . . .\u201d The defendant then requested that the trial court conduct an in camera review of Kenny\u2019s file to determine whether it contained any materials that would be subject to disclosure. The trial court granted the motion to quash, concluding that the subpoena was \u201coverly broad\u201d and, further, that the defendant had failed to demonstrate a need sufficient to warrant the \u201cfishing expedition\u201d that an in camera review of Kenny\u2019s file necessarily would entail. The court, however, indicated that it would reconsider its ruling if the defendant thereafter made a more \u201cspecific and precise\u201d request regarding materials in Kenny\u2019s possession that the defendant had reason to believe were necessary to the preparation of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to conduct an in camera review of the materials in Kenny\u2019s file. Specifically, the defendant claims that such a review was required because it could have led to the discovery of information, such as inconsistent statements or other evidence tending to exculpate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>defendant, that would be critical to his defense.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The defendant therefore asserts that we should remand the case to the trial court for an in camera review of Kenny\u2019s file.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The state counters that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting the motion to quash. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The defendant failed to specify the information likely to have been in Kenny\u2019s file that would have aided the defendant in presenting his defense or in cross-examining one or more of the state\u2019s witnesses. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the defendant merely asserted that an in camera review of <em>all </em>of the materials in Kenny\u2019s file might have yielded something useful to him. \u201cA subpoena is an appropriate process for the production of documents that are relevant to the matter before the court. ... It may not be used, however, for the purpose of conducting a fishing expedition into the papers of a party or a stranger to the proceedings. . . . The subpoena should be sufficiently particularized so that the documents sought may be readily identified. The onus should not be placed on the court to inspect numerous documents for the purpose of culling out those papers which may be relevant to the matter on trial. If the subpoena on its face is too broad and sweeping, it is subject to a motion to quash.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 179, 474 A.2d 795 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 766, 631 A.2d 309 (1993) (\u201c[a] criminal defendant does not have the right to conduct a general fishing expedition into [privileged or sensitive] records\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 172, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981) (same). Moreover, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s invitation to do so, the defendant never sought to narrow the scope of the subpoena or to identify with greater particularity what information necessary to his defense likely would have been contained in Kenny\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Finally, the defendant made no showing that the civil lawsuit against Wal-Mart related to any disputed issue in the defendant\u2019s criminal case. As characterized by defense counsel during the hearing on the motion to quash, the civil lawsuit alleged \u201cfaulty procedures on the part of Wal-Mart with respect to the sale of firearms in general and [with respect] to the specific [firearm] alleged to have been purchased by [the defendant] . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It was undisputed, however, that Cavaliere had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>not followed proper procedures when he had sold the Norinco rifle to the defendant; indeed, Cavaliere so testified at trial. Moreover, the defendant admitted to the police that he had purchased the rifle from Cavaliere. Under these circumstances, there simply was insufficient reason for the trial court to have undertaken an in camera inspection of the contents of Kenny\u2019s file. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 766 (preliminary showing of relevance prerequisite to court\u2019s in camera examination of privileged records); <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 457, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992) (same). We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly failed to conduct such an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt in violation of his federal constitutional right to a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant challenges the following portions of the trial court\u2019s instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt: (1) \u201c[a] reasonable doubt is not a doubt . . . suggested by the ingenuity of counsel\u201d; (2) \u201c[a] reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason, not on the mere possibility of innocence\u201d; (3) \u201c[a] reasonable doubt . . . is areal doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or the lack of evidence\u201d; and (4) \u201c[a reasonable doubt is] a doubt for which you can, in your own mind, conscientiously give a reason.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We reject the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>claim.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">As the defendant acknowledges, we recently have rejected constitutional challenges to instructional language identical in all material respects to the instructional language in those portions of the trial court\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt that the defendant claims were improper. In the case of each such challenge, we concluded that the language, when considered in the context of the court\u2019s reasonable doubt charge as a whole, did not dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Velasco, 253 Conn. 210, 249, 751 A.2d 800 (2000) (rejecting constitutional challenge to instruction that reasonable doubt is \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 560-61 (rejecting constitutional challenge to instruction that reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>doubt \u201cis a doubt based upon reason, not on the mere possibility of innocence\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 816-18, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998) (rejecting constitutional challenge to instruction that reasonable doubt is doubt \u201cfor which you can in your own mind conscientiously give a reason\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 504-505, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S.

Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional impropriety must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for felony murder.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Although the defendant concedes that there was sufficient evidence to establish that he had attempted to kidnap the victim,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> he contends that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that the victim\u2019s death occurred \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 an attempted kidnapping because the victim was killed intentionally,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and, therefore, any attempt to kidnap the victim must have been abandoned prior to the killing. In essence, the defendant interprets the \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 language of \u00a7 53a-54c, our felony murder statute; see footnote 2 of this opinion; to require that the death of the victim somehow advance or promote the achievement of the underlying felony, in this case, the attempted kidnapping. The defendant misconstrues that language and, therefore, cannot prevail on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>ted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 435-36, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The jury reasonably could have found that the defendant approached the victim\u2019s Jeep intending to kidnap her, and that he was attempting to restrain and abduct her when she resisted his efforts by sounding the horn and activating the garage door opener. The jury also reasonably could have inferred that the defendant shot and killed the victim because he was unable immediately to overcome her resistance. We conclude that these facts were sufficient to satisfy the requirement under our felony murder statute that the victim\u2019s death occur \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u201d the attempted kidnapping.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">\u201cFelony murder occurs when, in the course of and in furtherance of another crime, one of the participants in that crime causes the death of a person who is not a participant in the crime. . . .

We previously have defined the phrase \u201cin the course of\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 53a-54c to include \u201cthe period immediately before or after the actual commission of the crime . . . .\u201d Id. The jury reasonably could have found that the attempt to kidnap the victim did not terminate until her death. In light of the close temporal proximity of the attempted kidnapping and the victim\u2019s death, the jury reasonably could have concluded that her death occurred <em>in the course of </em>the attempted kidnapping for purposes of \u00a7 53a-54c.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he phrase \u2018in furtherance of was intended to impose the requirement of a relationship between the underlying felony and the homicide beyond that of mere causation in fact, similar to the concept of proximate cause in the law of torts. Primarily its purpose was to limit the liability of a person whose accomplice in one of the specified felonies has performed the homicidal act to those circumstances which were within the contemplation of the confederates to the undertaking . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Young, supra, [191 Conn.] 642. When . . . the participants have kidnapped the victim at gunpoint, a jury may find that it is within the contemplation of those participants that the victim might be shot and killed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Gomez, supra, 225 Conn. 352. Certainly, therefore, when, as in the present case, the defendant attempts to kidnap the victim at gunpoint, the jury reasonably may find that it was within his contemplation that the victim might be shot and killed, either accidentally or intentionally. Thus, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the murder occurred <em>in furtherance </em>o/the attempted kidnapping. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim of evidentiary insufficiency with respect to his felony murder conviction is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury regarding the elements of \u00a7 53-202k and that, as a result, the jury made no express finding as to whether the state had proven that the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of a class A, B or C felony in violation of \u00a7 53-202k. See footnote 4 of this opinion. The defendant further claims that this impropriety violated his constitutional right to due process,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and that, consequently, the case must be remanded to the trial court with direction to vacate the five year consecutive sentence imposed by that court pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k. Although we agree with the defendant that the juiy and not the trial court must make the factual determinations required under \u00a7 53-202k, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding the elements of \u00a7 53-202k was harmless. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence imposed under \u00a7 53-202k must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Prior to jury selection, the state filed a \u201cnotice of penalty enhancement pursuant to . . . \u00a7 53-202k . . . .\u201d After the jury rendered its verdict of guilty on the murder and felony murder charges, the state, at the sentencing hearing, sought a five year sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>tence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k based on the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm during the commission of those offenses. The defendant claimed that the court could not impose any additional sentence under \u00a7 53-202k because the jury never was asked to determine whether the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of the crimes. The trial court concluded that the jury, by virtue of its determination that the defendant had committed murder, a class A felony, also necessarily had found that the state had satisfied the first requirement of \u00a7 53-202k, namely, that the defendant had committed a class A, B or C felony. The trial court also concluded that, inasmuch as the murder count expressly alleged that the defendant had caused the death of the victim \u201cby shooting [her] with a firearm,\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the murder count necessarily included a finding that the state had satisfied the second requirement of \u00a7 53-202k, namely, that the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of that offense. The court then sentenced the defendant to a five year term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, to run consecutively to the sixty year prison term that the court had imposed on the defendant\u2019s murder and merged felony murder convictions.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 214, a case that was decided during the pendency of this appeal, we held that the jury, and not the trial court, is required to determine whether a defendant has used a firearm in the commission of a class A, B or C felony for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>poses of \u00a7 53-202k.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the jury was not expressly asked to make such a determination in this case. There is no question, however, that the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant had committed murder, a class A felony, necessarily satisfied the requirement of \u00a7 53-202k that the defendant commit a class A, B or C felony. Because, however, the use of a firearm is not an element of the crime of murder; see footnote 1 of this opinion; the jury lawfully could have returned a finding of guilty on the murder charge without also having found that the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of that crime. In this case, though, the information expressly alleged that the defendant intentionally had caused the victim\u2019s death \u201cby shooting [the victim] with a firearm . . . .\u201d Moreover, the court, in instructing the jury on the elements of murder, made express reference to the defendant\u2019s alleged use of a firearm: \u201cThe first [element of the crime of murder] is that the defendant had the intent to cause the death of another person, in this case, [the victim] .... The second element is that the defendant, acting with the intent to cause the death of [the victim], caused the death of that person, <em>in this case by shooting her with a firearm.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, a plausible case may be made that the jury\u2019s finding of guilt on the murder count necessarily included a finding that the defendant had used a firearm in the commission of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We need not decide that question, however, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999), in which the court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>a jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if \u201ca reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 17; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 232; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 469, 678 A.2d 910 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In this case, the trial court failed to instruct the jury on either of the two elements of \u00a7 53-202k. As we have indicated, however, the jury necessarily found that the defendant had committed a class A felony by virtue of finding him guilty of such a felony, namely, murder. See footnote 1 of this opinion. With respect to the second element of \u00a7 53-202k, the defendant did not contest the fact, established by incontrovertible evidence, that the victim had been shot repeatedly in the head with a firearm and had died as a result of wounds caused by that firearm. Indeed, in closing argument, the defendant acknowledged that the victim had been \u201cbrutally murdered.\u201d The defendant sought to convince the jury, rather, that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that <em>he </em>was the shooter. Because the defendant did not dispute the fact that the victim\u2019s fatal wounds were inflicted by a firearm, and because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the victim\u2019s murder, a class A felony, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding the elements of \u00a7 53-202k was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person ....</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">\u201c(c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, sexual assault in the first degree, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

Ed. 2d 1062 (1991), in which we concluded that the proper disposition of a case involving multiple convictions for a single homicide is for the trial court to combine those convictions and sentence the defendant for one of them. Thus, in the present case, the court combined the defendant\u2019s murder and felony murder convictions and sentenced the defendant for the murder conviction only. Under this procedure, \u201c [i]f the [defendant\u2019s] murder [conviction is] later invalidated for any reason and the defect at issue does not affect [his conviction for felony murder, that conviction] would be resuscitated and the defendant could be punished for [that conviction].\u201d Id., 725.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b719-11\"> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and what is now Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\"> <em>Miranda </em>v.

Although the record is adequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim, he cannot prevail under the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>because the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\"> The defendant initially went to the emergency room at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford, where he was admitted.

Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973). As the United States Supreme Court has stated, however, <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings protect [a defendant\u2019s privilege not to be compelled to be a witness against himself in any respect] by ensuring that a suspect knows that he may choose not to talk to law enforcement officers, to talk only with counsel present, <em>or to discontinue talking at any time.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 574, 107 S. Ct. 851, 93 L. Ed. 2d 954 (1987); see also <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 384 U.S. 479 (\u201c[A suspect in police custody] must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. <em>Opportunity to exercise theserights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation.\" </em>[Emphasis added.]). Consequently, even if the defendant was not expressly advised of his right to stop answering questions at any time, that right is implicit in any proper rendition of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Therefore, irrespective of the precise wording of the warnings given to the defendant, he was entitled to rely on the fact that his decision to terminate the interview with Lombardo could not be used against him by the state in a subsequent trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The state contends that this case is distinguishable from <em>Plourde </em>because, in <em>Plourde, </em>the defendant refused to answer any questions, whereas in this case, the defendant agreed to be interviewed and responded to a number of Lombardo\u2019s questions before terminating the interview. In support of this contention, the state relies on <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 447 U.S. 404, and a decision of this court, <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 186, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986), that followed the holding of <em>Anderson that Doyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination of a defendant who, upon being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, provides the police with one version of the facts and then, at trial, testifies to a different version. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 408 (\u2018 <em>\u2018Doyle </em>bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. <em>But Doyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements. Such questioning makes no unfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been induced to remain silent. As to the subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not remained sEent at aE.\u201d); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 185 <em>Q'Doyle </em>... is not apphcable . . . [when] the defendant [does] not remain sEent after he [is] arrested and advised of his rights\u201d). Indeed, in such circumstances, it is permissible to cross-examine a defendant about detaEs that he or she may have omitted from responses to police questioning because the defendant, having agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>to speak with police about the subject matter of the crime, cannot later complain that he had failed to mention those details in the exercise of his fifth amendment right to remain silent. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 186. <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Casey </em>are inapposite, however, because, unlike the defendants in those cases, the defendant in this case, after answering several questions, terminated his interview with Lombardo. Under <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Casey, </em>therefore, the state would have been free to cross-examine the defendant, if he had testified, regarding his responses to Lombardo\u2019s questions prior to his termination of the interview. Indeed, the state used those responses against the defendant in its case-in-chief, and the defendant has not challenged the propriety of the state\u2019s affirmative use of that evidence. See footnote 28 of this opinion. Under <em>Doyle, </em>however, the state was prohibited from eliciting testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence upon terminating the interview with <em>Lombardo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The state also suggests that Lombardo\u2019s testimony with respect to the defendant\u2019s refusal to answer any additional questions was admissible to show \u201cthe investigative effort made by the police and the sequence of events as they unfolded . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 490, 556 A.2d 154 (1989). It is true that we have allowed the use of evidence of a defendant\u2019s invocation of his fifth amendment right in certain limited and exceptional circumstances. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 183; <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>177 Conn. 487, 496, 418 A.2d 870, vacated on other grounds, 444 U.S. 893, 100 S. Ct. 199, 62 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1979). We nevertheless have cautioned that \u201cevidence of such an investigative effort must ... be narrowly limited in light of <em>Doyle.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 490. We have stated, moreover, that \u201c[s]uch evidence is impermissible if it was offered to impeach the testimony of the defendant in any way.\u201d Id., 491. It also is impermissible, therefore, to use such evidence affirmatively against an accused, as the state did in this case. It is undisputed that the state adduced evidence of the defendant\u2019s termination of his interview with Lombardo and the defendant\u2019s physical reaction to the question that apparently prompted him to do so, for the purpose of demonstrating the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. Indeed, the nature and scope of the police investigation were not at issue in this case, at least with respect to Lombardo\u2019s interview of the defendant. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s claim that Lombardo\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s termination of the interview was admissible as evidence of the investigative effort made by the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\"> Although most of the assailant\u2019s face was covered, at the time of the shooting, by a snug, white mask or white cream, the victim\u2019s husband had seen the defendant walk by the Isleibs\u2019 home nine days earlier wearing white facial makeup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> The recovered Norinco rifle bore the same serial number as the Norinco rifle that the defendant had purchased at Wal-Mart several days prior to the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e provides: \u201cDisclosure of communications, (a) All communications and records as defined in section 52-146d shall be confidential and shall be subject to the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146j, inclusive.

You can arrive at the real meaning of it by emphasizing the word \u2018reasonable.\u2019 A reasonable doubt is a doubt for which there exists a reasonable basis arising out of the evidence or the lack of evidence. It\u2019s a doubt which is something more than a guess or surmise. It\u2019s not a conjecture or a fanciful doubt. A reasonable doubt is not a doubt which is raised by someone simply for the sake of raising doubis, nor is it a doubt suggested by the ingenuity of counsel or any of the jurors which is not justified by the evidence or the lack of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">\u201cA reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason, not on the mere possibility of innocence. It\u2019s a doubt for which you can, in your own mind, conscien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tiously give a reason. A reasonable doubt, in other words, is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or the lack of evidence. It\u2019s the kind of doubt which, in the serious affairs which concern you in everyday life, you pay heed to and attention to.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\u201cNow, of course, absolute certainty in the affairs of life is almost never attainable, and the law does not require absolute certainty on the part of the jury before you return a verdict of guilty. The state does not have to prove guilt beyond all doubt or to a mathematical or absolute certainty. What the law does require, however, is that, after hearing all the evidence, if there is something in that evidence or lack of evidence which leaves in the minds of the jury, as reasonable men and women, a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, then the accused must be given the benefit of that doubt and acquitted. Any conclusion reasonably to be drawn from the evidence which is consistent with the innocence of the accused must prevail. If there is no reasonable doubt, then the accused must be found guilty. The test is one of reasonable doubt, a doubt based upon reason and common sense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\"> The defendant did not object to the instructional language that he challenges on appeal and, therefore, seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).
