Ed. 2d 598 (1986), it admitted a prior written statement that a state\u2019s witness had made to the police; and (5) the state failed to present sufficient evidence that the defendant had intended to kill the victim when he fired a shotgun at him, and that, in the alternative, if the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for attempted murder, there was insufficient evidence that the defendant simultaneously had intended to cause physical injury short of death when he fired the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s claims regarding the insufficiency of the evidence of his mental state. We agree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>however, with the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court impermissibly allowed the substitution of an alternate juror during deliberations and that such substitution requires a new trial. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction and order a new trial. Because of our disposition of this issue, we need not address the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 4,1996, Tyrell Boyd was riding in a motor vehicle driven by his friend Daniel Henry. At approximately 6:30 p.m., Henry parked his vehicle on Bedford Street, near the intersection of Bedford and Albany Avenue in Hartford, so that he could purchase cigarettes. When Henry came out of the store, he got into a heated conversation with someone he knew as \u201cLucius.\u201d When Lucius turned toward Boyd and asked him what he was looking at, Boyd got out of the vehicle and a fight began. A crowd of a dozen or more persons gathered around, and someone gave Lucius a baseball bat, which he proceeded to use to chase Boyd around Henry\u2019s car. As Boyd attempted to avoid Lucius by keeping Henry\u2019s car- between them, he saw the defendant raise a shotgun and, from a distance of ten to twelve feet, fire it at him, striking Boyd\u2019s left upper thigh. Boyd stumbled into the car and Henry proceeded to drive him to St. Francis Hospital. When they arrived at the hospital, Boyd was bleeding profusely and had no blood pressure. The shotgun blast had blown away skin, muscle and tissue, had destroyed a major vein in Boyd\u2019s leg and had tom open a ten centimeter section of his femoral artery. Boyd required immediate surgery and a vein from his right leg had to be harvested for use in his left leg. Boyd received ten units of blood and other blood products during the operation. He was placed in the intensive care unit, and, after four additional surgeries, was released. Thereafter, his wounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>created a substantial risk of death and a serious impairment to his health.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Following his release from the hospital, Boyd, who knew the defendant prior to the shooting, selected the defendant\u2019s photograph from an array of eight photographs shown to him by the police. He was positive of his identification. Approximately six months before trial, Boyd saw the defendant on the street, at which time the defendant offered to pay him not to appear in court. Additional facts will be provided as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Because the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of evidence, if successful, would necessitate the entry of a judgment of acquittal; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>37 Conn. App. 500, 507, 657 A.2d 650 (1995), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 237 Conn. 633, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996); we address this claim first. In the present case, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for attempted murder. In particular, he asserts that the evidence does not support a finding that, when he shot the victim, he bore a specific intent to kill rather than a specific intent to cause physical injury short of death. In the alternative, the defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for first degree assault. Specifically, he contends that if we conclude that the evidence supported the conclusion that, in firing a single gunshot, the defendant had intended to kill the victim, that same evidence could not also establish that he had acted with the specific intent to cause physical injury short of death, an essential element of the first degree assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">We first articulate the standard of review applicable to this claim. \u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency [of the evidence] claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We next define the essential element that is involved in this appeal and that is integral to the crimes of which the defendant stands convicted. Although \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-59 (a) (5) require the same mental state, namely, a specific intent; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 318-19, 630 A.2d 593 (1993); the particular specific intents required to violate these statutes are not identical. For each intent, a distinct conscious objective is sought. A verdict of guilty of attempted murder requires a finding of the specific intent to cause death. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49, 53a-54aand 53a-3 (11). A verdict of guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5), in contrast, requires a finding of the specific intent to cause physical injury. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5) and 53a-3 (3); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>237 Conn. 748, 753-54, 679 A.2d 920 (1996) (discussing \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-59 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">With this background in mind, we embark upon our analysis, beginning with the more serious charge. The specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder. \u201cTo act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 120, 622 A.2d 519 (1993). Because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available, intent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence. Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct, as well as from the cumulative effect of the circumstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. Id., 119. For example, \u201c[ijntent to cause death may be inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 127, 646 A.2d 169 (1994). This does not \u201crequire that each subordinate conclusion established by or inferred from evidence, or even from other inferences, be proved beyond a reasonable doubt [because this court has] held that a jury\u2019s factual inferences that support a guilty verdict need only be reasonable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 244, 627 A.2d 877 (1993). Nevertheless, because intent to cause the death of a person is an element of the crime; <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>supra, 120; that intent must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendant claims that the evidence that he had fired a shotgun <em>only once </em>into Boyd\u2019s upper thigh, from a distance of ten to twelve feet, does not support a finding that he had the specific intent to kill because the upper thigh is not a vital portion of the body. The state contends that, because there is no direct evidence that the defendant deliberately targeted Boyd\u2019s upper thigh, the jury reasonably might have concluded that he was simply a poor shooter who had actually targeted Boyd\u2019s torso generally. The state also argues that, even if the defendant had targeted Boyd\u2019s thigh, the jury reasonably could have concluded that he had the intent to kill. We agree with the state that regardless of whether the thigh was the defendant\u2019s target when he fired the shotgun, the jury\u2019s finding of intent to kill was well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The only direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s intended target came from Boyd, who testified that the defendant had \u201craised the rifle and shot me\u201d from a distance of approximately ten feet, and from Henry\u2019s written state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ment that he had seen the defendant fire one gunshot at Boyd. The defendant focuses on the fact that he shot Boyd only once. The defendant\u2019s failure to follow up by shooting Boyd again at closer range does not, however, necessitate a finding that the defendant did <em>not </em>intend to kill. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 305 (single shot from shotgun loaded with buckshot deadly enough to kill three people). At trial, the destructive nature of a shotgun was recounted by Louis Rodriguez, a Hartford police officer, who described the weapon\u2019s capacity to fire numerous projectiles at the same time that spread out as they travel. The farther the shooter is from the target, the wider the spread of the projectiles. Additionally, the nature of Boyd\u2019s very severe wound, including vein destruction and tissue damage, was described at trial by his physician. This evidence clearly supported a reasonable inference that the defendant had used a shotgun capable of firing several projectiles at Boyd with the intent to kill him. The deliberate firing of a shotgun capable of inflicting such massive damage, even if fired only once, is, under the facts of this case, essentially no different than firing another type of weapon several times in succession, and thus supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant intended to kill Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 21, 592 A.2d 149 (1991), we concluded that, although the evidence in that case permitted the inference that the defendant had intended only to injure the victim, \u201c[it] did not preclude the equally permissible inference that the defendant [had] intended to kill the victim . . . .\u201d The converse is equally true. As we have determined previously, under some circumstances, the intent to cause death and the intent to cause serious physical injury may be possessed simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>\u201cIn State </em>v. Hinton, [supra, 227 Conn. 305,] the defendant fired a single shotgun blast into a group of men, killing three and injuring another. Addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly accepted inconsistent verdicts of guilty on counts of attempted murder and assault in the first degree, we concluded that \u2018[i]t is clear that an assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (2) would be consistent with an attempted murder count in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a if [the actual victim] were the defendant\u2019s intended victim, because those statutory sections require intentional conduct.\u2019 Id., 318-19. Because the counts of attempted murder and intentional assault had been premised on a single act of violence, our approval of verdicts of guilty for both offenses with respect to the same victim and the same act necessarily acknowledged that a defendant may simultaneously possess the intent to cause death and the intent to cause serious physical injury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 753-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The defendant acknowledges that it is legally possible for a person to act both with an intent to kill and an intent to injure, but argues that the evidence in this case failed to prove that he \u201cactually acted with this complex mental state.\u201d The state makes two arguments in response. First, the state contends that the intent to kill necessarily encompasses the intent to injure. Second, the state argues that, even if the convictions of attempted murder and of assault require proof that the defendant simultaneously harbored independent intents to injure and to kill Boyd, such proof was provided to the jury. We are persuaded by the state\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">First, physical injury is defined as \u201cimpairment of physical condition or pain . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (3). It is difficult to imagine how the intent to cause death does not encompass an intent to injure when death is the ultimate impairment of one\u2019s physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>condition. Therefore, one cannot intend to cause death without necessarily intending to cause a physical injury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 403-405, 429 A.2d 919 (1980) (intent to cause death required for \u00a7 53a-54a includes intent to cause serious physical injuiy required for General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Second, even if we were to assume that the convictions of attempted murder and assault require proof that the defendant simultaneously harbored independent intents to injure and to kill Boyd, such evidence was established. It was entirely reasonable, under the facts of this case, for the jury to have found that the defendant intended to inflict physical injuiy to Boyd while also intending to cause his death. A defendant \u201c \u2018can intend both to cause the victim a . . . physical injury and to kill the victim. No temporal separation is required for the intent, but obviously one is required for the result. A possible factual scenario would have a defendant intending to kill a person but first causing serious physical injuiy or disfigurement, so as to make the victim suffer before dying. The intent is simultaneous, as the conscious objective to cause the requisite results is simultaneous, while the results themselves are separated by time.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 755, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>39 Conn. App. 18, 26, 663 A.2d 436 (1995) <em>(Foil, J., </em>dissenting). In this case, the jury reasonably could have inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct of firing the shotgun from ten to twelve feet away, thereby creating a substantial risk of death and serious impairment of Boyd\u2019s health, that he had possessed the intent, simultaneously, both to cause Boyd\u2019s death and to cause him physical injury during the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We next address the dispositive issue in this appeal, namely, whether General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c) (Rev. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>1999) allows the substitution of an alternate juror once deliberations have commenced, and if not, whether such an improper substitution requires reversal. We conclude that, pursuant to \u00a7 54-82h (c), alternate jurors must be dismissed when the case is submitted for deliberation to the jury, and therefore, they cannot be substituted for regular jurors thereafter. We also conclude that harmless error analysis is inappropriate for such an impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The following additional facts are pertinent to this issue. On Thursday, June 11, 1998, after the jury had been given its final instructions by the trial court, the jurors retired to the jury room to deliberate and the alternate jurors were sent home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury deliberated for the balance of the day without reaching a verdict. When proceedings resumed on Monday, June 15, 1998, after a three day hiatus, the trial court announced that the clerk had received a letter that morning from one of the jurors (juror M). In the letter, juror M expressed her concern continuing her service. Specifically, she stated that she was afraid she \u201cmight run into one of the parties involved in the case one day,\u201d that she had seen \u201cthe defendant and his friends outside of the courthouse,\u201d and that she was afraid of being followed. The trial court disclosed the letter to the counsel for the state and the defendant, both of whom agreed that juror M should be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Juror M was called into the courtroom for a brief voir dire examination so that the court could ascertain whether she had communicated her concerns to her fellow jurors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court then considered its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>options. The defendant expressed his opposition to proceeding with a jury of five. The state directed the court\u2019s attention to <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 242-43, 645 A.2d 999 (1994), wherein this court, proceeding under the assumption that the trial court\u2019s substitution of an alternate juror for an excused juror after deliberations had begun was a violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c), applied a harmless error analysis, and placed the burden on the defendant to demonstrate the harm caused by the violation. The trial court deferred its decision until the next day, and indicated its intent to recall the two alternates, who previously had been sent home, to examine them in order to determine whether they could still sit on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On June 16, 1998, the trial court questioned the two alternates and determined that they were both eligible to deliberate. The clerk then randomly selected the name of one of the alternates. The trial court then entertained argument by counsel on how best to proceed. The defendant objected to seating an alternate after the regular jurors had begun deliberation. He further argued that the trial court should declare a mistrial because the procedure contemplated by the trial court was a violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c), and because juror M had tainted the other jurors by sharing with them information about her level of discomfort in continuing to sit on the case. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating that it did not believe that the other jurors had been influenced improperly by juror M. The trial court further stated that, although it was \u201cconcerned that it is basically committing an error by\u201d substituting an alternate juror for a regular juror after deliberations had already begun, it nonetheless determined that this procedure was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The trial court then brought the five remaining original jurors into the courtroom and explained that an alternate juror was being substituted for juror M. The court instructed the jurors that they were required to start their deliberations over again, except for the selection of the foreman. Each juror, by a nod of the head, indicated his or her acquiescence and the jurors then retired to the jury room to begin their deliberations anew. Approximately three hours after the jury had concluded its deliberations and had recessed for a lunch break, the jury reached its verdict, finding the defendant guilty of both crimes as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The state argues, for the first time on appeal, that \u00a7 54-82h (c) authorizes the substitution of an alternate juror even after deliberations have begun. In the alternative, the state argues that the violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c) is subject to the harmless error doctrine and that the defendant\u2019s failure to demonstrate harm requires that we affirm his convictions. The defendant contends that, by substituting an alternate juror for a regular juror after jury deliberations had begun, the trial court violated \u00a7 54-82h (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He next claims that the trial court was required to declare a mistrial. Finally, the defendant contends that this court should reverse his convictions and not engage in a harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 242, we assumed, but did not decide expressly, that it was a violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c) to substitute an alternate juror for a regular juror after deliberations had begun. Thereafter, we concluded that, because the defendant had failed to establish that he had been harmed by the violation, the impropriety was deemed to have been harmless. Id., 245. We agree with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute in this case and therefore conclude that the trial court violated \u00a7 54-82h (c). We further agree with the defendant\u2019s assessment as to the appropriate remedy, that is, that, in the absence of an agreement by the parties to proceed with the remaining five jurors, the trial court was required to declare a mistrial after releasing juror M from her service as a juror. Therefore, we expressly overrule that portion of <em>Williams </em>that endorsed a harmless error analysis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Our analysis of this issue is guided by well established legal principles. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201c[Ojur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>State v. Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 32, 699 A.2d 101 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">With this background in mind, we turn to the statute at issue. General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cAlternate jurors shall attend at all times upon trial of the cause. ... If, at any time, any juror shall, for any reason, become unable to further perform his duty, the court may excuse him and, if any juror is so excused or dies, the court may order that an alternate juror who is designated by lot to be drawn by the clerk shall become a part of the regular panel and the trial shall then proceed as though such juror had been a member of the regular panel from the time when it was begun. A juror who has been selected to serve as an alternate shall not be segregated from the regular panel except when the case is given to the regular panel for deliberation at which time he shall be dismissed from further service on said case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The state argues that the plain language of the statute authorizes the trial court to substitute an alternate juror for a member of the original panel \u201cat any time,\u201d and therefore, does not preclude it from doing so once deliberations have begun. Consistent with this proposed interpretation, the state also reads the statute\u2019s language that the trial court \u201cshall\u201d dismiss alternate jurors once deliberations have begun as merely a directory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>rather than a mandatory, instruction that allows the trial court to recall an alternate juror if need be, after that alternate has been released from service. The state\u2019s argument rests on two assumptions: (1) that \u00a7 54-82h (c) does not require the trial court to dismiss the alternates upon submission of the case to the jury; and (2) that \u00a7 54-82h (c) does not prohibit the mid-deliberation replacement of an original juror with an alternate juror. We do not agree with those assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words. . . . <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>240 Conn. 671, 680-81, 694 A.2d 1218 (1997).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 622-23, 755 A.2d 180 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Looking first to the words of \u00a7 54-82h (c), it would appear that the language requires a trial court to dismiss an alternate juror once deliberations have begun, and thereby prohibits the mid-deliberation replacement of regular panel members. As stated previously, the statute provides that, when the jury begins deliberations, the alternates \u201cshall be dismissed from further service on said case.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c). \u201cDefinitive words, such as must or shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 507, 555 A.2d 986 (1989) .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>We have noted, however, that the use of the word shall, though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty. . . . <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 681.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 623. Therefore, we turn to the other aforementioned considerations in deciding whether \u00a7 54-82h (c) imposes a nondiscretionary obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The geneology of \u00a7 54-82h (c) supports our interpretation of the statute\u2019s language. As originally enacted in 1939, our alternate juror statute, which then applied to both civil and criminal trials, authorized the trial court to replace a regular juror with an alternate if, for any reason, that juror became unable to further perform his or her duties \u201cbefore the case shall be committed to the jury.\u201d See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1939) \u00a7 1406e. Subsequent statutory revisions retained that same language, thereby specifically prohibiting the mid-deliberation substitution of alternate jurors. See, e.g., General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 7911.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In 1959, the alternate juror statute, General Statutes \u00a7 51-243, allowed the substitution of an alternate if, \u201cat any time,\u201d a regular juror became unable to fulfill his or her official duties. The statute also provided that alternates \u201cshall be dismissed when the case is given to the regular panel for deliberations.\u201d Thereafter, in 1969, House Bill No. 6809 was introduced in the General Assembly as an amendment to \u00a7 51-243 (c) that, inter alia, would have permitted the replacement of regular jurors with alternates after deliberations had begun. The proposal was intended \u201c[t]o prevent the unnecessary retrial of cases . . . thereby saving the state thousands of dollars by eliminating early dismissal of alternate jurors.\u201d House Bill No. 6809, statement of purpose. The bill, as later modified, provided in relevant part: \u201cIf, <em>at any time, </em>any juror shall, for any reason, become unable to further perform his [or her] duty . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the court may order that [an] alternate juror . . . shall become a part of the regular panel and the trial <em>or deliberation </em>shall then proceed as though such juror had been a member of the regular panel from the time when it was begun, <em>provided the alternate juror or jurors shall be dismissed at the same time as the regular panel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Modified House Bill No. 6809.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The bill was passed by the House of Representatives as drafted, but was amended significantly when it reached the Senate. Like the House of Representatives version of the bill, the Senate version authorized the trial court to dismiss a juror \u201cat any time\u201d if that juror became unable to complete his or her duties, but deleted the very language that expressly would have allowed for the mid-deliberation substitution of alternates. Specifically, the Senate deleted the bill\u2019s reference to the continuation of \u201cdeliberations\u201d after an alternate had joined the panel, and the dismissal of alternates \u201cat the same time as the regular panel.\u201d See 13 S. Proc., Pt. 5,1969 Sess., p. 2318. Instead, the Senate version authorized the continuation, after an alternate had joined the panel, of \u201cthe trial\u201d only, and the dismissal of alternates \u201conce the case is given to the regular panel for deliberation.\u201d Id. Only after this amendment was adopted by the Senate was the bill passed by the full General Assembly. See 13 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1969 Sess., pp. 4315-17; see also Public Acts 1969, No. 518. Representative Lawrence J. Merly, the sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives, described the effect of the Senate amendments as \u201creturn[ing] the [original] bill ... to the existing law of alternate jurors,\u201d that is, requiring that alternates be dismissed upon submission of the case to the jury, thereby precluding the mid-deliberation substitution of alternate jurors. 13 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 4315-16. The rejection by the Senate, and ultimately the full General Assembly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>of those provisions of House Bill No. 6809 that expressly would have permitted the mid-deliberation substitution of alternate jurors under then \u00a7 51-243 reflects the legislature\u2019s disapproval of that practice. See <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, </em>250 Conn. 763, 782, 739 A.2d 238 (1999) (legislature\u2019s decision not to enact explicit exception to antidiscrimination statute reinforced intent to retain present construction).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In 1980, the legislature severed \u00a7 51-243 into two separate provisions. The substitution of alternate jurors in civil trials continued to be governed by \u00a7 51-243, whereas the substitution of alternate jurors in criminal trials was governed by \u00a7 54-82h (c). See Public Acts 1980, No. 80-313, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 56. The text of \u00a7 54-82h (c) mirrored that of \u00a7 51-243, as amended in 1969, regarding the substitution during trial of an alternate juror for a juror unable to continue in service, and the dismissal of alternates upon submission of the case for deliberation to the jury. Consistent with \u00a7 51-243, therefore, we read the language of \u00a7 54-82h (c), as originally drafted, as prohibiting the mid-deliberation substitutions of alternate jurors in criminal trials. See <em>Cotto </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>251 Conn. 1, 13, 738 A.2d 623 (1999) (presumption that legislature has created consistent body of law warrants interpretation of statute that conforms with existing statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Our interpretation that, pursuant to \u00a7 54-82h (c), alternate jurors cannot be recalled to replace an excused juror once deliberations have begun, allows for a complete reading of the statute that gives meaning to each independent clause. See <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 8, 16, 615 A.2d 1032 (1992) (every word and phrase is presumed to have meaning; statutes not construed to render terms surplusage); <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 149, 157, 602 A.2d 988 (1992) (\u201cwe do not interpret some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>clauses in a manner that nullifies others, but rather read the statute as a whole and so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cIf we construe the words \u2018at all times\u2019 and \u2018at any time\u2019 in [\u00a7 54-82h (c)] to include the period following the submission of the case to the jury for deliberations, we are rendering the clause \u2018at which time [the alternate] shall be dismissed from further service on said case\u2019 meaningless. If, however, we consider the statute as a whole and interpret the words \u2018at all times\u2019 and \u2018at any time\u2019 to mean any time during which an undischarged alternate is still available for substitution because [that alternate] has not been dismissed from further service on the case, then we have reconciled the statute\u2019s separate parts and rendered \u2018a reasonable overall interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>41 Conn. App. 831, 843, 678 A.2d 986 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Finally, a recent amendment to \u00a7 54-82h (c) supports our conclusion that the statute, as enacted, requires the dismissal of alternates upon submission of the case to the jury, and prohibits the mid-deliberation substitution of alternates. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending, Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 344-45, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992) (\u201c[w]e have previously considered subsequent enactments in order to illuminate the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to a prior legislative action\u201d); see also <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>250 Conn. 536, 546, 738 A.2d 604 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 621, 620 A.2d 133 (1993); <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 520-24, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). Number 00-116, \u00a7 6, of the 2000 Public Acts, which codified Substitute Senate Bill No. 58, amended \u00a7 54-82h (c) to provide in relevant part as follows: \u201cIf, at any time, any juror shall, for any reason, become unable to perform the duty of a juror, the court may excuse such juror and . . . the court may order that an alternate juror . . . shall become a part of the regular panel and the trial <em>or deliberation </em>shall then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>proceed <em>with appropriate instructions from the court </em>as though such juror had been a member of the regular panel from the time when <em>the trial or deliberation began. If the alternate juror becomes a member of the regular panel after deliberations began, the jury shall be instructed by the court that deliberations by the jury shall begin anew. </em>A juror who has been selected to serve as an alternate shall not be segregated from the regular panel except when the case is given to the regular panel for deliberation at which time <em>such alternate juror may </em>be dismissed from further service on said case <em>or may remain in service under the direction of the court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That section of the act, which takes effect October 1, 2000, \u201cgives the court the option in criminal cases to retain alternate jurors once deliberation begins or, as under current law, to dismiss them. It allows alternate jurors to become part of the regular panel of jurors during deliberations as well as during trial as current law provides. If a juror joins during deliberation, the bill requires an appropriate instruction from the court and that the court instructs the jury to begin deliberations again.\u201d Fiscal Note and Bill Analysis Report on Substitute Senate Bill No. 58 (February 2000 Sess.).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Public Act 00-116 reflects the legislature\u2019s understanding that, as originally enacted, \u00a7 54-82h (c) does not allow for the mid-deliberation substitution of jurors. The deliberate substitution of the word \u201cmay\u201d for the word \u201cshall,\u201d in relation to the dismissal of alternates once deliberations have begun, coupled with the express authorization of substituting alternates after the case is submitted to the regular panel for deliberations, confirms that until P.A. 00-116 takes effect, \u00a7 54-82h (c) requires that, upon submission of the case to the jury, the trial court must dismiss the alternate jurors, stripping it of the authority to recall them should a regular juror be excused thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Our conclusion that \u00a7 54-82h (c) does not permit the mid-deliberation substitution of an alternate juror is consistent with our recent holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 611, wherein we discussed the formal status of a jury in the course of construing the term \u201cdischarge\u201d as used in Practice Book \u00a7 42-31. In that case, we held that members of a jury are not necessarily relieved of their official obligations after they have departed from the courtroom and therefore, under certain circumstances, may be recalled for the purpose of submitting to a jury poll. Id., 629. In other words, <em>Pare </em>stands for the proposition that mere departure from the courtroom does not, in and of itself, discharge a jury from its obligation to render continued service in a particular case. In <em>Pare, </em>we went on to discuss when the obligations accompanying jury service are deemed complete, such that a jury is no longer subject to the authority of the court. We concluded that a jury completes its task, and thereby relinquishes its status as a judicial body, upon the separation and dispersal of its individual members. Id., 634. \u201cWhen a jury remains as an undispersed unit within the control of the court and with no opportunity to mingle with or discuss the case with others, it is undischarged and may be recalled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 630, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marinari, </em>32 F.3d 1209, 1214 (7th Cir. 1994). After separating and dispersing, however, individual jurors may \u201ccome into contact with outside influences\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>supra, 632-33; thereby tarnishing the deliberations that might take place thereafter. At that point, individual jurors effectively relinquish their status as jurors because they are no longer eligible to be recalled. See id. Similarly, absent some statutory authority to the contrary; see Public Act 00-116; an alternate juror who has been discharged is, simply stated, no longer a juror. Because that individual is no longer subject to the super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>visory authority of the trial court, having been dismissed from service, he or she is susceptible to contact with improper outside influences, and therefore, is no longer capable of serving in an official capacity. See <em>Cantrell </em>v. <em>State, </em>265 Ark. 263, 266, 577 S.W.2d 605 (1979) (\u201c[w]hen the jury retire[s] to deliberate, there [is] then no alternate juror\u201d); <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>611 S.W.2d 803, 804 (Ky. App. 1980) (juror ceases to be member of panel upon discharge and thereafter cannot be recalled); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bobo, </em>814 S.W.2d 353, 355 (Term. 1991) (alternate no longer member of jury because function ceases when case is submitted to regular jury). At that point, the alternate can no longer replace a regular juror who, for whatever reason, has been excused from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In the present case, as dictated by \u00a7 54-82h (c), the alternates were discharged by the trial court when the case was given to the regular jury for deliberations. Three days later, the trial court received the letter in which juror M expressed concerns for her safety should she be required to continue her service on the case. After considering the contents of the letter, the trial court determined, upon consent of the parties, that juror M should be excused. The defendant declined to proceed with only five jurors. The court recalled the two alternates, conducted a brief voir dire and concluded that neither had been tainted by outside contacts. Thereafter, the trial court instructed the clerk to select randomly the name of one of the alternates to replace juror M.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">As we have stated previously, \u00a7 54-82h (c) mandates the dismissal of alternate jurors once deliberations have begun, and thereby prohibits the mid-deliberation substitution of alternate jurors. Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision to recall a dismissed alternate to replace juror M was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The remaining question is whether the trial court\u2019s violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c) is subject to harmless error analysis. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The defendant argues that this court should order a new trial pursuant to its supervisory authority over the administration of justice; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 332-34, 715 A.2d 1 (1998); because the trial court \u201cdeliberately and knowingly\u201d disregarded the Appellate Court\u2019s directive in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 831, that a mistrial must be granted whenever the trial court violates \u00a7 54-82h (c). Because the defendant claims that a new trial is necessary whenever \u00a7 54-82h (c) has been violated, he in essence requests that we overrule that portion of <em>State v. Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 235, invoking a harmless error analysis. The state counters that the record fails to support the claim that the trial court intentionally violated \u00a7 54-82h (c), and therefore, pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 242, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the harm of that violation. Finally, the state contends that the defendant has failed to make any showing of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As stated previously, we held in <em>Williams, </em>that a violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c) was subject to harmless error analysis, and that, because the improper substitution of an alternate juror did not implicate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial by jury, the defendant bore the burden of demonstrating the harmfulness of that substitution. Id., 242. In <em>Williams, </em>we did not examine the contours of \u00a7 54-82h (c), but, rather, assumed, without deciding, that the mid-deliberation substitution of an alternate violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In the present case, we have resolved the question left open by <em>Williams, </em>concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c) did not permit the mid-deliberation substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tution of an alternate. The rationale undergirding that conclusion informs our assessment of whether to continue to review violations of \u00a7 54-82h (c) for harmless error. Specifically, having determined that an alternate, discharged from service when the case was submitted for deliberation to the jury, lost her status as a juror, it necessarily follows that the former alternate was no longer qualified to participate in the remainder of the proceedings. In light of the narrow question before us in <em>Williams, </em>we did not have occasion to address the legal status of a former alternate, and therefore, the conclusion that we drew therein did not take account of that factor. We are constrained to conclude that the inclusion of a nonjuror among the ultimate arbiters of innocence or guilt necessarily amounts to a \u201c[defect] in the structure of the trial mechanism\u201d that defies harmless error review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bobo, </em>supra, 814 S.W.2d 358; see <em>Thurman v. Commonwealth, </em>supra, 611 S.W.2d 804 (improper recall of discharged juror after start of deliberations warrants retrial).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u201cWe realize the burdens that are imposed on the trial courts when a juror suddenly becomes . . . disqualified from service during the deliberative process, especially where the trial has been lengthy and complex in nature. But however cumbersome the process may be, we do not believe it is appropriate to substitute our judgment as to guilt or innocence for that of the jury, which we must necessarily do in applying the harmless error analysis. It is impossible to say that the remaining [jurors] would be capable of disregarding their prior deliberations, even with an instruction to do so, and become receptive to the alternate\u2019s attempt to assert a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>view that might be non-conforming.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bobo, </em>supra, 814 S.W.2d 358. The inability to assess the effect of this impropriety on the defendant\u2019s trial persuades us that reversal must be automatic. To the extent that <em>State v. Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 242, held otherwise, it is overruled. See footnote 8 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT, SULLIVAN and VERTEFEUILLE, Js, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h provides: \u201cAlternate jurors in criminal cases.

According to the defendant, because <em>Walton </em>was decided two years before the trial in the present case, the trial court\u2019s failure to follow this binding precedent mandates that we exercise our supervisory authority and order a new trial, i.e., the mistrial that the trial court was required, but refused, to declare. To the extent that the defendant\u2019s argument asks us to reject the harmless error analysis that we employed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 244-45, we deem it a request to overrule that case. For the reasons set forth in part IIB of this opinion, we agree with the defendant that harmless error analysis is not appropriate, and accordingly, we overrule that part of <em>Williams.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> We do not, however, overrule that part of <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 243-44, wherein we concluded that \u201cthe mechanisms for providing for and dismissing alternate jurors, and the circumstances under which they may be substituted for regular jurors . . . does not implicate constitutional rights\u201d and are thus for the legislature to decide. The idea of alternate jurors was unknown at common law and came into existence only as a creation of the legislature in 1939. See General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1939) \u00a7 1406e. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s contention that an interpretation of \u00a7 54-82h (c), requiring a mistrial when a juror has been dismissed during deliberations, is \u201cconstitutionally precarious\u201d because it runs afoul of the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers. See <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 521, 461 A.2d 938 (1983) (\u201c[i]n the context of challenges to statutes whose constitutional infirmity is claimed to flow from impermissible intrusion upon the judicial power, we have refused to find constitutional impropriety in a statute \u2018simply because it affects the judicial function, so long as it is an exercise of power assigned by the constitution to the legislature\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\"> We do not dispute the contention raised by the dissent, that a jury is presumed, absent evidence to the contrary, to have properly followed the trial court\u2019s instructions throughout its deliberations. This contention, however, assumes the existence of a legally constituted jury which, in this case, ceased to exist once the \u201cnoiyuror,\u201d that is, the former alternate, was recalled to contribute to the deliberative process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b521-7\">MCDONALD, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A85\">with whom PALMER, J., joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with parts I and II A of the majority opinion. I disagree, however, with part II B.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 244, 679 A.2d 920 (1994), this court assumed, without deciding, that the mid-deliberation substitution of an alternate juror violated General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c) and then proceeded to employ a harmless error analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority now overrules this court\u2019s holding in <em>Williams. </em>\u201c[T]he doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>George </em>v. <em>Ericson, </em>250 Conn. 312, 318, 736 A.2d 889 (1999). I would conclude that this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The majority states that it is not overruling the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 243-44, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u201cthe mechanisms for providing for and dismissing alternate jurors, and the circumstances under which they may be substituted for regular jurors do not implicate constitutional rights.\u201d Because, however, \u201c \u2018[i]t is impossible to say that the remaining [jurors] would be capable of disregarding their prior deliberations, even with an instruction to do so, and become receptive to the alternate\u2019s attempt to assert a view that might be nonconforming,\u2019 \u201d the majority concludes \u201cthat reversal must be automatic.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the majority is at odds with this court\u2019s precedent. We have held that a jury is presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>175 Conn. 155, 160, 397 A.2d 89 (1978). In this case, there is no indication that the jury failed to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions to begin deliberations anew following the seating of the alternate juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion is also at odds with the wisdom of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, whose rulings are binding on federal courts in Connecticut. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hillard, </em>701 F.2d 1052, 1058 (2d Cir. 1983), that court held that, despite the rule 24 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the federal equivalent to \u00a7 54-82h (c), the substitution of an alternate juror after deliberations have begun does not lead to reversal per se, absent a showing of prejudice. A great number of other Circuit Courts of Appeal have so held as well. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Quiroz-Cortez, </em>960 F.2d 418, 420 (5th Cir. 1992) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Huntress, </em>956 F.2d 1309, 1316 (5th Cir. 1992) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gambino, </em>788 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>F.2d 938, 948 (3d Cir. 1986) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Josefik, </em>753 F.2d 585, 587 (7th Cir. 1985) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kopituk, </em>690 F.2d 1289, 1309 (11th Cir. 1982) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The majority is also at odds with other states that have followed the federal approach of applying a harmless error test to claims of improper substitution of alternate jurors. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>45 Ill. App. 3d 798, 805, 359 N.E.2d 909 (1977) (error harmless if no prejudice from late substitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>659 S.W.2d 298, 300 (Mo. App. 1983) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grovenstein, </em>335 S.C. 347, 351-52, 517 S.E.2d 216 (1999) (burden on defendant to demonstrate prejudice due to improper jury influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Finally, in reaching this conclusion, the majority is at odds with the collective wisdom of the people of Connecticut as embodied by the legislature. Since <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 235, was decided, the legislature had taken no action in response to our holding that a violation of \u00a7 54-82h (c) is subject to harmless error analysis. Although \u201cwe are aware that legislative inaction is not necessarily legislative affirmation . . . we also presume that the legislature is aware of [this court\u2019s] interpretation of a statute, and that its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 262-63, 726 A.2d 531, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 969, 120 S. Ct. 409, 145 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1999). The legislature, however, recently amended \u00a7 54-82h (c) to permit the trial court to retain alternate jurors and to substitute an alternate juror for a regular juror after deliberations have begun. The very practice that the majority deems to be so prejudicial as to prohibit harmless error review is now permitted by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In this case, the record, as in <em>Williams, </em>indicates that the trial court had attempted to minimize any potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>prejudice. The trial court questioned each of the alternate jurors as to whether they had spoken to anyone about the case. Each juror responded in the negative, without hesitation or equivocation. As a result, the trial court deemed them \u201cvery credible,\u201d concluding that they were \u201cstill viable, unbiased and fair jurors . . . .\u201d The trial court also instructed the jurors to \u201cbegin the determination and deliberation process from ground zero.\u201d I would therefore conclude that, because the defendant has failed to establish that he was prejudiced by the needed substitution of the alternate juror, the defendant\u2019s conviction should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> The trial court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 240, questioned tlie alternate juror as to whether he had spoken to anyone about the ease, and he responded that he had not. The trial court also questioned the remaining eleven jurors as to whether they would be able to begin deliberations anew. The jurors indicated that they would be able to do so. Id. Because the record indicated that the trial court in <em>Williams </em>had attempted to minimize any potential prejudice to the defendant resulting from the substitution of the alternate juror, this court determined that no prejudice had occurred. Id., 245.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> In 1998, the year during which the defendant\u2019s trial in the present case took place, rule 24 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provided in relevant part: \u201cAlternate jurors in the order in which they are called shall replace jurors, who, prior to the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, become or are found to be unable or disqualified to perform their duties. ...
