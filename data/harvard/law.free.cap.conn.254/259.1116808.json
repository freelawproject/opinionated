G. Wentworth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>issues in this appeal are: (1) whether General Statutes \u00a7 52-225f<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> invalidates antiassignment provisions that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>included in structured settlement agreements and annuities issued pursuant to such agreements; and (2) whether the antiassignment clause contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>annuity issued by Safeco1 *3<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the plaintiff beneficiary invalidates his assignment to Wentwoith. We conclude that \u00a7 52-225f does not invalidate such antiassignment provisions. We further conclude that, under Connecticut common law, the antiassignment provision in the annuity contract does not invalidate the plaintiffs assignment of his right to payments under the annuity to Wentworth. In accordance with case law and \u00a7 322 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, an antiassignment provision that does not limit the power to assign or expressly invalidate the assignment does not render the assignment of the annuity ineffective. Safeco, however, has the right to recover damages for the plaintiffs breach of the antiassignment provision. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The record reveals the following facts. In April, 1998, the plaintiff and Utica Mutual entered into a structured settlement agreement to resolve a personal injury claim. Pursuant to that settlement agreement, the plaintiff was to receive from Utica Mutual a lump sum payment, followed by a series of periodic payments over the next fifteen years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The structured portion of the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>was funded by the annuity contract issued by Safeco. The annuity contract provided under its \u201cAssignment\u201d provision that \u201c[n]o payment under this annuity contract may be . . . assigned ... in any manner by the [plaintiff] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Approximately six months after the execution of the settlement agreement and the issuance of the annuity, the plaintiff had become unemployed and faced a mortgage foreclosure action against his home, where he lived with his family. In order to resolve his financial troubles, the plaintiff decided to sell his right to the annuity payments. In November, 1998, he filed a declaratory judgment action seeking court approval, pursuant to No. 98-238, \u00a7 1, of the 1998 Public Acts (P.A. 98-238), now codified at \u00a7 52-225\u00cd, to transfer his right to the remaining annuity payments to Wentworth in exchange for a lump sum payment and other consideration. Safeco objected to the assignment, claiming that because the annuity contract contained an antiassignment provision, P.A. 98-238 was inapplicable. Utica Mutual neither appeared at that hearing, nor provided an explanation for its failure to appear, and the trial court issued an order of default for failure to appear against Utica Mutual.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The trial court, after a hearing, concluded that P.A. 98-238 invalidated antiassignment provisions and allowed payees to tr ansfer their rights to future payments under structured settlement agreements when the statutory requirements were met. The trial court further found that, pursuant to P.A. 98-238, the proposed sale of the annuity payments was in the best interests of the plaintiff, and was fair and reasonable to all interested parties. Accordingly, the court rejected Safeco\u2019s claim concerning the applicability of the antiassignment provision, and rendered judgment approving the transfer of the plaintiffs annuity payments to Wentworth. Safeco appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the case to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We first consider Safeco\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the language of \u00a7 52-225\u00cd invalidates antiassignment provisions in structured settlement agreements and annuities issued pursuant to such agreements. We agree with Safeco, and conclude that the language of \u00a7 52-225f does not abrogate the common-law right to include an antiassignment provision in such an agreement or annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">It is well settled that \u201c[i]n determining whether or not a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope. . . . Although the legislature may eliminate a common law right by statute, the presumption that the legislature does not have such a purpose can be overcome only if the legislative intent is clearly and plainly expressed. . . . We recognize only those alterations of the common law that are clearly expressed in the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the statute because the traditional principles of justice upon which the common law is founded should be perpetuated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>New Haven Register, Inc., </em>249 Conn. 709, 715, 735 A.2d 306 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The language of \u00a7 52-225f contains no clear expression of legislative intent to alter the common law. There is, for example, no provision in the statute that addresses the impact of antiassignment provisions on the transfer of structured settlement rights. Nor does the statute grant the trial court the power to ignore antiassignment provisions, or the common law of contracts, if the court deems it appropriate or necessary. Rather, the statute requires the trial court to consider \u201cwhether the transfer of such structured settlement payment rights is in the best interests of the payee and is fair and reasonable to all interested parties under all of the circumstances then existing\u201d and further provides, \u201c[i]f the court determines, after hearing, that such transfer should be allowed, it shall approve such transfer upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-225\u00cd (c) (1). Reading that language as a clear and plain expression of the legislature\u2019s desire to alter the common law of contracts would be an unwarranted departure from our traditional practice of presuming that \u201cthe legislature is capable of providing explicit limitations when that is its intent.\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Haybuster Mfg., Inc., </em>226 Conn. 282, 290, 627 A.2d 1288 (1993). In the absence of such explicit language, we adhere to our long-standing rule that \u201c[n]o statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import [and a statute] is not to be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which it does not fairly express.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gore </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>235 Conn. 360, 382, 665 A.2d 1341 (1995).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The primary issue raised by this case is whether, under Connecticut common law, an antiassignment provision in an annuity contract invalidates the plaintiff payee\u2019s transfer of his right to future payments under the annuity to a third party. We conclude, in accordance with case law and \u00a7 322 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, that the antiassignment provision at issue here does not render the assignment of the annuity ineffective, but, instead, gives the annuity issuer, Safeco, the right to recover damages for breach of the antiassignment provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Although we previously have addressed the issue of the validity of contractual provisions prohibiting the assignment of contractual rights; see <em>Lewin &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>143 Conn. 146, 149, 120 A.2d 423 (1956) (upholding validity of contractual provision that prohibited assignment without consent); the law of contracts has changed considerably since our earlier decision. Accordingly, we now reexamine the basic legal principles regarding contractual antiassignment provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Our analysis of the effect of the antiassignment provision begins by emphasizing that the modem approach to contracts rejects traditional common-law restrictions on the alienability of contract rights in favor of free assignability of contracts. See 3 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 317, p. 15 (1981) (\u201c[a] contractual right can be assigned\u201d); J. Murray, Jr., Contracts (3d Ed. 1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>(\u201cthe modem view is that contract rights should be freely assignable\u201d); 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (2d Ed. 1998) \u00a7 11.2, p. 61 (\u201c[t]oday most contract rights are freely transferable\u201d). Common-law restrictions on assignment were abandoned when courts recognized the necessity of permitting the transfer of contract rights. \u201cThe force [s] of human convenience and business practice [were] too strong for the common-law doctrine that [intangible contract rights] are not assignable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) J. Murray, Jr., supra, \u00a7 135, p. 791. \u201cIf the law were otherwise, our modem credit economy could not exist.\u201d 3 E. Farnsworth, supra, \u00a7 11.2, p. 61. As a result, an assignor typically can transfer his contractual right to receive future payments to an assignee. See <em>Western United Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>64 F.3d 833, 841 (3d Cir. 1995); 3 E. Farnsworth, supra, \u00a7 11.2, pp. 61, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The parties to a contract can include express language to limit assignment and courts generally uphold these contractual antiassignment clauses. See 3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 317, p. 15 (\u201c[a] contractual right can be assigned unless . . . assignment is validly precluded by contract\u201d); 3 E. Farnsworth, supra, \u00a7 11.4, pp. 82 (\u201cmost courts have upheld [terms prohibiting assignment] as precluding effective assignment\u201d). Given the importance of free assignability, however, antiassignment clauses are construed narrowly whenever possible. See 3 E. Farnsworth, supra, \u00a7 11.4, pp. 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In inteipreting antiassignment clauses, the majority of jurisdictions now distinguish between the assignor\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to assign and the \u201cpower\u201d to assign (modem approach). For example, in <em>Bel-Ray Co. </em>v. <em>Chemrite (Pty.) Ltd., </em>181 F.3d 435, 442 (3d Cir. 1999), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recognized that numerous jurisdictions followed the general rule \u201cthat contractual provisions limiting or prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>assignments operate only to limit [the] parties\u2019 <em>right </em>to assign the contract, but not their <em>power </em>to do so, unless the parties manifest an intent to the contrary with specificity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court concluded, however, that the \u201cassignment clauses [did] not contain the requisite clear language to limit [the] \u2018power\u2019 to assign\u201d and, therefore, held the assignment valid and enforceable. Id., 443. The court acknowledged that contracting parties could limit the <em>power </em>to assign by including an \u201cassignment provision [that] generally state[s] that nonconforming assignments (i) shall be \u2018void\u2019 or \u2018invalid,\u2019 or (ii) that the assignee shall acquire no rights or the nonassigning party shall not recognize any such assignment.\u201d Id., 442. Without such express contractual language, however, \u201cthe provision limiting or prohibiting assignments will be interpreted merely as a covenant not to assign .... Breach of such a covenant may render the assigning party liable in damages to the non-assigning party. The assignment, however, remains valid and enforceable against both the assignor and the assignee.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Many other courts similarly have held that an antiassignment provision that limits the <em>right </em>to assign does not void an assignment between an assignor and assignee unless there is also an express provision limiting the <em>power </em>to assign or a provision voiding the assignment itself. See, e.g., <em>Pravin Banker Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Banco Popular Del Peru, </em>109 F.3d 850, 856 (2d Cir. 1997) (\u201c \u2018[t]o reveal the intent necessary to preclude the power to assign, or cause an assignment violative of contractual provisions to be wholly void, [a contractual] clause must contain express provisions that any assignment shall be void or invalid if not made in a certain specified way\u2019 \u201d); <em>Cedar Point Apartments, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cedar Point Investment Corp., </em>693 F.2d 748, 754 (8th Cir. 1982) (concluding that \u201c[m]erely the \u2018right to assign,\u2019 not the power to assign, [was] limited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>express language of the [antiassignment] clause. No intent is thereby revealed to avoid an assignment not meeting the restrictions.\u201d); <em>Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston </em>v. <em>Stone Street Capital, Inc., </em>93 F. Sup. 2d 630, 637 (D. Md. 2000) (\u201cthe Court can think of no clearer way to communicate an intent to deny a party the power to assign than to expressly say so\u201d); <em>Wonsey </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co. of North America, </em>32 F. Sup. 2d 939, 943 (E.D. Mich. 1998) (refusing to \u201c[disregard] the modem trend of upholding assignments in the face of contractual anti-assignment clauses\u201d); <em>Pro Cardiaco Pronto Socorro Cardiologica, S.A. </em>v. <em>Trussell, </em>863 F. Sup. 135, 138 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (\u201cassignments are enforceable unless expressly made void\u201d); <em>Lomas Mortgage U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>W.E. O\u2019Neil Construction Co., </em>812 F. Sup. 841, 844 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (concluding that antiassignment clauses \u201cdo not specifically render void an attempted assignment\u201d but \u201cmerely restrict the right to assign\u201d); <em>Paccom Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>Docket Nos. CIV. A. 89-255-CMW, 90-311-CMW, 1991 U.S. Dist. WL 226775, p. *7 (D. Del. October 30, 1991) (\u201c[t]here is ample support for [the] position that distinguishes between the power to assign and the right to assign. If the power to assign is removed by contract [rendering any attempted assignment void] then the attempted assignment would be ineffective .... On the other hand, if the contract . . . merely removed the right to assign, then the assignments . . . would be upheld.\u201d); <em>Jacquette </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>Civil Action No. 98-1601 (N.H.P.) (D.N.J. November 16, 1998) (\u201ca contractual prohibition against assignment cannot render an assignment void unless the contract explicitly states that assignments are void or invalid or otherwise ineffective\u201d); <em>Hanigan </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>19 Ariz.

It does not deprive the assignor of the <em>power </em>to assign and its breach, therefore, would simply subject the promisor to an action for damages while the assignment would be effective.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]). Thus, the modem approach finds support in the majority of jurisdictions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The modem approach, however, is not adopted by some courts, which uphold antiassignment clauses regardless of whether the parties have included contractual language that expressly limits the power to assign or expressly invalidates the assignment itself. We agree with these courts that contracting parties can exercise their freedom to contract to overcome free alienability when they include the appropriate contractual language. See <em>Parrish Chiropractic </em>Centers, <em>P.C. </em>v. <em>Pro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>gressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>874 P.2d 1049, 1054-55 (Colo. 1994) (\u201cThe policy supporting free alienability is not such an absolute one that it must override a contract provision prohibiting assignment in a specific context. ... To hold otherwise would be to force [the obligor] to deal with parties with whom it has not contracted, regardless of . . . express contractual provision . . . .\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Portland Electric &amp; Plumbing Co. </em>v. <em>Vancouver, </em>29 Wash.

When a contract prohibits assignment in \u2018very specific\u2019 and \u2018unmistakable terms\u2019 the assignment will be void against the obligor.\u201d [Citation omitted.]). We disagree, however, with these courts that the antiassignment provisions in these cases contained the necessary contractual language. See <em>Parrish Chiropractic Centers, P.C. </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 1051 (enforcing an antiassignment provision in insurance policy that stated \u201c[i]nterest in this policy may not be assigned without <em>our </em>written consent\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Cloughly </em>v. <em>NBC Bank-Seguin, N.A., </em>773 S.W.2d 652, 655 (Tex.

These courts ignore the rule adopted by the majority of jurisdictions, which requires that in order to invalidate the assignment, the parties must include in their antiassignment provision language that specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>cally limits the <em>power </em>to assign or invalidates the assignment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The modem approach offers the advantage of free assignability together with full protection for any obligor who actually suffers damages as a result of an assignment. An assignor who breaches a contractual provision limiting his or her right to assign will be hable for any damages that result from that assignment. See, e.g., <em>Bel-Ray Co. </em>v. <em>Chemrite (Pty.)

This antiassignment provision limited the plaintiffs <em>right </em>to assign, but not his <em>power </em>to do so. The provision did not contain any express language to limit the power to assign or to void the assignment itself. Therefore, in accordance with the modem approach, we conclude that the plaintiffs assignment to Wentworth is valid and enforceable despite the plaintiffs breach of the contract\u2019s antiassignment provision. We further conclude, however, that Safeco is free to sue for any damages that it might sustain as a result of the assignment by bringing an action for breach of contract against the plaintiff as assignor. See, e.g., <em>Bel-Ray Co. </em>v. <em>Chemrite (Pty.) Ltd., </em>supra, 181 F.3d 442; <em>Pro Cardiaco Pronto Socorro Cardiologica, S.A. </em>v. <em>Trussell, </em>supra, 863 F.

Alternatively, Safeco may pursue damages from Wentworth, who, as the assignee, \u201c \u2018stands in the shoes of the assignor.\u2019 \u201d 3 E.

We do not find it necessary to reach the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Safeco lacked standing because the only relevant antiassignment provision in this case is the one in the annuity contract, the only agreement to which Safeco is a party. We acknowledge that Safeco is statutorily authorized to pursue this appeal. In a declaratory judgment action to determine whether a payee can transfer his structured settlement payment rights, <em>\u201c[t]he annuity issuer . . . shall be made [a party] to such action. . . </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-225\u00cd (c) (1). Given that Safeco issued the annuity contract to fund the payments due to the plaintiff under the settlement agreement, Safeco fits the definition of an annuity issuer under the statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the plaintiff was entitled to receive $52,000 within thirty days of its execution, thirty semiannual payments of $1323.09 beginning on March 6, 1999, and a final lump sum payment of $44,000 on March 6, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b286-5\"> The plaintiff has not claimed that the annuity contract is a contract of adhesion. Typically, \u201clife insurance contracts are [considered] contracts of adhesion because [t]he contract is drawn up by the insurer and the insured, who merely adheres to it, has little choice as to its terms. . . .

A review of the annuity contract in the present case reveals that it is a preprinted, standardized insurance contract in which the plaintiff was the named annuitant. It was not a contract arrived at by actual negotiation between the parties. We disagree with the dissent\u2019s characterization of the antiassignment clause as a bargained for provision of the annuity contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Utica Mutual has not challenged that order and, therefore, is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> In their brief, the plaintiffs argue that, rather than implicating the presumption against statutory abrogation of common-law rights, this case is simply one of statutory interpretation. Inasmuch as this contention is based entirely on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that antiassignment provisions are invalid under the common law of Connecticut\u2014a claim which we reject in part II of this opinion\u2014the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> A number of courts that have considered structured settlement agreements have enforced antiassignment provisions that explicitly deprive the assignor of the <em>power </em>to assign or otherwise provide that any assignment will be invalid. See, e.g., <em>Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston </em>v. <em>Stone Street Capital, Inc., </em>supra, 93 F. Sup. 2d 638 (holding that \u201cthe anti-assignment clause is a valid and enforceable term of the Settlement Agreement, and that [the] plaintiffs intended the clause to deny [the assignor] <em>the power </em>to assign\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Grieve </em>v. <em>General American Life Ins. Co., </em>58 F. Sup. 2d 319, 321 (D. Vt. 1999) (upholding antiassignment provision that provided \u201cnor shall [the plaintiff] . . . have the <em>power </em>to sell ... or anticipate the periodic payments, or any part thereof, by assignment or otherwise\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>First Colony Life Ins.

The dissent relies on these cases. We view them, however, as consistent with the modem approach because each of the provisions in question explicitly deprived the assignor of the <em>power </em>to assign.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b298-5\"> The dissent suggests that it is principally the courts of New York and New Jersey that employ the modem approach to antiassignment provisions. A review of the cases on which we rely, however, demonstrates that many courts other than New York and New Jersey have used this approach. In fact, the majority of jurisdictions have adopted the modem approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> At the trial court hearing, Safeco did not show any actual damages resulting from the assignment. It argues, however, that upholding the assignment increases the risk of losing certain purported favorable federal tax treatment afforded to both the insurance company and the annuitant. More specifically, an insurer can fund its liability under a structured settlement agreement by purchasing an annuity that grows tax free while the annuitant receives tax free payments from that annuity. Safeco argues that allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>a party to assign his rights to payments frustrates the public policy of ensuring a steady source of income to that party and creates a risk that the favorable tax treatment will be lost. We agree with the trial court\u2019s findings that \u201c[Safeco] . . . has not offered evidence of danger of suffering adverse tax effects as a result of the transfer nor is there other evidence of any detriment to it by virtue of the transfer.\u201d Although Safeco has raised the specter of a risk of losing its favorable tax treatment, it has not provided any evidence that there will be an actual adverse effect if this court were to uphold the assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b300-6\">NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhH\">with whom KATZ, J., joins, dissenting. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that General Statutes \u00a7 52-225\u00cd does not act to invalidate antiassignment provisions as a general matter. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s determination that our common law, and \u00a7 322 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, give the plaintiff, Marco Rumbin, the freedom to ignore a validly executed, and freely made, antiassignment provision in order to transfer his right to payment under the structured settlement agreement. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">I take no issue with the well settled precept of modem contract law that a \u201ccontractual right can be assigned unless . . . the assignment is forbidden by statute or is otherwise inoperative on grounds of public policy, or . . . assignment is validly precluded by contract.\u201d 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 317 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without this rule, which replaced the anachronistic common-law prohibition against the assignment of choses in action, \u201cour modem credit economy could not exist.\u201d 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1990) \u00a7 11.2, p. 61. Certainly, the majority is correct when it notes that \u201ccourts [have] recognized the necessity of permitting the transfer of contract rights. . . . As a result, an assignor typically can transfer his contractual right to receive future payments to an assignee.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">That said, the majority chooses to ignore a concept that is just as central to this court\u2019s jurisprudence, namely, a healthy respect for the power of independent persons to bargain for, or away, contractual provisions in the course of making a contract. This court repeatedly has emphasized that, absent fraud, duress, unconscionability, or other similar infirmity, courts are not in the business of remaking contracts to suit the changing whims of the contracting parties. See, e.g., <em>Robert Law</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number><em>rence Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>178 Conn. 1, 21-22, 420 A.2d 1142 (1979) (\u201cwhether provident or improvident . . . contracts voluntarily and fairly made should be held valid and [be] enforced in the courts\u201d). As this court recently stated, \u201c[e]ven if the result of the fair and logical enforcement of unambiguous agreements seems unduly to burden one of the parties, we decline to embark a voyage into uncharted waters in which untrammeled and unrestrained judicial revisionism would depart significantly from an aspect of contract law upon which contracting parties reasonably can be assumed to have relied for many years.\u201d <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 506, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000). Therefore, in spite of the aforementioned importance of contractual alienability, this court has a responsibility not to render unrecognizable the basic rules of contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Bearing those competing concerns in mind, the general rule governing antiassignment provisions is that \u201c[a] contract term prohibiting assignment of rights under the contract, unless a different intention is manifested . . . gives the obligor a right to damages for breach of the terms forbidding assignment but does not render the assignment ineffective . . . .\u201d3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 322. The crucial phrase in that rule\u2014\u201cunless a different intention is manifested\u201d\u2014is one that this court never has interpreted. The generally accepted view, however, is that this phrase encompasses a dichotomy between the <em>right </em>to assign, and the <em>power </em>to assign, and that only an antiassignment provision that restricts the latter will render any assignment made in spite of that provision invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The dichotomy between the right to assign and the power to assign, which is the starting point of the majority\u2019s analysis, is one with which I do not disagree. The fundamental source of my dissatisfaction with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>majority\u2019s reasoning is the standard that the majority opinion announces for judging whether an antiassignment provision restricts the right to assign or the power to assign. In my mind, that standard imposes on contracting parties an illogical and arbitrary set contractual mantra that must be recited in order to draft a valid antiassignment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">As the majority notes, several courts, most notably those of New Jersey and New York, have adopted precise linguistic requirements relating to the manifestation of the intent necessary to render an assignment of rights ineffective. Those courts have held that \u201c \u2018[t]o reveal the intent necessary to preclude the power to assign, or cause an assignment violative of contractual provisions to be wholly void, such clause <em>mus\u00ed contain express provisions that any assignment shall be void or invalid if not made in a certain specified way.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Garden State Buildings, L.P. </em>v. <em>First Fidelity Bank, N.A., </em>305 N.J.

Ltd., </em>supra, 181 F.3d 442. In order to manifest that specific intent, \u201cthe assignment provision must generally state that nonconforming assignments (i) shall be \u2018void\u2019 or \u2018invalid,\u2019 or (ii) that the assignee shall acquire no rights or the nonassigning party shall not recognize any such assignment.\u201d Id. Greatly favoring the free assignability of contractual rights, these courts have adopted the previously mentioned bright-line test for antiassignment clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">A number of jurisdictions that have considered the issue, however, have not been so insistent on the use of particular phraseology. Those courts simply have examined whether the prohibitive language employed by the parties was clear and unambiguous, and upheld the antiassignment clause when such language was used. See, e.g., <em>Grieve </em>v. <em>General American Life Ins. Co., </em>58 F. Sup. 2d 319, 324 (D. Vt. 1999) (antiassignment provisions were \u201cunambiguous, bargained-for contract terms\u201d); <em>Parrish Chiropractic Centers, P.C. </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins.

App. 1989) (\u201cwhere a contract expressly states that a right to payment arising under it is non-assignable, full force and effect must be given to this provision\u201d); <em>Portland Electric &amp; Plumbing Co. </em>v. <em>Vancouver, </em>29 Wash.

For example, in <em>Portland Electric &amp; Plumbing Co. </em>v. <em>Vancouver, </em>supra, 29 Wash. App. 294, the contract merely stated that \u201c[t]he Contractor shall not assign this contract or any part thereof, or any moneys due or to become due thereunder . . . .\u201d Yet, the Court of Appeals of Washington held that \u201c[t]he language in the subject contract is sufficient to prohibit any effective assignment of monies due . . . .\u201d Id., 295. A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of Colorado as to a contract that prohibited only the assignment \u201cof any interest\u201d in the contract. <em>Parrish Chiropractic Centers, P.C. </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 874 P.2d 1051. The court upheld that provision as preventing any effective assignment because \u201c[w]hen a contractual provision is clear and unambiguous, courts should neither rewrite it nor limit its effect by a strained construction.\u201d Id., 1055; see also <em>Cloughly </em>v. <em>NBC Bank-Seguin, N.A., </em>supra, 773 S.W.2d 655 (Texas Court of Appeals upheld validity of clause that provided \u201c \u2018[the plaintiff] shall not have the right to make any assignment or transfer any rights under this [agreement\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Most significantly, in three recent cases, courts have upheld antiassignment provisions in structured settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ment agreements in spite of the fact that the provisions did not contain the words \u201cvoid\u201d or \u201cinvalid.\u201d See <em>Grieve </em>v. <em>General American Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 58 F. Sup. 2d 321 (provision stating \u201cnor shall [the plaintiff] or any Payee have the power to sell, mortgage, encumber, or anticipate the periodic payments\u201d valid to prevent assignment); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>First Colony Life Ins. Co., </em>26 F. Sup. 2d 1227 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (provisionstating that \u201c[the plaintiff shall not] have the power to sell or mortgage or encumber [any periodic payments]\u201d prohibited assignment); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Roadway Express, </em>supra, 720 N.E.2d 1109 (provision stating that \u201c \u2018the [p]laintiff [shall not] have the power to sell, mortgage, encumber, or anticipate the Periodic Payments\u2019 \u201d valid to prevent assignment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In all three of these cases, the courts\u2019 main concern was the possible precedential effect of a decision \u201c[lending the court\u2019s] approval to the voiding of unambiguous, bargained-for contract terms . . . .\u201d <em>Grieve </em>v. <em>General American Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 324.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Although the majority acknowledges the difference between these two schools of thought, the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>nevertheless decides to impose formulaic restraints on the language that contracting parties may employ to craft an antiassignment clause that limits the power to assign. This holding flies in the face of decades of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">We long have held that \u201c[t]he intention of the parties to a contract governs the determination of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the contract. . . . Analysis of the contract focuses on the intention of the patties as derived from the language employed. . . . Where the intention of the parties is clearly and unambiguously set forth, effect must be given to that intent.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Advest, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 732, 745-46, 714 A.2d 649 (1998). At the heart of that rale is our understanding that different parties may choose differing language in order to express their intent, but so long as the language employed clearly manifests their joint contractual will, we are bound to enforce the contract\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In my opinion, this principle mandates against following the courts of New Jersey and New York in establishing a concrete formula that contracting parties must follow in order to write a valid antiassignment clause into a contract. Following a majority of the courts that have considered the issue, it would be preferable simply to hold that, so long as the language employed by the parties clearly and unambiguously establishes their intent to prohibit any assignment of rights under the contract, such an antiassignment clause will be valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In the present case, I would conclude that the language of the antiassignment clauses contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>settlement agreement and annuity contract<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are sufficiently clear and unambiguous to allow them to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">It is well settled that we interpret contract language in accordance with \u201ca fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pesino </em>v. <em>Atlantic Bank of New York, </em>244 Conn. 85, 91-92, 709 A.2d 540 (1998). \u201cIf the terms of [a contract] are clear, their meaning cannot be forced or strained by an unwarranted construction to give them a meaning which the parties obviously never intended. ... A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Downs </em>v. <em>National Casualty Co., </em>146 Conn. 490, 494-95, 152 A.2d 316 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The language employed in the antiassignment clauses at issue in the present case, when accorded its common and natural meaning, clearly and unambiguously prohibits the assignment of periodic payments. The settlement agreement provided in relevant part: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that . . . [the plaintiff] may not assign, pledge or sell the consideration to any third party in consideration of the payments made and to be made by [the defendant Utica Mutual Insurance Company]. ...\u201d The annuity contract provided in relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>part: \u201cNo payment under this annuity contract may be . . . sold, assigned, or encumbered in any manner by the [plaintiff] ... or any other recipient of the payment. ...\u201d Each of these clauses contains simple, easily understood language that clearly prohibits the assignment of any of the periodic payments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In an attempt to call into question whether the plaintiff freely entered into these contracts, the majority notes that \u201c[a] review of the annuity contract in the present case reveals that it is a preprinted, standardized insurance contract in which the plaintiff was the named annuitant. It was not a contract arrived at by actual negotiation between the parties.\u201d That statement inexplicably ignores the status of the settlement agreement, which most likely <em>was </em>the product of negotiation between the plaintiff and the original insurer, and gives short shrift to the fact that the plaintiff <em>never </em>has claimed that <em>either </em>contract was one of adhesion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">As discussed in part I of this dissent, three courts that recently have considered structured settlement agreements containing similar- prohibitive language have held that the language in question prevented assignment. See <em>Grieve </em>v. <em>General American Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 58 F. Sup. 2d 321 (\u201cnor shall [the plaintiff] or any Payee have the power to sell, mortgage, encumber, or anticipate the periodic payments\u201d); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>First Colony Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 26 F. Sup. 2d 1227 (\u201c[the plaintiff shall not] have the power to sell or mortgage or encumber [any periodic payments]\u201d); <em>Hender</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>son </em>v. <em>Roadway Express, </em>supra, 720 N.E.2d 1109 (\u201c \u2018the [p]laintiff [shall not] have the power to sell, mortgage, encumber, or anticipate the Periodic Payments\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In my view, the similarity between the language at issue in the present case, and the language at issue in <em>Grieve, Johnson </em>and <em>Henderson, </em>militates against the majority\u2019s conclusion. Unlike the requirements imposed by the courts of New Jersey and New York, neither the antiassignment clauses in those three cases, nor the clauses at issue in the present case, make use of the words \u201cvoid\u201d or \u201cinvalid.\u201d Yet, the language of all of those clauses unmistakably is couched in terms plain and common enough to provide clear guidance as to the parties\u2019 intent to prohibit assignment. I conclude, therefore, as did the court in <em>Henderson, </em>that \u201cthe plain language of the settlement agreement clearly indicates the parties intended to forbid [the plaintiff] from assigning his periodic payments.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Roadway Express, </em>supra, 720 N.E.2d 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">This conclusion is buttressed, in the present case, by the language of \u00a7 322 (2)(c) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which provides that \u201c[a] contract term prohibiting assignment of rights under the contract . . . <em>is for the benefit of the obligor, </em>and does not prevent the assignee from acquiring rights against the assignor or the obligor from discharging his duty as if there were no such prohibition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Restatement, although cognizant of the need for free transfer of contractual rights, also recognizes, and approves of, the desire of obligors to protect their financial interests. As noted in comment (a) to \u00a7 322 of the Restatement, \u201c[a] term in a contract prohibiting assignment of the rights created may resolve doubts as to whether assignment would materially change the obligor\u2019s duty ... or it may serve to protect the obligor against conflicting claims and the hazard of double liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Although in the present case the trial court concluded that \u201c[Safeco] . . . has not offered evidence of danger of suffering adverse tax effects as a result of the transfer nor is there other evidence of any detriment to it,\u201d that conclusion is irrelevant. As the court in <em>Henderson </em>noted, \u201c[m]ore important than whether or not these tax concerns are real or will actually arise is the fact that the parties implemented the antiassignment provisions with these concerns in mind.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Roadway Express, </em>supra, 720 N.E.2d 1113; accord <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>First Colony Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 26 F. Sup. 2d 1229 n.4 (\u201c[i]t appears that [uncertainty over adverse tax consequences] is what defendants wished to eliminate by including the nonassignability clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In the present case, Safeco may, or may not, suffer a detrimental change in its tax position as the annuity issuer as a result of the proposed transfer. Even if, however, the anticipated change for the worse never ensues, the antiassignment clauses were included to forestall that possibility. Therefore, unless the clauses are waived by Safeco, they exist as a safeguard against such adverse potential future consequences, and must be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">I am not unmindful of the conflicting jurisprudential interests raised by this case. Nor am I unaware of the straitened financial circumstances that may lead persons to trade future contractual rights for money in the here and now. Nevertheless, while I agree that the free assignability of contractual lights is an objective that this court should attempt to promote, free assignability is not the only, or even the paramount, jurisprudential consideration that necessarily must bear on our decision in the present case. Just as important is the need for this court to announce and adhere to a policy of promoting the evenhanded enforcement of fairly made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>and entered-into contracts, even if adherence to this policy causes hardship under a particular set of facts. Certainly, such a policy is preferable to a decision which will \u201clend [this court\u2019s] approval to the voiding of unambiguous, bargained-for contract terms in order to enable [the intervening plaintiff, J. G. Wentworth] to profit . . . from [the plaintiffs] financial distress.\u201d <em>Grieve </em>v. <em>General American Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 58 F.

Rather, it is evidence of those courts\u2019 adherence to one of the bedrock principles of contract law, namely, a court\u2019s responsibility not to \u201cignore the parties\u2019 clear intentions to incorporate [a] bargained-for provision.\u201d <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Roadway Express, </em>supra, 720 N.E.2d 1113.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> The settlement agreement provided in relevant part: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that. . .
