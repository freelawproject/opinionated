We reject the defendant\u2019s claims and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">This case is the companion to <em>State </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>249 Conn. 423, 735 A.2d 778 (1999), where we stated: \u201cThe jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On September 25, 1993, the victim, Norman Jones, a member of the Brotherhood street gang, was ... at a party in Bridgeport. Antoin Pettway also was present at the party. At some point during the evening, the victim and Pettway left the party together and went to the Pequonnock housing project, where Pettway had an apartment. Upon arriving at the housing project, Pettway entered his apartment building. The victim, who did not live at Pequonnock, remained directly outside the building\u2019s front entrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>\u201cPettway encountered [the defendant], a member of the Bush Mob gang, in the building\u2019s lobby. [The defendant] asked Pettway if the person outside the building\u2019s entrance was [the victim], and Pettway responded affirmatively. Both men then left the lobby. [The defendant] entered the stairwell and went upstairs, while Pettway took the elevator to his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u201cShortly thereafter, [the defendant] and [Dion Bush], who also was a member of the Bush Mob gang, entered the lobby from the stairwell. The two men, each of whom was armed with a handgun, then went to the building\u2019s front entrance and pointed their guns in the direction of the victim. [The defendant] diverted his aim from the victim and fired once into the air. [Bush], however, fired several rounds at the victim, stopping only when his gun had been emptied. As [Bush] and [the defendant] then retreated through the lobby, Bernard Johnson, who had been in the lobby at that time, asked them why they had shot at the victim. One of the two men responded that they had done so to retaliate for the recent murder of a Bush Mob gang member.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\u201cWithin minutes, Bridgeport police officers arrived and found the victim lying on the ground a short distance away from the entrance of the building. He had been shot once in the back and was unconscious. He subsequently was transported to Saint Vincent\u2019s Medical Center in Bridgeport, where attempts to save his life proved unsuccessful.\u201d Id., 425-26. Additional facts and procedural history will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to consider a dual inculpatory state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ment that Bush had made to Maria Caban the day after the murder. He argues that the jury\u2019s use of this evidence against him violated his rights under the confrontation clauses of the federal and state constitutions. U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. Caban testified at trial that, around the time of the murder, the Bush Mob frequently held meetings and stored clothing and guns in her Pequonnock apartment and that both Bush and the defendant spent time in her apartment. She testified that, the day after the shooting, she had a conversation with Bush in which he admitted that he had \u201cemptifed] out a gun on [the victim] outside of the building.\u201d Bush also told Caban that the defendant was present during the shooting and that the defendant had fired the first shot into the air. Bush stated that the defendant then \u201cpunked out,\u201d meaning that he became frightened and did not fire any more shots. Caban also testified that Bush told her that the gun used to kill the victim was in her apartment. Bush stated that he planned to leave town, and that Caban would not see him for a while. Caban testified that, several days later, members of the Bush Mob removed the gun from her apartment. Thereafter, Caban did not see any of the male members of the Bush Mob for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The defendant objected to the admission of the statement. The trial court admitted Caban\u2019s testimony but cautioned the jury that Bush\u2019s statements could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>used against the defendant at that time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the end of the trial, the court charged the jury that Caban\u2019s testimony could not be used against the defendant unless the jury found that a conspiracy existed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant took exception to the trial court\u2019s charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to consider Caban\u2019s testimony against the defendant when there was no evidence that, at the time the statement was made, a conspiracy was still in existence. The defendant argues that, at the time of Bush\u2019s conversation with Caban, the object of the conspiracy, the victim\u2019s death, already had been achieved. Furthermore, the defendant argues that there was no evidence that Bush\u2019s statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy, as Bush did not ask Caban to take any action to aid the conspiracy. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">\u201cIt is well established that a coconspirator\u2019s [hearsay] statement, made while the conspiracy is ongoing and in furtherance of the conspiracy, is an exception to the hearsay rule and as such, does not violate the confrontation clause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 Conn. 611, 634, 737 A.2d 404 (1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S. Ct. 1568, 146 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2000). In order to invoke the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, \u201c[t]here must be evidence that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the nonoffering party, and that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bourjaily </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 175, 107 S. Ct. 2775, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987). \u201cThe court must make its preliminary determination by a fair preponderance of the evidence . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vessichio, </em>197 Conn. 644, 655, 500 A.2d 1311 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1986). \u201cA finding as to whether or not a proffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy . . . will not be overturned on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thai, </em>29 F.3d 785, 814 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lan Ngoc Tran </em>v. <em>United States, </em>513 U.S. 977, 115 S. Ct. 456, 130 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1994); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 83 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>United States, </em>528 U.S. 875, 120 S. Ct. 181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1999) (reviewing preliminary determination of admissibility for clear error); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shores, </em>33 F.3d 438, 444-45 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1019, 115 S. Ct. 1365, 131 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1995) (employing clearly erroneous standard to finding that statement was made in course of and in furtherance of conspiracy); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>917 F.2d 457, 464 (10th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1125, 111 S. Ct. 1087, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1192 (1991) (time at which conspiracy ends is factual finding, subject to clearly erroneous standard); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp., </em>871 F.2d 1181, 1198-99 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lavery </em>v. <em>United States, </em>493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 324, 107 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1989) (finding that statement was made in furtherance of conspiracy not reversible unless clearly erroneous); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>866 F.2d 1357, 1363 (11th Cir. 1989) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Posner, </em>764 F.2d 1535, 1537 (11th Cir. 1985) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the conspiracy was ongoing when Bush made the statement to Caban. \u201c[A] conspiracy does not necessarily end with the commission of the target crime. Thus, a subsequent declaration of a conspirator may be admissible against any coconspirator ... if the conspirators were still concerned with the concealment of their criminal conduct or their identity . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 635. <em>In State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 661-62, we held that a statement made by one coconspirator to a third party three days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>after the murder had taken place was admissible against all three conspirators, because there was evidence that the conspiracy was ongoing. The <em>Booth </em>conspirators were jointly concocting alibis at that time. Id., 661. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>218 Conn. 309, 323-24, 589 A.2d 343 (1991), we held that a coconspirator\u2019s statement to a third party while the conspirators were transporting stolen money to a safe hiding place was admissible against another conspirator because the object of the conspiracy, successfully to steal the money and conceal it from detection, had not been accomplished at that time. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>761 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1985) (\u201cthe conspiracy continued so long as the conspirators were acting together to destroy incriminating evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Similarly, in the case at hand, the conspiracy did not end with the victim\u2019s murder. There was evidence that the conspirators were taking actions to conceal the murder weapon and hide their identity from the police at the time that Bush spoke with Caban. Caban testified that Bush told her that the gun used in the murder was in her apartment. She also stated that, several days after the murder, members of the Bush Mob removed the gun from its hiding place. Furthermore, Bush told Caban that he would be leaving town soon. Thereafter, she noticed that no male members of the Bush Mob were around her apartment for some time. The actions to conceal and dispose of the murder weapon and to escape detection for the crime reasonably may be construed as part of the original conspiracy to murder the victim and escape detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The defendant argues that, according to <em>Krulewitch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 69 S. Ct. 716, 93 L. Ed. 790 (1949), a conspiracy ends with the commission of the target crime and does not include subsequent acts to conceal the crime. We agree with the defendant that \u201cafter the central criminal purposes of a conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>have been attained, a subsidiary conspiracy to conceal may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime in order to escape detection and punishment.\u201d <em>Grunewald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 391, 401-402, 77 S. Ct. 963, 1 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1957). However, \u201c[b]y no means does this mean that acts of concealment can never have significance in furthering a criminal conspiracy. . . . [A] vital distinction must be made between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy, and acts of concealment done after these central objectives have been attained . . . .\u201d Id., 405. We conclude that the Bush Mob\u2019s actions, taken within hours of the murder, to hide and dispose of the murder weapon and conceal the identities of the killers were part of the conspiracy to murder the victim rather than independent subsequent acts intended to cover up the crime. The cases cited by the defendant are therefore distinguishable. See <em>Krulewitch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 336 U.S. 442 (statement made one and one-half months after crime not during course of conspiracy); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>12 F.3d 1186, 1196 (2d Cir. 1993) (threats made to informant by coconspirators more than three months after their arrest not during course of conspiracy); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Serrano, </em>870 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1989) (statement at deposition more than eight months after crime not during course of conspiracy); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vowiell, </em>869 F.2d 1264, 1267 (9th Cir. 1989) (statement made four days after crime not during course of conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We also conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that Bush\u2019s statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. \u201c[T]he \u2018in furtherance\u2019 term implies . . . [that] the statements must in some way have been designed to promote or facilitate achievement of the goals of the ongoing conspiracy, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>by, for example, providing reassurance to a coconspirator, seeking to induce a coconspirator\u2019s assistance, serving to foster trust and cohesiveness, or informing coconspirators as to the progress or status of the conspiracy ... or by prompting the listener\u2014who need not be a coconspirator\u2014to respond in a way that promotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity .. . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>supra, 12 F.3d 1196. \u201cStatements made by a co-conspirator to a third party who is not then a member of the conspiracy are considered to be \u2018in furtherance\u2019 of the conspiracy if they are designed to induce that party either to join the conspiracy or to act in a way that will assist it in accomplishing its objectives . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shores, </em>supra, 33 F.3d 444; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp., </em>supra, 871 F.2d 1199 (statement made to third party to reassure and encourage not to reveal incriminating information was \u201cin furtherance\u201d of conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>209 Conn. 564, 577-78, 552 A.2d 805 (1989), we observed that \u201c[one coconspirator] indicated that he wanted to tell [his wife] about the shootings before she heard about it on the news. We view this statement as relevant to the furtherance of the conspiracy. [The coconspirator\u2019s] statement was made to lessen any emotional trauma the killings would cause [his wife], whose house was being used to hide the stolen property and whose further cooperation was obviously necessary. The clear implication is that this statement helped to maintain the cohesiveness of the conspiracy thereby furthering its purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defendant argues that Bush\u2019s statement was merely a confession of guilt made to a friend. He points to the fact that Bush described past events to Caban and did not specifically ask her to take any action on his behalf. The defendant claims that this conversation necessarily was only \u201c \u2018[a] casual admission of culpabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ity\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. Eubanks, 591 F.2d 513, 520 (9th Cir. 1979); that \u201c \u2018spilled the beans\u2019 \u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Posner, </em>supra, 764 F.2d 1538; and did not further the conspiracy. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">There was evidence adduced at trial that Bush confided in Caban about the murder in order to induce her continued cooperation with the Bush Mob, of which the defendant and Bush were members. Caban was someone trusted by the Bush Mob, and she had assisted them in the past. She had permitted the gang to meet at her apartment and store weapons and clothing there. Her further support and cooperation were required to hide the murder weapon in her apartment. It was reasonable to conclude from the evidence that Bush told Caban about the murder and the Bush Mob\u2019s involvement to ensure her continued cooperation and silence. The law does not require a conspirator to ask a third party expressly to do something to further the conspiracy in order for the statement to be admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shores, </em>supra, 33 F.3d 444-45; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mayberry, </em>896 F.2d 1117, 1121-22 (8th Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Herrero, </em>893 F.2d 1512, 1528 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 927, 110 S. Ct. 2623, 110 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp., </em>supra, 871 F.2d 1199; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 866 F.2d 1363; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shoffner, </em>826 F.2d 619, 628 (7th Cir.) cert. denied sub nom. <em>Stange </em>v. <em>United States, </em>484 U.S. 958, 108 S. Ct. 356, 98 L. Ed. 2d 381 (1987). Instead, \u201c[t]he standard to be applied is whether some reasonable basis exists for concluding that the statement furthered the conspiracy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shoffner, </em>supra, 628. We conclude that a reasonable basis did exist, and that there was no impropriety in permitting Bush\u2019s statement to be used against the defendant under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The defendant also claims that audiotapes of telephone calls that he and Bush had made from jail during the trial should not have been admitted into evidence because they were irrelevant, and because their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value. He argues that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury, sua sponte, that the transcripts of the tapes were not to be considered as evidence. Lastly, the defendant argues that the three audiotapes of Bush\u2019s telephone calls from prison should not have been used as evidence against the defendant. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to these claims on appeal. During the first day of trial, Johnson testified that he could not identify the shooters because they were wearing masks. Johnson also testified that his earlier statement to police that Bush and the defendant were the shooters was a lie. When court ended for the day, Johnson was still on the stand, and the state indicated that it would call him as a witness again the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">That evening, the department of correction taped three telephone calls that Bush made from jail. In one conversation, Bush told an unidentified male that \u201c [s]hit went smooth today,\u201d and the male responded, \u201cYo, I did that for you man, with that kid man, B.J.\u201d Johnson\u2019s nickname was B.J. The male then continued: \u201cI went and seen that bitchless bitch from the (unintelligible) last night, and told that bitch, you know what I\u2019m saying . . . [t]old that bitch man, you shut up motherfucker.\u201d In the second telephone call, Bush told an unidentified female \u201cyou got to go and check that Little [racial slur] out.\u201d Caban\u2019s nickname was Little Maria. Bush explained that if Little was \u201cstraight,\u201d he could come home after the trial, and the female responded, \u201cYeah, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>she\u2019s straight then. Definitely straight.\u201d In the third telephone call, Bush told an unidentified male that \u201cshe\u201d is supposed to tell him about Little. He told the man either to ride over to \u201cher crib\u201d or call her, adding \u201c[j]ust make sure them [racial slur] do everything I say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The correction department also taped one telephone conversation that the defendant had with an unidentified woman that same night. On the tape, the defendant told the woman: \u201cDion said to call that number that I called the other night again.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With the defendant on the line, the woman called the number and another female answered the telephone, completing a three way call. The defendant told the second woman that Johnson was \u201chelping us,\u201d and that someone should talk to him \u201csome more.\u201d The defendant then told the woman that \u201cwe\u201d are looking for Darcell Daniels, Caban\u2019s roommate, and that \u201cwe\u201d need to find her \u201c[c]ause Maria (unintelligible) lying and shit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">At trial the next day, Johnson testified that, prior to the trial, someone had approached him regarding his testimony in this case. When asked if he was concerned about his safety with respect to testifying, Johnson answered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d Inspector William Graham of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office later testified that he had met with Johnson a few days before Johnson\u2019s testimony. Graham stated that Johnson had told him that his previous statement to police was accurate, but that he could not testify as to the identity of the shooters at trial because he was concerned about his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Later that same day of the trial, Caban failed to appear to testify as scheduled. She was arrested under a capias, jailed overnight and testified the following day. When Caban took the stand, she stated that she was afraid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>to testify because people had contacted her and told her to change her story. Caban also testified that she had spoken with the defendant since his incarceration and that a friend known as Junior had initiated a three way call with the defendant and Caban, during which the defendant asked if \u201cthey\u201d had contacted her yet. Caban answered that she did not want to talk about it and the conversation ended. A few days before Caban\u2019s scheduled testimony, a woman named Tasha called her and told her to change her story. Caban stated that Tasha also called Johnson and that, on a three way conference call, they all discussed whether Caban and Johnson were required to go to court. Caban testified that Johnson assured the woman that they both had to appear in court. During this call, Caban heard someone in the background say the name Angie. Caban testified that she knew that Angie was a relative of Bush\u2019s\u2014 either his sister or his cousin. Later that same night, a man named Warren, whom Caban had met through the defendant and Bush, approached her and spoke with her about her testimony. Warren told her that, unless she lied, Bush would have to spend many years in jail. Caban also testified that, on the day of her scheduled testimony, she was walking to the courthouse when she recognized some people gathered outside a restaurant. Angie was present with the group. Caban stated that, upon seeing these people, she became frightened and went to a friend\u2019s house instead of coming to court as her subpoena directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The day after Caban testified, the audiotapes of the telephone conversations were admitted into evidence and played for the jury. The jury also was given a transcript of the conversations prepared by Graham. The defendant objected to the admission of the three Bush tapes against him. The state argued that the conversations, together with Caban\u2019s testimony and Johnson\u2019s recanting of his police statement, indicated that Bush <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>and the defendant, directly or indirectly, had contacted Johnson and Caban to influence their testimony. The court responded that, at that time, the tapes were admissible only against Bush, \u201cpending my hearing everything that is to be said.\u201d Later in the trial, the court repeated that the three Bush tapes were admissible against only Bush,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the one tape of the defendant\u2019s call was admissible against the defendant.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In its jury charge, the trial court referred to the tapes when instructing the jury as to consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court later stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201cOn the tapes. There are four tapes for you to play, if you like. . . . Three of the tapes, obviously, are of and offered against Mr. Bush. The fourth tape is offered against [the defendant]. But you, in your overview of all the evidence in the case, including those tapes, you will determine whether or not there are statements made in there which allow you to conclude or not that the information being given off\u2014given by both men at different times to other people were the result of their being coconspirators in this case, or are they individually. And then examine as to whether or not the content of those tapes do in fact give you a basis to conclude that there was any act of intimidation or threat. There may or there may not be. That\u2019s up to you too.\u201d The defendant objected to this instruction, claiming that the court did not make it clear to the jury that it \u201cmay view [the defendant\u2019s] taped conversation as against [the defendant] and Bush\u2019s taped conversation as against Bush.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cNo, I think they\u2019re both treated the same. ... If they find there\u2019s reason to think that they\u2019re acting together in concert and, you know, based on [the defendant\u2019s] tapes, \u2018Bush wants you to call this number,\u2019 and it\u2019s for the mutual benefit of both to have the witnesses lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting these four audiotapes into evidence because they were irrelevant, and because their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. ... A party is not required to offer such proof of a fact that it excludes all other hypotheses; it is sufficient if the evidence tends to make the existence or nonexistence of any other fact more probable or less probable than it would be without such evidence. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 305, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that threats against witnesses are not relevant and are thus inadmissible as evidence unless the defendant is linked in some way to the making of the threats. . . . The reason for the rule is that evidence of threats against witnesses is generally admissible either on the theory that such conduct is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence or on the theory that the making of such threats evinces a consciousness of guilt. . . . Obviously, if the threats cannot be linked to the defendant, evidence of such threats directed toward a witness would be of no probative value for those purposes.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>214 Conn. 122, 129, 571 A.2d 686 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">There was sufficient evidence here from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant and Bush were jointly involved in tampering with and intimidating witnesses. Caban testified that Warren, whom she knew through the defendant, contacted her and told her to lie on the stand. Caban also stated that she had spoken with the defendant since his incarcera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>tion. In the audiotape of his telephone conversation, the defendant states that someone \u201cneed[s]\u201d to talk to Johnson \u201csome more\u201d and he mentions getting someone to talk to Caban \u201c[c]ause Maria (unintelligible) lying and shit.\u201d The defendant also states things in the plural, claiming that Johnson is helping \u201cus,\u201d and that \u201cwe\u201d need to find Caban and talk to her. The defendant is also heard referring to Bush\u2019s directive that a call be made. From this evidence, the jury could have concluded that the defendant and Bush were working together to influence the witnesses\u2019 testimony against them, and the tapes were therefore relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The defendant argues further that even if the evidence was relevant, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the tapes into evidence without ever weighing whether the prejudicial effect of these tapes outweighed their probative value. The defendant argues that the prejudicial effect of admission of the three tapes of Bush in conjunction with the tape of the defendant greatly outweighed any probative value because \u201can overall atmosphere of a conspiracy to tamper with witnesses was created, even though the court never verified that evidence of such a conspiracy existed.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\u201cWe have previously outlined four situations where prejudice to the defendant could outweigh the probative value of evidence. These are: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it. . . . We have also noted, however, that ultimately, [a] trial court has broad discretion in determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>probative value of proffered evidence is outweighed by the prejudice that is likely to result from its admission. . . . We will not overturn its decision absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 307. Although the tapes were prejudicial, all incriminating evidence is prejudicial. The question, rather, is whether the prejudice was unfair. It was not. We conclude that the probative value of the tapes clearly outweighs any prejudicial effect and, therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The defendant also claims that his constitutional right to a fair trial was violated when the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the transcripts of the taped telephone calls made from prison contained the state\u2019s version of the conversations and were therefore not to be considered as evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. After the tapes were admitted into evidence, the state offered a transcript of the conversations prepared by Graham to aid the jury. The trial court permitted the jurors to use the transcripts while they listened to the tapes. The trial court noted, however, that \u201c[the transcript] won\u2019t be marked as an exhibit,\u201d and that the copies provided to the jurors \u201care just an assist to the jury. We\u2019ll collect them [from the jury] afterwards and they can have them again in deliberation.\u201d In its jury charge, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]here are four tapes for you to play, if you like. . . . If not, I\u2019m going to send the transcripts in anyway, so you will have those. They\u2019re not exhibits, but they are an assist for you to have a recollection of that.\u201d The defendant did not object either to the trial court\u2019s instructions, or to the submission of the transcripts during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury sua sponte that the transcripts of the tapes contained the state\u2019s version of the conversations and were therefore not to be considered as evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the defendant concedes that he did not raise this issue at trial, he asserts that this claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim clearly is not one of constitutional magnitude, and we decline to review it for that reason. Although the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the proper use of the transcripts violated his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury, \u201cmerely placing a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim does not make it so. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>242 Conn. 318, 329, 699 A.2d 911 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>250 Conn. 807, 815, 740 A.2d 371 (1999). Indeed, we have stated that \u201cit would trivialize the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>stitution to transmute a nonconstitutional claim into a constitutional claim simply because of the label placed on it by a party or because of a strained connection between it and a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 817, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). We decline to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim because it is not of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We also conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not invoke the plain error doctrine. \u201cThe plain error doctrine of Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 requires a defendant to demonstrate that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice. . . . We repeatedly have observed that plain error is not even implicated unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 814. The fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings was not implicated by the trial court\u2019s instructions permitting the jury to use the transcript as an aid. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim does not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The defendant also argues that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to consider Bush\u2019s taped conversations against him. He claims that the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule is inapplicable here because Bush\u2019s conversations occurred long after the conspiracy to murder the victim had ended. The state counters that the trial court properly instructed the jury that the tapes could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and that the conversations were not hearsay because they were not admitted for their truth. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>\u201cA statement made out-of-court that is offered to establish the truth of the matter contained in the statement is hearsay, and as such is inadmissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 632, 626 A.2d 273 (1993). <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 670, 735 A.2d 267 (1999). However, [a] statement made out of court is not hearsay unless it is offered to establish the truth of the facts contained in the statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 576, 560 A.2d 426 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>253 Conn. 354, 364-65, 752 A.2d 40 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The truth of the statements contained in the audiotapes was irrelevant, as the tapes were offered to show consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he state of mind that is characterized as guilty consciousness or consciousness of guilt is strong evidence that a defendant is indeed guilty. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>214 Conn. 616, 626, 573 A.2d 716 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 112, 659 A.2d 683 (1995). \u201cCourts may admit evidence of threats against government witnesses on the grounds that an effort to intimidate a witness tends to show consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>154 F.3d 772, 780 (8th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1169, 119 S. Ct. 1090, 143 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1999). Moreover, the telephone calls in this case may be considered an act in furtherance of a conspiracy, or be admissible as evidence that a conspiracy existed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>168 F.3d 1089, 1093 (8th Cir. 1999); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roldan-Zapata, </em>916 F.2d 795, 803-804 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 940, 111 S.

Ed. 2d 453 (1991) (coconspirator\u2019s statement to witness was plainly relevant to show consciousness of guilt and admissible against all defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>dants); <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 365 (statement made to coconspirator was itself evidence of conspiracy, not hearsay) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 636 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The defendant argues that the Bush tapes should not have been admitted against him because the conspiracy to murder the victim had long since ended. The trial court properly instructed the jury that the tapes could be used as consciousness of guilt evidence against both defendants if the jury concluded that witnesses were threatened and intimidated with the knowledge, consent and authorization of both the defendant and Bush. See footnote 13 of this opinion. We have concluded that there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the defendant and Bush were jointly involved in the intimidation of witnesses. All four tapes were properly used against both defendants as evidence of their consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The defendant and Bush were both on trial for the murder of the victim. The evidence produced at the trial showed that the defendant and Bush were members of the Bush Mob, a street gang. The evidence also showed that the Bush Mob was determined to kill the victim to avenge the killing of one of its members by the Brotherhood street gang, to hide the murder weapon, a handgun, to protect members of the gang from discovery, and to intimidate and silence any witnesses who could testify against Bush Mob members. This was an atmosphere of violence to which we alluded in <em>State </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>241 Conn. 502, 508-509, 699 A.2d 872 (1997). At the trial, Caban, although subpoenaed, failed to appear to testify and was arrested under a capias to bring her into the courtroom. Johnson did appear at court to testify but, when called to the stand, he recanted his statement to the police implicating the defendant and Bush. The state then introduced Johnson\u2019s written statement under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Conn. 743, 747, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). We have said that the <em>Whelan </em>principle\u2019s acceptance in our court is but a reflection of the sad reality that witnesses to violent and fearful crimes may wish to say nothing or, if they do, later say that they saw nothing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>supra, 508-509. We conclude that the record here supports the trial court\u2019s admission of the telephone tapes and its instructions as to their use against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motions to sever his trial from that of his codefendant, Bush. The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Prior to trial, the state moved for joinder of the trials of the defendant and Bush. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion. During voir dire, the defendant made a motion for severance claiming that the admission of Caban\u2019s formal statement to the police and her proposed testimony would unduly prejudice him. The defendant argued that Caban\u2019s testimony was admissible against Bush but not against the defendant, and, therefore, its admission would violate his confrontation rights pursuant to <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968). The court ruled that the motion was premature, stating: \u201cI know of no reason at the present time why both men should not be tried together. You may reserve your renewals as time goes on if the posture changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The defendant renewed his motion to sever several times during the trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Each time he renewed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>motion, the defendant objected to either the testimony of Caban, the admission of a police report regarding her statements to the police, or the admission of the three audiotapes of Bush\u2019s telephone conversations. The trial court denied his motion on every occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joint trial because the admission of Bush\u2019s hearsay statement through the testimony of Caban inculpated the defendant and violated his confrontation rights pursuant to <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 391 U.S. 123. The defendant also claims that there was extensive evidence against Bush, and that the \u201cspillover\u201d effect of this evidence substantially prejudiced his case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\u201c[W]hether to consolidate or sever the trials of defendants involved in the same criminal incident lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . Ordinarily justice is better subserved where parties are tried together. . . . Joint trials of persons jointly indicted or informed against are the rule, and separate trials the exception resting in the discretion of the court. ... A separate trial will be ordered where the defenses of the accused are antagonistic, or evidence will be introduced against one which will not be admissible against others, and it clearly appears that a joint trial will probably be prejudicial to the rights of one or more of the accused. . . . [T]he phrase prejudicial to the rights of the [accused] means something more than that a joint trial will probably be less advantageous to the accused than separate trials. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>229 Conn. 125, 158-59, 640 A.2d 572 (1994); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 56, 630 A.2d 990 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>201 Conn. 659, 668-69, 519 A.2d 26 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vinal, </em>198 Conn. 644, 648, 504 A.2d 1364 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\u201cA joint trial expedites the administration of justice, reduces the congestion of trial dockets, conserves judicial time, lessens the burden upon citizens who must sacrifice both time and money to serve upon juries, and avoids the necessity of recalling witnesses who would otherwise be called to testify only once. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 404 F.2d 1193, 1196 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 1004, 89 S.

The <em>Bruton </em>court held that the admission of the codefendant\u2019s statements \u2018added substantial, perhaps even critical weight to the Government\u2019s case [against Bruton] in a form not subject to cross-examining, since [the codefendant declarant] Evans did not take the stand,\u2019 and therefore, Bruton had been denied his rights of confrontation. [Id.], 128. In <em>Bruton, </em>however, the court emphasized that it was dealing with a case in which \u2018the hearsay statement inculpating petitioner was clearly inadmissible against him under traditional rules of evidence.\u2019 Id., 128 n.3. Several lower courts have thus concluded that <em>Bruton </em>has no application when the statements of a codefendant are otherwise admissible against the defendant. See, e.g., <em>Kay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>421 F.2d 1007 (9th Cir. 1970) (cocon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>spirator statements); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 303 N.E.2d 338 (1973) (spontaneous utterance); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gauthier, </em>28 Mich.

See part I of this opinion. Because the statement was otherwise admissible against the defendant, the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of this statement in the joint trial violated the principle of <em>Bruton </em>must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the spillover effect of the extensive evidence admitted against Bush. In making this claim, the defendant points to testimony from Caban about the threats she received during the trial, and testimony from Detective Michael Kerwin of the Bridgeport police department regarding an April 12, 1996 interview with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Caban regarding the victim\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this evidence was not admissible against him and was highly prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Caban\u2019s testimony regarding the threats she received during the trial was admissible against both defendants, as there was evidence that the defendant was involved in the attempts to influence witnesses. Although the defendant contends that he was not sufficiently linked to this evidence for it to be used against him, the jury reasonably could have concluded otherwise. We have previously outlined the evidence linking the defendant to that evidence. See part II A of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">During cross-examination of Kerwin, Bush put into evidence a police report of Caban\u2019s April 12 meeting with the police. The report contained information that was substantially similar to Caban\u2019s testimony, except that it included details concerning a conversation Caban allegedly had with the defendant after the shooting. According to the report, the defendant told Caban that, after the shooting, the victim fell off his bike and crashed. The defendant also told Caban that he then approached the victim and took the victim\u2019s gun. Bush offered the police report in an attempt to impeach Caban. The defendant argues that, because the state objected to Bush\u2019s offer of the police report, it follows that the state would not have admitted the report into evidence if the defendant had been tried separately. The defendant claims that, because of the joint trial, he was forced to defend himself against both the state and Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, however, the fact that Bush, as opposed to the state, put the report into evidence did not require separate trials. The defendant conceded at oral argument that the state could have offered this police report against the defendant at a separate trial. Whether the state would have offered it is speculative and is not relevant to this analysis. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the joint trial because of the admission of the police report is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">We similarly reject the defendant\u2019s spillover effect argument. \u201c[I]t is not enough for the defendant to show that a joint trial was less advantageous than a separate trial would have been. Rather, the defendant must prove substantial injustice. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 160-61. We decline to hold that a separate trial is necessary whenever any potentially incriminating evidence against one codefendant is introduced during a joint trial. See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>[481 U.S. 200, 209-10, 107 S. Ct. 1702, 95 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1987)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 633. The jury was instructed numerous times to consider the case against each defendant independently. \u201cIn the absence of a showing to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed the instructions of the court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 633. We conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court took on the role of an advocate for the state by questioning witnesses throughout the trial, thereby depriving the defendant of his due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. U.S. Const., amends. V, XIV; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s questioning of two witnesses\u2014Johnson and Pettway\u2014improperly revealed to the jury that the court did not believe their testimony, thereby prejudicing the defense. The defendant also argues that the court\u2019s constant questioning of numerous other witnesses introduced irrelevant and prejudicial evidence into the tr ial. While the defendant did not object to the trial court\u2019s questions on these grounds during the trial, he now claims that he is entitled to relief under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\u201cBefore turning to the allegations made by the defendant, we recite certain well established principles regarding the responsibilities of the trial judge in conducting a criminal trial. Due process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8 . . . . In a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is his responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>197 Conn. 413, 424D-25, 504 A.2d 1020 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>[198 Conn. 1, 10, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985)]. Consistent with his neutral role, the trial judge is free to question witnesses or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>intervene in a case in an effort to clarify testimony and assist the jury in understanding the evidence so long as he does not appear partisan in doing so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>[183 Conn. 394, 401-402, 439 A.2d 387 (1981)]. Thus, when it clearly appears to the judge that for one reason or another the case is not being presented intelligibly to the jury, the judge is not required to remain silent. On the contrary, the judge may, by questions to a witness, elicit relevant and important facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 11.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 740, 595 A.2d 322 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\u201cOne of the chief roles of the trial judge is to see that there is no misunderstanding of a witness\u2019s testimony. The judge has a duty to comprehend what a witness says as much as it is his duty to see that the witness communicates with the jury in an intelligible manner. A trial judge can do this in a fair and unbiased way. His attempt to do so should not be a basis of error. Where the testimony is confusing or not altogether clear the alleged jeopardy to one side caused by the clarification of a witness\u2019s statement is certainly outweighed by the desirability of factual understanding. The trial judge should strive toward verdicts of fact rather than verdicts of confusion. <em>Ray </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 F.2d 258, 261 (8th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 913, 87 S. Ct. 863, 17 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1967), quoted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>McColgin, </em>535 F.2d 471, 475 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 853, 97 S. Ct. 145, 50 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1976).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 402-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court inappropriately interjected itself into Johnson\u2019s testimony four times. The first instance of alleged impropriety occurred during the state\u2019s direct examination of John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>son, when the trial court asked the court reporter to read back part of the testimony and then asked Johnson to affirm that it was correct.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the court\u2019s action unduly highlighted the importance of this testimony. We disagree. The trial court asked for Johnson\u2019s testimony to be read back to ensure that the jury heard the shooters\u2019 statement accurately. The trial court did not comment on the statement\u2019s importance in any manner. Although this is a practice that should be employed sparingly and with caution, the court\u2019s merely asking for repetition of a statement does not necessarily render the trial court an advocate for the state. Thus, the defendant cannot prevail on this unpreserved claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The second instance of alleged impropriety occurred during the state\u2019s direct examination of Johnson, when the trial court instructed Johnson to address the question that had been presented.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>that the trial court assumed the role of advocate by challenging the appropriateness of Johnson\u2019s response to the state\u2019s question. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Attempts to facilitate a witness\u2019 understanding of a question are not improper. See <em>State </em>v. Harris, 28 Conn. App. 474, 479-81, 612 A.2d 123, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 926, 614 A.2d 828 (1992) (no error where trial court rephrased state\u2019s questions after witness failed to answer appropriately). The trial court here was fulfilling its function of ensuring that the witness answered the state\u2019s question. Thus, the defendant cannot prevail on this unpreserved claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The third claim of alleged impropriety involves the trial court\u2019s questions to Johnson regarding his inability to read his prior statement to the police.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this questioning was improper because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>served to impeach Johnson\u2019s testimony that his prior statement was a lie and that he could not identify the shooters. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The trial court questioned Johnson about his inability to read in order to clarify whether he could not read that day because he needed glasses or whether he could not read at all. The trial court reasonably sought to clarify Johnson\u2019s ambiguous answer. It did so without impugning Johnson\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that it \u201cshould not draw any inferences whatsoever from any questions I may have asked any witnesses in the case. If I did, and I did, give no consideration to the answers given to any questions I may have asked. You have to examine the testimony of the witnesses that were presented here before you.\u201d The court later stated: \u201cNow, if I\u2019ve made any reference to the position of the state or the accused\u2014I don\u2019t think I have\u2014I have no interest. This is not my case; it\u2019s your case. You\u2019re the people that have to decide it. . . . It\u2019s not any intention on my part to convey to you, directly or indirectly, any feeling I would have on the outcome. I have an interest solely in seeing that it\u2019s tried fair and square, that it\u2019s tried in an orderly and timely manner. I have no interest in the verdict you are to render. That is your function; it is your responsibility.\u201d \u201cWe have always given great weight to curative instructions in assessing claimed errors.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 17; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 480-81 (court\u2019s questions clarifying testimony harmless due to curative instruction). In light of the curative instructions given by the trial court, the defendant cannot prevail on this unpreserved claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The last claim of alleged impropriety with respect to the trial court\u2019s questioning of Johnson involves inquiries by the trial court regarding the things that Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>could and could not do when he was under the influence of drugs, and how long he usually would remain under the influence. The defendant claims that this testimony was irrelevant and inflammatory, and that the trial court\u2019s questions implied an opinion that the court did not believe that Johnson was so high on drugs that he did not know what he was doing when he made his statement to the police. The defendant also argues that, similar to <em>State </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>16 Conn. App. 18, 28, 547 A.2d 47 (1988), the trial court\u2019s questioning on the effects of being high \u201cevinced not merely an educational process for the jury but an overall atmosphere indicative of judicial condemnation of the drug scene in which the defendant was alleged to be involved.\u201d Id. (reversing defendant\u2019s conviction because court engaged in lengthy dialogue with state\u2019s witness regarding origin, properties and uses of cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s questioning on this matter was extensive, we conclude that it did not constitute a violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process. In light of the fact that Johnson\u2019s statement and his testimony were contradictory, Johnson\u2019s condition when he made the police statement was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of which story to believe.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>trial court\u2019s questions aimed to clarify for the jury what Johnson meant by \u201chigh,\u201d so that the jury could understand the implication of Johnson\u2019s testimony. This was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of credibility. The trial court did not comment on Johnson\u2019s credibility nor did it attack or credit his testimony in any manner. Contra State v. Smith, 200 Conn. 544, 550, 512 A.2d 884 (1986) (trial court\u2019s questioning of state\u2019s witness about his experiences as Iranian hostage prejudicial to defendant because it bolstered witness\u2019 credibility and was not relevant to case).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 18, is distinguishable from this case. In <em>Delarosa, </em>the defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to sell, and the trial court\u2019s apparent condemnation of drug use therefore reflected on the defendant himself. In contrast, the defendant here was not alleged to have been involved in drug activities, and the trial court\u2019s comments regarding drug use were directed at a state\u2019s witness, not the defendant.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>We conclude, after a careful review of the record, that the trial court\u2019s questioning of Johnson regarding the fact that he was on drugs when he gave his statement to the police was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of credibility and was not prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s case. Moreover, in view of the trial court\u2019s curative instructions, set forth previously, we find that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process was not violated by this questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s questioning of Pettway violated his constitutional rights to due process. The following additional facts are relevant to the resolution of this claim. Bush called Pettway as his sole defense witness. Pettway testified that, on the night of the murder, he and the victim were at a party. Pettway and the victim then left the party on the victim\u2019s dirt bike, with Pettway driving. They went to the Pequonnock apartments, where Pettway lived at the time, to get the victim\u2019s goggles, which Pettway had borrowed. When they arrived at the apartment building, Pettway left the bike running, dismounted it and went inside. Pettway testified that he went to his apartment, retrieved the goggles and entered the elevator to go back downstairs. Pettway testified that, while he was in the elevator, he heard shots. He then exited the elevator on the second floor and ran up the stairs to his apartment. Pettway testified that, in the apartment, his aunt then told him, \u201cYour friend fell off the bike.\u201d Pettway looked out the window and saw the bike and the victim lying on the ground. He ran outside to see if the victim was all right, and stayed with him until the police and ambulance arrived. Pettway testified that he was \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201clost\u201d and \u201cshocked\u201d during this time period.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He further stated that he did not tell the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>who the victim was because they did not ask him. When the victim was taken to the hospital, Pettway went back to his apartment. On cross-examination by the state, Pettway denied that he had dropped the victim off with any knowledge of what was going to happen to him there. When all the parties had finished examining Pettway, the trial court questioned him as to the location where Pettway had found the victim lying on the ground.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s questioning implied that it agreed with the state\u2019s theory that Pettway had dropped the victim off with knowledge that he would be murdered. We disagree. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>court\u2019s questions focused on the position of the dirt bike prior to and after the shooting. The trial court also asked about Pettway\u2019s actions when he approached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>victim in order to clarify his testimony that, at that point in time, Pettway did not know that the victim had been shot. We fail to see anything in the court\u2019s questioning that implies partiality toward the state\u2019s theory that Pettway was involved in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The defendant also argues that the trial court\u2019s question, \u201cHysterical; is that right?\u201d indicated that it did not believe Pettway\u2019s testimony. See footnote 25 of this opinion. We disagree. The trial court\u2019s question merely served to clarify what word the witness had used in describing his state of mind. Pettway then affirmed that the court had heard him correctly. The defendant has given us no reason to believe that the trial court\u2019s statement did anything other than clarify the witness\u2019 testimony for the jury. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s questioning of Pettway did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court committed misconduct when it questioned a variety of other witnesses during the trial. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s questions brought forth irrelevant and prejudicial information to which the jury otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>would not have been exposed and likely indicated to the jurors that the defendant was not being an effective advocate for himself.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Upon a review of the record, we find that, in each of the alleged instances of impropriety, the trial court merely clarified the testimony for the jury and did not assume the role of advocate for a certain position. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>197 Conn. 629, 641, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>500 A.2d 1303 (1985) (no abuse of discretion where court\u2019s questions \u201ccan reasonably be viewed as intended to clear up a possible misunderstanding by the jury\u201d). As we stated in <em>State </em>v. Gordon, supra, 197 Conn. 425-26, \u201c [t]he judge took no position of advocacy regarding the outcome of the case, and made no improper comments on the significance of the evidence presented. At no time did the judge convey to the jury his opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\u201d Moreover, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s questions implied to the jury that defense counsel failed to ask questions properly. Contra <em>State v. Echols, </em>170 Conn. 11, 13-16, 364 A.2d 225 (1975) (new trial ordered when court told counsel to \u201c \u2018[a]sk [a witness] why\u2019 \u201d). The defendant therefore cannot prevail on these unpreserved claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s questioning did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, we caution that trial courts should be careful to avoid giving the impression of passing upon the credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal based on insufficient evidence to support a conviction for accessory to murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The defendant argues that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, demonstrates that the defendant did not shoot at the victim, but rather that he shot upward into the air. This evidence, the defendant argues, does not support a finding of an intent to commit murder. As a result, the defendant argues that the state failed to sustain its burden of proving this element beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus, that the defendant\u2019s convictions for both murder as an accessory and conspiracy to commit murder must be vacated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. ... As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>247 Conn. 616, 620-21, 725 A.2d 306 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">\u201cIn order to be convicted under our murder statute, the defendant must possess the specific intent to cause the death of the victim. . . . To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. ... To be guilty as an accessory one must share the criminal intent and community of unlawful purpose with the perpetrator of the crime and one must knowingly and wilfully assist the perpetrator in the acts which prepare for, facilitate or consummate it. . . . Thus, intent is a necessary element to the crime of murder whether the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the principal or merely an accessory.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 655-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\u201cIntent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of the accused\u2019s state of mind is rarely available. . . . Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. . . . Intent is a question of fact, the determination of which should stand unless the conclusion drawn by the trier is an unreasonable one.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">We have held that \u201c[t]o establish the crime of conspiracy under \u00a7 53a-48 ... it must be shown that an agreement was made between two or more persons to engage in conduct constituting a crime and that the agreement was followed by an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by any one of the conspirators. The state must also show intent on the part of the accused that conduct constituting a crime be performed. . . . Further, the prosecution must show both that the conspirators intended to agree and that they intended to commit the elements of the underlying offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The jury reasonably could have found that the defendant had the intent to cause the victim\u2019s death. There was evidence that the defendant had an agreement with Bush, a fellow gang member, to avenge the death of one of their \u201cbrothers\u201d by murdering the victim. The defendant was in the lobby of the apartment building speaking with Johnson prior to the murder. When Pettway entered the lobby, the defendant asked him who was outside sitting on the dirt bike. After the defendant confirmed that the victim was outside, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>went upstairs and summoned Bush. Shortly thereafter, both the defendant and Bush, armed with handguns, returned to the lobby from the stairwell above, and peeked around the comer in the direction of the victim. Bush asked the defendant if he was ready, the defendant answered yes, and Bush started firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">An intent to kill may be inferred from the use of handguns. Id., 367. Although the defendant diverted his aim from the victim and fired only once into the air, Bush fired several rounds at the victim. The defendant and Bush then escaped through the lobby, where Johnson asked them why they had shot the victim. Either Bush or the defendant responded that they had done so in retaliation for the recent murder of one of their \u201cbrothers.\u201d This evidence supports a finding that the defendant aided Bush with the intent to kill the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The defendant argues that, because the evidence demonstrates that he did not shoot directly at the victim, but rather shot upward into the air, the state failed to sustain its burden of proving intent beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree. The accessory to murder and conspiracy to commit murder charges do not require a finding that the defendant aimed a gun toward the victim with the intent to shoot the victim himself. As long as the evidence demonstrates the defendant\u2019s intent to kill the victim, and his knowing assistance in the murder, there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had conspired to murder the victim and acted as an accessory. We conclude that the evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was guilty of murder as an accessory and conspiracy to commit murder beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (a) provides: \u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1c8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilfy of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception ....</p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">\u201c(c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...

But since they are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, statements of either one may be used as probative value in respect to the other defendant as well if you are satisfied, and that won\u2019t come until you are given the case, that there was a conspiracy and that these people participated knowingly in conspiring to commit the crime of murder, if you find that, and an overt act had been completed in furtherance of it, then you may consider any statements made by any members of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201cNow, I don\u2019t know what you are going to find later on, but just be cautious. And when you are listening [to] the statements that apply to Bush, they remain with him for the time being. Okay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201c[DJuring the course of trial certain evidence was admitted for you to consider in the case of one of the accused but you were instructed that this particular evidence was not to be considered by you in connection with charges against the other accused. Reference is therefore being made to the statement that Mr. Bush was alleged to have made to Maria Caban, and she testified as to what he allegedly said to her, which included a reference to the codefendant in respect to the charge of murder. It was originally objected to and I allowed it to be offered with the caution at that time that you\u2019ll consider it only against Mr. Bush and not against [the defendant],</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">\u201cI tell you now in regard to the conspiracy charge that any statement made by any coconspirator, if you find that there was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, an agreement between these two men to commit the act of murder in respect to the victim in this case. If that agreement is [viable] and there\u2019s a[n] overt act that has taken place in furtherance of the agreement, to wit, the shooting and killing of the young man outside, then any statement made by any coconspirator is admissible against all participants in the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\"> The defendant argued: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2014just to\u2014for the record, to suggest that our position is that Bush\u2019s statements are not statements in furtherance of the conspiracy, but, rather, in the nature of admissions and confessions and not in furtherance of the conspiracy, and so therefore should not be used as against [the defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Later, the defendant stated: \u201cFinally, on the conspiracy, I just renew our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>objection and suggest that what were claiming is that these statements by Mr. Bush were not in furtherance of the conspiracy, but were, rather, confessions by him and therefore it should not be used against [the defendant] as to the conspiracy charge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> On appeal, the defendant argues that, on the tape, he asked: \u201c[D]id you call that number I told you to call the other night?\u201d See footnote 13 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b776-5\"> The trial court stated: \u201cI\u2019m going to repeat one more time that whatever the evidence is coming in this case, you will recognize it as being attributable solely to Mr. Bush, solely, at this juncture. Even if [the defendant\u2019s] name appears, it is Mr. Bush against whom this testimony would be offered, and you may only consider it in regard to the effect it may have.

Whenever a person is on trial for a criminal offense, it is proper to show that person\u2019s conduct as well as any statements made by him after the alleged criminal offense which may be fairly\u2014may fairly be inferred to have been influenced by the criminal act. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">\u201cEvidence of threats made against a witness or attempts to influence the testimony of a witness in a criminal prosecution are generally admissible if it can be shown that there is a connection between the acts and the defendant.

The defendant argues that where the state claims 1he defendant stated, \u201cDion said to call that number that I called the other night again,\u201d he, in actuality, slated, \u201cdid you call that number I told you to call the other night?\u201d The defendant did not make this argument at trial.

Neither the defendant nor Bush requested that the jury be so instructed, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b785-9\"> The defendant renewed his motion to sever prior to Caban\u2019s testimony at several points during the trial, including during her testimony, during Detective Michael Kerwin\u2019s testimony concerning a police report about Caban\u2019s statements to the police and during Correction Officer William Grady\u2019s testimony concerning the audiotapes of telephone conversations from jail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> The defendant also claims that he was unfairly prejudiced by the spillover effect of the three audiotapes of Bush\u2019s telephone conversations from jail. We previously have concluded that those audiotapes were admissible against the defendant as nonhearsay consciousness of guilt evidence. See part II of this opinion. Thus, we address the defendant\u2019s severance arguments only with respect to Caban\u2019s testimony of intimidation and the police report regarding her previous statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to . . . a speedy, public trial by an impartial jury.
