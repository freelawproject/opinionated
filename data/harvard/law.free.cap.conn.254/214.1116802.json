We conclude that he is.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The relevant facts and procedural history are undisputed. \u201cThe petitioner [was placed] in the custody of the [respondent] commissioner of correction [(commissioner) on] June 17, 1989, when he was arrested and held in lieu of bond on a charge of a violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Statutes [Rev. to 1989] \u00a7 21a-277 [a].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He earned nineteen days of presentence good time when he was sentenced ... on August 15, 1989, to a term of three years [imprisonment]. On February 9, 1990, while on supervised home release, the petitioner was arrested on other charges and reincarcerated. His home release status was revoked and he continued to serve time on his original three year sentence. On June 5, 1990, he was sentenced ... to eight years [imprisonment] on one count of a violation of General Statutes [Rev. to 1989] \u00a7 53a-122<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and eight years [imprisonment] on one count of a violation of General Statutes [Rev. to 1989] \u00a7 53a-167c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6Both [sentences] were to run concurrently] [with] each other and concurrently] with the sentence of three years he was already serving. [When his two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>eight year concurrent sentences were imposed], the petitioner had earned ninety days of [statutory] good time credit on [his original three year sentence] including thirty days while on supervised home release in addition to the nineteen days of [presentence] good time prior to [his three year sentence] for a total of 109 days good time. On September 25, 1991, the petitioner received an additional consecutive one year sentence . . . for a violation of General Statutes [Rev. to 1989] \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (1) [as amended by Public Acts 1990, Nos. 90-157, \u00a7 2, and 90-250, \u00a7 2],</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u201cThe petitioner brought this habeas petition because the [commissioner], in calculating the petitioner\u2019s good time credit, did not give the petitioner nineteen days of presentence good time and ninety days of [statutory] good time by failing to construe the multiple sentences as one continuous term [under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>for the purposes of calculating good time. The petitioner did not receive [presentence] good time credit or the [statutory] good time credits earned on the three year sentence, on the eight year sentencefs] or on the one year consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cThe [habeas] court agreed with the petitioner that on the basis of ... \u00a7 18-7 and <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 230 Conn. 17, 22, 644 A.2d 874 (1994), the petitioner\u2019s good time credits under [his original three year sentence] should be credited to his overall effective sentence of nine years. The court granted the habeas petition and awarded the petitioner 109 days of good time credit. The court denied the [commissioner\u2019s] petition for certification to appeal [pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b)* ***<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] because the case was not one of first impression and because if the petitioner were held during the time of appeal, he would lose his 109 days of good time credit.\u201d <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>47 Conn. App. 752, 753-55, 706 A.2d 1383 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The commissioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court, claiming that the habeas court improperly had: (1) denied his petition for certification to appeal; and (2) ordered that the 109 days of good time credit earned by the petitioner be applied toward the petitioner\u2019s total effective nine year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>term of imprisonment. The Appellate Court dismissed the commissioner\u2019s appeal on the ground that the habeas court had not improperly denied the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. In so concluding, the Appellate Court explained: \u201cIn <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 662 A.2d 718 (1995), the Supreme Court set the standard for deciding abuse of discretion on the issue of certification in such a case. [The Appellate Court] recognize[s] that [i]n enacting ... \u00a7 52-470 (b), the legislature intended to discourage frivolous habeas appeals. <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 616, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). A habeas appeal that satisfies one of the criteria set forth in <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991), is not, however, frivolous and warrants appellate review if the appellant can show: that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 616, quoting <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 432. Thus, if an appeal is not frivolous, the habeas court\u2019s failure to grant certification to appeal is an abuse of discretion. <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 616. . . . <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 150-51. . . . <em>Graham v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>39 Conn. App. 473, 476, 664 A.2d 1207, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 930, 667 A.2d 800 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u201cThe [commissioner] has not sustained his burden of persuasion that the [habeas] court\u2019s denial of his certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that an injustice has been done. <em>Hinton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>43 Conn. App. 549, 551, 684 A.2d 733 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 958, 688 A.2d 327 (1997). The habeas court and [the Appellate] [C]ourt are bound by the clear language of General Statutes \u00a7 18-7, which provides in relevant part: When any pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>oner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section. ... It is further clear that this portion of \u00a7 18-7 applies to General Statutes [Rev. to 1997] \u00a7 18-7a,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the good time credits for prisoners sentenced after July 1, 1983. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 581, 587 A.2d 116 (1991). The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>McCarthy . . </em>. and <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 20-21, as well as [the Appellate] [C]ourt\u2019s decision in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>34 Conn. App. 503, 505, 642 A.2d 724, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 908, 644 A.2d 922 (1994), make it clear that all multiple sentences both concurrent and consecutive, whether imposed at the same time or at different times, must be aggregated for the purpose of calculating good time. [The Appellate Court] agree [s] with the habeas court that the petitioner is not seeking additional presentence confinement credits, and that General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the case of <em>Payton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Albert, </em>209 Conn. 23, 29-30, 547 A.2d 1 (1988), cited by the [commissioner], deal with the transferability of jail time credit<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and do not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cWe find that none of the three criteria of <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 431-32, has been met and, therefore, the [habeas] court did not abuse its discretion in denying the [commissioner] certification to appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 755-57. Accordingly, the Appellate Court dismissed the commissioner\u2019s appeal. Id., 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We granted the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following two issues: \u201c(1) Whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the [habeas] court did not abuse its discretion in denying the [commissioner\u2019s] certification to appeal to the Appellate Court?\u201d And \u201c(2) [w]hether the Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Court properly concluded that [presentence] good time and statutory good time earned on a sentence must be shifted from an earlier sentence and credited to subsequently imposed concurrent sentences?\u201d <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 245 Conn. 901, 719 A.2d 1164 (1998). This appeal followed. Although we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly upheld the habeas court\u2019s denial of the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, we nevertheless agree with the determinations of the Appellate Court and the habeas court that the petitioner is entitled to have his total effective term of imprisonment reduced by the 109 days of presentence and statutory good time credit that he had earned while incarcerated in connection with his original three year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The petitioner is no longer incarcerated, having served his sentences less the 109 days good time credit that the habeas court had ordered the commissioner to award to the petitioner. The petitioner claims that, because he is no longer confined, this case is moot and, therefore, we must dismiss the appeal. Because \u201c[m]ootness implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction . . . [it] is ... a threshold matter for us to resolve.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>236 Conn. 89, 93, 671 A.2d 345 (1996). We disagree that the case is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u201cIt is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The commissioner asserts that, if he prevails in this appeal, he will seek custody of the petitioner for the period of time that he was required to award the petitioner as good time credit pursuant to the judgment of the habeas court. Although the petitioner questions the authority of the commissioner to have him recommitted under such circumstances, we previously have indicated that such a good faith representation by the commissioner is sufficient to obviate any potential mootness issue. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 195, 550 A.2d 309 (1988); see also <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 26 n.4. Accordingly, we reject the petitioner\u2019s mootness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">We now turn to the first certified issue, namely, whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (b). We disagree with the determination of the Appellate Court that the habeas court properly denied the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal [under \u00a7 52-470 (b)], apetitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is the proper standard because that is the standard to which we have held other litigants whose rights to appeal the legislature has conditioned upon the obtaining of the trial court\u2019s permission.\u201d <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 612. \u201cWe recognize that [i]n enacting \u00a7 52-470 (b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the legislature intended to discourage frivolous habeas appeals. ... A habeas appeal that satisfies one of the criteria set forth in <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>[supra, 498 U.S. 431-32], is not, however, frivolous and warrants appellate review if the appellant can show: that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . Thus, if an appeal is not frivolous, the habeas court\u2019s failure to grant certification to appeal is an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 150-51; see also <em>James L. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>245 Conn. 132, 137-38, 712 A.2d 947 (1998) (observing that this court\u2019s \u201crecent habeas corpus jurisprudence has construed \u00a7 52-470 [b] narrowly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We are persuaded that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. Although we ultimately agree with the habeas court that this case is controlled by our holding in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 17; see part III A of this opinion; the commissioner has raised a colorable claim that the petitioner is not entitled to the nineteen days of presentence good time credit that the habeas court had ordered the commissioner to award to the petitioner. See part III C of this opinion. Specifically, the commissioner had claimed that the habeas court\u2019s decision with respect to the petitioner\u2019s presentence good time credit is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 31-32, in which we concluded that jail time credits<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> earned under \u00a7 18-98d (a); see footnote 9 of this opinion; while awaiting sentencing for one offense may not be applied to reduce a second, subsequently imposed prison sentence. In the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>sioner\u2019s view, because, under <em>Payton, </em>jail time credit cannot be transferred from one sentence to another, any presentence good time credit that the petitioner had earned on one sentence cannot be credited toward his subsequent sentences. This claim is not frivolous. We conclude, therefore, that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We next must decide whether the habeas court properly determined that the petitioner is entitled to have good time credit applied toward his total effective term of imprisonment of nine years for the ninety days of statutory good time and nineteen days of presentence good time that he had earned in connection with his original three year sentence. As we previously have explained, both the habeas court and the Appellate Court had determined that the petitioner is entitled to have such good time credit applied toward his total effective sentence under our holding in <em>Howard v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 17. The commissioner challenges that determination, asserting, first, that the petitioner\u2019s statutory good time claim is not controlled <em>by Howard </em>because this case is factually distinguishable. Second, the commissioner maintains that the \u201cone continuous term\u201d language of \u00a7 18-7 is inapplicable to the petitioner\u2019s three year sentence because the good time credit calculation for that sentence is governed by \u00a7 18-7a (c), which, the commissioner contends, implicitly repealed the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 for any prison sentence, including the petitioner\u2019s sentence, imposed for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1983.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>missioner alternatively claims that, if we determine that <em>Howard </em>cannot be distinguished from this case, we should overrule <em>Howard.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, with respect to the petitioner\u2019s presentence good time claim, the commissioner contends that this case is controlled by <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 23, and not <em>Howard, </em>and that, under <em>Payton, </em>the petitioner is not entitled to credit for the nineteen days of presentence good time that he had earned on his original three year sentence. We reject these arguments and conclude that the habeas court properly ordered the commissioner to credit the petitioner with the 109 days of good time credit that he had earned in connection with his three year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We first consider the commissioner\u2019s claim that this case is factually distinguishable from <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 17. In that case, the petitioner, Gregory Howard, \u201cwas sentenced on February 24, 1984, to a term of imprisonment of forty months. Subsequently, on August 15,1985, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years to be served consecutively to his sentence of forty months. Thereafter, on March 18, 1993, he was sentenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>a term of imprisonment of nine months to be served concurrently with the sentence he was then serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201c[Howard\u2019s] forty month sentence expired on October 18, 1986. He was discharged from his ten year sentence on July 2, 1993. Thereafter, he was serving only the nine month concurrent sentence imposed on March 18, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u201cWhile [Howard] was serving his forty month sentence, he had forfeited a substantial amount of [statutory] good [time] credit because of misconduct in the institution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> . . . While serving his ten year sentence, [Howard] also had forfeited a substantial amount of good [time] credit. His behavior thereafter had improved during that [ten year] sentence, however, and all the forfeited credit attributable to that sentence had been eventually restored to that sentence. The [commissioner], however, refused to consider restoration of good [time] credits forfeited during [Howard\u2019s] forty month sentence for application to his subsequent sentences.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201cOn April 12, 1993, [Howard] brought [a] petition for habeas corpus to require that the [commissioner] consider the good [time] credits forfeited during [Howard\u2019s] expired forty month sentence for application to reduce his remaining sentences. The habeas court concluded that the [commissioner] had denied [Howard\u2019s] request on grounds not authorized by . . . \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a, and ordered the [commissioner] to reconsider the request. The court reasoned that [Howard\u2019s] forty month sentence and his subsequent sentences should be construed as one continuous term pursuant to \u00a7 18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>7. It determined, therefore, that [Howard] was entitled to have any good [time] credit forfeited during his forty month sentence considered for restoration to reduce his remaining sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u201cPursuant to the habeas court\u2019s judgment, the [commissioner] considered [Howard\u2019s] request for restoration of good [time] credits and restored to his ten year sentence thirty days of credit that [Howard] had lost while serving his forty month sentence. The [commissioner], however, refused to apply the restored thirty days of credit to [Howard\u2019s] nine month sentence. When [Howard] was notified on July 29, 1993, that thirty days of good [time] credit had been restored, [he] already had been discharged from his ten year sentence. Thereafter, [Howard] continued to serve only the unexpired portion of the nine month concurrent term to which he had been sentenced on March 18, 1993. That term was due to be discharged in September, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u201cIn response to [Howard\u2019s] motion requesting enforcement of its judgment, the habeas court ruled that all three sentences in question were required to be treated as one continuous term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 18-7. The court therefore ordered that the thirty days of restored good [time] credit be applied to that portion of [Howard\u2019s] nine month concurrent sentence that he was still serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cThe [commissioner] did not appeal the habeas court\u2019s decision insofar as it held that [Howard] was entitled to have his forty month sentence and his consecutive ten year sentence aggregated and construed as one continuous term of imprisonment. Moreover, [the commissioner did] not disagree with the habeas court\u2019s ruling that the good [time] credits forfeited by [Howard] while serving his forty month sentence properly should have been considered for application to reduce [Howard\u2019s] consecutive ten year sentence, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>though [Howard\u2019s] forty month term had expired. The [commissioner] concede[d] that these aspects of the habeas court\u2019s ruling were reasonable interpretations of <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, [supra, 217 Conn. 574] (statutory mandate of \u00a7 18-7 that consecutive terms of imprisonment be aggregated and treated as one consecutive term of imprisonment for purpose of calculating good time credits). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u201cThe [commissioner], however, appealed] from that part of the habeas court\u2019s judgment that determined that [Howard\u2019s] nine month concurrent sentence was part of a continuous term of imprisonment and that the restoration of thirty days of good [time] credit from [Howard\u2019s] expired forty month sentence had to be applied to his nine month sentence. The [commissioner] did not seek a stay of execution, however, and the restored good [time] credits were applied to the nine month sentence that [Howard] was then serving. [Howard] was released from custody on August 30, 1993.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 18-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In <em>Howard, </em>this court unanimously held that all of Howard\u2019s sentences, whether consecutive or concurrent and regardless of when they had been imposed, must be treated as one continuous term for purposes of applying statutory good time credit that he had earned under \u00a7 18-7a (c). Id., 23. We concluded that \u201cthe petitioner was entitled to have the thirty days of restored good [time] credits applied to his overall sentence, that is, the sentence with the longest term to run, [namely, Howard\u2019s] nine month concurrent sentence. [T]he legislature explicitly chose to make the effective sentence the benchmark for good time under \u00a7 18-7 ....</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u201cMoreover, the fact that [Howard\u2019s] forty month sentence had expired prior to the time [that Howard] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>held pursuant to his nine month sentence does not defeat [his] claim that he was entitled to the restored good [time] credits attributable to that sentence. Concededly, [Howard\u2019s] forty month sentence was required to be treated as one continuous term with his subsequent ten year sentence. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 568. His forfeited good [time] credits from that sentence were, therefore, applicable to his ten year sentence. Because the nine month concurrent sentence must be construed as one continuous term with his ten year sentence, those credits were also available for application to his nine month sentence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The commissioner claims that <em>Howard </em>does not control our resolution of the petitioner\u2019s claim because, unlike this case, <em>Howard, </em>involved the restoration of forfeited good time credit. Indeed, the commissioner asserts that the holding of <em>Howard </em>should be limited to those specific facts. The commissioner, however, has provided no principled basis upon which to distinguish this case from <em>Howard. </em>Simply put, there is nothing in the relevant statutory scheme or in our case law to suggest that the calculation and application of restored good time credit differ in any way from the calculation and application of good time credit that never was forfeited. In this case, the petitioner has requested that the good time credits he had earned on an earlier sentence be credited toward a controlling, subsequently imposed concurrent sentence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That is precisely what we concluded the commissioner was required to do in <em>Howard, </em>in which we rejected the commissioner\u2019s claim that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>only to consecutive sentences.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See generally id., 21-24. In fact, a review of the record in <em>Howard </em>reveals that, in that case, the commissioner drew no distinction between the calculation of restored good time credit and the calculation of good time credit that never had been forfeited. We decline the commissioner\u2019s belated invitation to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">It is noteworthy, moreover, that the distinction that the commissioner urges us to draw between this case and <em>Howard </em>would lead to bizarre and incongruous results. Under the view advanced by the commissioner, only a prisoner who, like Howard, has forfeited good time based on misconduct could have that good time, if restored, credited to a subsequent, controlling sentence. We see no conceivable reason why an inmate who, by virtue of his good conduct, has <em>not </em>forfeited any good time, should be deprived of credit for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>good time that he earns on his earlier sentence, while Howard, whose misconduct resulted in the <em>forfeiture </em>of good time, is entitled to credit toward a subsequent, controlling sentence for that good time simply because that good time had been forfeited and restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">The following hypothetical graphically illustrates this point. Inmate <em>X </em>and inmate <em>Y </em>both are convicted of the same crime and both receive a sentence of five years imprisonment. Inmate X behaves poorly and forfeits his good time, while inmate <em>Y </em>accrues approximately one year of good time by the end of the third year of his sentence. After having been incarcerated for three years on their original five year sentences, inmate X and inmate <em>Y </em>are both sentenced to a concurrent, four year term of imprisonment stemming from their possession of marijuana in the correctional facility. Inmate X and inmate <em>Y </em>are model prisoners for the remainder of their prison terms, and each is awarded good time credit at the maximum rate authorized by \u00a7 18-7a (c). Because of inmateXs good conduct, however, the commissioner restores the good time that inmate X had forfeited in connection with his original five year sentence. Under our holding in <em>Howard, </em>inmate X would be entitled to apply that restored good time credit to his total effective term of imprisonment. If, as the commissioner contends, <em>Howard </em>is limited to its facts, however, then inmate <em>Y </em>would <em>not </em>receive credit toward <em>his </em>total effective term of imprisonment for the good time that he had earned on his earlier five year sentence. Such a result is neither fair nor rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that <em>Howard </em>is directly on point and, unless overruled, is controlling with respect to the petitioner\u2019s statutory good time claim. We turn next, therefore, to the commissioner\u2019s contention that we should reconsider <em>Howard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Our resolution of the commissioner\u2019s claim that <em>Howard </em>should be overruled requires an examination of the relevant statutory language and our <em>pre-Howard </em>precedent construing that language. An appropriate starting point is General Statutes \u00a7 18-7, which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny prisoner sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1, 1976, may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of said institution, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence .... When any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Although \u00a7 18-7 makes express reference only to prison sentences imposed prior to October 1, 1976, we previously have concluded that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 also applies to good time credit earned under the provisions of \u00a7 18-7a, for sentences imposed on or after October 1, 1976.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 579, 581, we held that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 applies to consecutive sentences governed by \u00a7 18-7a (a),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which pertains to the calculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of good time credit for certain sentences imposed on or after October 1,1976. As we explained in <em>McCarthy, </em>the provisions of \u00a7 18-7 \u201crelate generally to the duties and prerogatives of the . . . commissioner ... in relation to the inmates\u201d; id., 575; and \u201c[t]here is nothing in the legislative history of [\u00a7 18-7a (a)] to indicate that the legislature intended to abrogate the aggregation of consecutive sentences for the purpose of calculating a prisoner\u2019s good time.\u201d Id., 576; see also <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 584, 587, 587 A.2d 124 (1991) (reaffirming <em>McCarthy </em>and suggesting that one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 applies to other subsections of \u00a7 18-7a).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Three years later, in <em>Howard, </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 17, we upheld the habeas court\u2019s decision applying the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 to \u00a7 18-7a (c); see id., 20-21; and also concluded that, because \u00a7 18-7 does not distinguish between convictions that result in consecutive sentences and convictions that result in concurrent sentences; id., 22; an inmate is entitled to have multiple sentences treated as one continuous term for good time calculation purposes whether those sentences are imposed to run consecutively or concurrently.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The commissioner does not dispute that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 applies to \u00a7 18-7a (a) and (b). The commissioner claims, however, that the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 should not apply to \u00a7 18-7a (c). Specifically, the commissioner contends that the method mandated by the legislature for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>calculating good time under \u00a7 18-7a (c), which differs from the method pursuant to which such credit is calculated under subsections (a) and (b), suggests that the legislature intended to eliminate the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 for purposes of good time calculations under \u00a7 18-7a (c). We disagree with the statutory interpretation advanced by the commissioner.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Under subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 18-7a, \u201cfor purposes of administrative efficiency statutory good time was calculated <em>and credited </em>at the outset of a prisoner\u2019s sentence on the basis of the sentence imposed by the sentencing court. . . . This method of awarding good time is commonly referred to as posting.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (Citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 269, 275, 593 A.2d 111 (1991); see also <em>Chung </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>245 Conn. 423, 427, 717 A.2d 111 (1998). \u201cBecause, under the posting system, good time is credited at the outset of a sentence, some prisoners receive good time for time that they, in fact, never serve.\u201d <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In 1982; the legislature amended \u00a7 18-7a by adding subsection (c); see Public Acts 1982, No. 82-379, \u00a7 1; which governs the calculation of good time credit for sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after July 1, 1983. The purpose of that statutory amendment was to abolish the posting system for prisoners whose good time calculations are governed by \u00a7 18-7a (c), thereby eliminating the possibility that any of those prisoners would be credited with good time that they never earn. <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 278. The legislature accomplished this goal by expressly providing that any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1983, may earn a reduction of his or her sentence only \u201cas such sentence is served . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 18-7a (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The commissioner claims that this amendment is inconsistent with the relevant language of General Statutes \u00a7 18-7, which provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder <em>shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation </em>which he may earn under the provisions of this section. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In particular, the commissioner claims that, under subsection (c) of \u00a7 18-7a, good time credit no longer is <em>estimated </em>as it is pursuant to the posting system utilized to calculate good time credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>under subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 18-7a and that, consequently, the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 is not applicable to \u00a7 18-7a (c). We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>Estimating </em>good time credit is no more or less a part of the posting system employed by the commissioner under \u00a7 18-7a (a) and (b) than it is for purposes of determining such credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c). Rather, the use of the term \u201cestimating\u201d in \u00a7 18-7 merely reflects the reality that an inmate may forfeit some of the good time credit that he or she otherwise would be expected to accrue under the applicable subsection of \u00a7 18-7a. Of course, the forfeiture of good time credit can occur regardless of which subsection of \u00a7 18-7a happens to apply in any given case. In fact, the petitioner in this case had forfeited good time credit on several occasions,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> thereby causing his estimated release date to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Moreover, the commissioner\u2019s contention finds no support in the legislative history of \u00a7 18-7a (c), which we previously examined in detail in <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 269: \u201cThe legislative history of [that statutory subsection] demonstrates that [it] was designed to attain two related objectives. First, the legislature sought to return to the original concept behind good time, that is, the concept of reward for good behavior. Senator Nancy L. Johnson defined this objective, stating: \u2018All this bill really does is to return the initial concept of good time which was a concept of reward. A reward for good behavior. When you deduct the entire amount at the front end of the sentence, then what you revert to is the system of punishment for poor behavior. So that instead of granting good time you actually end up earning penalties for poor behavior. . . . All it means is that the reward will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>not be front-ended. The reward must be earned and, indeed, good time will reduce the sentence .... The importance of this [amendment] is that it returns to the original sound concept of good time which is a concept of reward for good behavior rather than a concept of punishment for failure to provide good behavior.\u2019 25 S. Proc., Pt. 12, 1982 Sess., pp. 3826-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u201cThe legislature\u2019s second objective was to eradicate an irrational consequence of the posting system. Because, under the posting system, good time is credited at the outset of a sentence, some prisoners receive good time for time that they, in fact, never serve. As Representative Christopher Shays explained: \u2018We compute good time [under \u00a7 18-7a (a)] saying the person is going to serve the whole [ten] years, so he earns [five] years based on [ten] days a month and then he has [five] years based on [fifteen] days a month, assuming that he is in jail for the whole ten years .... And so what you end up with is a sentence where an individual gets out before he even serves the full sentence earning the good time.\u2019 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11,1982 Sess., p. 3551. For example, pursuant to the posting method, a prisoner sentenced to a term of seven years imprisonment is awarded good time for eighty-four months of service. If the prisoner exhibits good conduct and obedience and, therefore, retains the good time, he will serve 54.4 months. . . . Consequently, the prisoner receives good time for 29.6 months of time that he never serves.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 277-78. There is nothing in the relevant legislative history to suggest that \u00a7 18-7a (c) was intended to accomplish anything more than ensuring that, for any sentence imposed for an offense committed on or after July 1,1983, an inmate will not receive good time credit for time he has not served. The legislature achieved this objective by eliminating the posting method in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Furthermore, \u201cit is a well established rule of statutory construction that repeal of the provisions of a statute by implication is not favored and will not be presumed where the old and the new statutes, in this case \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and [18-7a (c)], can peacefully coexist. ... If, by any fair interpretation, we can find a reasonable field of operation for both \u00a7 18-7 and [\u00a7 18-7a (c)], without destroying or perverting their meaning and intent, it is our duty to reconcile them and give them concurrent effect. . . . We also note that the provision of \u00a7 18-7 requiring the aggregation of multiple sentences has been a part of the general statutes governing the award of good time since 1902. ... In the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language. ... If the legislature had intended by enacting [\u00a7 18-7a (c)] to do away with the longstanding policy of aggregation of multiple sentences, it could easily have said so. . . .<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is a presumption that an amendatory act does not change the existing law further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 578. Because \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a (c) are not inconsistent with each other, we will not presume that \u00a7 18-7a (c) abrogates the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 in the absence of a convincing showing to the contrary. The commissioner has failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Finally, it bears mention that, in <em>Howard, </em>the commissioner did not claim that \u00a7 18-7a (c) implicitly repealed the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 for prison sentences imposed for offenses committed on or after July 1, 1983. See generally <em>Howard, </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 20-21. Rather, the commissioner argued in <em>Howard </em>that the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 applies only to consecutive sentences; see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 580-81; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 587; and not to concurrent sentences; see <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 21; a contention that we squarely rejected in <em>Howard.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Id., 24. Had the commissioner successfully claimed in <em>Howard, </em>what he claims in this case, namely, that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 is inapplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to \u00a7 18-7a (c), we would have decided <em>Howard </em>in his favor. It is curious that the commissioner never raised such a claim in <em>Howard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The commissioner asserts that <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 23, a case involving the computation of jail time credit under \u00a7 18-98d (a);<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> id., 24-25; provides compelling authority to support the commissioner\u2019s contention that the petitioner is not entitled to good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) for the time that he had served on his three year sentence. In essence, the commissioner claims that <em>Payton </em>requires us to overrule <em>Howard. </em>We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><em>Payton </em>involved the following factual scenario. On July 22, 1986, Grover Payton was arrested on various charges, including robbery. Id., 27. He remained in pretrial confinement on these charges for 113 days, until November 12,1986, when he posted bail. Id. On January 16, 1987, Payton pleaded guilty to third degree robbery and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two and one-half years. Id. On August 28, 1986, Payton was charged with possession of cocaine.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Id. He remained in pretrial custody on this charge until posting bail seventy-six days later, on November 12,1986. Id. Payton pleaded guilty to the cocaine possession charge and, on January 16, 1987, was sentenced to a second term of imprisonment of two and one-half years. Id. The sentencing court ordered that Payton\u2019s robbery and cocaine possession sentences were to run concurrently. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201cIn determining [Payton\u2019s] effective release date, the [commissioner] examined the pretrial confinement time in each case. [With respect to the sentence for Payton\u2019s robbery conviction, the commissioner] calculated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>113 days of jail time plus a corresponding reduction of thirty-eight days for [presentence good time] advanced [Payton\u2019s] release date in that case from July 15, 1989, to February 14, 1989. [With respect to the sentence for Payton\u2019s cocaine possession conviction, the commissioner] calculated that seventy-six days of jail time plus a corresponding twenty-six days of [presentence] good time advanced the release date from July 15, 1989, to April 4, 1989. Having merged the two sentences and on the basis of the sentence which had the longest to run, the [commissioner], pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-38 (b),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> determined that the actual release date would be April 4, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u201c[Payton] argue[d] that he should receive jail time credit for all presentence confinement regardless of which offense caused his pretrial confinement and regardless of which sentence caused his subsequent imprisonment. In effect, he [sought] to credit the 113 days of jail time accrued in [connection with the robbery conviction] to the sentence imposed in [connection with the cocaine possession conviction].\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">We rejected Payton\u2019s claim, concluding that neither the language nor the legislative history of \u00a7 18-98d supported Payton\u2019s contention that the legislature had \u201cintended to authorize the transfer of jail time credits accrued while in pretrial confinement under one offense to the sentence thereafter imposed upon conviction for another offense.\u201d Id., 31-32. We further explained: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201cWhile \u00a7 18-98d deals with the calculation of sentences in general, it does not specifically take up the matter of concurrent sentences. [Section] 53a-38 (b) does. It provides in relevant part: \u2018If the sentences run concurrently, the terms merge in and are <em>satisfied by discharge of the term which has the longest term to run </em>[General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b)].</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u201cIn <em>[Payton], </em>the [commissioner] determined that the two and one-half year term imposed in [connection with Payton\u2019s robbery conviction], when adjusted for its authorized credits, would be satisfied on February 14, 1989. The two and one-half year term imposed in [connection with Payton\u2019s cocaine possession conviction], when adjusted for its authorized credits, would be satisfied on April 4, 1989. The two sentences having been ordered to ran concurrently, \u00a7 53a-38 (b) directed that their merged terms were satisfied by the \u2018discharge of the term which has the longest term to run.\u2019 In this instance, the [commissioner] determined that the longer term was the sentence [for the cocaine possession conviction], i.e., until April 4, 1989, and therefore he declared that date as the proposed discharge date since \u00a7 53a-38 (b) required him to do so. [The court] conclude [s] that the determination of the discharge date by this method reflects a correct construction of the two applicable statutes.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 32. Finally, we rejected Pay-ton\u2019s equal protection challenge to our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b), concluding that the refusal to credit Payton with the jail time credit that he had earned while awaiting sentencing on the robbery charges was justified by the state\u2019s compelling interest in prohibiting an inmate from \u201c \u2018bank[ing]\u2019 jail time credits\u201d; id., 33; to reduce a subsequently imposed sentence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The commissioner claims that, to the extent that <em>Howard </em>permits the banking of good time credits by authorizing the transfer of those credits from one sentence to another subsequently imposed sentence, our holding therein is incompatible with <em>Payton, </em>in which we concluded that jail time credit cannot be transferred from one sentence to another. Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s claim, <em>Payton </em>is distinguishable from <em>Howard, </em>because, in the former case, we considered the application of jail time credit, whereas in the latter, we addressed the issue of statutory good time credit. Each of the two cases, therefore, implicates entirely different statutes: <em>Payton </em>required us to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b), whereas <em>Howard </em>involved the construction of \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a (c). Thus, in each case, our interpretation depended on different statutory language, legislative history and prior case law. Indeed, the dissimilarity of the two cases is underscored by the fact that the brief filed by the commissioner in <em>Howard </em>bears no mention of <em>Payton, </em>notwithstanding the fact that we had decided <em>Pay ton </em>nearly five years prior to the commissioner\u2019s submission of briefs in <em>Howard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Furthermore, the commissioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Payton </em>is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the different purposes underlying jail time credit and statutory good time credit. \u201c[T]he purpose of the jail time statutes is to give recognition to the period of presentence time seived and to permit the prisoner, in effect, to commence serving his sentence from the time he was compelled to remain in custody due to a mittimus ... or because of the court\u2019s refusal to allow bail or the defendant\u2019s inability to raise bail ....</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cIn contradistinction to jail time, good time is a commutation of a sentence, affecting an inmate\u2019s parole and discharge dates, thereby serving an important rehabilitative function by allowing an inmate ... to earn an earlier release for himself.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 393-94, 362 A.2d 971 (1975). Thus, the fact that jail time credit cannot be applied from one sentence to a second, concurrent sentence is not determinative of whether statutory good time credits may be so applied; indeed, it may be argued that a prohibition against the application of earned good time credit to a subsequent, concurrent sentence would undermine the rehabilitative goal that good time credit was intended to achieve.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The commissioner also claims that because <em>Howard </em>permits an inmate to apply good time credits earned on one sentence to a subsequent, concurrent sentence, it can lead to a bizarre result: in some circumstances, the application of such credit may substantially reduce, or even offset entirely,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the time that an inmate otherwise would have been required to serve on a subsequent, concurrent sentence.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> To a significant degree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>however, this result<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> is merely a consequence of the fact that concurrent sentences, in contrast to consecutive sentences, \u201cmerge in and are satisfied by discharge of the term which has the longest term to run . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Moreover, if the sentencing court wishes to avoid the result that the commissioner characterizes as untenable, the court easily may do so by imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment rather than concurrent terms. Alternatively, the court, prior to sentencing, may ascertain how much good time the defendant has earned on any prior sentence or sentences, thereby enabling the court to determine with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>precision how much concurrent prison time must be imposed to accomplish the court\u2019s sentencing objectives.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> See <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>703 F.2d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 1983) (sentencing judges \u201cfrequently [take] into account existing systems of computing good time\u201d). We, therefore, do not believe that our conclusion in <em>Howard </em>regarding the applicability of \u00a7 18-7 to \u00a7 18-7a (c) leads to bizarre or absurd consequences. Thus, although in some instances, there may be incongruous results, those results are not inevitable, and may be avoided by a discerning sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In fact, as the Appellate Court has observed, it is the <em>commissioner\u2019s </em>\u201cinterpretation of \u00a7 18-7 [that] would yield bizarre results. For example, a five year sentence followed by a five year concurrent sentence imposed on the last day of the prior term would result in an inmate\u2019s serving ten years in jail without receiving enhanced good time credit. Conversely, the same inmate sentenced to two, five year consecutive sentences would receive enhanced good time credit.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 509. As we previously have noted; see footnote 27 of this opinion; the commissioner has sought to avoid this incongruous result by awarding enhanced good time credit to any inmate who has completed five years of his or her overall term, <em>regardless of whether the inmate is serving concurrent or consecutive sentences. </em>The commissioner, however, has pointed to no authority, and we are aware of none, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to substantiate his conclusory assertion that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 is partially, but not entirely, applicable to \u00a7 18-7a.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Consequently, we can discern no principled justification for the manner in which the commissioner has chosen to address the unfairness occasioned by his interpretation of the pertinent statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Finally, \u201c[t]he doctrine of stare decisis counsels that a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . Stare decisis is justified because it allows for predictability in the ordering of conduct, it promotes the necessary perception that the law is relatively unchanging, it saves resources and it promotes judicial efficiency. ... It is the most important application of a theory of decisionmaking consistency in our legal culture and it is an obvious manifestation of the notion that decisionmaking consistency itself has normative value.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>George </em>v. <em>Ericson, </em>250 Conn. 312, 318, 736 A.2d 889 (1999). Moreover, we are mindful that, \u201c[i]n assessing the force of stare decisis, our case law has emphasized that we should be especially cautious about overturning a case that concerns statutory construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 202, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Howard </em>was decided approximately six years ago. Although our holding in that case was clear,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the legislature has failed to take any steps to amend either \u00a7 18-7 or \u00a7 18-7a in response to <em>Howard. </em>\u201cWhile we are aware that legislative inaction is not necessarily legislative affirmation; see <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 662, 680 A.2d 242 (1996); we also presume that the legislature is aware of [this court\u2019s] interpretation of a statute, and that its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>248 Conn. 207, 262-63, 726 A.2d 531, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 969, 120 S. Ct. 409, 145 L. Ed. 2d 319 (1999). \u201cTime and again, we have characterized the failure of the legislature to take corrective action as manifesting the legislature\u2019s acquiescence in our construction of a statute. . . . Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsideration has passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence places a significant jurisprudential limitation on our own authority to reconsider the merits of our earlier decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 297, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). Moreover, in the intervening years since <em>Howard, </em>the legislature has amended \u00a7 18-7 without addressing our construction thereof; see footnote 26 of this opinion; further suggesting legislative approval of our interpretation. See, e.g., <em>Bocchino </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </em>246 Conn. 378, 388, 716 A.2d 883 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner has provided no compelling reason to overrule <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 17. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Accordingly, as the habeas court and Appellate Court determined, the petitioner is entitled to credit for the statutory good time that he had earned in connection with his three year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Finally, the commissioner asserts that, even if we are not persuaded that our decision in <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 23, governs the application of statutory good time credit earned under \u00a7 18-7a (c), <em>Payton </em>does control the application of presentence good time credit earned pursuant to \u00a7 18-98d (b). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">As we discussed previously, in <em>Payton, </em>we were faced with the issue of whether jail time credit<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> earned by an inmate for time served for one offense could be credited toward a second sentence with a later discharge date. Although we factored in Payton\u2019s presentence good time in calculating the jail time credit to which Payton was entitled, we did not specifically address the issue of whether presentence good time that he had earned on one sentence could be credited toward a subsequent sentence.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Thus, until today, we have not had occasion to determine whether the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 is applicable to presentence good time credit earned under \u00a7 18-98d (b). Having concluded that the legislature intended that an inmate who, like the petitioner, is entitled to have the statutory good time credit that he earned on one sentence applied to a subsequent, controlling concurrent sentence, we see no logical reason to conclude otherwise with respect to presentence good time credit. Although, as we have indicated, there is a distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>between jail time credit and statutory good time credit, no such distinction may be drawn between presentence good time credit and statutory good time credit merely because the former is earned prior to sentencing and the latter is earned after sentencing.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Consequently, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>conclude that our holding <em>in Payton </em>applies only to the allocation of jail time credit earned under \u00a7 18-98d (a), and not to the allocation of presentence good time earned under \u00a7 18-98d (b).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">We agree with the habeas court, therefore, that the petitioner is entitled to a credit toward his total effective term of imprisonment for the 109 days of presentence and statutory good time that he had earned in connection with his three year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing the appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to render judgment reversing the order of the habeas court denying the petition for certification to appeal and affirming the judgment of the habeas court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and BORDEN, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> We note that there are two types of good time credit relevant to this appeal. The first type, presentence good time credit, also known as jail credit good time, is credit toward a reduction of an inmate\u2019s sentence that is earned for good behavior while the inmate is in custody prior to sentencing. Presentence good time credit is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (b). See footnote 9 of this opinion. The second type of good time credit, known as statutory good time credit, is credit earned by a sentenced inmate for his or her good behavior. Statutory good time credit is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 18-7; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a.

In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Double A Transportation, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 21, 25, 727 A.2d 204 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\"> \u201cFor example, when a prisoner sentenced to seven years imprisonment for an offense committed prior to July 1,1983, was committed to the custody of the [commissioner], his statutory good time was calculated as follows: for the first sixty months he received ten days per month for a total of 600 days; for the remaining twenty-four months he received twelve days per month for a total of 288 days.

In other words, the commissioner does not dispute that he is required to apply the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 for purposes of calculating good time credit earned by any inmate for the prison time that he or she has served <em>in excess of five years, </em>including inmates who, like the petitioner, were sentenced to concurrent prison terms for crimes committed on or after July 1,1983. In light of this acknowledgement, we are unable to discern any logical basis for the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 is applicable to \u00a7 18-7a (c) <em>for that limited </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>purpose only, </em>and not for tile purpose of applying good time credit earned by such inmates for the time that they have served during the <em>first five years </em>of their overall term. We are aware of nothing in the language of \u00a7 18-<em>7, </em>\u00a7 18-7a or any other statutory provision that either expressly or implicitly supports the commissioner\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\"> As we slated in <em>Howard, </em>\u00a7 18-7 \u201cmakes no distinction between convictions that result in consecutive sentences and those that result in concurrent sentences. . . .

The fact, therefore, that [Howard\u2019s] sentence was concurrent rather than consecutive does not remove it from the purview of \u00a7 18-7.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 22. As we previously have noted, moreover; see footnote 22 of 1his opinion; in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 506-507, a unanimous panel of the Appellate Court came to the same conclusion shortly before we decided <em>Howard.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\"> See footnotes 9 and 10 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> This charge stemmed from conduct that allegedly had occurred on June 11, 1986. <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b) provides: \u201cA definite sentence of imprisonment commences when the prisoner is received in the custody to which he was sentenced. Where a person is under more than one definite sentence, the sentences shall be calculated as follows: (1) If the sentences run concurrently, the terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the term which has the longest term to run; (2) if the sentences run consecutively, the terms are added to arrive at an aggregate term and are satisfied by discharge of such aggregate term.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b268-5\"> As we stated in <em>Payton, </em>\u201c[a] petitioner should not, upon posting bail, leave a correctional center with the perception that there is jail time accrued in his name which may be applied to subsequent sentences that may follow criminal activity occurring after his release on bail but before the disposition of the original charges.\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 33-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> The commissioner also contends that his statutory interpretation is supported by <em>Nichols v. </em>Warren, supra, 209 Conn. 204, in which we concluded that the plain language of \u00a7 18-7a (c) does not permit the forfeiture of unearned good time credit . Because <em>Nichols </em>had nothing to do with the applicability of the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 to \u00a7 18-7a (c), it does not buttress the commissioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> Of course, a subsequent, concurrent sentence that is controlling\u2014the sentence with the longest term to run\u2014never will be offset entirely by good time earned in connection with a previous sentence. This is so because an inmate who had earned sufficient good time credit on the original sentence to vitiate a subsequent, controlling concurrent sentence necessarily would have accumulated enough good time on that original sentence to have secured his or her release prior to the imposition of the subsequent sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"> This possibility is demonstrated by the following example. Inmate <em>A </em>receives a ten year prison sentence for an offense committed after July 1, 1983, and prior to October 1,1994. Because inmate <em>A </em>earns good time under \u00a7 18-7a (c) at a rate of ten days per month for the first five years of his sentence and twelve days per month for time served thereafter, he is due to be released in approximately 7.4 years, assuming, of course, that he does not forfeit any good time. At the beginning of the seventh year of his sentence, however, inmate A is sentenced to a three year, concurrent term of imprisonment stemming from an escape attempt. Because, under <em>Howard, </em>inmate A\u2019s sentence is treated as one continuous term for purposes of applying good time credit\u2014inmate A\u2019s earned good time is applied toward his total effective term of imprisonment of ten years\u2014inmate A will not serve any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>additional time in connection wi1h his subsequent, three year concurrent sentence. Consequently, he will be released about four months after the imposition of that sentence. The commissioner contends that the legislature could not have intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Under the statutory interpretation urged by the commissioner, a view that would require us to overrule <em>Howard, </em>this result would be avoided. Specifically, if the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 were applicable only to consecutive sentences, then the good time credits that inmate <em>A </em>earned on his original ten year sentence are applicable only to that sentence, and not to his total effective term of imprisonment. Thus, although inmate <em>A </em>would be eligible for release from his ten year sentence approximately four months after the imposition of the subsequent, concurrent three year sentence, that is, after he has served about 7.4 years of his ten year sentence, inmate <em>A </em>would be required to serve approximately an additional two years in connect ion with his three year sentence, assuming that he does not forfeit the good time credit that he is eligible to earn on that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The commissioner also suggests that <em>Howard </em>can result in disparate treatment for similarly situated defendants. For example, inmate <em>B </em>has just commenced a one year term of imprisonment when he and the aforementioned inmate <em>A </em>attempt to escape. Inmate <em>B </em>is arrested, immediately pleads guilty to attempted escape and, like inmate <em>A, </em>is sentenced to a concurrent, three year term of imprisonment. Because inmate <em>B </em>has earned virtually no good time credit on his original one year sentence and, therefore, has little or no good time credit to be applied against his three year sentence, he will serve approximately 2.3 additional years in prison. In contrast, inmate <em>A, </em>who has received the same concurrent sentence as inmate <em>B </em>for his attempted escape with inmate <em>B, </em>will serve no additional time for that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> We note, however, that neither this case nor <em>Howard </em>gives rise to such a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> See footnote 31 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\"> Because the issue raised by this appeal involves the imposition of a concurrent sentence on an inmate who already is serving time for another offense, in some such cases, the subsequent, concurrent sentence will stem from an offense committed by that inmate while he is incarcerated in connection with his earlier sentence. In such circumstances, the commissioner has the discretion to forfeit any good time that the inmate has earned. When that occurs, the inmate will have no good time to be credited toward his subsequent sentence, unless, of course, the commissioner restores the credit that had been forfeited. Consequently, the issue that we address today will not arise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> We note that the commissioner has not always taken this position. For example, in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 505-506, the commissioner had maintained that the petitioner, Joseph Wilson, was not entitled to enhanced good time credit on a subsequent, concurrent sentence even though Wilson had completed five years on his earlier sentence. The Appellate Court rejected the commissioner\u2019s claim and affirmed the judgment of the habeas court, in which the habeas court ordered the commissioner to award Wilson good time credit at the enhanced rate beginning on the five year anniversary of his first sentence and continuing until the expiration of his overall term of incarceration. See id., 509-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\"> As we previously have explained, there is no merit to the commissioner\u2019s assertion that our holding in <em>Howard, </em>can be limited to the facts of that case or that <em>Howard </em>does not control this case. Indeed, this fact is evidenced by the decisions of the habeas court and the Appellate Court, in which they concluded, in effect, that the commissioner\u2019s contrary argument was frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\"> See footnote 10 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\"> Although our discussion in <em>Payton, </em>including our calculation of the amount of time to which Payton was entitled to be credited, encompassed both jail time and presentence good time, neither party in that case made any claim specific to presentence good time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> Two points that arguably support the commissioner\u2019s contention regarding good time bear mention, even though the commissioner has not raised them. First, General Statutes \u00a7 18-7 provides in relevant part that multiple sentences \u201cshall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which [an inmate] may earn <em>under the provisions of this section. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of our determination that the one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 is not limited to that statutory section; see, e.g., <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 24 (one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 applies to \u00a7 18-7a [c]); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 579, 581 (one continuous term language of \u00a7 18-7 applies to \u00a7 18-7a [a]); and because \u00a7 18-7 \u201crelate[s] generally to the duties and prerogatives of the warden of the prison and the commissioner ... in relation to the inmates\u201d; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 575; we are not persuaded that the legislature necessarily sought to limit the application of the one continuous term requirement of \u00a7 18-7 only to statutory good time credits, that is, good time credits earned after the imposition of an inmate\u2019s sentence. Furthermore, we have noted that the legislature previously has manifested its intention that the application of good time credits should be \u201cequal and uniform throughout the correctional system . . . .\u201d Id. (explaining legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 18-7a [a]). That intention would be thwarted were we to interpret the legislative scheme governing good time credits as creating different rules for the calculation and application of presentence good time credits and statutory good time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Second, the legislature explicitly provided that, for purposes of calculating credit awarded to an inmate for outstandingly meritorious performance under General Statutes \u00a7 18-98b, the inmate\u2019s multiple terms of imprisonment shall be treated as one continuous term. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-98b. The fact that the legislature used such language in that statutory section and not in \u00a7 18-98d lends some support to the commissioner\u2019s claim that, for purposes of the application of presentence good time, an inmate\u2019s multiple sentences are not to be treated as one continuous term. In <em>McCarthy, </em>however, we noted that the legislature\u2019s use of the one continuous term language in \u00a7 18-98b buttressed our conclusion that the identical language of \u00a7 18-7 applied to \u00a7 18-7a (a), notwithstanding the fact that the latter provision contained no such mandate. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 576-77. In view of the overriding public policy that good time credit, whenever earned, must be applied fairly and equally, we are not persuaded that the legislature\u2019s failure to include the one continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ous term language in \u00a7 18-98d is fatal to the petitioner\u2019s claim of entitlement to credit for his earned presentence good time credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> To the extent that our holding in <em>Payton </em>may be interpreted as encompassing presentence good time, that portion of <em>Payton </em>applicable to presentence good time is overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b277-7\">MCDONALD, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7C\">with whom VERTEFEUILLE, J., joins, dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the petitioner is entitled to credit toward subsequently imposed sentences for the 109 days of good time he earned while serving his prior three year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 568, 587 A.2d 116 (1991), we held that, for purposes of <em>estimating </em>enhanced good time credits under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (a),* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> consecutive sentences must be treated as one continuous term pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 18-7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue in <em>McCarthy </em>concerned whether, in estimating the amount of good time, the prisoner would receive a credit at the rate of ten days or fifteen days per month for each month of his sentence. Under \u00a7 18-7a (a) if his sentence was considered to be over five years, the factor was to be fifteen days for each month of the sentence over five years; if less than five years, the ten day factor would be used. We held in <em>McCarthy </em>that the prisoner\u2019s six consecutive one-year sentences should be treated as \u201cone continuous term\u201d for the purposes of estimating the amount of commutation. That holding was based on our finding that \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a (a) should \u201cpeacefully coexist.\u201d Id., 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In <em>Howard v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>230 Conn. 17, 644 A.2d 874 (1994), the issue concerned whether forfeited good time that is later restored should be <em>credited </em>pursuant to \u00a7 18-7a (c) against the petitioner\u2019s concurrent sentences imposed after the good time had been earned. We held that, under <em>McCarthy, </em>multiple sentences covered by \u00a7 18-7a (c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> must be treated as one continuous term for purposes of restoring or crediting good time. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 21. Our reasoning was that \u00a7 18-7 \u201cmakes no distinction between convictions that result in consecutive sentences and those that result in concurrent sentences.\u201d Id., 22.The question in <em>Howard, </em>however, was not whether \u00a7 18-7 makes distinctions between consecutive sentences and concurrent sentences. The question properly was whether, for purposes of \u00a7 18-7a (c), \u00a7 18-7 applies not only to the <em>estimating of the amount of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>good, </em>time; see <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 568; but also to the <em>crediting of good time </em>to subsequently imposed sentences. <em>Howard </em>did not discuss that issue, but simply held that \u00a7 18-7 requires the crediting of previously earned good time to subsequently imposed concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">I would hold that, whether imposed consecutively or concurrently, multiple sentences should not be construed as one continuous term for the purposes of crediting good time pursuant to \u00a7 18-7a (c), especially when the result is that a prisoner may earn a reduction in a sentence before a single day of that sentence is served. To rule otherwise is to ignore the statutory language in \u00a7 18-7a (c) that any reduction in sentence is to be earned \u201cas such sentence is served. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">This conclusion is supported by the policy behind \u00a7 18-7a (c), which was discussed at length in <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>219 Conn. 269, 593 A.2d 111 (1991). We noted in that case that \u00a7 18-7a (c) was enacted in order to end the practice of crediting a prisoner\u2019s good time at the outset of a prisoner\u2019s sentence on the basis of the full sentence imposed by the sentencing court, a practice known as \u201cposting.\u201d Id., 275, 277. We found that \u00a7 18-7a (c) \u201cwas designed to attain two related objectives. First, the legislature sought to return to the original concept behind good time, that is, the concept of reward for good behavior.\u201d Id., 277. \u201cThe legislature\u2019s second objective was to eradicate an irrational consequence of the posting system. Because, under the posting system, good time is credited at the outset of a sentence, some prisoners receive good time for time that they, in fact, never serve.\u201d Id., 278. We then pointed out that \u201cthe <em>predominant </em>purpose of \u00a7 18-7a (c) was to eliminate the possibility of prisoners earning good time for time that is never served.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The legislature recognized that the control of prisoners is a continuing problem that must be addressed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The good time credit system was one \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d method that enabled the warden to keep peace among the prison population, which includes many violent prisoners.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">I would conclude that the procedure for crediting good time mandated by \u00a7 18-7a (c) is different from the estimation formula contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 18-7a (a) and (b). Our holding in <em>Howard </em>ignores this basic distinction. Under the majority\u2019s ruling in this case, as in <em>Howard, </em>a prisoner will be able to credit good time earned on one sentence against a later sentence before he begins serving the later sentence. That result is directly contrary to the intent of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 18-7a (c), that good time be earned while serving a sentence. Therefore, I would hold that the legislature did not intend for \u00a7 18-7 to apply to \u00a7 18-7a (c) for purposes of crediting good time. Accordingly, I would overrule <em>Howard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The majority acknowledges that <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>209 Conn. 23, 547 A.2d 1 (1988), may be interpreted as prohibiting the transfer of presentence good time credit between sentences, and overrules it to that extent. See footnote 44 of the majority opinion. Unlike the majority, I would apply the reasoning of <em>Payton </em>to both presentence good time and the statutory good time in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Accordingly, I would hold that the petitioner was required to start earning good time as to the subsequently imposed concurrent sentence on the date that he started serving that sentence.
