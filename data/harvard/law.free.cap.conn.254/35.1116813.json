The defendant union, United Steelworkers of America, appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, the town of Groton, vacating on public policy grounds an arbitration award that had reinstated the employment of David Warren, whom the plaintiff had discharged following his conviction of embezzlement based upon his plea of nolo contendere. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly applied the \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception to the general rule of deference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>arbitration awards. We disagree and, accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Pursuant to an unrestricted submission, the arbitrator ruled that Warren had been discharged from his employment without just cause in violation of the governing collective bargaining agreement, and ordered him reinstated with limited back pay. The plaintiff filed an application in the trial court to vacate the award, and the defendant filed a cross application to confirm the award. The trial court determined that the award was in violation of public policy, and rendered judgment granting the plaintiffs application to vacate and denying the defendant\u2019s application to confirm. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The facts and procedural histoiy, as disclosed by the detailed award of the arbitrator, are undisputed. Warren was employed by the plaintiff as a weighmaster at the town landfill until April 14, 1997, when he was discharged. His duties included selling daily landfill permits to town residents, who would pay him for the permits. He was responsible for accounting for the permits that he sold and turning the money received over to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">On November 20, 1996, Warren was charged by the Groton police with two counts of larceny by embezzlement in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u00a7 53a-125b,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one count of violating a Groton town ordinance. These charges arose out of allegations that Warren had taken money for permits and kept it for himself, rather than turning it in to the plaintiff. On November 22, 1996, the police notified Warren\u2019s supervisor of his arrest and, in response, the supervisor transferred Warren temporarily to the highway division and notified him that \u201c[o]nce court action is final, we will review its findings and take any disciplinary action, as appropriate, which may include action up to and including employment termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On December 4, 1996, Warren\u2019s criminal defense attorney and the state\u2019s attorney reached a plea bargain pursuant to which the state would drop one of the larceny counts and the municipal ordinance count, Warren would plead nolo contendere to the remaining larceny count, and the state would recommend a fine of $85 plus $15 in court costs. Warren agreed to this plea bargain because contesting the charges at trial would cost him $5000 in legal fees, representing a significant percentage of his gross annual salary of approximately $35,000 and a larger percentage of his net annual salary. Warren thereupon entered a plea of nolo contendere to the larceny count, and the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction thereon and sentenced him according to the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The next day, Warren\u2019s supervisor contacted the clerk of the court and learned of Warren\u2019s conviction. There then ensued a lengthy series of meetings among the supervisor, Warren and his union representative. Ultimately, on April 14, 1997, the plaintiff terminated Warren\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The defendant filed a grievance on Warren\u2019s behalf challenging the termination. Upon the plaintiffs denial of the grievance, it was submitted to arbitration pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant. The collective bargaining agreement provided in relevant part: \u201cAll discharges, demotions, and/or suspensions will be for just cause only . . . .\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s personnel mies provided for possible disciplinary action for \u201cemployee misconduct,\u201d two examples of which provided as follows: \u201c(a) Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor arising out of the performance of duty or within the scope of employment which may affect the performance of duty\u201d; and \u201c(h) Misappropriation, destruction, theft or conversion of municipal property or equipment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>were unable to agree on how to state the issues submitted to the arbitrator, he framed the relevant issue<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as follows: \u201cWhether the [plaintiff] had just cause under Article XVIII of the collective bargaining agreement in terminating David Warren for the following reasons: (1) his conviction of a crime arising out of his employment .... If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>relied exclusively on subsection (a) of \u00a7 1 of personnel rule 10, namely, the fact of Warren\u2019s conviction of larceny in the sixth degree by embezzlement following charges that he had stolen funds that he was obligated to turn in to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, however, did not rely on subsection (h) of \u00a7 1 of personnel rule 10. In other words, the plaintiff did not seek to establish by independent evidence that Warren had <em>in fad </em>engaged in the larcenous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The arbitrator determined that, under the circumstances of the case, the fact of the conviction did not establish just cause for Warren\u2019s termination. The arbitrator first noted his agreement with the proposition that \u201c[i]f Warren in fact sold daily landfill permits and intentionally pocketed the money instead of turning it over to the [plaintiff], there would be just cause to discharge Warren from his employment. Discharge would be justified even if Warren had done so on only a single occasion. Any theft of [t] own funds for which an employee is responsible constitutes such an egregious breach of trust that summary discharge clearly would be justified. There would be no need or requirement to apply principles of progressive discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The arbitrator noted, however, that the plaintiff had relied, not on any independent proof that Warren had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in fact stolen such funds, but solely on the fact of conviction under the circumstances disclosed by the record. Those circumstances were that Warren had neither pleaded guilty to the crime charged nor been found guilty after a trial. Instead, he had been convicted after a plea of nolo contendere pursuant to the plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The arbitrator then turned to the legal effect of a plea of nolo contendere. In this regard, the arbitrator read this court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 711-12 n.4, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977), to hold that neither a plea of nolo contendere, nor a conviction based upon such a plea, can be used in a subsequent proceeding to establish (1) an admission of guilt, or (2) a res judicata effect regarding guilt. The arbitrator also noted this court\u2019s statements in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 711-12 n.4, citing C. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 265, p. 633, that pleas of nolo contendere may be entered for reasons of convenience and without much regard to guilt and collateral consequences, and are often entered with the expectation that they will not be used against the accused in subsequent proceedings. Thus, the arbitrator, quoting from <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 711-12 n.4, concluded that, although such a plea might be regarded as a tacit admission of guilt, because of their inconclusive and ambiguous nature, the plea and conviction \u201c \u2018should be given no currency beyond the particular case in which it was entered.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Applying these principles to the facts before him, the arbitrator noted that Warren had entered his plea with the expectation that it would not be used against him in subsequent proceedings. The arbitrator also noted that Warren had compelling reasons of convenience to enter such a plea, namely, the significant portion of his gross and net annual income that it would have cost him to go to trial, balanced against the modest fine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the advice of his attorney that he was not admitting any guilt. On the basis of these reasons, the arbitrator concluded that Warren\u2019s conviction of a crime arising out of his employment did not constitute just cause to terminate him under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The plaintiff applied to the trial court to vacate the award, and the defendant cross applied to confirm the award. In its application to vacate, the plaintiff claimed that the award violated clear public policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court determined that the arbitrator\u2019s award violated public policy. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment vacating the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court misapplied the public policy exception to the general rule of deference to an arbitrator\u2019s award made pursuant to an unrestricted submission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant argues that, because Warren\u2019s conviction was based on a plea of nolo contendere, the conviction: (1) cannot be used to establish that he in fact embezzled town funds; and (2) cannot be given any other legal effect. Thus, the defendant contends that \u201c[tjhere is no conflict with public policy unless the award approves some conduct which offends public policy. The award cannot be read to approve of theft unless [Warren] is <em>actually guilty of theft. </em>There has been no finding of guilt which can be relied upon in this proceeding. Therefore, the award does not conflict with public policy.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The well established general rule is that \u201c[w]hen the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 185, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>211 Conn. 7, 14, 557 A.2d 1236 (1989); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 415-16, 544 A.2d 186 (1988). Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 4-5, 612 A.2d 742 (1992). Furthermore, in applying this general rule of deference to an arbitrator\u2019s award, \u201c[e]very reasonable presumption and intendment will be made in favor of the [arbitral] award and of the arbitrators\u2019 acts and proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 119, 676 A.2d 825 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 6, however, we also recognized two narrow common-law bases, as opposed to statutory bases under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for vacating an award rendered pursuant to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>unrestricted submission: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute; and (2) the award violates clear public policy. Only the second ground is involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We recently held that, when a challenge to a voluntary arbitration award rendered pursuant to an unrestricted submission raises a legitimate and colorable claim of violation of public policy, the question of whether the award violates public policy requires de novo judicial review. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 429, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000). This challenge raises such a claim. We therefore undertake de novo review of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u201cThe public policy exception applies only when the award is clearly illegal or clearly violative of a strong public policy.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 7. A challenge that an award is in contravention of public policy \u201cis premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them. <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Stamford Police Assn., </em>[14 Conn. App. 257, 259, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>540 A.2d 400 (1988)]; <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>[179 Conn. 184, 195, 425 A.2d 1247 (1979)]. When a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award. <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>supra [195]. Accordingly, the public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests. <em>[United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 43, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987)]; see <em>W. R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Rubber Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 76 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1983) .... <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>supra, [208 Conn.] 417. The party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated. Id. Therefore, given the narrow scope of the public policy limitation on arbitral authority, the plaintiff can prevail in the present case only if it demonstrates that the [arbitrator\u2019s] award clearly violates an established public policy mandate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, 339-40, 555 A.2d 406 (1989). Applying the appropriate scope of review, we conclude that, based upon the undisputed facts of the present case, the award violated the clear public policy against embezzlement, and that this policy encompasses the policy that an employer may not be required to reinstate the employment of one who has been convicted of embezzlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>of his employer\u2019s funds, whether that conviction follows a trial, a guilty plea, or a plea of nolo contendere.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">We agree with the arbitrator, and the defendant does not dispute, that if Warren\u2019s conviction for embezzlement of his employer\u2019s funds had followed either a guilty plea or a trial, the employer would have been justified in imposing appropriate discipline, including termination, and an arbitral award requiring his reinstatement to employment would have violated clear public policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 566, Council 4, AFSCME, </em>43 Conn. App. 499, 500-501, 683 A.2d 1036 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 957, 688 A.2d 327 (1997) (where grievant had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of fraudulently diverting union funds, award reinstating him to job with responsibility for publicly owned property violated public policy); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Council 4, AFSCME, </em>27 Conn. App. 635, 641, 608 A.2d 718 (1992) (where grievant admittedly had misused state funds by cashing falsely generated public assistance checks, award of reinstatement to employment violated public policy). In either instance, the record would be sufficient to establish that the employee had in fact stolen from his employer. The guilty plea would constitute an admission of guilt; see <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 711 n.4; and the conviction after trial would be sufficient to establish the fact of the theft, under established principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>issue preclusion. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. Jones, 220 Conn. 285, 296-307, 596 A.2d 414 (1991). In either of those instances, the public policy against theft also would include the policy that an employer should not be required to retain in a position of financial trust an employee who has been established to have stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The question posed by this appeal is whether that calculus is altered by the fact that the conviction is based, not upon a plea of guilty or a trial, but upon a plea of nolo contendere. We conclude that an arbitral award that requires the employer to reinstate an employee who has been terminated following his conviction, upon the basis of such a plea, of embezzling the employer\u2019s funds, violates public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We agree with the plaintiff that the public policy against embezzlement encompasses the policy that an employer should not be compelled to reinstate an employee who has been convicted of embezzling the employer\u2019s funds, irrespective of whether the conviction followed a trial, a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The employment context ordinarily involves a number of legitimate expectations on the part of the employer that such a conviction is likely to undermine, irrespective of the legal underpinning of the conviction. For example, the employer is entitled to expect that he be able to trust an employee who is in a position of financial responsibility. The employer is also entitled to expect that his other employees will be able to trust their coemployees, and that those other employees will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>feel sufficiently deterred from engaging in embezzlement. Finally, the employer is entitled to expect that members of the public who are required to deal with his employees will feel that they are being served in an honest and trustworthy manner. All of these legitimate expectations are severely threatened by a requirement that the employer reinstate an employee who has been convicted of embezzling the employer\u2019s funds. That severe threat, moreover, is not removed or significantly ameliorated by the fact that the conviction rests upon a plea of nolo contendere, as opposed to a plea of guilty or a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Although we have stated in the context of litigation and administrative rulings that a prior conviction based upon a nolo contendere plea may have no currency beyond the case in which it was rendered; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 711-12 n.4; such a conviction does have the weight of a final adjudication of guilt and does share at least some characteristics of a guilty plea. \u201cA plea of nolo contendere has the same legal effect as a plea of guilty on all further proceedings within the indictment. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 35-36 n.8, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970); <em>Lawrence v. Kozlowski, </em>[supra, 705]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 363-64, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981). The only practical difference is that the plea of nolo contendere may not be used against the defendant as an admission in a subsequent criminal or civil case. 4 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadboum Rev. 1972) \u00a7 1066 (2), p. 81; Lenvin &amp; Meyers, \u2018Nolo Contendere: Its Nature and Implications,\u2019 51 Yale L.J. 1255 (1942). <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>197 Conn. 17, 20-21 n.7, 495 A.2d 1028 (1985). It is clear, however, that a nolo contendere plea also constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects in a manner equivalent to a guilty plea. <em>Lott </em>v. <em>United States, </em>367 U.S. 421, 81 S. Ct. 1563, 6 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1961); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>DePoli, </em>628 F.2d 779, 781 (2d Cir. 1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 97 n.5, 503 A.2d 136 (1985). Thus, it is simply too much to expect of the employer that it be required to set aside its legitimate expectations, solely because of the differences, which the law recognizes in contexts other than that of employment, between a conviction based upon a guilty plea or trial and a conviction based upon a nolo contendere plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\"><em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 705, upon which the defendant relies, does not require a different conclusion. In <em>Lawrence, </em>the plaintiff challenged, by way of an appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, the suspension of his driver\u2019s license by the defendant commissioner, who had admitted into evidence at the administrative hearing a certified record of the plaintiffs prior plea of nolo contendere to and ensuing conviction of negligent homicide. Id., 710. In concluding that the commissioner should not have admitted that record, we reiterated that \u201cin a judicial proceeding the plaintiffs nolo contendere plea and arrest would be inadmissible. Furthermore, despite the broad latitude given the commissioner with respect to the admission of evidence, we are also of the opinion that the nolo contendere plea should have been excluded from the administrative hearing as well, not only because it was of marginal probative value, but also because such pleas are often entered with the expectation that they will not be used against an accused in subsequent proceedings. See McCormick, [supra] \u00a7 265.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 711-12. In an explanatory footnote regarding the differences between a guilty plea and a nolo contendere plea, with respect to the latter, we stated: \u201cNor is it admissible ... as res judicata establishing that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act.\u201d Id., 711 n.4. For this proposition, we cited <em>Krowka </em>v. <em>Colt Patent Fire Arm Mfg. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Co., </em>125 Conn. 705, 714, 8 A.2d 5 (1939), in which, in the context of an action for damages, we had held that the record of a prior police court conviction of the plaintiff for breach of peace, based upon a nolo contendere plea, \u201cwas not admissible as res judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">As these authorities state, under our law a prior plea of nolo contendere and a conviction based thereon may not be admitted into evidence in a subsequent civil action or administrative proceeding to establish either an admission of guilt or the fact of criminal conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Civil actions and administrative proceedings, however, ordinarily do not involve the kind of legitimate expectations of the employer that are inherent in the employment context and that would be severely undermined by requiring the reinstatement of an employee convicted of embezzling his employer\u2019s funds. The absence of these considerations in the ordinary civil or administrative context, and the compelling nature of their presence in the employment context, differentiate these authorities from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">This differentiation, moreover, is premised on the notion that, because arbitration is essentially a private ordering scheme for resolving disputes, those authorities should not be extended to that private scheme. Voluntary arbitration is a method by which parties freely determine that their disputes will be resolved, at least in the first instance, not by public officials such as judges or administrators, but by arbitrators. Our legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>system encourages that determination by ordinarily giving great deference to the initial decision to arbitrate; <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 387, AFL-CIO, </em>252 Conn. 467, 473, 747 A.2d 480 (2000); and to both the factual and legal determinations of the arbitrators. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 7. Indeed, the arbitral process only becomes part of the public process of civil litigation if either party seeks judicial review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, and even then it is the exception, as in the present case, rather than the rule, that the scope of review of that decision requires a de novo determination by the court; and even in the present case, we give deference to the arbitrator\u2019s factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Therefore, although our jurisprudence traditionally has imposed limitations on the collateral effects to be given, in the civil and administrative litigation contexts, to a conviction based on a nolo plea, the private nature of voluntary arbitration strongly counsels against extending those limitations to the employment sphere governed by a voluntary arbitration clause. Put another way, our law is willing, for reasons of policy, to endorse the notion that a conviction based on a nolo plea is somehow different from and less than a criminal conviction based on a trial or guilty plea, to the extent that it may not be used for all purposes for which such convictions may be used in other public legal proceedings, such as civil trials and administrative proceedings. That does not mean, however, that the same notion must or should be extended to the private realm of arbitration governing employment. In that realm, a conviction based on a plea of nolo contendere does not, in our view, necessarily carry the same set of limitations with it.

Justice Peters subsequently reached her seventieth birthday on March 21, 2000, and is no longer a member of this court.

According to the arbitrator, Warren had not answered those questions because of confusion on the part of both the plaintiff and the defendant over the appropriate warnings required to have been given to Warren. Consequently, the arbitrator exonerated Warren of the insubordination charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Although the plaintiff did not raise this issue in its application to vacate, the trial court addressed it. Moreover, although the court appeared to endorse the plaintiffs position on this issue, the court rested its decision to vacate the award, not on this basis, but on the basis of the conviction. The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly addressed this issue because it was not within the scope of the pleadings. We need not address this claim, however, because we do not read the trial court\u2019s decision as resting on this ground, and the plaintiff has not renewed on appeal <em>its </em>claim on this issue as an alternate ground on which to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b65-9\"> The plaintiff also claimed that the award was in manifest disregard of the law. In light of its conclusion that the award violated public policy, the trial court did not address that claim. It is unnecessary for us to reach that claim as well. See footnote 7 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\"> Both parties agree that the submission to the arbitrator was unrestricted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 provides: \u201cVacating award, (a) Upon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof, shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u201c(b) If an award is vacated and the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court or judge may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators. Notwithstanding the time within which the award is required to be rendered, if an award issued pursuant to a grievance taken under a collective bargaining agreement is vacated the court or judge shall direct a rehearing unless either party affirmatively pleads and the court or judge determines that there is no issue in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">\u201c(c) Any party filing an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section concerning an arbitration award issued by the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration shall notify said board and the Attorney General, in writing, of such filing within five days of the date of filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">In <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 10, we also recognized that \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) includes the instance in which \u201can award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b69-5\"> We emphasize that we do not hold that, in imposing discipline on an employee who has been established to have embezzled his employer\u2019s funds, the employer is required by law to terminate the employee. The degree of discipline that the employer imposes is, in the first instance, within the discretion of the employer, subject to those standards set forth in the applicable personnel rules, collective bargaining agreement, and any other relevant materials. Indeed, in <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 566, Council 4, AFSCME, </em>43 Conn. App. 499, 501, 683 A.2d 1036 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 957, 688 A.2d 327 (1997), in which the employee had pleaded guilty to stealing union funds, the discipline imposed was not termination but demotion to a lesser position. The arbitral award that was held to violate public policy was to reinstate him to his prior position. Id., 504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\"> We acknowledge that there may be circumstances attending such a plea that are so extreme that a conviction based upon it should be given no credence whatsoever for purposes of an employment discipline decision. Suffice it to say that, although in the present case the circumstances attending Warren\u2019s plea generate understanding of his dilemma in deciding whether to plead nolo contendere or go to trial, they are not so extreme as to require that his conviction be wholly disregarded in the subsequent employment discipline decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> As the plaintiff suggests, however, this is not the universally held view. See, e.g., <em>Sokoloff v. Saxbe, </em>501 F.2d 571, 574-75 (2d Cir. 1974), in which the court sustained the revocation of a physician\u2019s license pursuant to a federal statute providing for such revocation upon the conviction of a drug-related felony, where the physician had been convicted of such a felony upon the basis of his nolo contendere plea. The court stated that \u201c[w]here ... a statute (or judicial rule) attaches legal consequences to the fact of a conviction, the majority of courts have held that there is no valid distinction between a conviction upon a plea of nolo contendere and a conviction after a guilty plea or trial.\u201d Id., 574.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b75-6\">MCDONALD, C.

I only wish to add that I do so as well for the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>Groton </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>252 Conn. 508, 526-27, 747 A.2d 1045 (2000).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b75-7\">KATZ, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfG\">with whom NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., joined, dissenting. I agree that, when a challenge to a voluntary arbitration award rendered pursuant to an unrestricted submission raises a legitimate and color-able public policy claim, the question of whether the award violates public policy requires de novo judicial review; see <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 429, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000); and that because the challenge in the present case raises such a claim, we should undertake de novo review of the award. I also agree that \u201cthe public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, 340, 555 A.2d 406 (1989). Applying the appropriate scope of review, I would conclude, however, that, based upon the undisputed facts of the present case, the award did <em>no t </em>violate the clear public policy against embezzlement because it was premised <em>solely </em>upon a conviction that followed a plea of nolo contendere.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The employment context ordinarily involves a number of legitimate expectations on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>employer that a conviction of embezzlement is likely to undermine. Therefore, as the majority states in its opinion, \u201cif [David] Warren\u2019s conviction for embezzlement of his employer\u2019s funds had followed either a guilty plea or a trial, the employer would have been justified in imposing appropriate discipline, including termination, and an arbitral award requiring his reinstatement to employment would have violated clear public policy. See, e.g., <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 566, Council 4, AFSCME, </em>43 Conn. App. 499, 500-501, 683 A.2d 1036 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 957, 688 A.2d 327 (1997) (where grievant had pleaded guilty to and been convicted of fraudulently diverting union funds, award reinstating him to job with responsibility for publicly owned property violated public policy); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Council 4, AFSCME, </em>27 Conn. App. 635, 641, 608 A.2d 718 (1992) (where grievant admittedly had misused state funds by cashing falsely generated public assistance checks, award of reinstatement to employment violated public policy). In either instance, the record would be sufficient to establish that the employee had in fact stolen from his employer. The guilty plea would constitute an admission of guilt; see <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>[171 Conn. 705, 711 n.4, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977)]; and the conviction after trial would be sufficient to establish the fact of the theft, under established principles of issue preclusion. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>220 Conn. 285, 296-307, 596 A.2d 414 (1991). In either of those instances, the public policy against theft also would include the policy that an employer should not be required to retain in a position of financial trust an employee who has been established to have stolen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The question posed by this appeal, however, is whether the arbitrator, as a matter of law, was required to determine that a conviction <em>after a plea of nolo con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tendere, as opposed to a plea of guilty or a conviction after atrial, established just cause for Warren\u2019s termination. The majority concludes that an arbitral award requiring an employer to reinstate an employee who has been terminated following a conviction of embezzling the employer\u2019s funds violates public pohcy irrespective of whether his conviction followed a trial, a guilty plea or a nolo contendere plea. The decision in this case does not turn, however, simply on whether the threat to the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations are removed or significantly ameliorated by the fact that the conviction of embezzlement rests upon a plea of nolo contendere, as opposed to a plea of guilty or a trial. Indeed, the public policy against embezzlement encompasses the policy that an employer should not be compelled to reinstate an employee who has embezzled the employer\u2019s funds, regardless of whether the employee even has been charged with, let alone convicted of, such an offense. Rather, the decision in this case turned on the arbitrator\u2019s finding that, because the employer had not sought to prove independently that Warren had embezzled its funds, relying exclusively on his nolo plea, the employer established \u201clittle or nothing about [Warren\u2019s] guilt or innocence . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Although a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere has the weight of a final adjudication of guilt, and shares some characteristics of a guilty plea,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> its limited evidentiary value is undisputed. As this court has stated, unlike a plea of guilty, \u201ca plea of nolo contendere is merely a declaration by the accused that he will not contest the charge, and even though followed by a finding of guilty and the imposition of a fine or other penalty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>is not admissible, either as a verbal admission or an admission by conduct. <em>Casalo </em>v. <em>Claro, </em>147 Conn. 625, 632, 165 A.2d 153 [1960]. Nor is it admissible to affect a party\u2019s credibility, as evidence of an arrest, or as res judicata establishing that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act. <em>Krowka </em>v. <em>Colt Patent Fire Arm Mfg. Co., </em>125 Conn. 705, 713, 8 A.2d 5 [1939]; see also Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 103f. Pleas of nolo contendere may be entered for reasons of convenience and without much regard to guilt and collateral consequences. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 265, p. 636. Even though the plea may be regarded as a tacit admission, its inconclusive and ambiguous nature dictates that it should be given no currency beyond the particular case in which it was entered. <em>A. B. Dick Co. </em>v. <em>Marr, </em>95 F. Sup. 83, 101 (S.D.N.Y. [1950]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thrower, </em>272 Ala. 344, 346, 131 So. 2d 420 [1961]; <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corporation </em>v. <em>Cloonan, </em>165 Kan. 68, 90, 193 P.2d 656 [1948]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>140 Me. 314, 318, 37 A.2d 799 [1944]; <em>State </em>v. <em>LaRose, </em>71 N.H. 435, 439, 52 A. 943 [1902]; <em>Honaker </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 50, 53 [1869]; see 4 Wigmore (3d Ed.) \u00a7 1066; annot., 18 A.L.R.2d 1287, 1314 \u00a7 5; annot., 152 A.L.R. 253; Fed. R. Crim. Procedure 11 (e) (6).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 711-12 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In reviewing an arbitration award, even on a claim of a public policy violation, neither the trial court nor this court has authority to make findings of fact that the arbitrator did not make. See, e.g. <em>United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 36-38, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987); <em>New York State Correctional Officers &amp; Police Benevolent Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>94 N.Y.2d 321, 704 N.Y.S.2d 910, 726 N.E.2d 462 (1999). Notably, the arbitrator made a factual finding that Warren, the employee in the present case, had consulted an attorney, who, in reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>on <em>Lawrence, </em>had advised him that a plea of nolo contendere was not an admission of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In the present case, there is, therefore, no factual foundation whatsoever for the assertion that Warren embezzled even one penny from his employer. As the arbitrator observed, for all anyone knows, Warren may have been accused falsely by a disgruntled landfill user or by someone else who harbored unfounded suspicions of misconduct. The arbitrator made a factual finding, which is binding on this court, that Warren, pursuant to the advice of counsel and \u201cunder the <em>Lawrence </em>decision\u201d that his plea could not be used against him, pleaded nolo contendere because, for financial reasons, he had deemed such a plea a more convenient and cleaner way to resolve the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Our case law does not permit the inference that a nolo contendere plea automatically fills in this gap in the factual findings made by the arbitrator. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 711-12 n.4. The holding in <em>Lawrence </em>has not been questioned until now. Nor has that holding been limited until now. The majority in this case concludes that, although a plea of nolo contendere and a conviction based thereon may not be admitted into evidence in a subsequent civil action or administrative proceeding to establish either an admission of guilt or the occurrence of criminal conduct, it is unfair to expect an employer to set aside its legitimate expectations, solely because of the differences between a conviction based upon a guilty plea or a trial and a conviction based upon a nolo contendere plea. The employer, however, need not set aside these expectations by reinstating an employee convicted of embezzling its funds. The employer may vindicate these expectations by demonstrating the misconduct that undermines its interests. A conclusion that the award conflicted with public policy therefore requires a determination that Warren embezzled, a finding that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>of the employer\u2019s reliance on his nolo plea, was not made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the absence of this finding, the majority\u2019s decision distills to what is essentially a determination that the arbitrator\u2019s adherence to our well established jurisprudence that a nolo plea is of limited precedential value was itself a violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">As the majority acknowledges, when a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s award is made on public policy grounds, the reviewing court is not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, but, rather, with the lawfulness of the award. <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>179 Conn. 184, 195, 425 A.2d 1247 (1979). That evaluation \u201cis to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 417, 544 A.2d 186 (1988). In the present case, the arbitrator adhered to our laws and legal precedents. I therefore fail to understand how, by following that law, and by failing to recognize the employment context exception announced today for the first time by the majority, the arbitrator violated any clear public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Finally, other than relying on the legitimate expectations of the employer, the majority does not explain adequately why we now<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should treat a conviction fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>lowing a nolo plea in the employment context differently from the way we traditionally have treated it in the civil and administrative arenas where other equally important interests are at stake. The majority states in its opinion that the employment context is different because it is premised on the notion that \u201carbitration is essentially a private ordering scheme for resolving disputes . . . .\u201d Although that is true, the arbitral process quite often becomes part of the public process of civil litigation. Additionally, not all arbitrations are unrestricted. Furthermore, not all employment cases are decided by arbitration. Nevertheless, according to the majority, Warren\u2019s nolo plea properly should have constituted substantive evidence in the arbitration proceeding, while, under <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Koslowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 712, his nolo plea could not have been used for substantive purposes had he been required to bring a civil action under his employment contract. Only if we were to overrule <em>Lawrence </em>in that context, a remedy that has not been sought, could the treatment be consistent. If it is, in fact, the employment context that is so significant, I fail to understand the disparate treatment of the evidence. There is certainly no indication in this case to even suggest that the expectations of the employer concerning the evidence upon which it could rely depended upon the forum in which Warren\u2019s termination could be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">In conclusion, in deciding to treat a conviction following a nolo plea differently from a conviction resulting from a trial or a guilty plea, we have engaged in a balancing test and have determined that facilitating resolution of criminal cases is paramount. By relying on the private nature of arbitration as a basis upon which to create an exception to our jurisprudence regarding the limited use of the nolo plea, the majority, in essence, takes the first step toward the elimination of the nolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>plea. While that step is certainly within its purview, I do not see its necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 35-36 n.8, 91 S.
