We conclude that it is not and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the trial court\u2019s granting of the bill of discovery filed by the plaintiff, Joseph Falco, against the defendant psychiatric hospital, the Institute of Living, to compel disclosure of the name, last known address and social security number of one of the defendant\u2019s patients referred to as John Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. On March 10, 1995, the plaintiff was admitted as an inpatient at the defendant. Shortly thereafter, on March 15, 1995, while attending a group meeting, the plaintiff allegedly was attacked without provocation by John Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">On January 7, 1997, after the defendant\u2019s insurer denied the plaintiff\u2019s insurance claim, the plaintiff filed this bill of discovery against the defendant to obtain identifying information from it that would enable him to bring an action against John Doe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>cated that this information was required immediately in order to file an action before the expiration of the statute of limitations on March 15,1997. The defendant moved to strike the bill of discovery on the grounds that it was improper under the circumstances, and that \u00a7 52-146e prohibited disclosure of communications and records identifying a patient. On February 28, 1997, during the pendency of the bill of discovery, the plaintiff filed a separate civil action against the defendant and John Doe.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In paragraph three of the first count of the complaint, the plaintiff identified John Doe by what he believed to be Doe\u2019s actual name. On March 10, 1997, in the present case, the trial court granted the plaintiffs bill of discovery and ordered the defendant to disclose John Doe\u2019s name, last known address and social security number.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed, with one judge dissenting, the judgment of the trial court granting the bill of discovery. <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>50 Conn. App. 654, 665, 718 A.2d 1009 (1998). The Appellate Court reasoned that, although \u00a7 52-146e applied, a court is nonetheless entitled to weigh a patient\u2019s statutory privilege against other countervailing considerations and, where appropriate, may provide for exceptions to the privilege beyond those explicitly articulated in the statute. Id., 657-58. Specifically, the court concluded that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tiffs state constitutional right to redress outweighed John Doe\u2019s statutory privilege against a \u201csingle limited disclosure\u201d of identifying information. Id., 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the plaintiff was entitled to a bill of discovery regarding \u2018John Doe\u2019s\u2019 name, last known address and social security number?\u201d <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>247 Conn. 948, 723 A.2d 324 (1998). The defendant claims that: (1) the trial court improperly exceeded its authority by recognizing an exception to John Doe\u2019s privilege that the legislature has not enacted; (2) disclosure of identifying information would implicate John Doe\u2019s constitutional privacy rights; and (3) John Doe was entitled to notice before the adjudication of the plaintiff\u2019s bill of discovery. We agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to reach the second and third claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The defendant first claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court could exercise its discretion to override the psychiatrist-patient privilege where the court discerned \u201ccompelling countervailing interests\u201d not explicitly recognized by the legislature. <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 659-60. The defendant argues that \u00a7 52-146e prohibits the disclosure of identifying information, narrowly limits the delineated exceptions to nondisclosure, and that the courts may not override that privilege where the legislature has not provided an exception. The plaintiff concedes that \u00a7 52-146e controls and that no appropriate statutory exception applies. He nonetheless contends that the trial court may balance competing interests and override the privilege in its discretion. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Section 52-146e (a) provides: \u201cAll communications and records as defined in section 52-146d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shall be confidential and shall be subject to the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146j, <em>inclusive. </em>Except as provided in sections 52-146f5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to 52-146\u00cd, <em>inclusive, </em>no person may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>disclose or transmit any communications and records or the substance or any part or any resume thereof which <em>identify a patient </em>to any person, corporation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>governmental agency without the consent of the patient or his authorized representative.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u201cAs we have previously observed, [t]he people of this state enjoy a broad privilege in the confidentiality of their psychiatric communications and records; <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 55, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990); and the principal purpose of that privilege is to give the patient an incentive to make full disclosure to a physician in order to obtain effective treatment free from the embarrassment and invasion of privacy which could result from a doctor\u2019s testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 234-35, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975). Accordingly, the exceptions to the general rule of nondisclosure of communications between psychiatrist and patient were drafted narrowly to ensure that the confidentiality of such communications would be protected unless important countervailing considerations required their disclosure. See, e.g., 9 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1961 Sess., p. 3945, remarks of Representative Nicholas B. Eddy (statutory scheme defines the protected relationship carefully and at the same time recognizes the legitimate interest of society in intruding upon the relationship <em>in certain limited </em>situations) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 195-96, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 629, 424 A.2d 293 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Although we are cognizant that \u201c[c]ommunications that bear no relationship to the purpose for which the privilege was enacted do not obtain shelter under the statute and are admissible subject to the normal rules of evidence\u201d; <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>190 Conn. 813, 819, 462 A.2d 1060 (1983); we are equally convinced that the protection of communications that identify a patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>are central to the purpose of the statute. The language of the statute supports this conclusion. Section 52-146e (a) specifically prohibits the disclosure or transmission of any communications or records that would \u201cidentify a patient . . . .\u201d Section 52-146d provides that the phrase \u201c \u2018identify a patient\u2019 refer[s] to communications and records which contain (A) names or other descriptive data from which a person acquainted with the patient might reasonably recognize the patient as the person referred to, or (B) codes or numbers which are in general use outside of the mental health facility which prepared the communications and records . . . .\u201d Further, the fact that an explicit exception contained in subdivision (3) of \u00a7 52-146\u00cd permits the disclosure of a patient\u2019s \u201cname, address and . . . [t]hat the person was in fact a patient\u201d for purposes of collection disputes between the hospital and the patient, lends weight to our conclusion that the general rule against disclosure applies with equal force to identity as to other information.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We therefore disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s characterization of information identifying the patient as \u201ca single limited disclosure . . . .\u201d <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 659. We also disagree with the plaintiffs suggestion, at oral argument before this court, that identifying information is of lesser importance within the statutory scheme than other communications and records. The confidentiality of a patient\u2019s identity is as essential to the statutory purpose of preserving the therapeutic relationship as the confidentiality of any other information in a patient\u2019s communications and records. The statute recognizes the unfortunate reality that a stigma may attach to one who seeks psychiatric care, and that revealing a patient\u2019s identity may subject him or her to embarrassment, harassment or discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>It is just as clear that no exception is available beyond those contained in \u00a7 52-146\u00cd. \u201c[W]e have long held that . . . exceptions to statutes are to be strictly construed with doubts resolved in favor of the general rule rather than the exception .... [W]here express exceptions are made, the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the operation of the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ensign-Bickford Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>245 Conn. 257, 268, 715 A.2d 701 (1998). With respect to \u00a7 52-146e, we have noted that the legislature has narrowly drafted the exceptions to the general rule against disclosure after carefully balancing the important countervailing considerations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 235 Conn. 195. The inference that we draw is that the legislature did not intend to save other cases from the general rule. Consideration of one exception in particular illustrates this point. Subdivision (7) of \u00a7 52-146f allows disclosure of communications to \u201cthe immediate family or legal representative of the victim of a homicide committed by the patient where such patient has . . . been found not guilty of such offense by reason of mental disease or defect\u201d for use in a civil action against the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>The passage of the bill that ultimately was enacted as subdivision (7) of \u00a7 52-146\u00cd followed the murder of a young girl by a psychiatric patient in Middletown. See 35 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13,1992 Sess., pp. 4441-49. The murder highlighted the difficulties presented to a litigant by the psychiatrist-patient privilege. Id. The legislature, however, did not draft an exception that assists civil claimants in general. See id., p. 4447, remarks of Representative Peter A. Nystrom (\u201c[s]ome of us in the House probably don\u2019t think the amendment goes far enough, but that\u2019s another battle for another day\u201d). The exception allows disclosure only after a homicide trial, and only after the patient has been found not guilty by reason of mental disease and defect. As Representative Robert M. Ward stated, the exception was a \u201cquite narrowly drawn change to the law . . . strictly limited to those fact patterns\u201d described in the act. Id., p. 4441. Therefore, we conclude that it is contrary to the language of the statute and the intent of the legislature for courts to make discretionary case-by-case determinations of when the privilege may be overridden.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">We reject the argument that, even in the absence of a statutoiy exception, the plaintiffs right to redress pursuant to article first, \u00a7 10, of the constitution of Connecticut<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> permits us to override the patient\u2019s privilege. We are unpersuaded that the right to redress is implicated at all, either by the statute generally or on the facts of this case specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">First, the right to redress is not implicated unless the statute restricts or alters the cause of action itself. See <em>Gentile </em>v. Altermatt, 169 Conn. 267, 284, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976). The psychiatrist-patient privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>merely restricts the discovery and the availability of evidence\u2014in this case, the communications and records held by the defendant. In this respect, the psychiatrist-patient privilege is no different from other common privileges such as the attorney-client or spousal privileges. Evidentiary privileges exist for \u201cthe protection of interests and relationships which, rightly or wrongly, are regarded as of sufficient social importance to justify some sacrifice of availability of evidence relevant to the administration of justice.\u201d 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 72, p. 269. The plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the privilege limits or impairs the cause of action itself. In the absence of that showing, we cannot conclude that the plaintiffs right to redress is implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Second, the plaintiff presented no evidence in the record to show the absence of alternative means of discovering the requested information other than disclosure by the defendant. The lack of such evidence lends credence to the defendant\u2019s argument, which echoes Judge Schaller\u2019s dissent from the Appellate Court decision, that the plaintiff employed the bill of discovery as a fast and easy alternative to diligent investigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff merely stated in the bill of discovery that \u201c[t]here are no other adequate means [of] seeming the information conveniently, effectively and completely.\u201d We agree with Judge Schaller\u2019s observation in his dissent that \u201c[i]t can hardly be seriously contended that failing to provide the most <em>convenient </em>way to obtain information about aputative defendant deprives aplaintiff \u2019 of his right to redress. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>We therefore conclude that the psychiatrist-patient privilege may be overridden only by legislatively enacted exceptions, and that the facts of this case do not fall within the narrowly drawn exceptions delineated by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court, and to remand the case to that court with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e provides: \u201cDisclosure of communications, (a) All communications and records as defined in section 52-146d shall be confidential and shall be subject to the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146j, inclusive.

Since we rest our decision in this case on statutory grounds alone, we save for another day the issue of whether reasonable efforts or more must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>given by a health care provider regarding notice to a patient whose records are sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> John Doe purportedly was served by abode service at the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> \u201cThe plaintiffs original request contained in the bill of discovery requested the full name, last known address, social security number and date of birth, the medical and psychiatric records of John Doe while he was an inpatient at the hospital during March, 1995, and all incident reports made by the defendant regarding the incident that occurred on or about March 15, 1995. At oral argument on the bill of discovery, the plaintiff withdrew his request for the psychiatric records of the patient in question, conceding that it was privileged information, and his request for the incident reports, as that information could be obtained through discovery. The trial court did not grant the plaintiffs request for John Doe\u2019s date of birth. \u201d <em>Falco </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, </em>50 Conn.

It was not intended as an invitation to courts to determine, independent of statutory enactment, when the privilege should be overridden. This court has never indicated, and explicitly rejects the suggestion, that it is the function of the judiciary to balance these considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Nothing in our decision today contradicts our prior observation that the broad psychiatrist-patient privilege may be subject to exceptions other than those enumerated in \u00a7 52-146f. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 629. As we also have noted, however, the creation of those exceptions is within the province of the legislature, not the discretion of the courts.
