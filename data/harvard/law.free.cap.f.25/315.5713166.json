The plaintiff concedes that the death of her husband, the assured, was caused by the act of the assured himself. It was conceded that the deatli did not result by reason of any accident to which the assured was exposed. He took his life himself. Ho fired the shot intentionally, according to the averment of the answer, and with the intention of taking his own life. That fact is not denied, and I submit, in the light of all the authorities upon this question, the defendant is entitled to a verdict upon the pleadings, and that it is not competent to go into any inquiry at all as to the condition of the mind of the assured at the time when he committed the act of which this defendant complains.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-11\">Treat, J., <em>(orally.) </em>Ordinarily, of course, felony implies an intent.

The proposition in its more convenient form could have been presented by a demurrer to the replication, and thereby have saved time and unnecessary delay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-9\"><em>Mr. Krum. </em>My excuse for not doing so, your honor will remember, was because I have been so hurried with other matters in this court that I did not have time to present the question in the form of a demurrer.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-12\"> Reported by Benj. if. Bex, Esq., of the St. Louis bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b334-10\">\n<em>The Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ASE\">The proposition now comes up after the jury is impaneled on the presentation of the first item of testimony offered in this case. Whether that should be admitted or rejected depends on the determination of the court with respect to the true construction of the policy submitted. I have examined these eases to which course! have referred. They are not new to me, because the original <em>Terry Case (Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>15 Wall. 580) went from this cir&lt; uit court, and the <em>Case of Bigelow, </em>decided in the United States supreme. court, 93 U. S. 284, remains unchanged, and the <em>Case of Broughton, </em>109 U. S. 121, S. C. 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 99, and the <em>Case of Lathrop </em>in 111 U. S. 612, S. C. 4 Sup. Ct. Rep. 533, do not vary the rule; for the policies in both those cases were like the original <em>Terry Case. </em>But where parties insert in the contract \u201cthat if the death is caused by the assured, sane or insane,\u201d then there can be no recovery, if he committed the fatal act otherwise than accidentally. Of course, if it is accidental, it was not his act. The next question presented here is whether the use of the terms \u201cfeloniously or otherwise\u201d are equivalent to the terms \u201csane or insane.\u201d As suggested last night, the word \u201cfeloniously\u201d ordinarily implies an intent, which might lead the court to inquire whether the party was capable of having an intent within the meaning of the law, which would leave this case as in the <em>Terry </em>and other like cases. The supreme court in the <em>Case of Bigelow </em>decided that the use of this phrase \u201cfeloniously or otherwise\u201d was equivalent to the words \u201csane or insane,\u201d so that if the assured caused his own death that was the end of the right of recovery; consequently this court has to rule out all testimony looking to the condition of the mind of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>assured when he committed the fatal act. All testimony relating to that will have to bo ruled out, though there is an immaterial issue on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">The court regrets that all these matters were not disposed of by a demurrer to the petition, hut for reasons of his own the counsel prefers this mode, which is a lawful mode. The result of it is, under the pleadings as they stand before the court, the assured, George M. Eiley shot himself, and death followed. That ends the case. If he did so, no beneficiary under the policy can recover. This policy is different from a great many others where other questions are open. He chose to take out a policy in a mutual society whereby, if he killed himself, \u201csane or insane,\u201d no matter under what circumstances, and he chose to kill himself, no recovery could be had under the policy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
