L. c. 62, \u00a7 47, as finally amended by St. 1926, c. 287, \u00a7 3, (see St. 1930, c. 416, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 33,) abatement is sought of an income tax paid by the complainant upon his income for the year 1928. The case came before the judge as a case stated and was reported without decision by him for our determination. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7111.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The only question argued is whether the complainant was hable to taxation upon his income for the year 1928. (No question is raised as to procedure, or as to the taxable nature of the income or the amount of the tax thereon if the complainant was \u00e1 taxable person.) The complainant contends (a) that he was not hable for a tax on his income for the year 1928 unless he continued to be an \"inhabitant\u201d of the Commonwealth, within the meaning of the taxing statute, for some part of the year 1929, and (b) that he did not continue to be such an \"inhabitant\u201d for any part of that year. The first contention need not be discussed for we are of opinion that on the case stated the complainant continued to be an \"inhabitant\u201d of the Commonwealth for a part of the year 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\">Taxes upon income are imposed by G. L. c. 62, as amended. Section 1 provides that income of certain classes \"received by any inhabitant of the Commonwealth during the preceding calendar year \u201d shall be taxed at a given rate. Section 5 provides for the taxation of other classes of income \"received by any inhabitant of the Commonwealth during the preceding calendar year\u201d at other and different rates. See also \u00a7 19. Section 22 provides that every \"individual inhabitant of the Commonwealth . . . whose annual income from all sources exceeds two thousand dollars shall annually make a return of his entire income,\u201d with certain exceptions, and that every \"other individual inhabitant\u201d who received taxable income shall make an annual return of such income. Section 25, prior to its amendment by St. 1929, c. 361, \u00a7 2, provided that every \"individual who is an inhabitant of the Commonwealth at any time between January first and June thirtieth, both inclusive, in any year,\u201d and certain other persons, \"shall be subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter,\u201d and \u201cshall file a return under section twenty-two or twenty-three if he has in the preceding year received income taxable under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The material facts in regard to the complainant\u2019s inhabitancy as agreed upon by the parties are in substance as follows: The complainant was an inhabitant of Newton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>during the year 1927 and the year 1928, \"at least through December 27.\u201d In April, 1928, he purchased a dwelling house at 217 First Street, Fort Myers, Florida, with the intention of making it his home at some future time. On November 21, he paid Florida State, county and city taxes on this dwelling house. On December 5, he notified the board of assessors of Newton that he had purchased this dwelling house and was leaving for Fort Myers with the intention of becoming a permanent inhabitant of that city. He also asked the board of assessors to make a notation to cancel any further assessments of poll taxes and to notify the board of registrars to remove his name from the list of voters, and stated that his future address would be 217 First Street, Fort Myers, Florida. On December 28, 1928, the complainant left Newton with the intention of going directly to Fort Myers and of making his home there in the house he had purchased and had no intention of returning to this Commonwealth \"as a State of domicil.\u201d The following day he took a steamship from New York City to Jacksonville, Florida. He arrived in Florida waters about 3 a.m., January 1, 1929, and in Jacksonville, Florida, at 7 a.m., January 1, 1929, and on the next day reached Fort Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">1. If being an \"inhabitant\u201d of the Commonwealth within the meaning of the taxing statute is equivalent to having a domicil therein, the complainant was an inhabitant of the Commonwealth until sometime in January, 1929. The complainant has not sustained the burden of proving a change of his domicil before January 1, 1929. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bogigian, </em>265 Mass. 531, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The rules governing domicil are well settled. Every person must have a domicil somewhere. <em>Feehan </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>237 Mass. 169, 171. \"Domicil of origin or domicil acquired remains until a new one is acquired.\u201d <em>Hallet </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>100 Mass. 167, 170. (Even if it is true, as stated in that case, that \"Native domicil is not so easily changed as acquired domicil, and more easily reverts,\u201d compare <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>12 Cush. 44, 50, the principle does not help the complainant for it does not appear that his domicil in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Massachusetts was acquired or that his domicil of origin was in Florida.) \u201cTo establish a change of domicil, fact and intent must concur.\u201d <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>212 Mass. 434, 436. See also <em>Whately </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>196 Mass. 393, 394; <em>Tax Collector of Lowell </em>v. <em>Hanchett, </em>240 Mass. 557, 558-560; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bogigian, </em>265 Mass. 531, 538. A \u201cdomicil once existing cannot be lost by mere abandonment even when coupled with the intent to acquire a new one, but continues until a new one is in fact gained.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>98 Mass. 158, 160. See also <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>132 Mass. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">The facts in this case show that before the end of the year 1928 the complainant had formed an intention to acquire a domicil in Florida and, specifically, at Fort Myers. He did not, however, reach any part of Florida until some time in January, 1929. That, before the year 1928 closed, he had abandoned his old home and was beyond the borders of Massachusetts on his way to his new home with no intention of returning to this Commonwealth \u201cas a State of domicil\u201d was not sufficient to effect a change of domicil. So far as this case turns on the rules governing domicil, it is not distinguishable from <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>98 Mass. 158, and cannot be decided for the complainant without departing from the principle that a person must have a domicil somewhere. The complainant did not acquire a domicil in Florida until some time in 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Even in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>16 Gray, 337, 340, relied on by the complainant, it was recognized that in circumstances closely similar to those of this case no change of domicil in its technical sense was effected, but this decision went on the ground that being an \u201cinhabitant\u201d of a place within the meaning of the taxing statute was not equivalent to being domiciled therein. <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Longmeadow, </em>12 Allen, 598, also relied upon by the complainant, was decided upon a similar state of facts. In the opinion it was stated that the \u201cprecise point was adjudged in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>16 Gray, 337, and this case must be governed by that decision,\u201d though there was also language to the effect that, a person who had gone beyond the limits of the State with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the intention of taking up his residence in another State \u201chad abandoned his domicil in this State.\u201d Page 599. The decision was explained on the latter ground in <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>132 Mass. 89, 95. See, for another explanation, <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>98 Mass. 158, 160. But we think that <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Longmeadow </em>must stand or fall with <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>and cannot be regarded as an independent authority, opposed to the otherwise unbroken current of our decisions, for the proposition that an existing domicil may be lost without another being gained.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">2. To be an \u201cinhabitant\u201d of the Commonwealth within the meaning of the income tax statute, is equivalent to being domiciled therein. This interpretation of the statute was assumed without discussion in <em>Feehan </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>237 Mass. 169, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bogigian, </em>265 Mass. 531. The tax upon income is in large part a substitute for the tax upon intangible personal property previously imposed upon owners thereof in the cities and towns of which they were inhabitants. See R. L. c. 12, \u00a7 23. No reason appears for a more restricted meaning of the word \u201cinhabitant\u201d in the income tax statute than in the personal property tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">In <em>Tax Collector of Lowell </em>v. <em>Hanchett, </em>240 Mass. 557, a case arising under the personal property tax statute, it was assumed, without discussion, though citing, at pages 558 and 559, <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>132 Mass. 89, that to be an \u201cinhabitant\u201d of a city was equivalent to being domiciled therein; and in <em>Boston Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>158 Mass. 461, 462, it was said, also citing <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>that the \u201cword \u2018inhabitant\u2019 in this statute means one whose domicil is in the place referred to.\u201d See Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20. See also <em>Collector of Taxes of Boston </em>v. <em>Mount Auburn Cemetery, </em>217 Mass. 286. In <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Buckland, </em>159 Mass. 491, 492, a case involving a pauper\u2019s settlement dependent upon residence and payment of taxes (Pub. Sts. c. 83, \u00a7 1, Fifth), the court said, citing <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>\u201cIt now is settled that domicil is residence for the purposes of taxation.\u201d See also <em>Stoughton </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>165 Mass. 251, 252-253. In <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>132 Mass. 89, the court, in consider- . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ing the meaning of the word \u201cinhabitant\u201d in the personal property tax statute, made the following statements: \u201cWe cannot construe the statute to mean anything else than \u2018being domiciled in.\u2019\u201d Page 95. \u201cWe think, however, that the sounder and wiser rule is to make taxation dependent upon domicil.\u201d Page 96. \u201cUpon the whole, therefore, we can have no doubt that the word \u2018inhabitant\u2019 as used in our statutes when referring to liability to taxation, by an overwhelming preponderance of authority, means \u2018one domiciled.\u2019\u201d Page 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">The conclusion thus emphatically stated in <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston </em>was supported by compelling reasons, and it was demonstrated by a thorough examination of the earlier cases that there were no conflicting precedents in our decisions apart from <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>16 Gray, 337, and <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Longmeadow, </em>12 Allen, 598. As to these cases the court said, at page 94, \u201cThe only case adjudged within this Commonwealth, in which the word of the statute, \u2018inhabitant,\u2019 is construed to mean something else than \u2018being domiciled in,\u2019 is <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester, </em>16 Gray, 337, although that decision is subsequently recognized in <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Longmeadow, </em>12 Allen, 598.\u201d The reasoning of <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester </em>was criticized and the ground upon which it was decided repudiated. The court, however, did not in terms overrule these earlier cases. With great caution it pointed out that in each of them, unlike the case then before the court, an intention was shown, formed before removal from the Commonwealth, fixing a place certain for the future home, and that it was not necessary to decide whether they should be followed in a case presenting precisely similar circumstances. Pages 99-100. But it was not suggested that this difference in facts furnished any basis in principle for distinguishing the cases, and the clear implications of the opinion are that it does not. See page 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The case expressly left undecided in <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston </em>has now arisen. We find, however, no sound ground for taking it out of the application of the general principle stated, and made the ground of decision in that case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>expressly or by implication accepted as law in the later cases, that under the taxing statutes inhabitancy and domicil are equivalent. We think therefore, that <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Rochester </em>and <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Longmeadow </em>should not be followed, but must be regarded as having been in effect overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">Of course we are considering the meaning of \"inhabitant\u201d only as used in the governing statute. It may have a different meaning in statutes dealing with other subjects. As is true of the words \"citizen\u201d and \"resident,\u201d its meaning depends upon the connection in which it is used. See <em>Harvard College </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>5 Pick. 370, 373; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>17 Pick. 231, 234; <em>Borland </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>132 Mass. 89, 93; <em>Stoughton </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>165 Mass. 251; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>240 Mass. 350, 353-354; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>240 Mass. 601, 608; <em>Dillaway </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>256 Mass. 568, 577; <em>Marlborough </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>275 Mass. 394, 396-397.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">It follows that the complainant is not entitled to an abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\n<em>Complaint dismissed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
