There was some dispute about the parties making an \u201cagreed case.\u201d It does not appear to the court that there was an agreed case. In fact, the appellant\u2019s counsel, with that commendable candor which his position at the bar would lead us to expect, admits that he did not so understand it. There could not be an agreed case except in writing. It has been decided long ago <em>(Talbird </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>31 S. C., 601,) that the agreed case must be in writing; and, unless it is, it could not be filed, as required by Code, \u00a7 345, subd. 5. As far back as <em>Tribble </em>v. <em>Poore </em>(May 14, 1888), 30 S. C., 97, this court decided what the return shall consist of, as required by Rule 2. Rule 2 requires that \u201cwhen the appeal is from a judgment the return <em>* * * </em>shall consist of copies of the judgment roll, the notice of appeal and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ceptions;\u201d and the case, as prepared for argument, is nota part of the return.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Agf1\"><em>Perry &amp; Heyward </em>and <em>J. A. McCullough, </em>for the motion. <em>Cothran, Wells, Ansel &amp; Cothran, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">It was objected on the part of appellants that the affidavit filed with the clerk, upon which he acted, was sworn to before an attorney engaged in the cause, in violation of Rule 16 of this court; and it was urged that this invalidates the order entered dismissing the appeal. Eule 16 is as follows: \u201cNo affidavit will be considered by the court, which has been sworn to before an attorney engaged in the cause or matter, or before any party .interested therein.\u201d This rule is a very harsh rule. It has never been construed, and only once invoked, and then the moving party abandoned it. The court is not willing to extend its operation beyond its letter, and we do not think it can be applied here. The motion is in the nature of an appeal from the order entered by the clerk dismissing the appeal. Now, suppose this was an appeal from the Circuit Court. Would an objection like this beseriously entertained? In addition to this, Eule 1, which confers upon the clerk his authority to dismiss an appeal for failure of appellant to file his return, specifies that \u201c* * * upon an affidavit\u201d to the effect that the appellant had not filed his return, etc., the respondent may obtain from the clerk an order dismissing the appeal for want of prosecution. If he is satisfied by affidavit that the rule has not been complied with, he is bound, upon application, to dismiss the appeal. It is the judgment of the court, that the motion tore-instate the appeal be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">On hearing the motion to reinstate the appeal herein, dismissed bythe clerk under Eules land 2, after argument of counsel, it is ordered, that said motion be, and hereby is, refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
