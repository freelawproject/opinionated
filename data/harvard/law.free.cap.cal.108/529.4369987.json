Plan of lots in Mission valley belonging to James Reiner, Esq., county surveyor\u2019s office, San Diego, January 12,1856. Wm. H. Leighton, deputy county surveyor. 'The foregoing subdivision or survey of lots is a subdivision of one hundred and sixty acres situated in Mission valley, and being numbered one thousand one hundred and three on the official map of San Diego. Joseph Reiner. Received for record January 28, 1858, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m., and recorded February 4,1858, at 4 o\u2019clock p. m., at request of Joseph Reiner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">\u201c Geo. A. Pendleton, Recorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGB\">Across the map were lines dividing it into blocks or ' lots, four of which, extending through the center from left to right, were marked as 660 feet square, and numbered: \u201c 1, 10 acres,\u201d \u201c'2,\u201d \u201c 3,\u201d and \u201c 4.\u201d At the upper left-hand corner was a lot marked \u201c A, 10 acres,\u201d on which was written: \u201c Surveyed for Joshua Sloane, June 15, 1868. James Pascoe, county surveyor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">Plaintiffs next offered in evidence a deed from Joseph Reiner to Cave J. Gouts, dated February 10, 1858, and \u25a0recorded April 15, 1858. By this deed the grantor remised, released, and quitclaimed to the grantee \u201c lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>number three (3) and four (4), containing ten acres each, in Reiner\u2019s subdivision of lot 1103, .... said subdivision recorded in book one (1), page 184, records of San Diego county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Plaintiffs also offered other deeds from Gouts and his grantee, through and under which they claimed title to the lots in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Appellant objected to the Reiner deed and the other subsequent deeds upon the grounds: 1. \u201cThat the deed from Reiner to Gouts does not sufficiently describe the property, or any property, and that it does not state the state, county, or city in which the property is situated\u201d; 2. \u201c That the map offered in connection with the deeds does not appear to be the map referred to in the deeds\u201d; 3. \u201cThat the deeds refer to a map recorded in book 1 of the records of San Diego, page 184, while the map offered in evidence is not recorded, but simply pasted in the book, and that no map is recorded in the book offered at page 184, or elsewhere\u201d; 4. \u201cThat the deed and map, taken together, do not sufficiently describe the property, or any property, and that they do not show the county, state, or city\u201d; 5. \u201cThat said map does not purport to be map of 1103, but a map of a survey made for Joshua Sloane, June 15, 1858.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The court sustained the objection, and refused to admit the said deeds in evidence, and thereupon, the case being submitted without further evidence, rendered its decision and judgment in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The new trial was evidently granted upon the theory that the trial court erred in excluding the offered deeds; and the only question presented here for consideration is, Did the Reiner deed contain a description of the premises in controversy sufficient to pass the title thereto to Gouts, or was it void for uncertainty?</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">It is a general and well-settled rule of law that \u201c a deed, for a description of the land conveyed, may refer to another deed or to a map, and the deed or map to which reference is thus made is considered as incorporated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the deed itself.\u201d (Devlin on Deeds, sec. 1020, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">So, also, it is a familiar rule that when a tract of land has been subdivided into blocks or lots, and a map thereof made on which the blocks or lots are designated by numbers, a description of the blocks or lots in a deed by the numbers so designated is sufficient, provided the map can be produced and identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Of course the description of the premises in the deed must be sufficiently definite and certain to enable the land to be identified, or it will be void for uncertainty. But \u201cif a surveyor by applying the rules of surveying can locate the land, the description is sufficient. And, generally, the rule may be stated to be that the deed will be sustained if it is possible from the whole description to ascertain and identify the land intended to be conveyed.\u201d (Devlin on Deeds, sec. 1012.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">And see Lawson\u2019s Rights, Remedies, and Practice, volume 5, section 2285, where it is said, citing numerous authorities, that \u201c if, notwithstanding an uncertain description, the intention of the parties can be gathered from the deed, or from oral proof, the grant is not void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The objection that the description in the deed to Gouts was void for uncertainty, because it did not state the state, county, or city in which the property is situated, is not tenable. Such a statement was not necessary if without it the property could still be located and identified. <em>(Beal </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>33 Iowa, 318; <em>Kykendall </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>3 Kan. 85; <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Schenck, </em>9 Wis. 160; <em>Kile </em>v. <em>Yellowhead, </em>80 Ill. 208; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>81 Ill. 296; <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Burleson, </em>35 Neb. 238.) The deed in question described the lots by numbers, and as containing ten acres each in Reiner\u2019s subdivision of lot 1103, said subdivision being recorded in book 1, page 184, records of San Diego county. There was record evidence that Reiner owned lot 7 in Mission valley, and it was agreed that that lot was the same as lot 1103. It seems clear, therefore, that Reiner, in making his deed to Gouts, had in mind and referred to the lot which he owned and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>had had subdivided and platted. Under these circumstances we do not think it can be said, as matter of law, that the description was so defective as to be void for uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The objection that the map offered in connection with the deeds does not appear to be the one referred to in the deeds, but the map of a survey made for Joshua Sloane in June, 1868, is based on the indorsement found on the upper left-hand corner of the map. But that indorsement cannot have the effect claimed for it. At most, it would seem to indicate only that in June, 1868, Pascoe, as county surveyor, made a survey for Sloane of the ten-acre lot \u201cA,\u201d and then made the indorsement as a certificate of such survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The objection that the map, having been only pasted \u2022in the deed-book and not recorded, could not be used.to help out the description in the deed is rested upon the authority of <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Center, </em>30 Cal. 540; 89 Am. Dec. 131, and <em>Cadwalader </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>73 Cal. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In the case first cited the plaintiff produced a map from the recorder\u2019s office, and the defendants objected to it on the ground that <em>\u201c </em>it was made with pencil and not with ink,\u201d and that \u201c it is pasted in between the leaves of the book, but not recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">This court, after conceding that the parties to a deed, instead of setting out in full the metes and bounds or other complete designation of the tract intended to be conveyed, may describe it in whole or in part, by reference to some instrument, as a deed, map, etc., which contains or furnishes such a description of the land that it, -when read in connection with the deed, will completely identify the land, said: \u201c The objection should have been sustained. Had the deed referred to a map to be found in that place and condition, it would have been admissible in evidence, for it would have constituted in effect a part of the deed as much as if it had been copied into it. But the deed calls for a map duly <em>recorded </em>in the recorder's office, and by the utmost stretch of liberality the one produced cannot be regarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>as recorded. The act concerning county recorders provides that the several instruments entitled to record shall be recorded \u2018in large and strong bound books, and in a fair, large, and legible hand.' The necessary implication from this provision is that the instrument must be <em>copied </em>into the proper book of record; and in view of the purpose to be subserved by the recording of the several classes of instruments mentioned in the act\u2014the making and preservation of accurate and durable official copies of such instruments\u2014a copy made in pencil or other materials that would not permanently remain would not be within the spirit of the 'act. The map should, for these reasons, have been excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In the second case cited the deed was held void for uncertainty, because it appeared that the reference to the map therein was equally applicable to two different maps, and it was decided that, in such case, parol evidence was inadmissible to identify the one referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Without commenting on the cases cited, it is enough to say that there was no statute in 1858, and is none now, so far as we are advised, providing for the recording of maps. It is, however, a matter of common knowledge that it has been customary to deposit maps in the office of the county recorder, and to refer to them as \u201c recorded \u201d or \u201c of record \u201d in that office. And, when such a map is thus referred to, it may be identified by extrinsic evidence, and the fact that it is not recorded or of record, within the ordinary meaning of those words, is wholly immaterial. .In the case of <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Schmaelzle, 49 </em>Cal. 59, the deed for a description of the property to be conveyed referred to another deed \u201c recorded in Sacramento\u201d; and it was held that the description in the deed given was not vitiated by the fact that the deed referred to was falsely stated to be recorded in the county where the property was situated. And in <em>Colton Land. etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Swartz, </em>99 Cal. 278, a sheriff\u2019s deed described the property conveyed as the north half of block 36, Colton addition, a plat or map of which addition \u201cis of record in the office of the county recorder of San Ber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>nardino county, state of California.\u201d The map offered in evidence was found in a book of maps kept in the recorder\u2019s office, and it was objected that it was not. admissible, as it was not acknowledged so as to entitle-it to record. It was held that \u201c a map thus deposited within the recorder\u2019s office is properly referred to in am instrument of conveyance as being 1 of record \u2019 therein* and may be received in evidence, even though it be not-acknowledged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The map offered in evidence in this case was not objected to; but, if it had been, we think it admissible*, notwithstanding the deed referred to it as \u201c recorded in book one, page 184, records of San Diego county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The other points discussed by counsel do not require-special notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Vancliee, C., and Haynes, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the-order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">Harrison, J., G-aroutte, J., Van Fleet, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
