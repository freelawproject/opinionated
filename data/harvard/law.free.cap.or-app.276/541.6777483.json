It requires us to determine whether a borrower who has actual notice that his property is being sold at a trustee\u2019s sale under the Oregon Trust Deeds Act (OTDA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is barred from later challenging the sale on the grounds that the entity that executed the sale was neither a validly appointed successor trustee nor the agent of a trustee. We conclude that a person\u2019s property interest under <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.797 (2013), cannot be terminated unless a \u201ctrustee\u201d as defined in the OTDA executed the sale. Because the trial court erred in construing <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) as prohibiting all post-sale challenges by those with actual notice of the sale, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Following a trustee\u2019s sale at which GMAC Mortgage, LLC (GMAC) purchased real property that Matthew Wolf had used as security for a loan obligation, GMAC filed an action against Wolf for forcible entry and detainer (FED) to recover the property. Wolf filed a separate action for declaratory relief that Wolf owns the property free of any interest claimed by GMAC, alleging that multiple violations of the OTDA, including that the sale was not conducted by a \u201ctrustee\u201d within the meaning of the act, made the sale invalid. After the two actions were consolidated for trial, GMAC filed a motion for summary judgment on Wolfs declaratory claims. In moving for summary judgment, GMAC did not challenge Wolfs ability to prove any of the facts alleged in his complaint, but argued that <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>operated to foreclose and terminate Wolfs property interest after the trustee\u2019s sale, regardless of legal deficiencies in the sale, based on the undisputed facts that the property was sold at a trustee\u2019s sale, that Wolf had actual notice months before the sale, and that he took no action to delay or stop the sale. The trial court agreed, granted GMAC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and entered a limited judgment in GMAC\u2019s favor in the declaratory action. In addition, the parties agreed that the court\u2019s construction of the statute disposed of the FED dispute, and the court entered a stipulated general judgment of restitution in favor of GMAC on the FED action. The stipulated judgment expressly preserves Wolfs right to appeal to challenge the court\u2019s construction of <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011), and Wolf filed timely notices of appeal from both the limited judgment and the stipulated general judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Wolf argues that <em>former </em>ORS 86.770 (1) (2011) did not foreclose or terminate his interest in the property because, among other problems, the trustee\u2019s sale at which GMAC purchased the property was not conducted by someone who qualified as a \u201ctrustee.\u201d The trial court did not address\u2014 and we do not reach \u2014 the merits of Wolfs premise that the sale was not conducted by a \u201ctrustee,\u201d but we briefly explain the basis for that argument to provide context for the arguments raised in the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Wolf borrowed $168,000, for which he executed a note that was secured by a trust deed on property located in Newberg, Oregon. The lender named Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as the beneficiary in the trust deed, and MERS appointed LSI Title Company (LSI) as \u201csuccessor trustee.\u201d In June 2010, LSI executed a notice of default and election to sell the property, which were personally served on Wolf and recorded in Yamhill County. On April 1, 2011, LSI sold the property to GMAC. GMAC\u2019s action to recover the property from Wolf, and Wolfs declaratory action, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Wolf argues that MERS was neither the trustee of the trust deed secured by Wolfs property nor a beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>authorized to appoint a successor trustee and, therefore, lacked authority to foreclose on the deed by the OTDA mechanism of a trustee sale. He also argues that MERS lacked authority to appoint LSI as a \u201csuccessor trustee\u201d to execute the sale. He relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Brandrup v. ReconTrust Co., </em>353 Or 668, 688, 303 P3d 301 (2013), and <em>Niday v. GMAC Mortgage, LLC, </em>353 Or 648, 658, 302 P3d 444 (2013), which upheld similar challenges to MERS\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">On appeal, GMAC argues that, regardless of any violations of OTDA provisions, <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) prevents Wolf from raising his challenge to the validity of the sale, because the legislature intended trustees\u2019 sales to terminate the property interest of persons to whom notice of the sale was given, in order to promote the interests of certainty and finality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The parties\u2019 arguments require us to determine the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting the statute, and we do so by applying the framework for statutory construction set forth in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), <em>as modified by State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Under that framework, we first examine the text of the statute and its context. <em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171. If useful, we also may consider the statute\u2019s legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 171-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cIf, under ORS 86.705 to 86.795, a trustee sells property covered by a trust deed, the trustee\u2019s sale forecloses and terminates the interest in the property that belongs to a person to which notice of the sale was given under ORS 86.740 and 86.750 or to a person that claims an interest by, through or under the person to which notice was given. A person whose interest the trustee\u2019s sale foreclosed and terminated may not redeem the property from the purchaser at the trustee\u2019s sale. A failure to give notice to a person entitled to notice does not affect the validity of the sale as to persons that were notified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Wolf argues that the words \u201cunder ORS 86.705 to 86.795\u201d require the trustee\u2019s sale to be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with all the provisions of the OTDA. In other words, a failure to strictly comply with one or more provisions of the OTDA, Wolf argues, renders <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) inapplicable and the trustee\u2019s sale invalid. GMAC responds that the statute does not mandate strict compliance with every provision of the OTDA in order for a trustee\u2019s sale to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We need not resolve, however, whether <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) requires strict compliance with every provision of the OTDA before a person\u2019s property interests will be terminated by a trustee\u2019s sale.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court construed <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) to preclude every form of post-sale challenge raised by Wolf, and granted summary judgment on that basis. Our conclusion that the trial court erroneously construed the scope of <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) requires us to reverse the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We conclude that the participation of a \u201ctrustee\u201d is so fundamental to a \u201ctrustee\u2019s sale\u201d that a sale cannot foreclose and terminate an individual\u2019s property interest under <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) unless that sale is conducted by an actual trustee. The statute\u2019s text, read in context, supports that conclusion. The phrase, \u201c[i]f, under ORS 86.705 to 86.795, a <em>trustee </em>sells property covered by a trust deed,\u201d when read in light of the OTDA as a whole, can refer only to a sale conducted by the trustee. <em>Former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) (emphasis added). The OTDA defines a \u201ctrustee\u201d in terms of a legal relationship: For purposes of the OTDA, \u201c\u2018[t]rustee\u2019 means a person, other than the beneficiary, <em>to whom a trust deed conveys an interest in real property, </em>or the person\u2019s successor in interest.\u201d <em>Former </em>ORS 86.705(8) (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.705(9) (2013) (emphasis added). Thus, the \u201ctrustee\u201d under the OTDA is a creature of statute with a defined legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>relationship to the beneficiary of the trust deed and to the real property in which the trust deed secures an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The power of sale under the OTDA is likewise conferred by statute \u2014 and, importantly, is conferred only upon a trustee. <em>See </em>ORS 86.710 (where transfer in trust of an interest in real property is made pursuant to provisions of the OTDA, power of sale is conferred only upon \u201cthe trustee\u201d); <em>see also former </em>ORS 86.790(3) (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.713 (2013) (stating that the beneficiary may appoint in writing a \u201csuccessor trustee\u201d); ORS 86.735 (2011), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 304, \u00a7 10; Or Laws 2013, ch 625, \u00a7 4, <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.752 (2013) (authorizing \u201c[t]he trustee\u201d to foreclose a trust deed by advertisement and sale only if certain requirements are met). In other words, in the absence of a validly appointed trustee, there is no \u201ctrustee\u201d at all for purposes of the OTDA \u2014 and, hence, no \u201ctrustee\u2019s sale\u201d with the power to foreclose other persons\u2019 property interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">GMAC urges us to look for context to <em>former </em>ORS 86.780 (2011), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 86.803 (2013), under which a \u201cstatutory presumption of finality\u201d arises when a trustee\u2019s deed is issued and recorded. <em>See Staffordshire Investments, Inc. v. Cal-Western, </em>209 Or App 528, 543, 149 P3d 150 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 727 (2007). According to GMAC, that context demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intention that <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) should bar post-sale challenges. We conclude that the statute suggests the opposite intention. The presumption that arises under <em>former </em>ORS 86.780 (2011) is merely a rebuttable presumption if the purchaser is not a bona fide purchaser (BFP). That statute provides that the recitals contained within the deed \u201cshall be prima facie evidence in any court of the truth of the matters set forth therein\u201d but \u201cshall be conclusive in favor of a purchaser for value in good faith relying upon them.\u201d <em>Former </em>ORS 86.780 (2011). Thus, if the purchaser is <em>not </em>a BFP, the statute provides only a rebuttable presumption. <em>See </em>OEC 311(2) (\u201cA statute providing that a fact or a group of facts is prima facie evidence of another fact establishes a presumption ***.\u201d); OEC 308 (\u201cIn civil actions and proceedings, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>presumed fact is more probable than its existence.\u201d). The existence of a <em>rebuttable </em>presumption suggests that the legislature, in fact, contemplated challenges to the <em>prima facie </em>evidence contained in the trustee\u2019s deed, if not the validity of the trustee\u2019s deed itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\">GMAC also argues that the legislative history emphasizes certainty and finality in foreclosure proceedings as the major public policy consideration and that allowing post-sale challenges like Wolfs challenge here \u201cwould gut the purpose of the OTDA.\u201d However, we emphasized in <em>Staffordshire </em>that \u201cthere is nothing * * * in the Act, to indicate that the legislature intended the auction to be final <em>in the absence of legal authority to sell the </em>property.\u201d 209 Or App at 542 (emphasis in original). We examined the underlying purpose behind the OTDA\u2019s statutory framework and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">\u201cThe [OTDA] represents a well-coordinated statutory scheme to protect grantors from the unauthorized foreclosure and wrongful sale of property, while at the same time providing creditors with a quick and efficient remedy against a defaulting grantor * * *. [I]t confers upon a trustee the power to sell property securing an obligation under a trust deed in the event of default, without the necessity for judicial action. However, the trustee\u2019s power of sale is subject to strict rules designed to protect the grantor, including provisions relating to notice and reinstatement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">As our discussion in <em>Staffordshire </em>demonstrates, the OTDA represents a balance of interests. Although the legislature intended to provide finality, it also intended to protect grantors from the unauthorized foreclosure and wrongful sale of property. Construing <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) to treat as final a sale conducted by one who is not a trustee would run afoul of the \u201cstrict rules\u201d and \u201cwell-coordinated statutory scheme\u201d that the legislature established for nonjudicial foreclosure. <em>See Staffordshire, </em>209 Or App at 542. We conclude that the legislature, by referring in <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) to a sale by a \u201ctrustee,\u201d intended beneficiaries of trust deeds to have a quick, efficient, and final remedy through nonjudicial foreclosure, but only in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>case of a true \u201ctrustee\u2019s <em>sale\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., a sale by a \u201ctrustee,\u201d as defined in ORS 86.705.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Because <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) applies only to a \u201ctrustee\u2019s sale,\u201d it cannot preclude a post-sale challenge to the sale of Wolfs property by someone who was not, in fact, the trustee, which is what Wolf alleged \u2014 and GMAC did not dispute on summary judgment \u2014 happened here. We, thus, conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based solely on the ground that Wolf had actual notice of the trustee\u2019s sale and took no action to delay or stop it prior to the sale. The trial court\u2019s error in construing <em>former </em>ORS 86.770(1) (2011) requires reversal on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">\u201cThe OTDA * * * was enacted in 1959 to provide an alternative to the judicial foreclosure process. Ronald Brady Tipperts, <em>Note, Mortages </em>\u2014 Trust <em>Deeds in Oregon, </em>44 Or L Rev 149,149-50 (1965). That nonjudicial alternative is available when the parties use a trust deed to secure the loan. A trust deed is a deed executed under the OTDA that \u2018conveys an interest in real property to a trustee in trust to secure the performance of an obligation the grantor or other person named in the deed owes to a beneficiary.\u2019 ORS 86.705(7). The OTDA permits the trustee appointed under a trust deed to advertise and sell the property to the highest bidder without judicial involvement.
