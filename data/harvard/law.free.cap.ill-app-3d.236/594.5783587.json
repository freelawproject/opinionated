She was also found to have a large amount of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in her blood. Because of her condition and the inability of her 19-year-old parents to care for her, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) filed a petition for adjudication of wardship in the juvenile division of the circuit court of Cook County. Thomas E. Holum was appointed guardian ad litem (GAL). Gary T. Morgan, the guardianship administrator of the DCFS, was appointed temporary custodian with the right to consent to medical treatment. Subsequently, the court entered a dispositional order vacating Morgan\u2019s temporary custodianship and appointing him guardian of the child.</p> <p id=\"b617-5\" pgmap=\"617\">The DCFS filed a supplemental petition in the juvenile court for instructions and for authority to consent to the entry of a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d (DNR) order on C.A.\u2019s medical charts. The petition alleged that C.A.\u2019s medical condition had deteriorated and that the hospital had obtained from C.A.\u2019s parents a letter stating their desire that their daughter receive treatment to alleviate her pain or improve her life, but not to resuscitate her if she stopped breathing or if her heart stopped.</p> <p id=\"b617-6\" pgmap=\"617\">After a hearing, the juvenile court granted the petition and entered an order finding it to be \u201cin the best interest of the minor\u201d for the DCFS \u201cto act in accordance with the recommendations of the treating physicians\u201d of the patient. That order was stayed pending this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b617-7\" pgmap=\"617\">The GAL raises a number of challenges to the trial court\u2019s order. One is directed at the court\u2019s authority to enter the order under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 801 \u2014 1 et seq.); another challenges the guardian\u2019s standing to petition for consent to withhold medical treatment; and a third questions whether the evidentiary showing in this case was sufficient to justify entry of a DNR order. Finally, the GAL challenges the constitutionality of the newly enacted Health Care Surrogate Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 1 et seq.), legislation that became effective 10 days after the entry of the trial court\u2019s order in this case.</p> <p id=\"b617-8\" pgmap=\"617\">Background</p> <p id=\"b617-9\" pgmap=\"617\">The baby was born on October 23, 1990. She was small for her gestational age (fifth percentile) and was experiencing interventricular hemorrhaging, which means that the blood vessels in her brain were quite weak and subject to spontaneous rupture. She required the use of a cardiac monitor and mechanical ventilation for weeks after her birth.</p> <p id=\"b617-10\" pgmap=\"617\">C.A.\u2019s mother, herself a ward of the court, was 19 years old with a juvenile record and a history of drug abuse. She had no regular residence and lived on the street. She had given birth to another child, Jonathon, by a different father, and that child also had been adjudged a ward of the court and placed in foster care. C.A.\u2019s mother had not seen or visited Jonathon for over a year. C.A.\u2019s father, an American Indian, was also 19 years old. He, too, had a drug problem. The two youths were not married and did not have a stable relationship.</p> <p id=\"b618-4\" pgmap=\"618\">The juvenile court found, by order of March 21, 1991, that the minor\u2019s parents were unwilling and unable to care for her and that it was in C.A.\u2019s best interests to be made a ward of the court with Gary T. Morgan acting as her guardian.</p> <p id=\"b618-5\" pgmap=\"618\">On July 10, 1991, the DCFS filed a supplemental petition for instructions, alleging that C.A.\u2019s medical condition had deteriorated and that the hospital in which she was being treated had requested and received from C.A.\u2019s parents permission to place a DNR order in her medical charts. Although the DCFS concurred with the hospital\u2019s request, the agency sought the court\u2019s instruction as to its authority to consent to the DNR order in accordance with the wishes of the biological parents and doctors.</p> <p id=\"b618-6\" pgmap=\"618\">On July 11, a hearing on this petition began. Dr. Rebecca Simmons, C.A.\u2019s attending physician, testified as to her credentials and the court found her qualified in the fields of pediatrics and neonatalogy. Dr. Simmons testified that the baby\u2019s diagnosis was \u201cHIV, status post-necrotizing, and prematurity.\u201d \u201cNecrotizing\u201d is an infection of the bowel that results in the death of tissue and requires removal of part of the bowel. In her opinion, C.A.\u2019s prognosis was \u201cterminal,\u201d meaning that her death would most likely result within the next year, based on statistics.</p> <p id=\"b618-7\" pgmap=\"618\">C.A. was being given two drugs \u201cfor her AIDS\u201d and she had been given a \u201ccentral line for intravenous feeding.\u201d She had a tracheostomy. The doctor testified that the appropriate treatment for C.A. at the time was to \u201ccontinue her HIV medications; to continue her central line feedings, intravenous feeding, and to continue to carry her tracheostomy.\u201d Dr. Simmons testified that in her professional opinion, it would not be in C.A.\u2019s best interest for doctors to attempt resuscitation if her heart stopped beating or she ceased breathing. The witness testified that it would be in the infant\u2019s best interests, however, to continue the medication for HIV and to keep the central line and tracheostomy in place.</p> <p id=\"b618-8\" pgmap=\"618\">Dr. Simmons testified that the baby was fully conscious and aware of her surroundings. She interacted with others socially, but not \u201cnormally.\u201d At eight months, she was \u201cvery developmental^ delayed,\u201d functioning neurologically like a four-month-old child. C.A.\u2019s HIV would severely impair her in the future. Asked if death was \u201cimminent,\u201d Dr. Simmons stated that it \u201ccould be imminent. It could be very unexpected.\u201d The infant had already suffered a cessation of breathing and heart functioning in the past and she was, in the witness\u2019 opinion \u201cat high risk for sudden death.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b619-4\" pgmap=\"619\">The hospital had resuscitated C.A. by using CPU and had inserted a catheter into her heart. Dr. Simmons said that the child was uncomfortable and cried a lot. She was incapable of eating by herself at the time of the hearing and her condition had worsened because of the tracheostomy. C.A. had been feeding normally until the necrotizing bowel problem. Since then she had had two surgeries. At the time of the hearing, she was able to defecate normally.</p> <p id=\"b619-5\" pgmap=\"619\">Dr. Simmons gave her opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that C.A. would not improve to have a normal life. She also stated that C.A. was under sedation for her comfort and it would be in her best interest not to resuscitate her if her heart or breathing stopped. It would be in her best interest to stop her suffering. She was in complete agreement with the parents\u2019 wishes, as memorialized in their letter.</p> <p id=\"b619-6\" pgmap=\"619\">Further questioning involved C.A.\u2019s HIV infection. Dr. Simmons said that the doctors believed that the HIV contributed to the necrotizing of the bowel. C.A. could not eat properly at the time and continued to vomit up her food.</p> <p id=\"b619-7\" pgmap=\"619\">The hearing was continued to September 13 so that a second physician\u2019s opinion could be obtained.</p> <p id=\"b619-8\" pgmap=\"619\">Elizabeth Gath, an attending physician in the departments of internal medicine and pediatrics at Cook County Hospital, testified that she is associate director of the Women and Children With AIDS program. She is licensed to practice medicine in three States. The court found her qualified as an expert witness.</p> <p id=\"b619-9\" pgmap=\"619\">Dr. Gath reviewed C.A.\u2019s medical records and charts but did not examine the infant herself. At the time of Dr. Gath\u2019s testimony, C.A. was 11 months old. After stating the diagnoses of the child, Dr. Gath was asked about the \u201cprofoundly compromised\u201d state of C.A.\u2019s immune system, due to the large amount of the virus in her blood. Dr. Gath explained that the virus ultimately causes the syndrome known as acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the measures used to test the immune system is a count of the T-cells, a subset of a type of white blood cell known as a lymphocyte. The T-4 helper cells are the ones injured by the virus. Normal children have a T-4 cell count of about 3,000. C.A.\u2019s count was only 300. This places her at risk for multiple infections and complications. At the time of the hearing, C.A. was being treated with AZT, which does not cure HIV but prolongs life. She was also being given a medication to help fight a type of pneumonia that children with HIV are particularly susceptible to getting.</p> <p id=\"b620-4\" pgmap=\"620\">Dr. Gath testified that she was aware of two incidents of resuscitation that were necessary, one at C.A.\u2019s birth and one on March 1 of 1991. The first episode was a result of the premature birth and the second was a spontaneous cessation of breathing, which is not uncommon in premature infants. The doctor was in agreement with the treatments and medications being administered. She said it was significant that C.A. was diagnosed as HIV-infected prior to her first birthday because it indicates the more severe form of illness. Statistically, a child who exhibits this condition will be dead by her third or fourth birthday.</p> <p id=\"b620-5\" pgmap=\"620\">Dr. Gath was asked whether she was in agreement with the potential placement of a DNR order in C.A.\u2019s charts. She said that the parents\u2019 written wishes seemed an appropriate indication of parental concern. She also said she was concerned that \u201cwe may be doing the right thing, do not resuscitate, perhaps for the wrong reason,\u201d although she did not explain that remark. The witness did note that the child had multiple problems but that they seemed to be \u201cquiescent\u201d at the moment. In other words, C.A. was feeding and was not infected with anything at the time. The problems C.A. had, however, were \u201clongstanding and ongoing. She\u2019s suffered two interventricular hemorrhages. She is neurodevelopmentally delayed, either because of the hemorrhages or because of the hypoxia as a result of the two resuscitative efforts.\u201d \u201cHypoxia\u201d is low oxygen in the brain which would cause brain damage. In response to a later question from the court asking whether the hypoxia was caused by the resuscitation, the witness answered in the negative and explained that breathing problems and the resulting loss of oxygen in the brain could have been caused by C.A.\u2019s prematurity.</p> <p id=\"b620-6\" pgmap=\"620\">Dr. Gath further testified that C.A. was stabilized at the time but that she would require a resuscitation in the future and at that point \u201cit would seem prudent if the family and the attending physician at that time feels that this child could not be resuscitated from it, that it would seem prudent not [sic] to have a resuscitative order.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b620-7\" pgmap=\"620\">\u201cDo not resuscitate\u201d means do not give cardiac compression or intubation. \u201cIntubation\u201d means placing a tube directly into the lungs and having a machine breathe for the child. Other \u201caggressive measures\u201d that could be used to revive someone include vasopressors, which are medicines that would keep blood pressure elevated if the blood pressure dropped precipitously.</p> <p id=\"b620-8\" pgmap=\"620(23) 621(83)\">C.A. continued to be fed through a tube and could not swallow properly. She continued to vomit. There was no current evidence of necrotizing of the bowel. Her T-cell count would not have been raised from the HIV medications. The virus suppresses the T-4 helper cells and gets \u201cinto all systems of the body, including the bone marrow, which can then cause suppression of all cell lines, platelets, white cells, red cells. It can cause profound anemia. It can cause profound bleeding disorders. It can cause susceptibility to multiple types of infections, infections that persons with a normal immune response would not be susceptible to.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">Dr. Gath was aware of approximately 3,000 children in the nation whose diagnosis of AIDS-defining illnesses were reported since 1982. Of those, a significant number were found to be HIV-infected by their first or second birthday, and of that group, 80% died by their third birthday.</p> <p id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621\">Dr. Gath testified that C.A. was not in a comatose or vegetative state and, although she had a terminal illness, her death was not necessarily \u201cimminent\u201d in the sense of happening within a matter of days or weeks, at least as far as could be determined from the medical records. According to a letter from a physician regarding the infant\u2019s neurological deficits, C.A. was neurodevelopmentally two months old when she was chronologically 11 months old. Finally, Dr. Gath testified that the child was suffering because of the tube down her esophagus and the vomiting.</p> <p id=\"b621-7\" pgmap=\"621(220) 622(13)\">The final witness was Randi Gurian, a social worker with the DCFS, assigned to the neonatal intensive care unit at Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital. She had been involved in the case since the birth of C.A. and knew both parents, especially the mother. Gurian testified that she typed the letter that the parents dictated to her following counseling as to C.A.\u2019s condition and prognosis. At the time the letter was written, March 21, 1991, the baby had been critically ill for approximately three weeks. The parents came to her office asking to talk to Gurian about what would happen to their daughter. They continuously stated that they wanted everything done for her and hoped she would recover. The parents asked if the doctors thought C.A. would eventually die of AIDS. The mother said she did not want C.A. to suffer and that everything should be done to increase the baby\u2019s comfort. The father agreed that there should be no extraordinary measures to resuscitate C.A. and that it had taken the baby\u2019s mother a longer time to reach that conclusion. Gurian testified that she then contacted the primary nurse and attending physicians and after reviewing the situation the doctors asked if the parents wanted a DNR order in the event the child\u2019s heart or breathing stopped. The parents asked Gurian to help them write the letter, which they dictated and signed.</p> <p id=\"b622-3\" pgmap=\"622\">Afterwards, Gurian saw the mother on several occasions but not the father. Neither parent had communicated any desire to withdraw their letter requesting the DNR order. The mother reiterated that she wanted her daughter to live but that if her heart stopped, she did not want anyone to pound on her and did not want any more machines.</p> <p id=\"b622-4\" pgmap=\"622\">At the time of the hearing, C.A. was in a specialized foster home.</p> <p id=\"b622-5\" pgmap=\"622\">During closing remarks, the attorney for the DCFS emphasized that he was \u201cnot asking the Court today to issue an order to do not resuscitate on this minor. What the department is asking is that it is in the best \u2014 that this Court find that it is in the best interests of the minor and that the department will do no harm if we give our authorization to the treating physician to issue a do not resuscitate order. This will be at such time as the treating physician feels that it is necessary and proper.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b622-6\" pgmap=\"622\">The GAL stated in response that he relied primarily on the Illinois Supreme Court cases of In re Estate of Longeway (1989), 133 Ill. 2d 33, 549 N.E.2d 292, and In re Estate of Greenspan (1990), 137 Ill. 2d 1, 558 N.E.2d 1194. According to the GAL, \u201cunder those cases *** the DCFS request is premature in this case.\u201d The GAL argued that C.A. was not in a coma or vegetative state, her death was not imminent, and she was not terminally ill. Also, under the \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d test set out in the supreme court cases, C.A. could not have expressed any preference as to the termination of medical treatment because she is a minor.</p> <p id=\"b622-7\" pgmap=\"622\">The court took the matter under advisement and issued its ruling on September 16, 1991. On that date the court found that after reviewing all of the evidence and cases, it was in the \u201cbest interest of the minor for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to act in accordance with the recommendations of the treating physician at the [hospital] and it is so ordered.\u201d At the request of the GAL, the court stayed the order and we have also granted a stay pending appeal.</p> <p id=\"b622-8\" pgmap=\"622\">Opinion</p> <p id=\"b622-9\" pgmap=\"622\">I</p> <p id=\"b622-10\" pgmap=\"622(22) 623(136)\">During oral argument on appeal the GAL focused on the sufficiency of the evidence and the applicability of the Surrogate Health Care Act to this case. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 1 et seq. (eff. Sept. 26, 1991).) The GAL stopped short of expressly conceding the first two issues he raised in his brief, which concern the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction and the court-appointed guardian\u2019s authority to seek approval of a DNR order for the ward; however, the GAL admitted that the juvenile court could approve such an order under certain circumstances. Apparently, the GAL\u2019s chief concern was that by permitting the guardian to consent to a DNR order in this case, the juvenile court failed to apply appropriate standards that would safeguard children in C.A.\u2019s position. The GAL also charged that there was a \u201ctotal failure of evidence\u201d to support the need for the DNR order itself.</p> <p id=\"b623-5\" pgmap=\"623\">In contrast, the DCFS argued that the case does not involve the sufficiency of the evidence, which was uncontested, but instead involves the propriety of the court\u2019s grant of authority to the guardian to consent to the entry of a DNR order at such time as the treating physicians believe it is a necessary and proper order, given the medical condition of the child. The DCFS also asserted that the new Surrogate Health Care Act does not apply, but even if it did, its aims were fulfilled in this case.</p> <p id=\"b623-6\" pgmap=\"623\">In defining the circumstances under which life-sustaining medical treatments may be withheld from a patient, the courts assume a difficult role. New other intersections between the law and medicine involve issues that so strongly implicate moral, religious, or philosophical beliefs. This court must carefully review legal precedent, to the extent it exists, and determine whether the trial court in this case exceeded its authority, abused its discretion, or otherwise entered an improper order. If not, we must affirm.</p> <p id=\"b623-7\" pgmap=\"623\">There is little doubt that if this case involved an otherwise healthy ward of the court who needed a blood transfusion or organ transplant, the guardian would have consented, the court would have approved, and no one would have appealed from the determination. If, however, that same child were the offspring of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, who objected to the child\u2019s receiving blood transfusions, a more difficult case would be presented. (See People ex rel. Wallace v. Labrenz (1952), 411 Ill. 618, 104 N.E.2d 769 (Despite parents\u2019 religious objections, infant would receive blood transfusions to save her life).) If the child were 17 years old instead of an infant, and firmly expressed the desire to follow her religious beliefs to the exclusion of the life-saving operation, the outcome under Illinois law would be to respect the mature minor\u2019s decision. In re E.G. (1989), 133 Ill. 2d 98, 549 N.E.2d 322.</p> <p id=\"b624-4\" pgmap=\"624\">The first example involves a consensus of opinion that organ transplants to save lives are necessary and desirable. The second and third examples illustrate what happens when a minority religious viewpoint clashes with societal norms and the medical establishment. The ultimate issue, then, is who is in the best position to decide (and who gets to decide who will decide). See also Curran v. Bosze (1990), 141 Ill. 2d 473, 566 N.E.2d 1319 (In light of mother\u2019s opposition, court would not find it in the best interests of 3V2-year-old twins to undergo bone marrow harvesting to possibly save life of their half-brother).</p> <p id=\"b624-5\" pgmap=\"624\">A</p> <p id=\"b624-6\" pgmap=\"624\">THE COMMON LAW BASIS FOR DISCONTINUANCE OF LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT</p> <p id=\"b624-7\" pgmap=\"624\">Traditionally, the law has preserved a patient\u2019s right to self-determination, even when he decides against life-sustaining medical treatment. (See In re Estate of Longeway (1989), 133 Ill. 2d 33, 44, 549 N.E.2d 292, 297 (Common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment \u2014 which is rooted in \u201csacred\u201d right to \u201cpersonal inviolability\u201d \u2014 provides the legal authority for a patient to refuse treatment, including artificial nutrition and hydration); see also Corlett v. Caserta (1990), 204 Ill. App. 3d 403, 412, 562 N.E.2d 257 (Patient\u2019s fundamental right to consent to medical treatment is found in the Federal Constitution and Illinois\u2019 common law).) When the patient is not competent, or his desires are not ascertainable, other factors must be considered before life-sustaining treatments are discontinued. (See, e.g., In re Estate of Greenspan (1990), 137 Ill. 2d 1, 558 N.E.2d 1194 (The guardian of an incompetent has the duty to act in the ward\u2019s bests interests, but if the patient\u2019s previously expressed desire as to medical treatment conflicts with the guardian\u2019s determination of the ward\u2019s best interests, court will apply the \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d test, which requires clear and convincing evidence of the patient\u2019s intent); see also Guidelines For State Court Decision Making In Authorizing Or Withholding Life Sustaining Medical Treatment (1991) (printed by West Publishing Company on behalf of the National Center For State Courts (LSMT guidelines)).) Before we reach specific guidelines that legislatures and courts have fashioned to handle such situations, we address the juvenile court\u2019s statutory jurisdiction to enter orders affecting a ward\u2019s medical treatment, including the entry of a DNR order.</p> <p id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">B</p> <p id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">THE JUVENILE COURT GUARDIAN\u2019S AUTHORITY TO CONSENT TO DNR ORDER</p> <p id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">What is the primary issue in this case? What are the standards for deciding when a DNR order may be placed on a ward\u2019s charts when the ward\u2019s interests are represented by a court-appointed guardian under the Juvenile Court Act? To answer these questions we look first to the court\u2019s power under that act.</p> <p id=\"b625-7\" pgmap=\"625\"> Section 2 \u2014 11 permits the court during temporary custody to approve \u201cmedical, dental, or surgical procedures if such procedures are necessary to safeguard the minor\u2019s life or health.\u201d Section 2\u2014 27(1)(d), which applies to the legally appointed custodian\u2019s or guardian\u2019s power after appointment, allows him to consent to \u201cmajor medical and surgical treatment.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, pars. 802 \u2014 11, 802 \u2014 27(101)(d).) In our view, these provisions support the guardian\u2019s general standing to petition the court for authority to consent to a medical judgment made by the ward\u2019s treating physicians, even when that judgment is to discontinue life-sustaining medical treatment. The court is charged with ruling on all matters presented to it regarding the welfare of the child. Moreover, the Juvenile Court Act provides for court review of matters affecting the ward on a regular basis. For example, the guardian is required, periodically, to file reports in the court to ensure that case plans involving the wards are being implemented. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 802 \u2014 28(2).</p> <p id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625(191) 626(94)\">In Illinois, no court of review has addressed whether the Juvenile Court Act provides judges with authority to consent to the placement of a DNR order on a minor ward\u2019s medical chart. Other jurisdictions have accepted the authority of a juvenile court to approve such an order, however. In Custody of A Minor (1982), 385 Mass. 697, 434 N.E.2d 601, the child was suffering from a terminal cardiac condition with no known cure and was on a respirator. The hospital sought entry of a DNR order and the Massachusetts trial court found that it would be in the child\u2019s best interest not to be resuscitated if he went into cardiac or respiratory arrest. On appeal, the supreme judicial court affirmed, holding that once a child in need of care and protection is committed to the Department of Social Services, the juvenile court has authority to make medical care decisions, including the one in question.

We believe that the court acted properly in hearing the petition and in concluding that C.A.\u2019s guardian could consent to the placement of a DNR order on her charts under certain conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">II</p> <p id=\"b626-7\" pgmap=\"626\">The more difficult issue is whether the court exercised its power properly, given the evidence presented. The GAL focuses his arguments on this aspect of the case, urging us to reverse the order as being entered without legal standards or sufficient evidence. He argues that the Illinois Supreme Court in Longeway and Greenspan set forth governing standards that were not met in this case. Specifically, he asserts that those cases require clear and convincing evidence that a patient\u2019s death be \u201cimminent,\u201d which he argues was not established here. He further contends that the juvenile court in this case improperly used the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard in granting consent rather than the \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d test of Longeway and Greenspan.</p> <p id=\"b626-8\" pgmap=\"626\">WHICH STANDARD APPLIES IN CASES OF MINOR WARDS?</p> <p id=\"b626-9\" pgmap=\"626(18) 627(87)\">Both Longeway and Greenspan involved adult patients whose decision-making capacity was nonexistent at the time their guardians sought the cessation of life-sustaining medical treatments. Both, however, had clearly expressed their desire (while still competent) that they not be kept alive artificially or allowed to linger. Both patients were in their seventies and would not recover from their disabilities, but were being kept alive by artificial nutrition and hydration. Neither had executed a living will (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 1101/2, par. 701 et seq.) or a health care power of attorney (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 1101/2, par. 804 \u2014 1 et seq.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b627-5\" pgmap=\"627\">In Longeway the court borrowed the definition of \u201cterminal illness\u201d from the Illinois Living Will Act and held that a terminal condition is one in which (1) death is imminent and (2) death-delaying procedures serve only to prolong the dying process. (Longeway, 133 Ill. 2d at 47.) In such a case, the withdrawal of feeding and hydration tubes would be permitted. In Greenspan, the court commented that the \u201cimminence\u201d of a patient\u2019s death \u201cmust be judged as if the death-delaying procedures were absent.\u201d (Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 21.) Under that reasoning, the court held that Mr. Greenspan\u2019s death would occur within a week after withdrawal of the feeding tube and was thus \u201cimminent,\u201d or near at hand. Finally, to safeguard the patient pending any legislative modification of the common law, Greenspan held that a surrogate decision maker can exercise the patient\u2019s right to forego artificial hydration and nutrition only if, in addition to the terminal illness of the patient, \u201cthe incompetent has been diagnosed as irreversibly comatose or in a persistently vegetative state\u201d; the incompetent\u2019s treating doctor and two other consulting doctors have concurred in the diagnosis; \u201cthe incompetent\u2019s right outweighs any interest of the State, as it normally does\u201d; it is ascertained what the incompetent presumably would have decided if competent under the circumstances; and \u201ca court enters an order allowing the surrogate to exercise the incompetent\u2019s right to refuse the treatment.\u201d Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 16, 558 N.E.2d at 1201.</p> <p id=\"b627-6\" pgmap=\"627(53) 628(43)\">The GAL, in the pending case, argues that C.A.\u2019s condition was not terminal under the Greenspan definition and that she was not in a coma or persistent vegetative state. He further argues that since Longeway and Greenspan require clear and convincing evidence that the patient would want the treatment discontinued, under the substituted judgment test, the trial court in this case lacked the power to apply the best interests standard. Without elaboration, the GAL states that it \u201cis clear\u201d that a best interests standard \u201cis not susceptible of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b628-5\" pgmap=\"628\"> We reject the argument that the trial court was bound to apply the substituted judgment test when almost by definition an infant has no articulable judgment to be substituted. Because wards of the court are not in the care of their biological parents, representatives of the State step in to act in parens patriae. Section 2 \u2014 22 of the Act expressly requires the trial court to adhere to the \u201cbest interests of the minor and the public\u201d in dispositional hearings concerning wardship. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 802 \u2014 22.) In practice, the determination of whether a proposed course of action is actually in the child\u2019s best interests may be subject to differing opinions. See People ex rel. Wallace v. Labrenz (1952), 411 Ill. 618, 104 N.E.2d 769 (right of child to life-sustaining transfusions prevails over religious views of parents); In re Quinlan (N.J. 1976), 70 N.J. 10, 355 A.2d 647 (After much anguish, and with support of church, patient\u2019s father sought to be appointed guardian for comatose daughter for withdrawal of artificial respirator (but not feeding tubes)); Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health (1990), 497 U.S. 261, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224, 110 S. Ct. 2841 (Patient\u2019s parents sought withdrawal of comatose daughter\u2019s feeding tubes because of their belief she would want discontinuance of life-support); see also Barber v. Superior Court (1983), 147 Cal. App. 3d 1006, 1018-19, 195 Cal. Rptr. 484, 491 (In dismissing murder prosecution against doctors who discontinued a patient\u2019s life-support system at family\u2019s request, court suggested that patient\u2019s best interests be determined by balancing the burdens generated by a medical intervention against its benefits).</p> <p id=\"b628-6\" pgmap=\"628\">As the Greenspan court noted, although a public guardian must act in the best interests of a ward, such standard cannot prevent him from seeking termination of artificial feeding systems in accordance with his ward\u2019s clearly expressed desires. In other words, the substituted judgment test is to be applied in the case of once-competent adult patients whose desire can be determined; it honors the patient\u2019s right to choose, not someone else\u2019s decision that it would be in the best interests of the patient to continue to receive life-sustaining treatments. The patient\u2019s right to control his treatment prevails over contrary opinions of surrogates and caregivers.</p> <p id=\"b628-7\" pgmap=\"628(36) 629(111)\">The substituted judgment test, however, is of limited relevance in the case of immature minors. If anyone\u2019s judgment is being substituted it is that of the parents or some other person with a close interest in the child\u2019s welfare. (See In re L.H.R. (Ga. App. 1984), 253 Ga. 439, 321 N.E.2d 716 (recognizing that substituted judgment test is inapplicable to cases involving infants); cf. In re Guardianship of Barry (Fla. App. 1984), 445 So. 2d 365 (using substituted judgment of parents and doctors and requiring clear and convincing evidence of terminally ill infant\u2019s medical condition before authorizing removal of life-support system).) The Health Care Surrogate Act expressly recognizes that the best interests standard, rather than substituted judgment, applies in the case of incompetents, including minors, whose consent or desire cannot be discerned. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851-20(b)(1).</p> <p id=\"b629-5\" pgmap=\"629\">Without a doubt, if C.A.\u2019s parents were themselves competent adults whose baby was not a ward of the court, and they agreed with or consented to the doctors\u2019 recommendation of a DNR order, that decision would have remained in the private domain and the court would not have become involved. As primary caregivers, parents or other close family members ordinarily are the ones charged with making the difficult determination of what is in a terminally ill child\u2019s best interests. The legislature recognized this in providing statutory authorization for private decision making under the Health Care Surrogate Act. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 5(a) (\u201cUncertainty and lack of clarity in the law concerning the making of private decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment, without judicial involvement, causes unnecessary emotional distress to the individuals involved and unduly impedes upon the individual right to forgo life-sustaining treatment\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b629-6\" pgmap=\"629(178) 630(103)\">We conclude that the court properly used the best interests of the child standard in ruling that the guardian had authority to consent to the entry of the DNR at such time as the treating doctors agreed it was medically appropriate. The GAL\u2019s reliance on Longeway and Greenspan to strike down the court\u2019s order in this case avoids the specific factual context before us and the precise issues posed. The supreme court in both cases confirmed that incompetent patients have a common law right to refuse life-sustaining treatment through a surrogate. In both cases, the surrogates were close family members acting as guardians and attempting to effectuate the will of the patient, as expressed by his or her prior statements. Both involved removal of existing and continuous treatments that kept the comatose patients artificially alive. In the pending case, however, the surrogate is a court-appointed guardian of a minor ward who cannot express a judgment on the issue of her resuscitation. C.A.\u2019s guardian does not seek the discontinuance of nutrition or medication, but instead requests permission to act in accordance with the parents\u2019 and doctors\u2019 decision that, given C.A.\u2019s terminal and incurable condition, not to mention discomfort, no measures to restart her heart or breathing should be undertaken if her cardiac and respiratory systems fail on their own. Like the elderly patients in Greenspan and Longeway, however, C.A. has no true awareness of her condition, and her age and impaired neurological development mean she will remain unable to appreciate her situation. We conclude that the best interests of the child standard, rather than substituted judgment, is the proper way to evaluate C.A.\u2019s condition.</p> <p id=\"b630-5\" pgmap=\"630\">THE EVIDENCE OF C.A.\u2019S MEDICAL CONDITION</p> <p id=\"b630-6\" pgmap=\"630\">The medical evidence in this case was not disputed. The baby suffered from severe and incurable conditions, including the HIV infection and major neurological impairment. She needed intravenous feedings and had undergone two surgeries to her bowels. Other medical interventions to prolong her life included a tracheostomy, or tube in her throat, and a catheter in her heart. C.A.\u2019s pain may not be quantifiable, but Dr. Gath testified that she was suffering, vomiting up her food, and crying a lot. The GAL does not dispute these facts, and while he makes an argument denying the \u201cimminence\u201d of C.A.\u2019s death and the \u201cterminal\u201d nature of her condition, ultimately the GAL\u2019s position rests on the contention that no level of evidence can sustain the entry of a DNR order on an infant\u2019s medical charts because it is impossible to ascertain the infant\u2019s wishes. Under the substituted judgment tests of Greenspan and Longeway, therefore, the GAL argues that the trial court\u2019s order in this case must be found to be unsupportable by any evidence.</p> <p id=\"b630-7\" pgmap=\"630\">We reject this reasoning. If the argument is correct, the juvenile court judge in this case would have had to abandon C.A., in a sense, and simply dismiss the petition. That would leave C.A. in a worse position than a baby whose parents decide, with the doctors, that a particular course of treatment is better than another.</p> <p id=\"b630-8\" pgmap=\"630(103) 631(90)\">Whenever a court having jurisdiction over a justiciable controversy is faced with a novel legal issue or case of first impression, that court must exercise its judgment in accordance with traditional jurisprudence. Here, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which several witnesses testified. The GAL was given a full and fair opportunity to present all matters he deemed were significant on the issues. We do not agree with his assumption that unless the facts of the pending case fit exactly within Greenspan or Longeway, we must vacate the trial court\u2019s order. Here, the treating physician gave her opinion that it was in the best interests of C.A. to have the DNR order available; a second physician agreed that it was \u201cprudent\u201d; the infant\u2019s parents expressed their wishes in writing to the same effect; and the social worker on the case corroborated the parents\u2019 decision that the child should not suffer and that given her prognosis it was in her interests not to be revived. We believe that the medical evidence and opinion as to her prognosis can fairly be viewed as clear and convincing.</p> <p id=\"b631-5\" pgmap=\"631\">The GAL did not, in fact, offer contrary evidence. Instead, the GAL challenges the legal conclusion that C.A.\u2019s condition was terminal, her death imminent.</p> <p id=\"b631-6\" pgmap=\"631\">As to the terminal nature of her illness, both Doctors Simmons and Gath agreed that the child was in fact under a death sentence because of her HIV infection and profoundly compromised immune system. The GAL nevertheless argues that the evidence on this point was inadequate because the witnesses based their diagnosis on statistical analysis of other cases involving HIV-positive children, 80% of whom died by their third or fourth birthday. The GAL also uses the fact that such children may live beyond their fourth birthday as support for his contention that C.A.\u2019s death is not imminent at this time.</p> <p id=\"b631-7\" pgmap=\"631\"> We wish to avoid overly technical constructions of \u201cterminal\u201d and \u201cimminent\u201d because those terms must be considered in particular factual contexts. At the time the DNR order was initially sought in the pending case, C.A. was critically ill. Her condition at that time could well have been viewed as one in which death was imminent and resuscitative procedures would serve only to prolong the dying process. More to the point, the guardian was not seeking the immediate entry of a DNR order on C.A.\u2019s charts at the time of the court\u2019s ruling. Rather, he sought a finding that he was the proper surrogate to consult with the treating physicians at such time as they believed the DNR order was necessary and proper.</p> <p id=\"b631-8\" pgmap=\"631(128) 632(28)\">During oral argument before this court the guardian stated that DNR orders are constantly reviewed by medical personnel and are not necessarily permanent. Therefore, to grant the guardian authority to consent to a DNR order in the future, the trial court was not required to hold that C.A.\u2019s death was imminent at the time the court ruled on the petition. The evidence did establish, however, that an infant who is HIV-infected from birth is expected to die from the complications of AIDS within a few years. Certainly, such a condition may be viewed as incurable and fatal, and, in the ordinary sense, terminal. The evidence at the hearing, in our opinion, established the gravity of C.A.\u2019s condition and her nonexistent prognosis for even a semblance of normal childhood. Confined to bed, her painfully foreshortened life is attended by tubes, machines, catheters, and specialized care facilities\u2014 not playmates, toys, or trips to the zoo.</p> <p id=\"b632-5\" pgmap=\"632\">The witnesses who testified at trial all agreed that the DNR order was the proper course at such time as the child\u2019s condition destabilized in the future and the medical decision would be made that resuscitative measures would not be beneficial. At that time, presumably her death would be considered \u201cimminent\u201d under the Greenspan definition, \u201cjudged as if the death-delaying procedures were absent.\u201d (Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 21.) Dr. Gath was the only witness expressing some ambivalence, in answering questions regarding the terminal nature of the disease, saying \u201cwe all have terminal illnesses known as life, itself.\u201d She agreed, however, that the child was suffering, had serious and ongoing disabilities, and that in the future, when C.A. needs a resuscitation, a DNR would be \u201cprudent.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b632-6\" pgmap=\"632\">Finally, then, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting to C.A.\u2019s guardian the authority to consent to the entry of a DNR order in her medical charts in accordance with the treating doctor\u2019s recommendations, which, in turn, were based on her medical condition and prognosis. We read the court\u2019s order as affirming the guardian\u2019s authority to act as C.A.\u2019s surrogate, to implement a decision that C.A.\u2019s guardian, her doctors, and her parents concurred in as being in the child\u2019s best interests. In our view, the medical evidence presented was sufficient to enable the court to determine that a DNR order should be available for this patient. The court neither abdicated its responsibilities nor exceeded its authority.</p> <p id=\"b632-7\" pgmap=\"632(183) 633(30)\">We stress that we are not attempting to resolve, for all cases, when and in what circumstances a guardian appointed under the Juvenile Court Act may seek (or not seek) judicial intervention before consenting to placement of a DNR order on a ward\u2019s medical charts. Some of the evidence in this case indicates that C.A.\u2019s prematurity was the likely reason she stopped breathing at birth and on the subsequent occasion. We certainly do not imply that premature infants should not be resuscitated or otherwise treated, simply because of their prematurity. We live in an age when medical technology can save premature babies who, a decade or two earlier, would almost certainly have died at birth. C.A., tragically, suffers from a devastating, deadly condition that current medical technology cannot cure. We are limiting our opinion to its facts, with the caveat that in cases like this one \u2014 where the patient\u2019s wishes are not available and the court is involved \u2014 someone has to decide. Although it may be argued that when the patient\u2019s desires cannot be determined, life-sustaining medical treatments should be instituted or maintained, we are of the belief that such an outcome is as much a decision, by default, as any other. See LSMT guidelines, at 66.</p> <p id=\"b633-5\" pgmap=\"633\">Ill</p> <p id=\"b633-6\" pgmap=\"633\"> We have alluded throughout this opinion to the Health Care Surrogate Act (Act), which became effective on September 26, 1991, days after the entry of the order in this case. The GAL requests us to not only find that it applies to this case and was not fulfilled, but also to declare the Act unconstitutional for lacking due process and equal protection safeguards. We decline to reach constitutional issues that are not necessary to our ruling nor squarely before us, however. Therefore, our brief discussion of the new Act is limited to acknowledging that the legislature has stepped into this area and enacted a statutory framework to guide interested parties in the future. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 5(a) (\u201cThe legislature recognizes that all persons have a fundamental right to make decisions relating to their own medical treatment \u2022**** [and lack] of decisional capacity, alone, should not prevent decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment from being made on behalf of persons who lack decisional capacity</p> <p id=\"b633-7\" pgmap=\"633\"> The Health Care Surrogate Act allows an individual chosen from among a statutory order of persons (including the patient\u2019s guardian, family members, or close friends) to decide, subject to certain conditions, whether to initiate or continue life-sustaining medical treatments when the patient cannot speak for himself. The Act adopts the substituted judgment test to be used when the patient had expressed views on the subject before becoming incompetent. When the patient\u2019s views are not ascertainable, however, the Act provides for application of the best interests of the patient standard. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851-20 (b)(1).</p> <p id=\"b633-8\" pgmap=\"633\">The Act sets forth three qualifying conditions, which trigger the surrogate\u2019s authority to act when one or more of the conditions is certified to exist by the attending physician and at least one other qualified physician. The first condition defines \u201cterminal condition\u201d as meaning \u201can illness or injury for which there is no reasonable prospect of cure or recovery, death is imminent, and the application of life-sustaining treatment would only prolong the dying process.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10.) This is similar to the Greenspan definition.</p> <p id=\"b633-9\" pgmap=\"633(19) 634(47)\">The second alternate condition is the \u201cpermanent unconsciousness\u201d element found in the coma or persistent vegetative state, meaning in essence that the patient is unaware of \u201cself and environment,\u201d incapable of \u201cpurposeful action [or] social interaction\u201d and the initiation or continuation of life-sustaining treatment in light of the medical condition provides \u201conly minor medical benefit.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851-10.</p> <p id=\"b634-5\" pgmap=\"634\">The third alternative qualifying condition is an \u201cincurable or irreversible condition\u201d for which there is not a \u201creasonable prospect of cure or recovery.\u201d It is a condition \u201cthat ultimately will cause the patient\u2019s death\u201d even with the life-sustaining treatment; \u201cimposes severe pain or otherwise imposes an inhumane burden on the patient\u201d; and is a condition for which the continuation of life-sustaining treatment in light of the patient\u2019s medical condition provides only minimum medical benefits. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10.</p> <p id=\"b634-6\" pgmap=\"634\">The GAL challenges the new Act on the grounds that it does not provide for automatic judicial review of all matters affecting life-sustaining medical treatments. At the same time, he argues that the trial court did not follow the requirements of the new Act, which was not then in effect. The juvenile court did conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine what would be in the best interests of the child, however, which presumably would not have been required had the parties proceeded under the Surrogate Health Care Act. We find the GAL\u2019s position unworkable, as it apparently argues for greater restrictions on a surrogate\u2019s ability to consent to the termination of life-sustaining treatments than either the courts or the legislature has found appropriate.</p> <p id=\"b634-7\" pgmap=\"634\">As noted, we will not address the constitutionality of the new Act. Nor do we express an opinion as to how the Act may operate in conjunction with the Juvenile Court Act when the rights of minor wards are affected. We do not think the result in this case is inconsistent, however, with one that could have been reached under the new Act.</p> <p id=\"b634-8\" pgmap=\"634(125) 635(68)\">As a note of caution, we remind parties and lawyers involved in surrogate health care decisions that time is often a major factor. In the pending case, our opinion affirms the guardian\u2019s right to consent to the DNR in the future, in consultation with the attending physicians, without the further involvement of the court. Unfortunately, the proceedings below and the appeals process have already added months of uncertainty to an unfortunate situation. In some cases, because of the emergency nature of these types of decisions, courts may not be able to act fast enough. That is surely one of the concerns the legislature considered in providing for such decisions to be made without judicial intervention whenever possible. When the court is involved, however, it can act only within its traditional role. From the common law right of a patient\u2019s informed consent to statutory rights to create living wills and appoint health care agents, the law has evolved to accommodate conflicting views over how life-and-death medical decisions should be made. The new Act fills a statutory gap involving the incompetent patient\u2019s right to have a surrogate act on his behalf.</p> <p id=\"b635-5\" pgmap=\"635\">Here, the GAL\u2019s arguments were sincere and zealous as he spoke out for the highest standards and levels of proof. We agree that when an adult patient\u2019s desires can be determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that determination prevails. We find invalid, however, the GAL\u2019s underlying assumption that C.A.\u2019s guardian, doctors, and parents lacked the right to decide on C.A.\u2019s behalf whether resuscitative measures should be continued, given her medical condition and prognosis. The courts are not paralyzed when the ultimate decision is who should make such a decision. Here, the court considered the evidence and law and determined that the guardian should, in essence, be given the same right as a parent to concur with the doctors\u2019 medical judgment that a DNR order might become necessary and proper given C.A.\u2019s condition.</p> <p id=\"b635-6\" pgmap=\"635\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p> <p id=\"b635-7\" pgmap=\"635\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b635-8\" pgmap=\"635\">JIGANTI, P.J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b626-10\" pgmap=\"626\"> We recognize that in future cases decided under the Health Care Surrogate Act (Act), the precise issue we decide here involving the juvenile court\u2019s authority to approve DNR orders may be moot. The new Act permits a surrogate to consent to such orders on behalf of incompetent minors. Although the new Act contemplates private decision making under the statutory guidelines therein, our opinion in this case affirms the juvenile court\u2019s general authority, upon the guardian or other interested party\u2019s request, to hear and resolve those issues concerning the ward\u2019s welfare. The new Act preserves existing rights under other laws, moreover, including any right to seek judicial review \u201cunder the common law or statutes of this State to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.\u201d Ill.

Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 850 \u2014 1 et seq.), which became effective shortly after the trial court\u2019s order was entered in the case at bar, the majority nonetheless notes the principles stated in the Act in reaching its conclusions.</p> <p id=\"b636-5\" pgmap=\"636\">I agree that Illinois law allows a court-appointed guardian under the Juvenile Court Act to withhold certain life-saving medical treatment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the care of a minor child under certain circumstances. I also agree that the proper standard is whether the withholding or withdrawal of a life-saving medical treatment would be in the best interests of the child.</p> <p id=\"b636-6\" pgmap=\"636\">However, I am unable to agree with the majority disposition because I find it in direct conflict with the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Longeway and Greenspan. The record in the present case demonstrates without equivocation that C.A. is not \u201cterminally ill,\u201d as her death is not imminent and the administration of a resuscitative efforts would not, on this record, merely \u201cprolong the dying process.\u201d In addition, the infant is not in a permanently comatose or chronically vegetative state. She is mentally alert, interacts socially with others, and is able to breathe without mechanical intervention. Neither of the physicians who testified at the trial court\u2019s hearing could specify when the child is likely to die, and only one doctor, Dr. Simmons, ventured the broad opinion that it would be in the infant\u2019s best interests that a DNR order be placed on the child\u2019s medical charts.</p> <p id=\"b636-7\" pgmap=\"636\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s refusal to apply the provisions of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The trial court retains jurisdiction over the proper medical care to be administered to C.A. as long as she remains a ward of the court. The issues presented in this appeal should therefore be resolved according to the law currently in effect, i.e., the Health Care Surrogate Act. In my opinion, the trial court\u2019s order should be vacated and the parties directed to comply with the provisions of the Health Care Surrogate Act.</p> <p id=\"b636-8\" pgmap=\"636\">This dissent will initially present my disagreement with the majority holding based on the failure of the majority to comply with the requirements enunciated in the Longeway and Greenspan cases, and will then consider the issues in this case under the Health Care Surrogate Act.</p> <p id=\"b637-4\" pgmap=\"637\">I</p> <p id=\"b637-5\" pgmap=\"637\">I am unable to agree with the majority\u2019s reasoning in this case, as it is in direct conflict with the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Longeway (133 Ill. 2d 33, 549 N.E.2d 292) and Greenspan (137 Ill. 2d 1, 558 N.E.2d 1194). In both of those decisions, the Illinois Supreme Court held that a patient has a common law right to refuse medical treatment, including artificial nutrition and hydration, and that where the patient is incompetent, this right may be exercised by a guardian as the patient\u2019s surrogate. (Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 16, citing Longeway, 133 Ill. 2d at 44-46.) The court further held that, \u201cpending any constitutionally permissible modification of the common law by the legislature, a surrogate can exercise the right for an incompetent patient only if\u2019 (emphasis added) (Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 16) the following criteria are satisfied:</p> <blockquote id=\"b637-6\" pgmap=\"637\">\u201c(1) the incompetent is terminally ill ***, i.e., the patient\u2019s condition is incurable and irreversible so that death is imminent and the application of death-delaying procedures serves only to prolong the dying process;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-7\" pgmap=\"637\">(2) the incompetent has been diagnosed as irreversibly comatose or in a persistently vegetative state;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-8\" pgmap=\"637\">(3) the incompetent\u2019s attending physician and at least two other consulting physicians have concurred in the diagnosis;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-9\" pgmap=\"637\">(4) the incompetent\u2019s right outweighs any interests of the State, as it normally does;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-10\" pgmap=\"637\">(5) it is ascertained, by an appropriate means \u2014 e.g., by the procedure of substituted judgment on the basis of clear and convincing evidence *** \u2014what the incompetent presumably would have decided, if competent, in the circumstances; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b637-11\" pgmap=\"637\">(6) a court enters an order allowing the surrogate to exercise the incompetent\u2019s right to refuse the treatment.\u201d Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 16.</blockquote> <p id=\"b637-12\" pgmap=\"637\">Application of these factors to the present case reveals that the majority\u2019s disposition is in contradiction to the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s requirements in Longeway and Greenspan.</p> <p id=\"b637-13\" pgmap=\"637(81) 638(94)\">The first criterion enunciated by the supreme court for a surrogate to refuse to provide life-saving medical treatment is that the patient be terminally ill, i.e., the patient\u2019s condition is incurable and irreversible and his death imminent, such that administration of the life-sustaining medical treatment serves only to prolong the dying process. In the present case, the majority determines that C.A. is \u201cterminally ill\u201d because she suffers from HIV. (See 236 Ill. App. 3d at 611 (wherein the majority states that \u201cboth Doctors Simmons and Gath agreed that the child was in fact under a death sentence because of her HIV infection and profoundly compromised immune system\u201d).) The majority also finds it persuasive that the child was \u201ccritically ill\u201d when \u201cthe DNR order was initially sought in the pending case\u201d and observes that \u201c[h]er condition at that time could well have been viewed as one in which death was imminent and resuscitative procedures would serve only to prolong the dying process.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 236 Ill. App. 3d at 611.</p> <p id=\"b638-5\" pgmap=\"638\">I find the majority\u2019s reasoning disingenuous. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s characterization of C.A.\u2019s condition as terminally ill simply because she was allegedly \u201ccritically ill\u201d when the guardian\u2019s petition was filed. In my view, the supreme court\u2019s decisions in Longeway and Greenspan do not allow for the withholding of a lifesaving medical treatment from every patient who is critically ill. The circumstance that cardiac or respiratory arrest will almost certainly cause the patient to die, if resuscitative efforts are not administered, does not transform a critically ill patient\u2019s medical condition into a \u201cterminal illness.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b638-6\" pgmap=\"638\">In addition, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s characterization of C.A.\u2019s condition as a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d because the child is HIV-infected. The health care professionals in this case testified that, based upon statistics, C.A. is not likely to live beyond her third or fourth birthday. However, at the time of the trial court\u2019s hearing, C.A. was less than a year old; she is now almost two years of age. Consequently, C.A. has at least another year before she will be three years old. Thus, the statistical data to which the physicians referred does not support a conclusion that the infant\u2019s death is \u201cimminent.\u201d In fact, not one of the physicians testified that the infant will likely die within the next few days, weeks, or months.</p> <p id=\"b638-7\" pgmap=\"638\">I would also note that the child\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Simmons, testified that she believed a DNR order should be placed on the baby\u2019s medical charts immediately. However, Dr. Elizabeth Gath testified that a DNR order would be appropriate if \u201cresuscitative efforts would be futile.\u201d There is no medical evidence in the record to suggest that resuscitation would be futile if the child suffers cardiac or respiratory arrest, given the infant\u2019s medical condition at the time of the trial court\u2019s hearing.</p> <p id=\"b638-8\" pgmap=\"638(42) 639(27)\">With respect to the second requirement of Longeway and Greenspan, that the patient be diagnosed as either irreversibly comatose or in a chronic vegetative state, the majority observes, \u201cLike the elderly patients in Greenspan and Longeway, however, C.A. has no true awareness of her condition, and her age and impaired neurological development mean she will remain unable to appreciate her situation.\u201d 236 Ill. App. 3d at 610.</p> <p id=\"b639-5\" pgmap=\"639\">I find no support in the record for the majority\u2019s lame attempt to analogize C.A.\u2019s medical diagnosis to the severely debilitated conditions of the patients in Longeway and Greenspan. The testimony presented to the trial court established without contradiction that C.A. is aware of her surroundings and can and does interact socially with others. It is only in the sense that the child is not able to understand the scope of her medical condition that the infant can be said to be \u201cunaware of her condition\u201d or that the child \u201cwill remain unable to appreciate her situation,\u201d as characterized by the majority. However, there is no evidence in the record that demonstrates or implies that C.A\u2019s medical condition was comparable to the medical conditions in Longeway or Greenspan, where the adult patients were in a permanently comatose or chronically vegetative state with no chance of ever regaining consciousness.</p> <p id=\"b639-6\" pgmap=\"639\">In contrast, the record here shows that C.A. is mentally alert, able to function socially, and can breathe without mechanical intervention. Her only current symptoms are that she cannot eat normally and must be fed with artificial nutrition. More importantly, she suffers no current symptoms from her status as HIV-infected. She was neurodevelopmentally delayed, but the physicians testified that they could not predict the course of her future development, and conceded that she might improve as she matures. The doctors were also unable to testify that the child\u2019s inability to eat without artificial nutrition would continue throughout the remainder of her life, and admitted that this condition, too, might improve as the child ages. In short, C.A.\u2019s condition is not even faintly similar to the patients in Longeway and Greenspan.</p> <p id=\"b639-7\" pgmap=\"639\">The third criterion stated by the supreme court is also lacking in the present appeal, i.e., that the patient\u2019s attending physician, and at least two other consulting doctors, concur in the patient\u2019s diagnosis as terminally ill. In the case before us, only two physicians testified \u2014 Dr. Simmons, the child\u2019s treating physician, and Dr. Gath, a consulting physician. Thus, the record before us does not contain sufficient health care consensus on C.A.\u2019s medical condition. In addition, neither of the physicians testified that C.A. is terminally ill, as that term is defined by the supreme court in Longeway and Greenspan.</p> <p id=\"b639-8\" pgmap=\"639(32) 640(119)\">The fourth factor stated by the supreme court is whether the patient\u2019s right to forgo the life-saving medical treatment outweighs the State\u2019s interests. In this regard, the court specified four countervailing State interests: to preserve life, protect the interests of innocent third parties, prevent suicide, and maintain the ethical integrity of the medical profession. (See Longeway, 133 Ill. 2d at 48.) The Longeway court observed that \u201c[n]ormally, none of these interests will override a patient\u2019s refusal\u201d of the life-saving medical treatment. (133 Ill. 2d at 48.) This analysis assumes that the patient\u2019s medical condition falls within the scope defined by the supreme court, i.e., that the patient is terminally ill and has been diagnosed as either irreversibly comatose or in a persistently vegetative state. Because the child here does not suffer from such a medical condition, considering the State\u2019s countervailing interests in this regard is premature and improper.</p> <p id=\"b640-5\" pgmap=\"640\">The fifth step stated by the supreme court is to determine what the patient, if competent, would have decided under the circumstances, i.e., the substituted judgment test. I have no quarrel with the majority\u2019s determination that the best interests of the child standard should apply to this case, rather than the substituted judgment test. (See Curran v. Bosze (1990), 141 Ill. 2d 473, 566 N.E.2d 1319.) However, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s decision that the DNR order will be in C.A.\u2019s best interests.</p> <p id=\"b640-6\" pgmap=\"640\">As stated previously, the record here demonstrates that C.A. is not terminally ill, since her death is not \u201cimminent\u201d and the withholding of resuscitative efforts would not serve to merely \u201cprolong the dying process.\u201d Moreover, the infant is not in a permanently comatose or chronically vegetative state. Notwithstanding these circumstances, the majority believes that the placement of a DNR order on the child\u2019s medical charts will be appropriate at such time as the treating physicians find it to be appropriate based on her terminal condition. (236 Ill. App. 3d at 612.) Two considerations stated by the majority appear to be particularly significant. The first of these is the circumstance that \u201cDNR orders are constantly reviewed by medical personnel and are not necessarily permanent.\u201d (236 Ill. App. 3d at 611.) The second is the majority\u2019s expressed concern that judicial proceedings are time-consuming and that \u201cbecause of the emergency nature of these types of decisions [with respect to whether resuscitative efforts should be withheld], courts may not be able to act fast enough.\u201d (236 Ill. App. 3d at 614.) These considerations would be significant if C.A. were terminally ill and in a permanently comatose or chronically vegetative condition. But she quite simply is not.</p> <p id=\"b640-7\" pgmap=\"640(44) 641(219)\">I find nothing in the majority\u2019s analysis that specifies the precise circumstances presented in this case that would warrant the majority\u2019s failure to adhere to the precedent set down by the Illinois Supreme Court in Longeway and Greenspan requiring that the patient be terminally ill and either permanently comatose or in a chronically vegetative condition. I would note that the Health Care Surrogate Act creates an additional category of \u201cqualifying conditions\u201d where the patient is suffering from an incurable or irreversible condition. The Act defines this qualifying condition as an \u201cillness or injury (i) for which there is no reasonable prospect of cure or recovery, (ii) that ultimately will cause the patient\u2019s death even if life-sustaining treatment is initiated or continued, (iii) that imposes severe pain or otherwise imposes an inhumane burden on the patient, and (iv) for which initiating or continuing life-sustaining treatment, in light of the patient\u2019s medical condition, provides only minimal medical benefit.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10.) However, the majority refuses to apply the Health Care Surrogate Act to this appeal. And, as noted more fully below with respect to the Health Care Surrogate Act, the additional requirements of the Health Care Surrogate Act regarding certification of the patient\u2019s medical condition by two physicians who have personally examined the patient (see Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, pars. 851 \u2014 10, 851 \u2014 20) have not been satisfied in the case before us. Thus, there is no Illinois precedent that justifies the majority\u2019s disposition in the instant cause.</p> <p id=\"b641-5\" pgmap=\"641\">I am troubled by the majority\u2019s ruling because, in my judgment, it lacks sound precedential value with respect to the legality of withholding life-saving medical treatments, unnecessarily chips away at our supreme court\u2019s pronouncements in Longeway and Greenspan, and also is in contravention to the Health Care Surrogate Act. The majority holds that the guardian should consent to the placement of a DNR order on this child\u2019s medical charts at such time as the treating physicians find it to be appropriate based on her terminal condition. (236 Ill. App. 3d at 612.) But this holding merely begs the essential question in this case: At what point will it be \u201cappropriate,\u201d based on C.A.\u2019s medical condition, to withhold resuscitative efforts? The majority never addresses this issue, and certainly now is not the \u201cappropriate\u201d time based upon the requirements of Longeway, Greenspan, or the Health Care Surrogate Act.</p> <p id=\"b641-6\" pgmap=\"641(80) 642(20)\">I note that the majority\u2019s disposition is also unsupported by the cases from other jurisdictions to which the majority refers. In none of those decisions did the court authorize the entry of a DNR order on the medical chart of an alert, conscious child, whose death was not imminent and whose prospect for future neurological development was unclear. See Custody of A Minor (1982), 385 Mass. 697, 434 N.E.2d 601; In re Guardianship of Hamlin (1984), 102 Wash. 2d 810, 689 P.2d 1372; In re L.H.R. (1984), 253 Ga. 439, 321 S.E.2d 716; see generally Annot., 48 A.L.R.4th 67 (1986).</p> <p id=\"b642-3\" pgmap=\"642\">II</p> <p id=\"b642-4\" pgmap=\"642\">In my opinion, the provisions of the Health Care Surrogate Act are applicable to the issues presented in this appeal. In a proceeding under the Juvenile Court Act for the care of a minor adjudged abused or neglected and placed with the DCFS, the trial court retains on-going jurisdiction over the child so long as the minor remains a ward of the court. (See, e.g., In re Shawn B. (1991), 218 Ill. App. 3d 374, 578 N.E.2d 269.) Consequently, the trial court\u2019s order in the instant cause determines the scope and proper exercise of the guardian\u2019s on-going authority to consent to the withholding of resuscitative efforts in C.A.\u2019s behalf. Although the Health Care Surrogate Act did not become effective until a few days after the trial court\u2019s decision, the question of whether the guardian in this case is currently authorized to consent to the placement of a DNR order on C.A.\u2019s medical charts is properly resolved by the law currently in effect, i.e., the Health Care Surrogate Act. See, e.g., Bates v. Board of Education, Allendale Community Consolidated School District No. 17 (1990), 136 Ill. 2d 260, 555 N.E.2d 1; Rios v. Jones (1976), 63 Ill. 2d 488, 348 N.E.2d 825.</p> <p id=\"b642-5\" pgmap=\"642\">In the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Illinois General Assembly enacted comprehensive guidelines for the circumstances and procedures under which a life-saving medical treatment may lawfully be withheld or withdrawn in the medical care for all persons in this State. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 1 et seq.; see generally Fatum, Kane, and LeBlang, A Review of the Illinois Health Care Surrogate Act, 80 Ill. Bar J. 124 (1992).) The Health Care Surrogate Act recognizes the \u201cfundamental right\u201d of all individuals to forgo a life-sustaining medical treatment under certain circumstances, without regard to the person\u2019s failure or inability to execute a living will or power of attorney for health care, and regardless of whether the person lacks the decisional capacity to choose to forgo a life-sustaining medical treatment. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 5(a).) Its purpose is to establish a process for private decision making, without prior judicial approval, for the withdrawal or withholding of life-saving medical treatment. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 5(b).) Its terms explicitly apply to the rights of a minor to forgo a life-saving medical treatment under the pertinent requirements of the statute. See, e.g., Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 55.</p> <p id=\"b643-4\" pgmap=\"643\">A. POWERS OF JUVENILE COURT ACT GUARDIAN UNDER HEALTH CARE SURROGATE ACT</p> <p id=\"b643-5\" pgmap=\"643\">Based upon the pertinent provisions of the Health Care Surrogate Act, I conclude that a court-appointed guardian under the Juvenile Court Act is granted the power to act as a surrogate decision maker on behalf of the guardian\u2019s minor ward, and to decide whether a lifesaving medical treatment should be withheld or withdrawn in the minor\u2019s medical care.</p> <p id=\"b643-6\" pgmap=\"643\">The Health Care Surrogate Act sets forth a prioritized list of persons who may qualify as surrogate decision maker on behalf of a patient who lacks decisional capacity and suffers from a qualifying condition. (See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 25(a).) With respect to a patient who is an unemancipated minor and has no spouse or children, this listing of priority is: (1) the child\u2019s guardian of the person; (2) either parent of the child; (3) any adult brother or sister of the patient; (4) a close friend of the patient; and (5) the child\u2019s guardian of the estate. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 25(a).</p> <p id=\"b643-7\" pgmap=\"643\">The Act defines a \u201cguardian\u201d as \u201ca court appointed guardian of the person who serves as a representative of a minor or as a representative of a person under legal disability.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10.) Although this definition of \u201cguardian\u201d does not explicitly refer to a court-appointed guardian under the Juvenile Court Act, the inclusion of a court-appointed guardian under the Juvenile Court Act is consistent with the objectives of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The fundamental purpose of the Health Care Surrogate Act is to set forth a comprehensive scheme allowing for private decision making in health care treatments without a prior court determination, in order to preserve the dignity of the patient and to relieve the anguish associated with such decisions. In view of the comprehensive purpose of the statute, I do not believe that our legislature intended to deprive children, who have been adjudged abused or neglected, of the benefits of the Health Care Surrogate Act.</p> <p id=\"b643-8\" pgmap=\"643(104) 644(33)\">Moreover, recognition of such a power in a court-appointed guardian under the Juvenile Court Act is consistent with the broad powers conferred on a guardian for a child who has been adjudged abused or neglected. The Juvenile Court Act defines \u201cguardianship of the person\u201d as \u201cthe duty and authority, subject to residual parental rights and responsibilities, to make important decisions in matters having a permanent effect on the life and development of the minor and to be concerned with his or her general welfare.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 801 \u2014 3(8).) The Act further states that this authority \u201cin-eludes but is not necessarily limited to *** the authority to consent to *** a major medical, psychiatric, and surgical treatment.\" (Emphasis added.) Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 801 \u2014 3(8)(a).</p> <p id=\"b644-5\" pgmap=\"644\">The trial court and the court-appointed guardian properly took into, account the wishes of C.A.\u2019s biological parents. In so doing, the guardian preserved the parent\u2019s residual rights and responsibilities under the Juvenile Court Act (see Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 801 \u2014 3(13)) as well as their right to notice under the Juvenile Court Act. See Ill. Ann. Stat., ch. 37, par. 801 \u2014 5 (Smith-Hurd 1990) (as amended effective July 1, 1992); see also Ill. Rev. Stat. .1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10 (defining \u201cparent\u201d under Health Care Surrogate Act as \u201cperson who is the natural or adoptive mother or father of the child and whose parental rights have not been terminated by a court of law\u201d); Santosky v. Kramer (1982), 455 U.S. 745, 753, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599, 606, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 1394-95 (\u201cfundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.

PROPRIETY OF DNR ORDER UNDER HEALTH CARE SURROGATE ACT</p> <p id=\"AfV\" pgmap=\"644\">Under the Act, the withholding or withdrawal of a life-saving medical treatment may be authorized where a patient suffers from a \u201cqualifying condition.\u201d The statute defines this term as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b644-7\" pgmap=\"644\">\u201cthe existence of one or more of. the following conditions in a patient certified in writing in the patient\u2019s medical record by the attending physician and by at least one other qualified physician:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-8\" pgmap=\"644\">(1) \u2018Terminal condition\u2019 means an illness or injury for which there is no reasonable prospect of cure or recovery, death is imminent, and the application of life-sustaining treatment would only prolong the dying process.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b644-9\" pgmap=\"644\">(2) \u2018.Permanent unconsciousness\u2019 means a condition that, to a high degree of medical certainty, (i) will last permanently, without improvement, (ii) in which thought, sensation, purposeful action, social interaction, and awareness of self and environment are absent, and (iii) for which initiating or continuing life-sustaining treatment, in light of the patient\u2019s medical condition, provides only minimal medical benefit.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b645-4\" pgmap=\"645\">(3) \u2018Incurable or irreversible condition\u2019 means an illness or injury (i) for which there is no reasonable prospect of cure or recovery, (ii) that ultimately will cause the patient\u2019s death even if life-sustaining treatment is initiated or continued, (iii) that imposes severe pain or otherwise imposes an inhumane burden on the patient, and (iv) for which initiating or continuing life-sustaining treatment, in light of the patient\u2019s medical condition, provides only minimal medical benefit.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851-10.</blockquote> <p id=\"b645-5\" pgmap=\"645\">The record of the trial court\u2019s proceedings in the case before us does not contain sufficient evidence to determine whether C.A.\u2019s medical condition fell within one of the qualifying conditions stated in the Health Care Surrogate Act. Under the Act, when a patient suffers from a qualifying condition, the treating physician must certify in writing, in the patient\u2019s medical records, the patient\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis for recovery. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, pars. 851 \u2014 10, 851 \u2014 20.) A second qualified physician, who has personally examined the patient, must also concur in the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient\u2019s medical condition as that governed by one of the qualifying conditions stated in the Act. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851\u2014 10 (defining \u201cqualified physician\u201d as a physician licensed to practice medicine in Illinois \u201cwho has personally examined the patient\u201d); see also Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 20.</p> <p id=\"b645-6\" pgmap=\"645\">At the trial court\u2019s proceedings, only one physician, Dr. Simmons, testified that she had personally examined the child. The remaining physician, Dr. Gath, testified that she had only reviewed the infant\u2019s medical charts. In order to justify the placement of a DNR order on C.A.\u2019s medical charts, it would be necessary for the child\u2019s treating physician, as well as one other physician who has personally examined the infant, to certify in the minor\u2019s medical charts that she suffers from one of the qualifying conditions stated in the Act. Because the record does not demonstrate that this requirement has been satisfied, I would vacate the trial court\u2019s order with directions that the parties comply with the provisions of the Health Care Surrogate Act.</p> <p id=\"b645-7\" pgmap=\"645(88) 646(17)\">I note that additional terms of the Health Care Surrogate Act would also be applicable in determining whether resuscitative efforts should be withheld. For example, under the Act, the surrogate\u2019s decision to authorize the withholding or withdrawal of a life-saving medical treatment must be stated to the treating physician and at least one adult witness. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 20(d).) The physician must then set forth, in the patient\u2019s medical records, the surrogate\u2019s decision and any discussion with respect thereto, and the adult witness must sign the document. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 20(d).</p> <p id=\"b646-5\" pgmap=\"646\">According to the Act, a determination that the patient suffers from a qualifying condition \u201ccreates no presumption regarding the application or non-application of life-sustaining treatment,\u201d but rather provides the circumstances necessary for the surrogate decision maker\u2019s consideration of whether to forgo a life-sustaining treatment. (III. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10.) In reaching this decision, \u201cthe surrogate shall weigh the burdens on the patient of initiating or continuing life-sustaining treatment against the benefits of that treatment.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 10.) In addition, where the patient is a minor, the surrogate \u201cshall take into account any other information, including the views of family and friends, that the surrogate decision maker believes the patient would have considered.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 20(b)(1).) Because of the trial court\u2019s on-going jurisdiction over the child\u2019s care and treatment, the court should be advised of the decision reached by these persons with respect to the placement of the DNR order on the child\u2019s chart. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 802 \u2014 28.</p> <p id=\"b646-6\" pgmap=\"646\">Although not mentioned by the parties in the present case, I note that the range of life-saving medical treatments which may lawfully be withheld or withdrawn in the instant cause may not be as broad as that applicable to an adult patient. The Health Care Surrogate Act defines a \u201clife-saving medical treatment\u201d as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b646-7\" pgmap=\"646\">\u201cany medical treatment, procedure, or intervention that, in the judgment of the attending physician, when applied to a patient with a qualifying condition, would not be effective to remove the qualifying condition or would serve only to prolong the dying process.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851\u2014 10.</blockquote> <p id=\"b646-8\" pgmap=\"646\">The Act further provides that a life-saving medical treatment may include, but is not limited to, \u201cassisted ventilation, renal dialysis, surgical procedures, blood transfusions, and the administration of drugs, antibiotics, and artificial nutrition and hydration.\u201d Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851-10.</p> <p id=\"b646-9\" pgmap=\"646(72) 647(84)\">However, the Health Care Surrogate Act further provides that nothing therein \u201csupersedes the provisions of 45 C.F.R. 1340.15 concerning the provision of \u2018appropriate\u2019 nutrition, hydration, and medication for neonates.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 851 \u2014 40.) This latter provision is a reference to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a75101 et seq. (1988)) and its implementing regulation (45 C.F.R. \u00a71340.15 (1991)), which precondition Federal funding for child abuse prevention and treatment programs upon State adoption of procedures or programs for the prompt notification of \u201csuspected medical neglect (including instances of withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life-threatening conditions)\u201d and the enactment of appropriate State laws to permit \u201cthe State child protective service system to pursue any legal remedies *** as may be necessary to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from disabled infants with life-threatening conditions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a75106a(b)(10)(B), (b)(10)(C) (1988).</p> <p id=\"b647-5\" pgmap=\"647\">Under the applicable implementing regulation for this provision in the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, an infant is defined as a child under the age of one year. (45 C.F.R. \u00a71340.15(b)(3)(i) (1991).) However, the regulation also advises that its terms \u201cshould be consulted thoroughly in the evaluation of any issue of medical neglect involving an infant older than one year of age who has been continuously hospitalized since birth, who was born extremely prematurely, or who has a long-term disability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (45 C.F.R. \u00a71340.15(b)(3)(i) (1991).) In addition, the regulation provides in pertinent part as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b647-6\" pgmap=\"647\">\u201cThe term \u2018withholding of medically indicated treatment\u2019 means the failure to respond to the infant\u2019s life-threatening conditions by providing treatment (including appropriate nutrition, hydration, and medication) which, in the treating physician\u2019s (or physicians\u2019) reasonable medical judgment, will be most likely to be effective in ameliorating or correcting all such conditions, except that the term does not include the failure to provide treatment (other than appropriate nutrition, hydration, or medication) to an infant when, in the treating physician\u2019s (or physicians\u2019) reasonable medical judgment any of the following circumstances apply:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b647-7\" pgmap=\"647\">(i) The infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b647-8\" pgmap=\"647\">(ii) The provision of such treatment would merely prolong dying, not be effective in ameliorating or correcting all of the infant\u2019s life-threatening conditions, or otherwise be futile in terms of the survival of the infant; or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b647-9\" pgmap=\"647\">(iii) The provision of such treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of the infant and the treatment itself under such circumstances would be inhumane.\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a71340.15(b)(2) (1991).)</blockquote> <p id=\"b647-10\" pgmap=\"647\">The regulation includes an appendix giving detailed explanations for its provisions, including those quoted above. See 45 C.F.R. Appendix to Part 1340 (1991).</p> <p id=\"b648-4\" pgmap=\"648\">I recognize that the guardian in the present case has not sought the authority to withdraw artificial nutrition or hydration from the minor child here. However, the parties and the trial court are cautioned of the significance of these provisions in the Federal statute and its implementing regulations.</p> <p id=\"b648-5\" pgmap=\"648\">C. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF HEALTH CARE SURROGATE ACT</p> <p id=\"b648-6\" pgmap=\"648\">The GAL contends that the Health Care Surrogate Act is unconstitutional, as a violation of procedural due, process, because it does not require prior judicial intervention and approval of a guardian\u2019s decision to consent to the withdrawal or removal of a life-saving medical treatment for the ward. I cannot agree with this argument. Initially, as explained more fully above, the Act requires specific factual findings by the appropriate health care professionals, as well as consultation with persons committed to and interested in the child\u2019s care and welfare. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. HOVa, pars. 851 \u2014 10, 851 \u2014 20.</p> <p id=\"b648-7\" pgmap=\"648\">In addition, the Health Care Surrogate Act contains detailed provisions for the possibility of dispute among various persons who are or could be designated as surrogate decision makers. If a guardian has already been appointed, challenge of the guardian\u2019s decision may be had in the court where such appointment of guardianship was granted. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. IIOV2, par. 851 \u2014 55.</p> <p id=\"b648-8\" pgmap=\"648\">In the case before us, the trial court could resolve a dispute between the appropriate persons regarding C.A.\u2019s care and treatment, upon the filing of a supplemental petition raising such issue. (See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 802 \u2014 13.) In considering whether the lifesaving medical treatment should be withheld or withdrawn, the court must consider the best interests of the child. (See, e.g., Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 37, par. 802-13; Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 1101/2, par. 850-20.) In accordance with Illinois Supreme Court precedent, the applicable standard of proof is that of clear and convincing evidence. See Greenspan, 137 Ill. 2d at 18; Longeway, 133 Ill. 2d at 51.</p> <p id=\"b648-9\" pgmap=\"648\">In considering the sufficiency of the due process protections afforded by a State statute, it is necessary to balance the private interest affected by the official action, \u201c \u2018the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest *** and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u2019 \u201d; and the State\u2019s interest, \u201c \u2018including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u2019 \u201d Parham v. J.R. (1979), 442 U.S. 584, 599-600, 61 L. Ed. 2d 101, 117, 99 S. Ct. 2493, 2502-03, quoting Mathews v. Eldridge (1976), 424 U.S. 319, 335, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 33, 96 S. Ct. 893, 903.</p> <p id=\"b649-4\" pgmap=\"649\">As applicable to the case before us, the private interests involved in this appeal are the minor\u2019s right to adequate medical treatment and her right to forgo a life-saving medical treatment that is not in her best interest. An erroneous deprivation of her right to adequate medical treatment may cause her to suffer either death or a diminished quality of life; an erroneous deprivation of her right to forgo a life-saving medical treatment may cause her to unnecessarily continue to live under inhumane circumstances.</p> <p id=\"b649-5\" pgmap=\"649\">The additional safeguard suggested by the GAL, i.e., prior judicial approval, could well hinder, rather than enhance, the minor\u2019s rights in the present case. Although the decision to withhold resuscitative efforts must sometimes be made quickly, judicial proceedings are not well suited or equipped for such short-notice decision making. This is one of the concerns the legislature considered in providing for such decisions to be made without prior judicial approval whenever possible. Given the Act\u2019s goal of permitting private decision making, the inherent shortcomings in requiring prior judicial approval, and the potential that judicial approval could easily hamper rather than help the minor patient\u2019s on-going and timely medical care, I am unable to conclude, on the record before us, that the failure to require prior judicial intervention would violate the procedural due process rights of C.A.</p> <p id=\"b649-6\" pgmap=\"649\">The GAL also contends that the statute violates procedural due process because it does not require that the treating physician, and one other physician who has personally examined the patient, certify that they have determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that the patient suffers from one of the qualifying conditions enumerated in the Health Care Surrogate Act. In addition, the GAL asserts that the Health Care Surrogate Act violates principles of equal protection because it provides for different degrees of medical certainty with respect to each of the three qualifying conditions stated in the statute. I find these arguments to be premature. Because the appropriate physicians in this case have not certified that C.A. suffers from any of the qualifying conditions stated under the Health Care Surrogate Act, the GAL\u2019s arguments are speculative, and I decline to consider them in this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b649-7\" pgmap=\"649\">For the reasons stated, I am unable to concur in the majority\u2019s disposition, and respectfully dissent.</p> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b636-9\" pgmap=\"636\"> I note that the issue in the instant case does not involve the withholding of artificial nutrition, hydration, or medication. Federal law requires the administration of these measures to an infant, irrespective of whether the child is in a comatose condition, a permanently vegetative state, or is terminally ill. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a75106(b)(1), 5106g(10) (1988); 45 C.F.R. \u00a71340.15 (1991).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
