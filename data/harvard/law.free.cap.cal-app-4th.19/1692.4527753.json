Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-12\">In this case we hold that kidnapping for extortion does not require the person extorted be someone other than the kidnapped victim. Mamdouh Ibrahim and Atif Ibrahim appeal from a judgment of conviction for multiple offenses, including murder, rape, and kidnapping for extortion resulting in death. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-13\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">Mamdouh and Atif are brothers. The victim, Zinab Saad, was their former stepmother. Each emigrated from Egypt. In 1991, Zinab was divorced and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1694\">*1694</page-number>living with her two daughters in San Mateo. Mamdouh shared an apartment in Concord with Subhi Beilani. Circumstantial evidence indicates that on Friday, January 18, 1991, Mamdouh and Atif, accompanied by Subhi, abducted Zinab from her house in San Mateo and took her to the Concord apartment, where she was raped and murdered. They then took the body to the Marin Headlands and set it on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">The evidence of activity by Mamdouh, Atif and Subhi between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on January 18 is sketchy. Witnesses testified that the three left the Concord apartment with Mamdouh\u2019s girlfriend at 4 p.m. in two vehicles, leaving the girlfriend at her workplace at 4:10 p.m.; they later returned to the apartment, with Subhi being the first to arrive at 7:45 p.m.; they left again in two vehicles at 9 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Zinab had planned to spend the weekend with her boyfriend at a resort, but when he arrived at her house to pick her up at 6:45 p.m. she was not there. The house was later found to be in slight disarray.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">At 10 p.m., federal park rangers at the Marin Headlands saw two vehicles enter a side road. A few minutes later, the rangers saw a bonfire alongside the road, illuminating the two vehicles. Mamdouh, Atif and Subhi were subsequently apprehended by assisting officers. The vehicle Mamdouh had been driving smelled of gasoline. Zinab\u2019s body, burned with gasoline, was found at the site of the bonfire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">The county coroner determined that Zinab had apparently been strangled to death before her body was burned. There was internal bleeding in her neck and head, as well as blood on the surface of her head. Her mouth was covered with duct tape, and a piece of striped cloth covered her eyes. Semen was present in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-8\">A search of the Concord apartment yielded Zinab\u2019s purse and tote bag, a knotted tie bearing duct tape and hairs similar to Zinab\u2019s, a cigarette butt bearing traces of lipstick similar to Zinab\u2019s, a roll of duct tape, a can of mace, four pieces of Zinab\u2019s jewelry, and a bloodstained striped shirt which matched the cloth covering Zinab\u2019s eyes. Officers at the Marin Headlands found a piece of duct tape in a trash can, a partial roll of duct tape in a dumpster, and, at the side of a road, a plastic bag containing items of Mamdouh\u2019s clothing bearing bloodstains which matched Zinab\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">When the men were booked, the booking officer found in Subhi\u2019s wallet a note in Zinab\u2019s handwriting. The note said, \u201cI am Zinab Saad. I take $4,000, $4,000 only, from Subhi Beilani.\u201d It was signed by Zinab and dated September 3, 1989, but the paper on which it was written seemed to the booking officer to be fairly new.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1695\">*1695</page-number>The evidence is murky as to <em>why </em>Zinab was kidnapped and killed. The prosecutor\u2019s theory was that the motive was financial. Two outstanding bills from Mamdouh\u2019s insurance company and automobile dealer were found in the glove compartment of his vehicle, and he had recently sought unsuccessfully to borrow money from a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">All three men were prosecuted, but only Mamdouh testified. He gave the following version of Zinab\u2019s death: He and Zinab had had a prior sexual relationship, but by 1991 they had not been in contact for about 18 months. On January 18, 1991, Zinab telephoned him and asked if he would pick her up; she wanted to spend the night at his apartment. Mamdouh, Atif and Subhi drove in two vehicles to Zinab\u2019s house in San Mateo and took her back to the Concord apartment. As the four were watching television in the living room, Zinab went to Mamdouh\u2019s bedroom. Mamdouh followed her there, and they had consensual sexual intercourse. They then returned to the living room, where the four discussed Subhi\u2019s desire to buy Atif\u2019s car. Zinab asked if Subhi needed money and, as a joke, she wrote the promissory note and said, \u201cHere, this is the money. Go get it.\u201d Zinab subsequently became upset and started to cry for some unknown reason, and she returned to Mamdouh\u2019s bedroom. He visited her there twice. During his second visit she repeatedly yelled that something was her \u201cfault.\u201d He held her shoulders and helped her to lie on the bed, and then left the room. When he returned five minutes later, she was dead. Fearing his family would learn of his involvement with Zinab and the police might think he had killed her, Mamdouh decided to make it look as if she had been robbed. He bound her arms, taped her mouth and took her jewelry. He, Atif and Subhi then left in two vehicles with the body. When they stopped to buy gasoline for the vehicles, they decided to burn the body. They drove to the Marin Headlands, where Mamdouh put gasoline on the body and set it on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">A jury convicted Mamdouh of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187), rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)), kidnapping for extortion resulting in death (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a)), simple kidnapping (Pen. Code, \u00a7 207, subd. (a)), conspiracy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (1)), removing articles from a corpse (Pen. Code, \u00a7 642), and false imprisonment (Pen. Code, \u00a7 236). He was acquitted of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211) and kidnapping for robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)). The jury returned the same verdicts as to Atif, except he was acquitted of rape and removing articles from a corpse. Subhi was acquitted on all charges except murder and simple kidnapping, as to which the jury was unable to reach verdicts. Pursuant to the convictions of kidnapping for extortion resulting in death, the court sentenced Mamdouh and Atif to imprisonment for life without possibility of parole (LWOP).</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1696\">*1696</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">A. <em>Kidnapping for Extortion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">The primary focus of this appeal is the LWOP sentences for kidnapping for extortion resulting in death. Mamdouh and Atif contend they did not commit this offense because it requires that the person from whom property is obtained be someone other than the kidnapped victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">This argument belies the plain language of the aggravated kidnapping statute, which encompasses a kidnapping \u201cfor ransom, reward or to commit extortion <em>or </em>to exact from another person any money or valuable thing . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a), italics added.) Because the statute is phrased in the disjunctive, it describes four different types of aggravated kidnapping: (1) for ransom; (2) for reward; (3) to commit extortion; and (4) to exact from another person any money or valuable thing. The crime of extortion (Pen. Code, \u00a7 518) does not require that the fruits of the extortion be obtained from a third party. Appellants would have the \u201canother person\u201d language of the fourth type of aggravated kidnapping apply to the first three, but that construction is logically precluded by the disjunctive language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-7\">Appellants rely on <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 579 [198 Cal.Rptr. 565], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 628, footnote 10 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376]. The perpetrators in that case detained a husband and wife during a residential robbery and threatened to harm the husband if the wife screamed. The People\u2019s theory was that the defendants were guilty of kidnapping for ransom or extortion because the wife\u2019s cooperation was a \u201cvaluable thing\u201d within the meaning of the aggravated kidnapping statute. The appellate court rejected this theory on the ground the restraint was merely incidental to the robbery and did not \u201csubstantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of the robbery itself.\u201d (150 Cal.App.3d at p. 595; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1119 [80 Cal.Rptr. 897, 459 P.2d 225, 43 A.L.R.3d 677] [asportation that elevates robbery to kidnapping for robbery does not include incidental movements that do not substantially increase the risk of harm necessarily present in robbery].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">In reviewing the case law on the subject, the court in <em>Martinez </em>commented, \u201cThe kidnap for ransom and extortion cases have recognized four-fact situations which show this form of aggravated kidnaping.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.3d at p. 588.) The court then described those situations, all of which involved kidnapping of a primary victim and ransom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1697\">*1697</page-number>or extortion from a secondary victim: (1) the primary victim is abducted and held while ransom is demanded from a secondary victim; (2) the kidnap victim is not moved but the secondary victim is; (3) neither victim is moved; and (4) the kidnap victim is held to induce police officers to refrain from resisting and stopping the defendant\u2019s criminal acts. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 588-589.) <em>Martinez </em>concluded from these cases that the aggravated kidnapping statute is \u201cintended to apply to those situations involving a primary and secondary victim, where one of the victims is held or taken away and the other is subjected to a ransom or extortion demand.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 591.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">From this discussion in <em>Martinez, </em>appellants conclude that the four situations described in that case are the <em>only </em>possible types of kidnapping for ransom or extortion, and thus kidnapping for extortion requires a secondary victim other than the person kidnapped. But <em>Martinez </em>did not so hold. The court merely categorized the existing cases and concluded the statute was intended to apply to situations involving primary and secondary victims. The court never said those situations represent the <em>exclusive </em>application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-6\">In contrast, a subsequent decision, <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Deardorf) </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 509 [288 Cal.Rptr. 137] directly held that kidnapping for extortion does <em>not </em>require that property be exacted from a secondary victim. Relying on the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the disjunctive language in the aggravated kidnapping statute, the court concluded, \u201cWe are unaware of any requirement, imposed either by statute or case law, that requires the victim in a kidnapping for extortion case to have someone other than himself step onto the stage in order to provide the crook with an item of value. Extortion is defined by [Penal Code] section 518 as \u2018. . . the obtaining of property from another, with his consent . . . induced by a wrongful use of force or fear . . . .\u2019 Significantly, section 518 makes no requirement that someone other than the victim pay the criminal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 513-514; see also Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed. 1982) p. 233 [\u201cOne who detains another for the purpose of extorting money from him or from another person as the price of his release is guilty of kidnaping for ransom . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Appellants contend <em>Martinez </em>and <em>Deardorf </em>are in conflict and <em>Martinez </em>represents the better view. We perceive no conflict, since we do not read <em>Martinez </em>as presenting an exclusive list of kidnappings for ransom or extortion. Moreover, because of the disjunctive language of Penal Code section 209, subdivision (a), we agree with the reasoning in <em>Deardorf.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">Appellants also contend the language in Penal Code section 209 \u201cor to exact from another person any money or valuable thing\u201d should be construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1698\">*1698</page-number>as modifying the provisions \u201cfor ransom, reward or to commit extortion\u201d\u2014 making \u201canother person\u201d an essential element of kidnapping for extortion\u2014 because the former language would otherwise be surplusage, describing situations already covered by the provisions \u201cfor ransom, reward or to commit extortion.\u201d But this construction is itself infected by redundancy: if the \u201canother person\u201d language encompasses and restricts the ransom, reward and extortion provisions, it renders <em>those </em>provisions surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">Finally, appellants claim kidnapping for extortion necessarily requires a secondary victim because, otherwise, all face-to-face simple extortions would constitute kidnapping for extortion since they all involve <em>confinement, </em>which is an element of aggravated kidnapping. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a) [\u201cAny person who seizes, confines, inveigles, entices, decoys, abducts, conceals, kidnaps or carries away another person . . . .\u201d].) Appellants rely by analogy on <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at page 1139, which held that kidnapping for robbery does not encompass robberies \u201cin which the movements of the victim are merely incidental to the commission of the robbery and do not substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in the crime of robbery itself.\u201d But a face-to-face simple extortion does not necessarily involve confinement; it may be committed through \u201cforce or fear.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 518.) Moreover, where extortion does involve confinement, the problem posed by appellants can be met by applying the reasoning of <em>Daniels </em>and requiring, for purposes of aggravated kidnapping, that the confinement not be merely incidental to simple extortion but substantially increase the risk of harm over and above that necessarily present in extortion. That standard is met here; there was a considerable asportation for many miles and a lengthy confinement for several hours, neither of which was necessary to extort the promissory note from Zinab. It cannot be reasonably asserted\u2014and appellants do not claim\u2014 that Zinab\u2019s confinement was merely incidental to the commission of simple extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">We conclude that appellants were properly convicted of kidnapping for extortion resulting in death, and thus were properly sentenced to life without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">We are disturbed, however, by the fact that where there is no secondary victim, the distinction between kidnapping for extortion and kidnapping for robbery can be subtle (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Norris </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 51, 58 [219 Cal.Rptr. 7, 706 P.2d 1141] (conc. opn. of Kaus, J.)), yet the difference in penalty is substantial where the result is death/life without possibility of parole for the former (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (a)), but life with possibility of parole for the latter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 209, subd. (b)). We suspect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1699\">*1699</page-number>difference in penalty is rooted in the common (though not essential) involvement of multiple victims\u2014primary and secondary\u2014in kidnappings for extortion. Absent a secondary victim, we can discern no reason for punishing the kidnapper-extortionist far more severely than the kidnapper-robber. Nor, do we believe, should so great a difference in penalty hinge upon so subtle a distinction as that between extortion and robbery\u2014whether property was taken <em>consensually </em>by force or fear (Pen. Code, \u00a7 518) or <em>nonconsensually </em>by force or fear (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211). We believe that where, as here, a kidnapping for extortion resulting in death does not involve a secondary victim, the magnitude of the crime is equal to that of a kidnapping for robbery resulting in death, and the two crimes should be equally punished. We therefore urge the Legislature to reconsider the sentencing schemes for these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">B.-F.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">IV.
