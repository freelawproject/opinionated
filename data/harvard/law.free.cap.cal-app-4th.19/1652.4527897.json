J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADz\">In thepublished portion of this opinion, we shall hold that the filing of an information tolls the period of limitations as to lesser related offenses which are based on the \u201csame conduct\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, subd. (b)) as that which underlies the charged offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">Defendant was charged with a variety of sexual offenses committed against Margaret T. and Adonica H. A jury convicted him of 33 counts charging sexual offenses, including forcible oral copulation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288a, subd. (c)), forcible rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)), forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1655\">*1655</page-number>sodomy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 286), and penetration of genital or anal opening with a foreign object (Pen. Code, \u00a7 289). The jury found defendant used a deadly weapon in the commission of one of the sex offenses (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.3, subd. (a)) and acted in concert in respect to several of the others (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 288a, subd. (d), 264.1). In addition, the jury convicted defendant of one count of second degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211; further statutory references to sections of an undesignated code are to the Penal Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Defendant was sentenced to state prison for an aggregate term of 282 years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He appeals contending the trial court erred (1) in denying his <em>Marsden </em>motions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) in refusing his request to instruct on lesser related offenses, (3) in failing sua sponte to instruct on petty theft as an included offense of robbery, (4) in imposing cruel and unusual punishment, and (5) in failing completely to instruct on sodomy. We shall reverse defendant\u2019s convictions on three counts of forcible rape for error in failing to instruct on the lesser related offense of engaging in prostitution in violation of section 647, subdivision (b). In all other respects, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">In July 1990, defendant met Margaret T., a prostitute. They struck up a conversation and Margaret agreed to accompany defendant to his residence. Once there, defendant\u2019s demeanor changed. He slapped Margaret, told her \u201cyou\u2019re my bitch now,\u201d and threatened her. Defendant forcibly engaged Margaret in acts of rape, sodomy and oral copulation and penetrated her with a foreign object. Other men participated with defendant in several of the acts. Following the sexual assaults, Margaret was taken to the streets to work as a prostitute for defendant. She escaped when a customer picked her up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">On August 10, 1990, defendant apprehended Margaret walking on the street and forced her to accompany him to his residence. There defendant and other men again subjected Margaret to assaults similar to those perpetrated upon her in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">On September 17, 1990, defendant met Adonica H. at a mall. Adonica was not a prostitute. They talked for a few minutes and Adonica agreed to go with defendant for a drink. Defendant took her to his residence, forced her to disrobe and told her \u201cYou\u2019re my bitch now.\u201d Adonica was forcibly subjected to acts of rape, sodomy and oral copulation with defendant and with other men acting in concert with defendant. At one point, while another man was forcing himself on Adonica, defendant took $2 or $3 dollars from Adonica\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1656\">*1656</page-number>purse. Adonica was eventually released and reported the attacks to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Defendant testified Margaret and Adonica were prostitutes and that they each approached him first. He engaged in consensual vaginal intercourse with each of them in exchange for crack cocaine. He denied he engaged in other sex acts or assisted others in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">I<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">Without specifying any particular counts, defendant requested the court instruct on violation of section 647, subdivision (b), engaging in prostitution (hereafter prostitution), as a lesser related offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, believing the statute of limitations had expired on the misdemeanor offense of prostitution, refused so to instruct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instructions on prostitution requires reversal of all sexual offense convictions. We conclude the instructions should have been given but only with ' reference to the charges of forcible rape. Since we find the failure to instruct prejudicial, reversal is required but only as to the rape convictions (counts 23, 33, and 34).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 510 [199 Cal.Rptr. 45, 674 P.2d 1303, 50 A.L.R.4th 1055] held a trial court is obligated, upon a defendant\u2019s request, to instruct the jury on lesser related offenses when (1) there exists \u201csome basis, other than an unexplainable rejection of prosecution evidence, on which the jury could find the offense to be less than that charged,\u201d (2) the offense is \u201cclosely related to that charged and shown by the evidence,\u201d and (3) the instruction is \u201cjustified by the defendant\u2019s reliance on a theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1657\">*1657</page-number>defense that would be consistent with a conviction for the related offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 531.) A defendant\u2019s right to lesser related instructions exists \u201cto enable the jury to determine fairly the issues presented by the evidence and in so doing to avoid any incentive to convict the defendant of a greater offense than that which he committed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">At trial defendant admitted he engaged in acts of vaginal intercourse with Margaret and Adonica, but claimed the acts were consensual in exchange for drugs. Defendant denied committing or assisting anyone in committing any other sexual acts with these women.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">The People contend lesser related instructions on prostitution were not required because (1) prostitution is not an offense closely related to rape, and (2) prostitution was time-barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Farrow </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1606 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 844], the People argue prostitution is not closely related to rape because the two offenses address distinct societal interests: the societal interest in proscribing rape is to prevent assaultive crimes and secure the safety of the individual, whereas the societal interest in proscribing prostitution is to ensure a certain level of moral conduct and to protect those who engage in prostitution from being preyed upon by pimps, panderers, drug pushers, and those of similar ilk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\"><em>Farrow, </em>in fact, rejected the societal interests test and those cases which had \u201c \u2018unreflectively relied\u2019 on Geiger\u2019s \u2018same societal interest\u2019 factor as a virtual sine qua non for establishing the existence of Geiger\u2019s \u2018closely related\u2019 criteria for the giving of instructions on lesser related offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Farrow, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1622-1623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">The <em>Farrow </em>court opined that <em>People </em>v. <em>Blevins </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1413 [270 Cal.Rptr. 172] set forth the appropriate test for determining whether a lesser offense is closely related to a greater offense. <em>(Farrow, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1623.) <em>Blevins </em>held: \u201c[T]he second prerequisite [of <em>Geiger] </em>is established when the evidence offered by either side [which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1658\">*1658</page-number>would support the giving of instructions on a lesser related offense] is relevant to and was admitted for the purpose of establishing whether the defendant is guilty of the charged offense.\u201d <em>(Blevins </em>at p. 1417.) In other words, \u201c. . . for a lesser uncharged offense to be closely related to a greater charged offense, evidence of the lesser offense must be relevant to the issue of whether the defendant is guilty of the greater one.\u201d <em>(Blevins </em>at p. 1415.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Accordingly, if the jurors believed defendant\u2019s testimony that he traded drugs for consensual sexual intercourse, they would have acquitted him of the rape charges. Thus, evidence the charged rapes were simply acts of prostitution is relevant to the determination of defendant\u2019s guilt of the greater charges. Under these circumstances, prostitution is an offense closely related to rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">We must now determine whether the statute of limitations had run on prostitution.  With the exception of capital cases, (see <em>Spaziano </em>v. <em>Florida </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 447, 456 [82 L.Ed.2d 340, 349-350, 104 S.Ct. 3154]), the statute of limitations is jurisdictional and may not be waived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chadd </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 739, 757 [170 Cal.Rptr. 798, 621 P.2d 837]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1934) 1 Cal.2d 611, 613-614 [36 P.2d 378].) As a consequence, a trial court is under no duty to instruct on a lesser included offense which is time-barred since the defendant cannot be convicted of it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diedrich </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 263, 283 [182 Cal.Rptr. 354, 643 P.2d 971]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vallerga </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 847, 878-883 [136 Cal.Rptr. 429].) A fortiori, a defendant may not be convicted of a lesser related offense which is time-barred. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brice </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 111, 114-115 [253 Cal.Rptr. 370].) It follows that a trial court is not required to give requested instructions on lesser related offenses which are barred by the statute of limitations. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ognibene </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1286, 1289-1290 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 96].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The maximum punishment for prostitution, a violation of section 647, subdivision (b), is six months in the county jail and a fine not exceeding $1,000. (\u00a7 19.) Section 802 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), prosecution for an offense not punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison shall be commenced within one year after commission of the offense.\u201d A violation of section 647, subdivision (b) is not one of the exceptions listed in subdivision (b) of section 802. Thus, the one-year limitation period is applicable to prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Section 803 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in this section, a limitation of time prescribed in this chapter is not tolled or extended for any reason, (b) No time during which prosecution of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1659\">*1659</page-number>person for the same conduct is pending in a court of this state is a part of a limitation of time prescribed in this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Section 804 provides in pertinent part: \u201cFor the purpose of this chapter, prosecution of an offense is commenced when any of the following occurs: (a) An indictment or information is filed. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">The information charged defendant with two counts of forcible rape occuring on August 10, 1990 (counts 33 and 34) and one count of forcible rape occuring on September 17, 1990 (count 22). Unless tolled by the filing of the information (\u00a7\u00a7 803, subd. (a); 804, subd. (a)), the one-year statute of limitations on prostitution as an offense lesser related to those charged rapes would have run on August 10, 1991, for counts 33 and 34 and on September 17, 1991, for count 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">The information was filed on January 15, 1991, and tolled the statute of limitations not only as to the charged rapes but also as to offenses based on \u201cthe same conduct\u201d as the charged rapes (Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, subd. (b)). The issue thus narrows to whether the related offense of prostitution is based on the \u201csame conduct\u201d as the charged rapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">The Law Revision Commission comment to section 803 states that \u201c[t]he test of the \u2018same conduct,\u2019 involving as it does some flexibility of definition, states a principle that should meet the reasonable needs of prosecution, while affording the defendant fair protection against an enlargement of the charges after running of the statute. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">Thus, where an action is dismissed and refiled after the period of limitations, the prosecutor may charge offenses based on the \u201csame conduct\u201d as the dismissed action because the filing of the original action tolls the statute of limitations not only as to those offenses charged in the original action, but also as to offenses based on the \u201csame conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1229-10\">Here, the \u201cconduct\u201d at issue was sexual intercourse between defendant and respectively, Margaret and Adonica, both of whom claimed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1660\">*1660</page-number>conduct constituted rape while defendant claimed it was in each case simply an act of prostitution. Since the prostitution offenses were based on the same conduct as the rapes for which defendant was being prosecuted, the filing of the information tolled the one-year statute of limitations. (\u00a7 803, subd. (b).) Therefore, the instructions requested by defendant on the lesser related offense of prostitution should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Brice, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 111, is not inconsistent with our holding. In that case, defendants were charged by information on June 24, 1981, with murder. The victim had been killed on March 10, 1981. At defendants\u2019 request the trial court instructed the jury on the lesser related offense of accessory to murder (\u00a7 32) and the jury convicted defendants of that offense. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the statute of limitations is jurisdictional and cannot be waived by consent or otherwise and therefore the convictions for a ccessory were barred by the three-year statute of limitations for that offense (206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 114-115). The court explained the crime of accessory took place the day after the victim\u2019s death, on March 11, 1981, and trial commenced in late 1984, more than three years thereafter and thus too late to amend the information to allege a violation of section 32 (206 Cal.App.3d at p. 114).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">Section 803, subdivision (b), which tolls the period of limitations during \u201cprosecution of the same person for the same conduct,\u201d was added by chapter 1270 of the Statutes of 1984 (chapter 1207) as part of a comprehensive revision of the provisions governing the time of commencing criminal actions. Section 806, a part of chapter 1207, specifies as a general rule that chapter 1207 applies \u201cto an offense that was committed before, on, or after\u201d January 1, 1985 (\u00a7 806, subd. (b)). However, the applicable pre-January 1, 1985, law applies to an offense committed before that date if \u201cprosecution for the offense would be barred on [January 1, 1985] by the limitation of time applicable before [that date]\u201d (\u00a7 806, subd. (c)(1)) or \u201c. . . prosecution for the offense was commenced before [January 1, 1985].\u201d (\u00a7 806, subd. (c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">In <em>Brice, </em>both exceptions to the general rule stated in section 806 apply: prosecution of accessory for murder was barred by the limitation of time applicable before January 1, 1985, and the prosecution had been commenced before that date. Thus, subdivision (b) of section 803 which tolls the period of limitations during \u201cprosecution of the same person for the same conduct,\u201d had no application to the <em>Brice </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\">We believe the refusal to instruct on prostitution was prejudicial. We cannot say that a properly instructed jury could not have believed defendant\u2019s testimony as to the rape charges and found that he in fact engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1661\">*1661</page-number>consensual acts of intercourse with Margaret and Adonica and only thereafter resorted to forcible sexual conduct. We note that the jury did acquit on several counts which charged forcible oral copulation and forcible sodomy (counts 16, 18, 21, 26, 43, and 48). The convictions for rape charged in counts 22, 33, and 34 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">III-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">The convictions for rape charged in counts 22, 33, and 34 are reversed.
