Defendants cross-appeal, claiming the trial court erroneously denied their request for contractual attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the trial court correctly determined defendants did not breach the joint venture agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude the trial court properly denied defendants\u2019 request for contractual attorney fees because defendants attempted to claim fees by using a memorandum of costs without filing a noticed motion as is required by statute and rule of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-13\">I. <em>The Trial Court Reached the Right Result*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number>II. <em>Cross-appeal\u2014Denial of Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Defendants cross-appeal from the judgment insofar as the cost award excludes their claim for attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717 (hereafter section 1717 attorney fees), as parties prevailing in an action on a contract. Defendants, who sought the attorney fees in their cost memorandum, contend the trial court erred in denying their claim on the procedural ground of their failure to file a motion for the attorney fees at the same time they filed their cost memorandum claiming such fees. Defendants further contend the trial court abused its discretion by denying their motion for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will conclude defendants\u2019 contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">The sequence of events is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">On March 11, 1992, the trial court issued a written tentative decision in favor of defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit for breach of contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs requested a statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">On March 31, 1992, <em>before entry of judgment, </em>defendants filed a cost memorandum which included a claim for $98,746.50 in attorney fees \u201cauthorized by contract, assessed upon motion or by this memorandum.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">On April 10, 1992, plaintiffs noticed a motion to tax costs, challenging inter alia the attorney fee claim on the merits, with no procedural objection to the absence of a noticed motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">On April 28, 1992, the trial court issued its statement of decision in favor of defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">Also on April 28, 1992, defendants filed an opposition to the motion to tax costs, which included briefing of the merits of the attorney fee claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1721\">*1721</page-number>section 1717 and a declaration of counsel setting forth the basis for the amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">On May 1, 1992, plaintiffs filed their reply, challenging the attorney fee claim on the merits and raising for the first time the procedural objection that section 1717 attorney fees must be sought through a motion filed before or at the same time as the cost memorandum, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 870.2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argued the fee request must be denied because defendants \u201chave not yet served a notice of motion for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Plaintiffs also asserted, without amplification, that defendants\u2019 opposition to the motion to tax costs could not be construed as a motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">On May 5, 1992, a hearing was held on the motion to tax costs, with no discussion of the attorney fee issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-6\">On May 13, 1992, before entry of judgment, the trial court issued its order (designated as \u201cRuling on Request for Attorney Fees and Motion to Tax Costs\u201d) granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to tax costs as to the attorney fees. The order, which transposes the parties, states in part: \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 [szc: defendants\u2019] motion for attorney fees is hereby denied. Plaintiffs [&gt;zc: defendants] have failed to file a motion pursuant to Rules of Court, rule 870.2. [ ] [H] Defendants\u2019 [sz'c: plaintiffs\u2019] motion to tax costs is granted as follows. The following costs are allowed and all other costs are denied: [recitation of costs, omitting attorney fees].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">On May 26, 1992, defendants filed a motion for reconsideration or, alternatively, for relief under section 473, seeking the court\u2019s permission to file a motion for attorney fees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Plaintiffs opposed the motion for reconsideration or relief, asserting inter alia that defendants had failed to comply with section 473\u2019s requirements, in that defendants had failed to show any \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect\u201d and had failed to attach to their motion for relief a copy of the proposed motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-9\">Defendants\u2019 reply to plaintiffs\u2019 opposition made no response to the issue of noncompliance with section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1722\">*1722</page-number>On June 18, 1992 (still before entry of judgment in the lawsuit), the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration or section 473 relief as to the attorney fees issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">On July 17, 1992, judgment was entered. The judgment includes a cost award in an amount excluding the attorney fee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">On August 7, 1992, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">On September 8, 1992, defendants filed a notice of cross-appeal from the judgment, specifically \u201cfrom that portion of the judgment which fails to include defendants\u2019 reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the action as an element of the costs of suit awarded to defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">B. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">1. <em>Order Taxing Costs Was Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">Defendants contend the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to tax costs as to the attorney fees on the procedural technicality of defendants\u2019 failure to file a motion for attorney fees at the same time they filed their cost memorandum. As we read their brief, defendants mount a multipronged attack. First, they argue they did not need to file a noticed motion and were within their rights to proceed by simply including attorney fees in the cost bill. Second, they argue that if a timely motion was required, their procedural deficiencies (in failing to file a formal motion and in failing to do so no later than the time they filed the cost bill) should be disregarded due to the absence of prejudice to plaintiffs, in that (a) defendants\u2019 opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to tax costs sufficiently presented all information which would have been presented in a motion for attorney fees, and (b) the cost bill was itself premature (rule 870(a)(1)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Third, defendants argue relief should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1723\">*1723</page-number>have been granted under section 473.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We will reject all of defendants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">a. A <em>Timely Motion Is Required</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">At issue in this case is the relationship of three provisions: (1) Civil Code section 1717, which authorizes attorney fees to a party prevailing in an action on a contract containing an attorney fee provision; (2) section 1033.5, which makes section 1717 attorney fees recoverable as costs upon a noticed motion; and (3) rule 870.2, which sets forth the time for filing a motion for section 1717 attorney fees as an element of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">Thus, Civil Code section 1717<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provides that attorney fees \u201cshall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit\u201d and also provides that the \u201cprevailing party\u201d will be determined \u201cupon notice and motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">Section 1033.5<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> requires that section 1717 attorney fees as an element of costs be sought by noticed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">Rule 870.2 (fn. 7, <em>ante) </em>requires that the motion claiming section 1717 attorney fees be filed before or at the same time as the cost memorandum. We note Judicial Council rules have the force of statutes to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1724\">*1724</page-number>they are not inconsistent with legislative enactments or constitutional provisions. (I<em>n re Richard S. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 857, 863 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 819 P.2d 843].) Moreover, rule 870.2, which became effective in January 1987, was adopted pursuant to express statutory authority in section 1034.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">As should be apparent from the foregoing provisions, a noticed motion for attorney fees should have been filed in this case no later than the filing of the cost memorandum. Defendants argue they did not need to file a motion, and it was proper for them to claim attorney fees by merely including the amount in the cost memorandum. In support of this proposition, defendants rely on outdated authority. Thus, they cite the Legislature\u2019s 1987 amendment of Civil Code section 1717, which deleted the following italicized words from the statute: \u201cReasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be fixed by the court, <em>upon notice and motion by a party, </em>and shall be an element of costs of suit.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Italics added.) (Stats. 1987, ch. 1080, \u00a7 1, p. 3648.) Defendants cite decisional law construing that amendment to mean that a motion is no longer required. (E.g., <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7 [263 Cal.Rptr. 110].) Defendants further claim the 1987 amendment deleting the motion requirement from Civil Code section 1717 means that the rule 870.2 procedure is no longer required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">However, defendants overlook the Legislature\u2019s subsequent amendment of section 1033.5, which defeats defendants\u2019 position. Thus, in 1990, the Legislature amended section 1033.5 to its present form (fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>requiring that section 1717 attorney fees be fixed by noticed motion. In so doing, the Legislature expressed its intent as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">\u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that <em>there is great uncertainty as to the procedure to be followed in awarding attorney\u2019s fees </em>where entitlement thereto is provided by contract to the prevailing party. <em>It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to confirm that these attorney\u2019s fees are costs which are to be awarded only upon noticed motion, </em>except where the parties stipulate otherwise or judgment is entered by default. <em>It is further the intent of the Legislature to vest the Judicial Council with the discretion provided in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1725\">*1725</page-number><em>Section 1034 of the Code of Civil Procedure to adopt procedural guidelines establishing the time for hearing of these motions, but the Legislature finds and declares that the criteria set forth in Section 870.2 of the California Rules of Court provide a fair and equitable procedure for the motions.\u201d </em>(Stats. 1990, ch. 804, \u00a7 2, italics added; see Historical and Statutory Notes, 18A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1033.5 (1993 pocket supp.) p. 43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">This declaration of legislative intent could not be more clear. Contractual attorney fees are to be claimed \u201conly\u201d by noticed motion, not by the mere filing of a memorandum of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">Thus, defendants were required to file a noticed motion for attorney fees, and were further required by rule 870.2 to file the motion before or at the same time as the cost memorandum. They did not do so. This conclusion raises questions as to (1) whether the trial court has discretion to disregard noncompliance with the procedural requirements, and (2) whether the trial court has discretion to grant relief from noncompliance under section 473 (fn. 11, ante) upon a showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. We will conclude the trial court does not have discretion to disregard noncompliance. We will also conclude the trial court has discretion to grant relief under section 473, but defendants in this case fail to show any abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of section 473 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">b. <em>Procedural Deficiencies Cannot Be Disregarded; Sole Remedy Is Section 473 Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">As indicated, defendants argue their procedural deficiencies (in failing to file a formal motion and in failing to do so no later than the date they filed the cost bill) should be disregarded because there was no prejudice to plaintiffs, in that (1) defendants\u2019 opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to tax costs was equivalent to a motion for attorney fees, and (2) the cost bill was itself premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">The first question is whether the trial court has discretion to disregard noncompliance, in light of the 1990 amendment of section 1033.5. We note that two divisions of the Second District have expressed the view that the procedural requirements are mandatory, such that the trial court does not have discretion to disregard noncompliance. Thus, <em>Bankes </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 365 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 723] reversed an attorney <em>fee </em>award on grounds unrelated to the issue before us. The court then stated as an alternative ground for reversal the untimely filing of the request for attorney fees. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 369-372.) <em>Bankes </em>set forth the applicable statutes and rules, cited the 1990 legislation, and noted that the trial court\u2019s power to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1726\">*1726</page-number>procedural deviations is restricted by rule 870(b)(3),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which contains a limitation on the trial court\u2019s power to grant extensions of the time period for filing the cost memorandum.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (9 Cal.App.4th at p. 371.) Similarly, <em>Nazemi </em>v. <em>Tseng </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1633 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 762] held the trial court abused its discretion by considering a motion for attorney fees filed after expiration of the maximum time extension allowed by rule. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1640-1641.) Without discussing the 1990 legislation, <em>Nazemi </em>determined: \u201cThe time provisions relating to the filing of a memorandum of costs, while not jurisdictional, are mandatory.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1640, citing <em>Hydratec, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sun Valley 260 Orchard &amp; Vineyard Co. </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 924, 929 [272 Cal.Rptr. 899], and <em>Sepulveda </em>v. <em>Apablasa </em>(1938) 25 Cal.App.2d 381, 388-389 [77 P.2d 526].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">We agree the cost procedure requirements are mandatory, and therefore the trial court does not have discretion to disregard noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">Defendants nevertheless maintain the trial court should disregard noncompliance if the opposing party is not prejudiced. They rely on cases holding that technical noncompliance with the procedural requirements should be overlooked where the party seeking costs complied with the spirit if not the letter of the law. We will conclude those cases are no longer good law in light of the 1990 legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Thus, <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Dewor Developments </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 778 [191 Cal.Rptr. 8, 661 P.2d 1088] held that litigants were entitled to a determination of their section 1717 attorney fee claim despite failure to file a motion (as then required by Civil Code section 1717), because they had complied with the \u201cspirit\u201d if not the letter of the law, by attaching points and authorities and a declaration to their cost memorandum. (33 Cal.3d at p. 786.) However, the Supreme Court there noted that Civil Code (former) section 1717\u2019s new requirement of a noticed motion became operative only 10 days before the trial court\u2019s judgment, and after all procedural steps in the case were completed. (33 Cal.3d at p. 786.) Moreover, <em>Christensen </em>contained no analysis of the issue, and the case predated the 1990 clarifying legislation. We therefore do not find <em>Christensen </em>to be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1727\">*1727</page-number>As defendants note, the same \u201cspirit of the law\u201d standard was applied in <em>California Recreation Industries </em>v. <em>Kierstead </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 203 [244 Cal.Rptr. 632], which arose at a time when Civil Code section 1717 contained the express motion requirement. In that case, the appellants sought attorney fees in a cost memorandum, then served points and authorities and declarations after the opposing parties challenged the attorney fees in a motion to tax costs. (199 Cal.App.3d at p. 205.) Citing <em>Christensen\u2019s </em>\u201cspirit of the law\u201d standard, the appellate court held fees could be awarded on the cost procedure despite Civil Code section 1717\u2019s motion requirement. <em>(California Recreation Industries, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 209.) However, like <em>Christensen, California Recreation Industries </em>predated the Legislature\u2019s 1990 clarification of the law and is therefore outdated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">We note the Second District has recently applied the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d principle to save a defective attorney fee claim despite the 1990 legislation. <em>(Gunlock Corp. </em>v. <em>Walk on Water, Inc. </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].) In <em>Gunlock, </em>as in this case, the appellant filed no motion but merely included an amount for attorney fees in the cost memorandum. When the opposing party filed a motion to tax costs, challenging inter alia the noncompliance with the motion procedure, the appellant in its opposition submitted a declaration from counsel explaining the basis for the charges. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1302-1303.) The trial court reluctantly granted the motion to tax costs, believing it had no discretion in the matter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1303.) The trial court subsequently denied the appellant\u2019s motion for relief under section 473, on the ground that counsel\u2019s unawareness of code requirements was per se inexcusable. (15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">The appellate court in <em>Gunlock </em>began by recounting the Legislature\u2019s express effort to rectify the prior confusion surrounding this issue in its 1990 legislation requiring that section 1717 attorney fees be sought by noticed motion. (15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1303.) Nevertheless, <em>Gunlock </em>continued on to conclude that the present statutory scheme does not deprive the trial court of discretion to overlook noncompliance. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1304.) The appellate court first reasoned that, even if a motion was required to be filed within the time for filing the cost memorandum, the time limitation for filing the cost memorandum (rule 870<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>) is not jurisdictional, and a trial court has broad discretion to allow relief from a failure to timely file where the opposing party is not prejudiced. (15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304.) <em>Gunlock </em>next cited the authorities excusing a technical noncompliance where the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d was satisfied. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1304-1305.) <em>Gunlock </em>concluded the authorities \u201cmanifest substantial latitude in allowing fees to be awarded without strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1728\">*1728</page-number>compliance with statutory temporal and procedural limitations.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">We respectfully disagree with <em>Gunlock </em>because it recreates the \u201cuncertainty\u201d the Legislature so clearly sought to dispel in its declaration of intent in amending section 1033.5 in 1990. Our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].) Given the Legislature\u2019s clear declaration of legislative intent and its express endorsement of rule 870.2, the trial court does not have discretion to disregard the statutory requirement that a claim for contractual attorney fees must be made by timely written motion. That the procedural requirements are not jurisdictional does not lead to the conclusion that they may be disregarded. While not jurisdictional, the rules are mandatory. <em>(Nazemi, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1640.) Moreover, in light of the Legislature\u2019s express intent to resolve uncertainty in this area of law, we cannot sanction an approach to handling these attorney fee claims that can only generate litigation such as the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">We therefore conclude the trial court did not err in denying attorney fees on the ground defendants failed to file a timely motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-6\">Nevertheless, the mandatory nature of the procedural requirements does not mean that the trial court is deprived of jurisdiction to grant relief under section 473 (fn. 11, <em>ante) </em>upon a proper showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(LeDeit </em>v. <em>Ehlert </em>(1962) 205 Cal.App.2d 154, 169-170 [22 Cal.Rptr. 747] [trial court may grant section 473 relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1729\">*1729</page-number>from noncompliance with time limitations for filing cost bill, which are not jurisdictional]; see also 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 145, p. 547 [section 473 relief may be granted from failure to take nonjurisdictional procedural steps].) We find nothing in the 1990 legislation that would alter the nonjurisdictional nature of the mandatory procedural steps for claiming costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\">We conclude the trial court may not disregard noncompliance with the procedural requirements for claiming contractual attorney fees but may grant relief under section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">We now turn to the trial court\u2019s denial of relief under section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"Ace\">c. <em>No Abuse of Discretion in Denying Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">As indicated, defendants moved for relief under section 473 as an alternative to the motion for reconsideration, asking for the opportunity to file a motion for attorney fees.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Defendants contend the trial court abused its discretion in denying relief, because at the time the trial court ruled, judgment had still not been entered, so defendants\u2019 cost bill was itself premature, and plaintiffs would not be prejudiced by the court allowing defendants to follow the proper procedure. Defendants assert the motion \u201cwas only \u2018late\u2019 in the sense that it is [] supposed to be filed \u2018with or before\u2019 the cost memo.\u201d We will conclude defendants fail to show the trial court abused its discretion in refusing relief under the standards of section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-7\">Section 473 allows relief upon a showing of excusable neglect, mistake, inadvertence, or surprise. Section 473 also requires that a copy of the proposed pleading accompany the motion for relief; \u201c. . . otherwise the application shall not be granted.\u201d (\u00a7 473, fn. 11, <em>ante.) </em>The determination of the motion lies in the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>(Iott </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 521, 527 [253 Cal.Rptr. 635].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-8\">Here, defendants\u2019 motion for relief failed to assert any mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect and failed to attach a copy of the proposed motion. Indeed, it is apparent from the record that the section 473 motion was thrown in as a mere afterthought, with no attempt to meet the foregoing requirements. Thus, the motion first sought reconsideration, arguing California law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1730\">*1730</page-number>does not require the filing of a motion for attorney fees. Then, under the heading asking for leave to file a motion for attorney fees, defendants merely asked the court to disregard their noncompliance pursuant to the authorities we discussed <em>ante </em>which disregarded technical noncompliance if the other party would not be prejudiced. As we have explained, those authorities have been superseded by the expression of legislative intent in amending section 1033.5. Defendants accompanied their motion for relief with a declaration from counsel stating that defendants had argued the merits of the attorney fee claim in their opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to tax costs, and that plaintiffs had not been prejudiced by defendants\u2019 use of the cost bill procedure rather than a noticed motion to claim fees. The declaration then states: \u201cHowever, if this court finds that the plaintiffs have been prejudiced, then defendants request leave to file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to [] \u00a7 473.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Thus, defendants recognized that their reliance on the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d cases was not equivalent to a request for relief under section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">Defendants\u2019 failure to comply with section 473\u2019s requirements was noted in plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the motion for relief. Yet defendants made no effort to correct the deficiencies in their reply papers or at the hearing. Instead, they insisted in their reply papers that the trial court should reach the merits of the attorney fee claim because plaintiffs were not prejudiced by defendants\u2019 noncompliance with the proper procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Thus, defendants failed to make a proper showing for section 473 relief and have failed to show any abuse of discretion in denial of relief. Even if we were to assume the ground for relief was mistake of law, i.e., a mistake as to the procedural requirements for claiming attorney fees, that would not help defendants here. Thus, \u201c[wjhile a mistake in law is a ground for relief under section 473, the \u2018issue of which mistake in law constitutes excusable neglect presents a question of fact. The determining factors are the reasonableness of the misconception and the justifiability of lack of determination of the correct law. []\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[I]gnorance of the law coupled with negligence in ascertaining it will certainly sustain a finding denying relief. []\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 313, 319 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">In any event, defendants do not assert mistake of law or any other statutory ground for relief under section 473. On appeal, they do not defend their motion under the standards of section 473 at all. Instead, they merely assert the trial court had to grant relief because plaintiffs would not be prejudiced by allowing defendants to file an appropriate motion for attorney fees. However, absence of prejudice to the opposing party is not in and of itself sufficient to entitle a party to relief under section 473. Rather, the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1731\">*1731</page-number>is that in the absence of prejudice, the trial court has broad discretion to allow relief on one of the statutory grounds\u2014excusable mistake, inadvertence, neglect, or surprise. (See <em>Ganey </em>v. <em>Doran </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 901, 910 [236 Cal.Rptr. 787.) Here, there was no such showing. Nor was a copy of their proposed motion attached to their request for relief, as section 473 plainly requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">Defendants claim their position is supported by <em>Ganey </em>v. <em>Doran, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d 901. We disagree. There, the plaintiff filed a cost memorandum but failed to serve it on the defendant. Upon discovery of the problem, the plaintiff sought section 473 relief to refile the cost memorandum, on the basis that the failure to serve stemmed from a secretarial oversight. (191 Cal.App.3d at p. 910.) The trial court granted relief. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion. <em>Ganey </em>does not help defendants show why the denial of relief was an abuse of discretion in this case. They point out that in <em>Ganey </em>the plaintiff sought section 1717 attorney fees as an item of the cost memorandum, but the trial court, considering a motion to be required, allowed the plaintiff to submit the separate motion. (191 Cal.App.3d at p. 911.) However, this point was mentioned merely as background to the discussion of the contention on appeal that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees where the plaintiff neither pled nor prayed for attorney fees in his complaint. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, <em>Ganey </em>does not stand for the proposition that the trial court in this case abused its discretion in denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">We conclude defendants fail to show any abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion for relief under section 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">On appeal, defendants also request that this court award them attorney fees for defending this appeal. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">In light of our disposition, we need not address defendants\u2019 request that we decide the applicability of the attorney fees clause upon which they rely as the basis for their attorney fee claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">The judgment is affirmed. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-10\">Sparks, Acting P.

We do not understand Gunlock's point, because section 1033.5 (fn. 13, <em>ante) </em>expressly provides that attorney fees under Civil Code section 1717 are considered fees awarded under contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Indeed, it appears the availability of section 473 relief is the source of the \u201cspirit of the law\u201d cases, which relied upon section 473 cases but dropped section 473\u2019s requirement of a showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Thus, <em>Gunlock, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at page 1304, and <em>California Recreation Industries, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at page 209, both cite <em>Hoover Community Hotel Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Thomson </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 485 [214 Cal.Rptr. 264], <em>Hoover </em>does state the trial court has discretion to disregard noncompliance with the procedural requirements for claiming costs. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 487-488.) However, the authorities relied upon by <em>Hoover </em>were section 473 cases, though <em>Hoover </em>did not acknowledge that fact. (168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 487-488.) Thus, <em>Hoover </em>cited <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Saxe &amp; Yolles Dev. Co. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 374, 380-381 [115 Cal.Rptr. 648, 525 P.2d 88]. Although <em>Pollard </em>did not mention section 473, it is apparent from the opinion that section 473 was at issue, because the Supreme Court stated the parties had moved in the trial court for permission to file a late cost bill on the ground of inadvertence (a statutory ground for relief under section 473), and the Supreme Court concluded the trial court had broad discretion \u201cin allowing relief on grounds of inadvertence . . . .\u201d <em>(Pollard, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 380-381.)
