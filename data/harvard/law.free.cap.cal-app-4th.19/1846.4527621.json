Flavell filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint for declaratory relief against the City of Albany seeking to invalidate Ordinance No. 91-04 which amends the city\u2019s residential off-street parking requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied the petition and granted judgment in favor of the city. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">In 1978, residents of Albany approved \u201cMeasure D,\u201d an initiative amending the city\u2019s zoning ordinance to increase residential off-street parking requirements from one (1) space per unit to two (2) spaces per unit. Measure D provides a limited exception to the requirement. In a section entitled \u201cSpecial Reduction,\u201d it states: \u201cThe Planning Commission may by Conditional Use Permit reduce the parking requirements . . . to no fewer than one and one-half (1-1/2) spaces per unit upon making the finding that existing on-street parking is sufficient to justify a reduction.\u201d The two-for-one requirement was codified as section 20-3.5 c.l of the zoning ordinance; while the Special Reduction exception became former section 20-3.5 d.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">Prior to the passage of Measure D, the zoning ordinance required one parking space per residential unit with one notable exception. This exception, entitled \u201cPlanning Commission,\u201d was contained in former section 20-3.5 d.2 of the ordinance and stated as follows: \u201cThe Planning Commission may waive or reduce the parking requirements contained in paragraph c upon making the finding that space is not available to provide the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1849\">*1849</page-number>parking facilities, except that off-street parking requirements may be reduced but shall not be waived for new structures.\u201d Although Measure D enacted the two-for-one requirement along with the Special Reduction exception, it did not eliminate the Planning Commission exception. The two-for-one requirement and the Special Reduction exception, passed by voters, were simply added to the zoning ordinance alongside the preexisting Planning Commission exception. Both parties are in agreement upon this fact. Noting the variance between the two provisions\u2014one providing for only a very limited reduction, the other providing for a reduction or waiver of parking requirements\u2014the city, after 1978, interpreted them in such a way as to avoid any conflict. Measure D and the Special Reduction exception were applied to all <em>new </em>residential units (i.e., ones constructed following passage of the initiative); and the preexisting Planning Commission exception was applied only in situations not involving new units.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">In 1991, the Albany City Council adopted Ordinance No. 91-04, further amending the parking requirement provisions of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance. In keeping with Measure D, it retains the two-for-one parking requirements for new residential units (still codified as section 20-3.5 c.l). It modifies the Planning Commission exception by providing that for \u201c[mjinor [additions [w]here [n]o [n]ew [d]welling [u]nits [a]re [c]reated\u201d (i.e., the addition of floor space by no more than 10 percent or 120 square feet), no additional parking spaces are required (\u00a7 20-3.5 d.l(a)); and for other \u201cadditions where no new dwelling units are created,\u201d the city planning commission retains authority to waive or reduce the two-for-one requirements, but only upon consideration of certain newly specified circumstances (\u00a7 20-3.5 d.l(b)). The ordinance also restates the Special Reduction exception as follows: \u201cWhere New Dwelling Units Are Created. Special Reduction enacted by Measure D, 1978. The Planning Commission may, by conditional use permit, reduce the parking requirement contained in paragraph c, 1 to no fewer than one and one-half (1-1/2) spaces per dwelling unit upon making the finding that existing on-street parking is sufficient to justify a reduction.\u201d (\u00a7 20-3.5 d.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-7\">In 1990, appellant filed an application with the city for permission to convert a single-family home into a two-family dwelling unit. The application included a request for a waiver of the parking requirements. The application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">In 1991, appellant filed another application regarding another property, a multiunit building. Appellant, again, sought permission to add a new unit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1850\">*1850</page-number>the property including a waiver of parking requirements. He argued that he was entitled to such a waiver under the Planning Commission exception of the zoning ordinance (Ordinance\" No. 91-04 had not been adopted as yet). This application was denied as well. Thereafter, appellant filed an action in superior court contesting the denial of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">In the meantime, the Albany City Council adopted Ordinance No. 91-04 as described above. The record indicates that appellant opposed the new ordinance during the review process. Upon passage of the new law, appellant filed the instant action. His contentions are essentially that the city, in passing the subject ordinance, violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> local planning ordinance procedures; the California Elections Code; and the Albany general plan. Appellant sought a writ of mandate directing the city to rescind the ordinance; a declaration that the ordinance is invalid; and an injunction enjoining the city from approving any permits under the ordinance. The trial court ruled in favor of the city on all issues, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">Appellant maintains that with the passage of Ordinance No. 91-04, the city effectively amended Measure D without the authority to do so, a violation of the California Elections Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-7\">The issue is one of construction. Appellant argues that voters intended Measure D\u2019s two-for-one parking spaces requirement, along with the one and one-half parking spaces Special Reduction exception, to apply to all residential units, both new and existing ones. He contends that Ordinance No. 91-04 amends Measure D in two respects: First, by providing that the Special Reduction exception applies only \u201c[wjhere [njew [djwelling [ujnits [ajre [cjreated\u201d (\u00a7 20-3.5 d.l(c)), and second, by enacting a new exception which permits a waiver or reduction of required parking spaces for \u201c[ajdditions [wjhere [njo [njew [djwelling [ujnits [ajre [cjreated,\u201d upon consideration of certain newly specified circumstances (\u00a7 20-3.5 d.l(b)). The city, meanwhile, argues that voters intended Measure D to apply only to new residential units. The trial court agreed with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-8\">As can be seen, appellant\u2019s argument stands or falls on his interpretation of Measure D. As the issue involves purely a question of law, we are not</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1851\">*1851</page-number>bound by the trial court\u2019s finding.  In interpreting the voter initiative, we are mindful that \u201c[t]he construction of a municipal initiative or ordinance is governed by the same rules as the construction of statutes. [Citations.]\u201d (C-Y <em>Development Co. </em>v. <em>City of Redlands </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 926, 929 [187 Cal.Rptr. 370].) The cardinal rule in this respect is that \u201c. . . a statute must be read and considered as a whole in order that the true legislative intention may be determined. The various parts of a statute must be construed together, and harmonized, so far as it is possible to do without doing violence to the language or to the spirit and purpose of the act, so that the statute may stand in its entirety. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Candlestick Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Francisco Bay Conservation etc. Com. </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 557, 569 [89 Cal.Rptr. 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">Moreover, \u201c[t]he contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by an administrative agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rivera </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 132, 140 [98 Cal.Rptr. 281, 490 P.2d 793].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, it seems clear that the city\u2019s interpretation of Measure D is the correct one\u2014that is, Measure D applies to new residential units only. First of all, when considering the two-for-one requirement in the context of the initiative as a whole, it is apparent that this, along with other features of Measure D, is aimed strictly at new residential development. According to the record, the stated objective of the proponents of Measure D was to curb the development of multiunit residences in favor of single-family homes in order to \u201crestore a reasonable balance between single and multipleunit homes\u201d in the City of Albany and \u201cto halt the steady increase in congestion on . . . city streets.\u201d The initiative seeks to do this by (1) conditioning the approval of a proposed multiunit development on the consent of a majority of the residents living within 300 feet of the proposed development; (2) the stricter 2-for-l parking requirements; and (3) limiting housing density on the east side of Albany Hill to 18 units per acre as opposed to the existing 35-unit-per-acre standard. These elements of Measure D are prospective in nature and relate to future development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">Second, the city\u2019s interpretation serves to harmonize Measure D with other parts of its zoning laws, in particular what we have referred to as the Planning Commission exception to the city\u2019s parking requirements. Under the city\u2019s interpretation, the planning commission retains its pre-Measure D authority to waive or reduce parking requirements in the case of housing additions which do not, in and of themselves, constitute new residential units. The city has harmonized Measure D with existing law in this way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1852\">*1852</page-number>since the passage of the initiative in 1978. Under the legal principles outlined above, the city\u2019s practice in this regard is entitled to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">Having found appellant\u2019s interpretation of Measure D erroneous, it follows that his allegations regarding Ordinance No. 91-04 are flawed as well. We find the addition of the phrase, \u201c[w]here [n]ew [d]welling [u]nits [a]re [cjreated,\u201d to the Special Reduction exception under the ordinance, to be in accordance with the voters\u2019 mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">Appellant next challenges Ordinance No. 91-04 as it relates to the city\u2019s general plan.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He urges that the housing element of the general plan is legally inadequate, thus rendering the general plan and the ordinance themselves invalid. The alleged inadequacy of the housing element stems from the fact that (1) it has not been revised since its adoption on January 7, 1985, whereas Government Code<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> section 65588 requires such elements to be revised not less than every five years; and (2) it does not contain a five-year schedule of actions to implement goals as required by section 65583, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument as he has failed to establish a \u201cnexus\u201d between the claimed deficiency in the plan and the subject ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-8\">In <em>Garat </em>v. <em>City of Riverside </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 259 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 504], plaintiffs attacked the City of Riverside\u2019s general plan in an attempt to invalidate a city land-use ordinance which had the effect of protecting certain lands reclassified as residential/agricultural from \u201cpremature\u201d development. In their lawsuit, plaintiffs alleged that the plan was legally inadequate in that: the land-use element did not include standards of building intensity recommended for nonresidential categories of land use; the housing element failed to include quantified objectives for the provision of housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1853\">*1853</page-number>for all income levels; the noise element did not provide noise contours for local industrial plants or state policies to minimize the exposure of residents to excessive noise; the circulation element was not reflective of the changes in land use since 1981; and, finally, there were inconsistencies within and between the various elements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">The Garat court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 challenge on the grounds that they had failed to establish a nexus between the claimed legal inadequacies of the land use, housing, circulation and noise elements of Riverside\u2019s general plan and the policies and geographical areas implicated by the adoption of the new ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">Applying <em>Garat </em>to the case at bench, we find appellant\u2019s assault fatally deficient as well in that he has failed to establish <em>any </em>nexus between the claimed legal inadequacies in the general plan (i.e., lack of revision of the housing element within a five-year period and lack of a five-year schedule of actions) and Ordinance No. 91-04. As can be seen, appellant\u2019s attack concerns certain time-related inadequacies rather than actual substantive inadequacies. In order to invalidate Ordinance No. 91-04 on this basis, however, appellant must do more than simply point out these inadequacies. He must, in addition to this, establish (1) that these omissions have resulted in certain consequences, and (2) how the ordinance is affected by these consequences. In our case, appellant has made no showing as to how the inadequacy of failing to timely revise the element would have any bearing or effect on the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">White, P.
