J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acp1\">Plaintiffs County of San Diego et al. (San Diego plaintiffs) and plaintiff interveners appeal the portion of a judgment after court trial finding no constitutional violation in the allocation among counties of mental health funds under the Short-Doyle Act (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> former \u00a7 5600 et seq.) by the state\u2019s Department of Mental Health (Department). We affirm the portion of the judgment determining the funding allocations were constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Defendants Kathleen Brown et al. (the state defendants) and defendant interveners appeal the portions of the judgment declaring unconstitutional the Department\u2019s allocation of state hospital beds among counties, ordering the Department to reallocate beds, granting injunctive relief against defendants and awarding plaintiff counties damages as compensation for charges for past bed overuse. The state defendants also challenge the court\u2019s findings they violated former section 5600 and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.). We reverse the portions of the judgment declaring the bed allocations unconstitutional, ordering bed reallocation, enjoining defendants and awarding damages. We reverse the portions of the judgment involving claims of violations of former section 5600 and the APA with directions to the superior court to dismiss those claims as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Plaintiffs County of Fresno et al. (Fresno plaintiffs) appeal the portion of the judgment denying their claim against the Department under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (FRA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) for reimbursement of funds expended by Fresno in treating its Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) conservatee Robert S. We affirm that portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The Department\u2019s Director Stephen W. Mayberg (Director) petitions for extraordinary relief directing the superior court to stay an order of contempt and to take no action to enforce those portions of the judgment requiring the Department to provide state hospital beds to counties without reimbursement. We grant the petition and direct the superior court to dismiss the contempt proceedings as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Allocation of Mental Health Funding and State Hospital Beds</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">This litigation primarily involves a constitutional challenge by various plaintiffs including several counties to the Department\u2019s allocation of mental health resources within California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claimed the inequitable distribution of such resources, specifically allocations to the counties of funds and state hospital beds, was without rational basis and thus unconstitutional under the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state Constitutions. Plaintiffs also claimed the state defendants violated former section 5600, the APA and the FRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">After trial the superior court concluded the state defendants violated former section 5600 and the APA. The court also concluded the Department\u2019s state hospital bed allocations and charges to the counties for bed overuse violated federal and state due process and equal protection guarantees. The court awarded plaintiff counties damages for the bed overuse charges. The court concluded there was currently no constitutional violation in the Department\u2019s allocation of Short-Doyle Act funds to the counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"A0x\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">\n<em>Funding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">In 1957 the Legislature enacted the Short-Doyle Act (Stats. 1957, ch. 1989, p. 3535) to provide counties with state funds for local mental health programs. The purpose of the Short-Doyle Act was to encourage community and state participation in mental health care by providing a means to share funding of community programs. Funding under the Short-Doyle Act was originally set by the level a county chose to fund its mental health program.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>Counties funding their programs at higher levels received more state funds, resulting in some counties developing larger programs, providing more services and receiving additional state funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">From 1957 until 1969 county participation in the Short-Doyle program was voluntary. In 1969 participation became mandatory for counties with populations over 100,000. In 1973 the program became mandatory for all counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Since the beginning of the Short-Doyle program San Mateo has participated. In fiscal year 1958-1959 San Francisco, Contra Costa and Alameda began participating. During the next three years Los Angeles, Solano and Mendocino entered the program. Entering the program in fiscal year 1962-1963 was San Diego, the first plaintiff county to use Short-Doyle funds. Over the next 11 years the other plaintiff counties joined the program. In each year until fiscal year 1973-1974 plaintiff counties\u2019 average aid per capita was lower than defendant counties\u2019 average aid per capita. Thus, plaintiff counties generally entered the Short-Doyle program later and did not participate to the same extent as defendant counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Originally Short-Doyle was a dollar-for-dollar state-to-local matching fund program. In 1962 the funding ratio changed, with the state providing 75 percent of the funds and the counties 25 percent. In 1969 the matching fund ratio changed to 90 percent state and 10 percent county.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In the 1960\u2019s there was enough state money to go around to the counties. Defendant counties as a group took greater advantage of available state funds by posting greater local matching funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fiscal year 1962-1963 San Diego\u2019s level of local payment was $136,848 and San Francisco\u2019s $784,816. In fiscal year 1964-1965 San Diego\u2019s level of local payment was $678,680 and San Francisco\u2019s $1,707,921.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">During the 1960\u2019s federal funding was also available as construction and staffing grants. San Francisco and Los Angeles took advantage of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>grants to build mental health programs. San Diego, Fresno and other \u201cunder-equity\u201d counties often did not apply for federal funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When federal funding ceased, the state sometimes replaced the lost federal funds. Those state funds became part of a participating county\u2019s larger base allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Short-Doyle funds were allocated based on the \u201ccounty plan\u201d each participating county was required to submit each year. The county plan specified how the county would spend its money and indicated community need. Through the mid-1970\u2019s a county through its plan could submit requests for new and expanded programs based on community needs. Base funding was carried forward each year. As permitted, many counties asked the state for additional money to expand their programs. That new money became part of the base allocations to be carried forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">After voters passed Proposition 13 in 1978, state funds for mental health began to shrink, base allocations essentially remained static, and funding equity among counties became an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In 1981 the Equity Funding Task Force issued a report to the California Conference of Local Mental Health Directors. Acknowledging the existence of funding inequities created by historical Short-Doyle funding, the report recommended distributing funds according to relative need based on a poverty-population formula. The report characterized the poverty-population method as an interim measure for use to move toward equity while studies sought an appropriate affirmative approach. In about 1982, after study, the Department began using a poverty-population model.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The 1983 Budget Act required the Department to submit to the Legislature \u201can equitable needs formula proposal for the allocation of mental health funds.\u201d In April 1984 in response the Department issued a summary of the Equitable Mental Health Allocation Project. The summary recommended using a poverty-population model. The summary also recommended the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>use new money exceeding the base to achieve funding equity but not reallocate each county\u2019s historical resource base. The report noted further study was needed and indicated the poverty-population method was an interim measure for use until \u201cbetter service delivery data\u201d became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">After introduction and withdrawal of legislation to allocate mental health resources on a per capita basis, the Legislature in 1985 passed Senate Bill .No. 786 (the Seymour amendment). Senate Bill No. 786 amended former section 5600 to require new funds above the current base be allocated among counties based on the poverty-population formula. The legislation also prohibited reduction of the counties\u2019 base allocations to achieve equity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">From 1981 to 1991 the counties\u2019 respective equity positions remained essentially constant. The relatively small amounts of new money allocated to under-equity counties did not have lasting effect on equity due in part to those counties\u2019 faster rates of population growth. Under-equity counties remained under-equity. Over-equity counties retained their over-equity positions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">\n<em>State Hospital Beds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Until 1972 the Department did not charge counties for their patients\u2019 use of state mental hospital beds. In fiscal year 1972-1973 the Department began charging counties a 15 percent match for using the previously free state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>hospital beds. A county could buy state hospital services with funds allocated for local programs. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 5708, 5714.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, a link was established between local funding and state hospital beds, with local dollars becoming convertible into beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The state began shifting its resources into community funding and gradually reduced the number of state hospital beds. Additional funding for state hospital beds generally went to improving the standard of care for patients at the facilities instead of increasing the number of beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Until fiscal year 1980-1981 state hospital beds were allocated based upon each county\u2019s actual usage, that is, supply matched demand with demand being constrained, as in the case of Short-Doyle funds, by the requirement of a local match.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">For fiscal year 1980-1981 the Legislature in the Supplemental Budget Act set state hospital bed allocations to the counties based upon historical usage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Except for minor modifications and changes required by injunctions in this case, state hospital bed allocations remained constant after the 1981 freeze. Through the 1980 Supplemental Budget Act the Legislature established a buy-out and bed reduction program which increased funding for local community programs in return for counties reducing their use of state hospital beds. (Stats. 1980, ch. 510, item 302(f), p. 1166.) Under that program San Diego received increased funding for local mental health programs in exchange for giving up about half its historical allocation of state hospital beds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, another link was established between local funding and state hospital beds, with beds becoming convertible into local dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Concluding the Legislature had established a bed allocation to counties that was not to be changed except for the buy-out provision, the Department in 1981 froze state hospital bed allocations based upon historical usage. The Department also interpreted the Seymour amendment\u2019s language prohibiting decreasing a county\u2019s allocation for equity purposes as a legislative directive the Department could not lower a county\u2019s bed allocation. When a county overused its allocation of state hospital beds, corresponding portions of the funds appropriated annually for local assistance were transferred to the appropriation for support of state hospitals. Between 1986 and 1988 about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>$2 million for bed overuse was withheld from San Diego\u2019s funding allocations. The Department denied San Diego\u2019s requests for relief from the assertedly inequitable allocation of mental health resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">From 1981 to 1991 state hospital bed allocations remained basically constant. The number of state hospital beds available to counties essentially froze at 1981 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\n<em>\u201cRealignment\u201d Legislation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">After trial and before entry of judgment the Legislature enacted the Bronzan-McCorquodale Act, revising the method of funding for county mental health services and discontinuing Department allocation of community mental health funds and state hospital beds. (\u00a7\u00a7 4330 et seq., 17600 et seq.; Stats. 1991, chs. 89 &amp; 611.) Under such \u201crealignment legislation\u201d counties received funds from the state and could decide to use that money to fund local programs or to pay the Department for state hospital beds. Under realignment counties could purchase at full price as many state hospital beds as they deemed necessary and were willing to buy. No fixed number of beds was allocated to any county. Realignment also allocated portions of expected tax revenue growth for equity purposes. San Diego, Orange and Santa Clara received additional adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Later, in July 1993, the Governor signed into law as an emergency statute Senate Bill No. 463 amending various aspects of realignment including base funding, transfers among accounts and distribution of growth accounts. (Stats. 1993, ch. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"ALC\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">\n<em>Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">In July 1986 San Diego plaintiffs\u2014including the County of San Diego, four members of its board of supervisors, and its public conservator for three conservatees\u2014filed a class action complaint in San Diego County Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Court case No. 568230 for declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of California and various state officials, including the Director.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Asserting denial of federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process, San Diego plaintiffs alleged the state defendants distributed funds and allocated state hospital beds in a manner depriving San Diego of its fair share. Plaintiffs characterized the allocations as based not on need but instead on perpetuating past years\u2019 allocations. Plaintiffs also asserted the state defendants did not distribute the funds as required by former section 5600 and the FRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In March 1988 the court granted San Diego plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction against the state defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In June 1989 the court consolidated for all purposes case No. 568230 with other pending lawsuits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court also permitted various counties to intervene as plaintiffs or defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In October 1989 another preliminary injunction was granted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>In December 1989 the court modified its October 1989 preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court ordered the injunction to have statewide effect. The court also reaffirmed its March 1988 preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">In July 1990 the court determined all plaintiffs had standing and permitted plaintiff interveners to join as parties individual members of their Boards of Supervisors as county officials and as taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Coming for trial were plaintiffs\u2019 claims the Department\u2019s allocations of mental health funding and state hospital beds violated equal protection and due process as arbitrary, capricious and lacking in standards; and the state defendants violated former section 5600, the APA and the FRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The court held separate phases of trial on various issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">\n<em>Phase One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">From September 18, 1990, through November 1, 1990, the court tried issues involving various alleged statutory violations by state defendants. After the first phase of trial, the court issued a decision and order on statutory violations dated January 10, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The court concluded the Department did not comply with two reporting requirements of former section 5600 and ordered the Department to comply with those statutory requirements. The court also concluded the Department violated former section 5600 by not properly allocating new moneys to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>under-equity counties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court ordered the Department to adopt an allocation scheme consistent with its opinion and also ordered all future allocations of available funds beyond the current base be done in a manner ensuring reasonable progress toward equity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The court concluded the Department violated the APA by not promulgating regulations about funding, allocation of state hospital beds and collection of assessments for bed overuse. The court ordered the Department to adopt the requisite regulations.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">\n<em>Phase Two</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">From January 28, 1991 through February 21, 1991, the court tried constitutional issues. Plaintiffs asserted the disparities among counties in the Department\u2019s allocations of mental health funding and state hospital beds were unconstitutional under equal protection and due process theories as lacking any rational basis. Defendants denied any constitutional violation, asserting the disparities were not great and any such disparities were rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of ensuring the continuity and stability of local programs. The parties stipulated the court could apply the rational basis test to plaintiffs\u2019 claims.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">After trial the court found no current constitutional violation in \u201cmaintaining the discrimination in mental health funding allocations.\u201d With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim, the court concluded preserving the stability of treatment of existing patients and avoiding harm to the infrastructure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>of over-equity counties\u2019 programs were legitimate governmental concerns that were \u201crationally related to the legislative goal of maintaining a base funding level while attempting to cure the discrimination with new funds over time.\u201d The court also concluded the mental health funding allocations did not violate federal or state constitutional guarantees of procedural or substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The court found the Department\u2019s allocation of state hospital beds among counties violated federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection. The court concluded the \u201cgross inequities\u201d in state hospital bed allocations were \u201cnot explained by any legislative purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court also found state hospital bed allocations violated federal and state substantive due process guarantees. The court stated \u201cthe present system of bed allocation is not rationally related to a legitimate goal of government.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To achieve an equitable distribution correcting the constitutional violations found by the court, the Department was ordered to \u201creallocate bed days among the counties according to each county\u2019s poverty-population index within three years unless the state devises a constitutional alternative and presents it to the court for approval by June of 1992.\u201d The court also determined plaintiff counties were entitled to money damages as compensation for past bed overuse charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The court made permanent the existing injunctions in the case. The court also ordered: \u201cNo county shall be charged or assessed for over-utilizing its allocation of state hospital beds so long as the county does not utilize more beds than the county would have been allocated had its bed allocation been based on its poverty population percentage for the year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The court found no violation of the FRA in the allocation of Short-Doyle funding or state hospital beds.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>On August 8, 1991, the court entered judgment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> appealed.

However, we conclude the superior court properly determined the funding allocations were rationally based and did not violate any constitutional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">Preliminary, we note defendants challenge plaintiffs\u2019 standing to raise this constitutional attack on the mental health resources allocation system. Defendants contend the court erred in permitting plaintiff counties and members of their boards of supervisors to bring these lawsuits on their own behalf or as representatives of their residents. However, we do not decide the issue of standing. Even if we concluded plaintiffs had standing, we would affirm the portions of the judgment based on the court\u2019s finding the funding allocations were constitutional. We would also reverse those portions of the judgment based on the court\u2019s finding the state hospital bed allocations were unconstitutional. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">This litigation does not involve an abstract problem of bookkeeping. Instead, the Legislature faced an historically developed concrete situation involving ill human beings which was not amenable to a perfect solution. As a result of historical choices by various county governments when funds were plentiful, an infrastructure was created of local community health programs providing ongoing care relied upon by many people. When funds dried up, the Legislature was confronted with the problems of providing care for all needy ill people and equalizing funding to counties. However, full attainment of both those goals could not be achieved simultaneously because of the inadequacy of available funds. The Legislature thus confronted the stark choice of continuing ongoing care for real people or distributing the shortfall among all counties. It was not irrational for the Legislature to decline to equalize allocations immediately in an abstract manner which could damage many programs and hurt many ill people. Instead, the Legislature acted rationally in moving toward equity over time by allocating new moneys when available while preserving existing programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">\n<em>Funding Allocations Were Constitutional</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">In concluding disparities in funding allocations were not unconstitutional, the superior court found maintaining a base funding level while attempting to cure the discrimination with new funds was rationally related to the legitimate governmental concerns of maintaining the stability of treatment of existing patients and avoiding harm to the infrastructure of over-equity counties\u2019 programs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>\n                   Plaintiffs contend the court erred in not declaring the discriminatory funding allocations unconstitutional as based on prior years\u2019 allocations and not rationally related to counties\u2019 differing needs or any other legitimate state purpose. Plaintiffs contend the stated governmental purposes here\u2014stabilizing existing patient care and preserving county program infrastructures\u2014failed to pass scrutiny as \u201crealistic.\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Merlo </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 855, 865, fn. 7 [106 Cal.Rptr. 388, 506 P.2d 212, 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>A.L.RJd 505].)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Instead, according to plaintiffs, that stated rationale was simply an excuse to maintain a discriminatory system favoring politically powerful counties. Characterizing stabilization of over-equity counties\u2019 programs as creating \u201can irrational and permanent advantage\u201d at the expense of under-equity counties\u2019 residents including the mentally ill, plaintiffs contend the evidence of \u201cenormous\u201d monetary discrimination against under-equity counties demonstrated the \u201ctotally arbitrary nature of the mental health resource allocation system, and its discriminatory impacts on both plaintiff counties and their residents.\u201d Asserting equal protection requires elimination of irrational discrimination within a reasonable time <em>(Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal </em>v. <em>Webster County </em>(1989) 488 U.S. 336, 343-344 [102 L.Ed. 688, 696-698, 109 S.Ct. 633]), plaintiffs contend the evidence demonstrated despite years of inequity the state defendants did not develop any plan likely to achieve equitable distribution within a reasonable time without judicial intervention. Plaintiffs also assert legislative changes since the early 1970\u2019s have perpetuated instead of cured the discriminatory funding allocations.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiffs claim they proved without refutation by defendants that the discriminatory funding allocations were irrational, arbitrary, and not rationally related to any legitimate state concern.

This record amply supported the superior court\u2019s finding the \u201cdiscrimination\u201d resulting from maintaining counties\u2019 base funding levels while attempting to cure the disparities with new funds over time was rationally related to the legitimate governmental concerns of preserving the stability of treatment of existing patients and not harming the infrastructure of county mental health programs.

When funds were plentiful, some counties took advantage of the opportunity to develop local mental health systems. The court properly found the state had a legitimate \u201cstability\u201d interest in avoiding destruction of that local community health base already built. When funding declined, the Legislature acknowledged the equity problem and sought solutions including the Seymour amendment which required allocations among counties based on the poverty-population formula of new funds above the current base.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The evidence demonstrated a rational basis for protecting base allocations to counties. As the court properly found, stability of programs was necessary to provide patients with a continuum of care.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A stable continuum of care was crucial to mentally ill patients and their families. Reduction in base funding would adversely impact the continuum of care. Loss of an outpatient clinic resource could result in placing a patient in a hospital. Further, reallocating base funding would cause lost economic efficiency and value. In 1984 the Equitable Mental Health Allocation Project specifically recommended maintaining base allocations because not doing so would be \u201cinefficient and impractical.\u201d In sum, maintaining base allocations was essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>for administering mental health programs and ensuring the necessary continuum of care for patients.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The allocation of funding was not irrational simply because absolute equity had not been attained by the time of trial. The state defendants made reasonable adjustments to the mental health funding scheme over time to begin to eliminate unreasonable disparities. Various studies recommended changes the Department adopted and implemented. The state instituted an allocation policy to change the system so that relative resource allocations would approach relative needs without dismantling existing programs. The Legislature codified such approach in the Seymour amendment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs\u2019 expert, use of the poverty-population formula over the past six years furthered the goal of equity in allocating state mental health funds. Other evidence indicated applying the poverty-population formula in fiscal year 1990-1991 reasonably assured progress toward equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Further, the unequal funding allocations were rationally related to the legitimate governmental concerns of stability of patient care and preservation of existing local program infrastructure. As the superior court properly found, the unequal distribution of state funding resulted from the counties\u2019 historical choices about participating in the Short-Doyle incentive matching grant program. Participation in the program was voluntary until 1973. In the 1960\u2019s money was available to all counties but San Diego declined because it did not want to spend its revenue on the 25 percent matching requirement. Plaintiff counties entered the program later and did not participate to the same extent as defendant intervener counties. Unlike plaintiff counties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>defendant intervener counties consistently overmatched funds. Defendant intervener counties also took greater advantage of available federal funds. During the 1970\u2019s many counties asked for and received from the state more money to expand their programs and such new money became part of the base allocations to be carried forward. Indeed, plaintiffs acknowledge the disparate funding allocations favored \u201ccounties which entered the Short-Doyle system earlier and to a greater extent than other counties in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In sum, the disparities in funding allocations resulted from various counties historically making consistent commitments to developing local mental health programs when ample funding was available and other counties declining to do so. Plaintiffs effectively seek to deprive defendant interveners of the results of their choices made long ago. By the late 1980\u2019s all counties experienced inadequate funding and had unmet needs. The trial court\u2019s determination allowed for maintenance of investments counties had chosen to make over several decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the superior court properly found the stability of patient care and program infrastructure was a legitimate governmental concern and the method used to allocate funding including maintaining base allocations was rationally related to providing such stability. Based upon those findings, the court correctly determined the unequal funding allocations did not violate equal protection guarantees. (Cf. <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra,_U.S. at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 13-14, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2333]; <em>City of Rancho Cucamonga </em>v. <em>Mackzum </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 929 [279 Cal.Rptr. 220].)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Similarly, the court correctly concluded the funding allocations did not violate due process. Noting plaintiffs admitted their citizens did not have property rights to mental health treatment and plaintiffs did not introduce any evidence otherwise indicating they had the requisite property interest to invoke procedural due process guarantees, the court found no procedural due process violation. The court also properly found no substantive due process violation. \u201cSubstantive due process essentially requires protection from arbitrary legislative action. Under this principle, a deprivation of property is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>justified \u2018only if the conduct from which the deprivation flows is prescribed by reasonable legislation reasonably applied, i.e., the law must not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious but must have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 597, 617, fn. 14 [194 Cal.Rptr. 294].) Even assuming deprivation of property occurred here, the classification bore a rational relation to a constitutionally permissible objective. <em>(McCourtney </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">At most plaintiffs simply showed the existence of unequal funding among counties on a per capita basis. Plaintiffs did not demonstrate such inequality violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection or due process. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court\u2019s finding the allocation of mental health funding under former section 5600 was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>Defendants\u2019 Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\n<em>State Hospital Beds and Overuse Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">\n<em>Superior Court Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The superior court found the allocation of state hospital beds violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection and substantive due process. The court issued injunctive relief including ordering reallocation of state hospital beds among counties according to each county\u2019s poverty-population index within three years unless the state defendants presented an alternative plan to the court for approval. The court also found plaintiff counties were entitled to damages from the state defendants for bed overuse charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">In declaring the bed allocations unconstitutional, the court found the \u201cgross inequities\u201d were \u201cnot explained by any legislative purpose.\u201d The court stated \u201cfreezing state hospital bed allocations over a ten year period is not rationally related to protecting patients from harm.\u201d The court also found \u201cbeds are not so integrated in the counties\u2019 mental health system that they cannot be separated from funding. Defendants have shown nothing more than a theoretical connection between the bed allocations and their Short-Doyle funds.\u201d The court interpreted former section 5600\u2019s language \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>county allocation may be decreased\u201d as not prohibiting reallocation of beds.

Defendants then contend the court erred in declaring the bed allocations unconstitutional and ordering reallocation. Defendants also contend the court erred in awarding plaintiff counties damages for bed overuse charges. Additionally, defendants contend we should reverse the superior court\u2019s findings involving plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims and direct the court to dismiss those claims as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">\n<em>Beds Were Part of Base Allocations Under Former Section 5600</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">The superior court essentially concluded former section 5600 did not either require or prohibit reallocation of hospital beds among counties.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Instead, the court interpreted the statute as not including beds as part of a county\u2019s mental health resource base allocation. Thus, the court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 assertion the equity and relative-need language in former section 5600 required reallocation of state hospital beds among counties. Accordingly, the court found the failure to reallocate beds on the basis of need did not violate the statute. The court also rejected defendants,\u2019 assertion the statutory language \u201cno county allocation may be decreased\u201d for equity purposes prevented any reallocation of beds. Thus, the court concluded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>Department was free to reallocate beds without violating former section 5600. Such conclusion permitted the court to characterize its reallocation order as not inconsistent with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Defendants contend the court erroneously interpreted former section 5600 as excluding state hospital beds from the counties\u2019 base allocations of mental health resources and thus did not realize its reallocation order was inconsistent with the statute. According to defendants, counties\u2019 bed allocations were protected by former section 5600\u2019s language prohibiting decreasing any county\u2019s base allocation to achieve equity. We agree with defendants. The court erred in concluding the statutory prohibition against decreasing a county\u2019s allocation applied only to funds and not to beds. Under former section 5600, state hospital beds also constituted an allocation not subject to decrease for equity purposes. We base our conclusion on (1) the Department\u2019s consistent administrative interpretation known to the Legislature that the statute precluded decreasing a county\u2019s bed allocation for equity purposes; (2) the Legislature\u2019s independent recognition in budgetary legislation that bed allocations were to remain static\u2014indicating it would be inconsistent for the Department to act otherwise; and (3) the historical linkage between allocations of state hospital beds and funding for local mental health programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The record contained ample evidence the Department considered state hospital bed allocations to be included under former section 5600\u2019s prohibition against decreasing any county\u2019s \u201callocation\u201d for purposes of achieving equity. Evidence also indicated such statutory provision was designed to prevent dismantling of programs and reallocation of base resources to achieve equity. The Department adopted the recommendation of the Equitable Mental Health Allocation Project report in 1984 that state hospital bed allocations should be included in a county\u2019s mental health resource base. Beginning in 1984 the Department included the value of beds in the resource base, thus impacting allocations of local assistance augmentations. The Department also interpreted the Seymour amendment\u2019s language prohibiting decreasing a county\u2019s allocation for equity purposes as a legislative directive the Department could not lower a county\u2019s bed allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In sum, after the Seymour amendment the consistent administrative interpretation of former section 5600 was not to decrease a county\u2019s state hospital bed allocation for purposes of equity. Although presumed to be aware of such administrative interpretation, the Legislature did not amend former section 5600 to permit decreasing bed allocations for equity purposes. Courts generally defer to administrative interpretation of statutes, particularly where, as here, the Legislature has acquiesced in such interpretation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number><em>(Thornton </em>v. <em>Carlson </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1249, 1256-1257 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 375],)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Thus, the superior court should have interpreted former section 5600 as preventing decreasing counties\u2019 bed allocations for equity purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Further, the superior court\u2019s interpreting former section 5600 as excluding state hospital beds from counties\u2019 base allocations was inconsistent with the Short-Doyle program\u2019s historical fiscal fungibility between funds and beds. In fiscal year 1972-1973 the Department began charging counties a 15 percent match for using previously free state hospital beds. A county could buy state hospital services with funds allocated for local programs. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 5708, 5714.) Thus, when the state first began requiring the counties to make co-payments for beds a link was established between local funding and beds, with local program funds becoming convertible into beds. As resources became increasingly scarce, the state chose to allocate both beds and local program dollars with continued fungibility. In the 1980 Supplemental Budget Act the Legislature set state hospital bed allocations to the counties based upon historical usage and established a buy-out and bed reduction program which increased funding for local community programs in return for counties reducing their use of state hospital beds. (Stats. 1980, ch. 510, item 302(f), p. 1166.)<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Another link was thus established between local funding and state hospital beds, with beds becoming convertible into local dollars. Manifestly, the superior court\u2019s interpretation of former section 5600 as excluding beds from counties\u2019 base allocations was unreasonable in light of the historical linkage between local program funds and state hospital beds.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">As noted, the trial court found legitimate governmental purposes\u2014stability of patient care and preservation of county program infrastructure\u2014were rationally related to former section 5600\u2019s protection of counties\u2019 base allocations with respect to funding for local programs. A proper interpretation of former section 5600 as including beds within counties\u2019 base allocations would have facilitated the court\u2019s concluding the bed allocation system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>was also rationally related to those same legitimate governmental purposes. Indeed, plaintiffs acknowledge \u201cin considering the unconstitutionality of the system, there was no legal or factual basis for the trial court to carve out a distinction between beds and program funds.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>State Hospital Bed Allocations Were Constitutional</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">(4) Seeking reversal of the portions of the judgment declaring state hospital bed allocations unconstitutional and mandating reallocation of beds, defendants contend maintaining counties\u2019 bed allocations while moving toward equity with available new moneys did not violate any equal protection or substantive due process right of the counties. Instead, according to defendants, the bed allocations satisfied the rational basis test under both equal protection and due process principles. <em>(Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra,_ U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 17-18, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2336]; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Department of Personnel Administration </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 1102, 1125 [278 Cal.Rptr. 346, 805 P.2d 300]; <em>Fein </em>v. <em>Permanente Medical Group </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 137, 163-164 [211 Cal.Rptr. 368, 695 P.2d 665]; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Bray </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 841, 847-848 [148 Cal.Rptr. 148, 582 P.2d 604].)<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>\u201cWhen social or economic regulations are involved, the rational-basis test applies.

Under the rational basis test, plaintiffs had the \u201c \u2018heavy burden\u2019 \u201d to demonstrate the state\u2019s protection of counties\u2019 historical bed allocations was without reasonable basis. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 463 [101 L.Ed.2d at p. 413].) Plaintiffs did not meet that burden. The record compelled a conclusion legitimate governmental interests justified preserving counties\u2019 bed allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">As discussed above, the superior court properly concluded the legislative goal of maintaining a base funding level preserving existing services while attempting to achieve equity with new moneys over time was constitutional as rationally related to the legitimate governmental interests of maintaining the stability of existing patient care and the infrastructure of local programs. Defendants accurately assert the court should have found the same governmental interests also justified maintaining historical bed allocations. When confronted with the choice of continuing ongoing care for real people or distributing the shortfall among all counties, it was not irrational for the Legislature to decline to equalize bed allocations immediately in an abstract mathematical manner which could damage local program infrastructure and hurt many ill people. Instead, the Legislature acted rationally in moving toward equity over time by allocating new moneys when available while preserving historical bed allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The superior court\u2019s erroneous conclusion the bed allocations were unconstitutional stemmed primarily from two mistaken findings. First, failing to acknowledge the import of the historical reciprocal fiscal relationship between beds and local funding, the court found bed allocations could be analyzed separately from funding allocations.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Second, based on a tenuous factual finding most state hospital patients were transient, the court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>understated the effect of bed reallocation on the treatment of existing patients.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">(D</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\n<em>Bed Allocations Were an Integral Part of County Mental Health Systems</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The superior court erred in finding state hospital beds were not so integrated in counties\u2019 mental health systems that they could not be separated from funding. The record compelled a conclusion bed allocations have historically been an integral part of local mental health systems. Further, maintaining such historical bed allocations was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interests of preserving the stability of existing patient care and local program infrastructure.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">As discussed at length, the Department properly allocated hospital beds in accord with former section 5600\u2019s requirement a county\u2019s base allocation including beds could not be decreased for equity purposes. Further, former section 5600 reflected the Short-Doyle program\u2019s historical fiscal fungibility between funds and beds. When the state first began requiring the counties to make copayments for beds a link was established between local funding and beds, with local program funds becoming convertible into beds. (Former \u00a7\u00a7 5708, 5714.) As resources diminished, the state chose to allocate both beds and local program dollars with continued fungibility. Beds became convertible into local dollars when the 1980 budget legislation set state hospital bed allocations to the counties based on historical usage and established a buy-out and bed reduction program which increased funding for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>local community programs in return for counties reducing their use of state hospital beds. (Stats. 1980, ch. 510, item 302(f).) In enacting the Seymour amendment, the Legislature directed the counties\u2019 base allocations including beds not be reduced. Although the superior court might not unreasonably discern a legislative intent ultimately to reduce local dependence on state hospital beds, for purposes of constitutional analysis the legislatively established historical reciprocal relationship between local funding and beds in practice inextricably linked those two components of the mental health resources allocation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Ample evidence indicated state hospital beds were an integral part of counties\u2019 programs and decreasing those bed allocations were \u201cjust as damaging as a decrease in the community budget, because each county builds its program around the resources it has.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Community programs were built around the concept of having access to a certain level of state hospital beds.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Local programs were based on the number of patients who could be treated in the community and those who required treatment in a state hospital. Counties geographically closer to state hospitals also tended to use those hospitals as more integral parts of their local programs for acute patients, in part because patients discharged from hospitals tended to remain in nearby communities. Some counties farther from state hospitals built acute mental health facilities to complement local care.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In sum, historical state hospital bed usage differed among counties according to how those beds fit into the structure of each county\u2019s overall local mental health program.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Further, in light of the fungibility of state hospital beds and funding, differing historical bed allocation levels arose also from various counties choosing to invest more local matching funds in mental health services than did other counties. Counties\u2019 bed allocations developed based on their actual usage. Beginning in 1981 counties could choose to have their bed allocations adjusted. San Diego opted to reduce its bed allocation by one-half in exchange for enhanced local program funding it continues to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Finally, the evidence demonstrated a rational basis for protecting bed allocations to counties. Maintaining those bed allocations was rationally related to the legitimate governmental concern of avoiding harm to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>infrastructure of county programs. Reallocating beds, including reducing some counties\u2019 bed allocations, would adversely affect community programs. A county receiving a decreased bed allocation would need to use funds otherwise spent on community programs to help those who would have been in state hospitals. As noted, the superior court found cuts to programs would cause staff turnovers, recruitment difficulties, and interference with counties\u2019 ability to contract with suppliers. Thus, the court should have concluded the protection of counties\u2019 bed allocations furthered the go&amp;l of protecting existing programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\n<em>Bed Reallocation\u2019s Harmful Effect on Patient Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Finding the protection of patients from harm was a legitimate governmental purpose, the superior court noted patients would suffer from reductions in state hospital bed allocations if the reductions necessitated evicting existing patients needing care. However, based on its finding most of the state hospital population was transient with an average hospital stay of about 90 days, the court concluded the 10-year freeze on bed allocations was not rationally related to the goal of not harming patients. The court stated: \u201cA total freeze of beds is so far removed from what is necessary to accomplish the goal of not harming patients by eviction as to be totally irrational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The record casts doubt on the court\u2019s finding most of the state hospital population was transient. Plaintiffs have identified no evidence specifically indicating most of the population was transient. The court\u2019s finding was based on the testimony of a witness who was not certain about the average length of hospital stays. Further, uncontradicted testimony indicated 19 percent of San Mateo\u2019s state hospital patients were hospitalized for more than 10 years, 41 percent for more than 5 years, and 77 percent for at least 1 year.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In any event, in light of the historical inextricable linkage between allocations among counties of funding and state hospital beds, the superior court should have found reallocation of beds, including decreasing some counties\u2019 bed allocations, would adversely impact the treatment of existing patients. With respect to funding allocations, the superior court found the evidence demonstrated \u201cthe harmful effect of disrupting treatment of patients already on a treatment plan\u201d and \u201cthe necessity of maintaining the level of care for individual patients.\u201d In determining the funding disparities were not unconstitutional, the court stated: \u201cIt is rational for the state to strive not to leave vulnerable citizens in a worse condition than they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>be in had they not been involved with state programs.\u201d The court should have reached similar conclusions about the historical disparities in bed allocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">As the court properly found with respect to funding allocations, stability of programs was necessary to provide patients with a continuum of care. A stable continuum of care was crucial to mentally ill patients and their families. Both funding and bed allocations reflected historical choices made by counties about the means to provide a continuum of care to patients. State hospital beds were an integral part of many counties\u2019 programs. Bed reallocation would result in decreasing some counties\u2019 bed allocations. Such decreases would constitute reductions in those counties\u2019 base funding resulting in lost economic efficiency and value. Reducing such base funding would also adversely impact the continuum of care. Counties receiving decreased bed allocations would need to use funds otherwise spent on-community programs to help those who would have been in state hospitals. Evidence indicated reducing the number of beds under reallocation would result in the loss of service to a large portion of mentally ill patients already receiving treatment. Moreover, ousting patients from beds would be traumatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In sum, the historically developed base level bed allocations were essential to ensuring the necessary continuum of care for existing individual patients. Not maintaining those bed allocations would disrupt the treatment and level of care for many patients. Thus, the superior court should have found the challenged bed allocations were rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of protecting patients from harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">For many years state funding for county mental health programs and allocations to counties of state hospital beds have been directly linked. Beds and local dollars have been reciprocally convertible and fungible. Unequal distribution of state mental health resources resulted from counties\u2019 historical choices about participating in the Short-Doyle incentive matching grant program. The state has made adjustments to the mental health resource allocation system over time to begin to eliminate unreasonable inequalities. The disparities in bed allocations were not irrational simply because absolute equity had not been attained by the time of trial. The state defendants properly balanced the goals of maintaining existing local mental health programs, including state hospital bed allocations, and attempting to achieve equity among counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The superior court erred in determining there was no legitimate governmental purpose in maintaining a county\u2019s base allocation of state hospital beds. The record compels a conclusion the stability of patient care and program infrastructure was a legitimate governmental concern and the method used to allocate state hospital beds, including maintaining base allocations, was rationally related to providing such stability. The court should have determined the bed allocations did not violate equal protection guarantees. (Cf. <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra,_U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 14, 112 S.Ct. at p. 23331; <em>City of Rancho Cucamonga </em>v. <em>Mackzum, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at p. 947.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Similarly, the court erred in concluding allocation of state hospital beds violated substantive due process. The challenged governmental action was not arbitrary, unreasonable or unrelated to a legitimate state purpose. Where, as here, a legislative classification does not infringe upon a fundamental right, the test under the due process clause is \u201cwhether the classification bears a rational relation to a constitutionally permissible objective. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McCourtney </em>v. <em>Cory, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 439.) Plaintiffs did not meet their burden to prove the classification was irrational. <em>(Armstrong </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 617, fn. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Accordingly, the portions of the judgment declaring the allocation of state hospital beds unconstitutional, ordering reallocation of beds, and granting injunctive relief against defendants must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">\n<em>Recovery of Damages for Funds Withheld for Bed Overuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Based upon its findings the under-equity state hospital bed allocations and the overuse charges for exceeding those limitations violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process, the superior court concluded plaintiff counties were entitled to compensation for moneys the state withheld under former section 5700 et seq. from their Short-Doyle allocations for bed overuse.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Because we have concluded the bed allocations did not violate any equal protection or substantive due process rights of the counties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>the portion of the judgment awarding damages for bed overuse charges must be reversed.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">(D)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>Mootness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The realignment legislation enacted after trial but before entry of judgment revised the method of funding for county mental health services and discontinued Department allocation of community mental health funds and state hospital beds. (\u00a7\u00a7 4330 et seq., 17600 et seq.; Stats. 1991, chs. 89 &amp; 611.) Under realignment counties received funds from the state and could use that money to fund local programs or pay the Department for state hospital beds. Counties could purchase as many beds as they deemed necessary and wanted to buy. No county was allocated a fixed number of beds. Realignment also allocated portions of expected tax revenue growth for equity purposes. Some underequity counties also received additional adjustments. (\u00a7 17600 et seq.) In July 1993 various aspects of realignment were amended.

However, even if we were to conclude the realignment legislation rendered moot the portions of the judgment involving the constitutionality of funding and bed allocations under the Short-Doyle system, ordering reallocation of beds and granting injunctive relief against defendants, the existence of the constitutionally based damage award would require us to resolve the constitutional issues.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">\n<em>Promulgation of Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The state defendants also appeal the portion of the judgment ordering the Department to adopt regulations implementing former section 5600 as required under the APA.

Instead, counties received funds from the state for use to fund local programs or to contract for beds. Counties could purchase as many beds as they were willing to buy. Thus, realignment provided for distribution of funds under new standards without substantial Department discretion. (\u00a7\u00a7 5701, 17600-17600.20.) According to defendants, by adopting specific standards removing the need for regulations, the realignment legislation rendered moot the court\u2019s order directing the Department to promulgate regulations. We agree. The superior court concluded regulations were required to implement the Short-Doyle Act and particularly former section 5600. However, the old system has been eliminated.

However, the challenged order in this litigation involved the need for regulations under the old resource allocation system, not under realignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">We also note San Diego plaintiffs concede enactment of Senate Bill No. 463 in July 1993 has rendered moot the need for a regulation to define the term \u201ccurrent base.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Title 29 United States Code section 794(a), in 1989 provided in relevant part: \u201cNo otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States, as defined in section 7(8) [29 USCS \u00a7 706(8)], shall, solely by reason of her or his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance'. . . .\u201d (Pub.L. No. 100-630 (Nov. 7, 1988) tit. II, \u00a7 206(d), 102 Stat. 3312.) We may refer to the statute as section 504 of the FRA due to its origin. (Pub.L. No. 93-112 (Sept. 26, 1973) tit.

I didn\u2019t give Fresno money, because, although they told me how much they spent in taking care of Robert S., I have no idea how much money they would have spent in any event, absent the 504 violation, and I had no evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The parties stipulated Fresno\u2019s health director had been \u201cappointed as LPS conservator of the person of many residents of the County of Fresno who are gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder.\u201d The parties also stipulated Fresno\u2019s health director and mental health director were \u201ccharged with authorizing individualized treatment, supervision, and placement for their LPS conservatees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We note the superior court determined Fresno plaintiffs had standing in December 1989, well before Fresno plaintiffs in January 1991 amended their complaint to allege a patient-specific claim for damages under section 504. At the hearing on the standing issue Fresno plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked to amend the pleading by interlineation to allege the state defendants\u2019 allocation of state hospital beds violated section 504 of the FRA by unjustifiably discriminating against \u201cdisabled persons\u201d instead of against \u201cplaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"57\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Section 84.2 of 45 Code of Federal Regulations provided: \u201cThis part applies to each recipient of Federal financial assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services and to each program or activity that receives or benefits from such assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Section 84.3(f), of 45 Code of Federal Regulations provided: \u201cRecipient means any state or its political subdivision, any instrumentality of a state or its political subdivision, any public or private agency, institution, organization, or other entity, or any person to which Federal financial assistance is extended directly or through another recipient, including any successor, assignee, or transferee of a recipient, but excluding the ultimate beneficiary of the assistance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"A1-L\">In any event, the state defendants also contend \u201cbecause Robert S. did not suffer any damages, the county can not claim that it is entitled to damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\">For example, in their trial brief Fresno plaintiffs asserted the County of Fresno had the right to relief for the FRA section 504 violation involving Robert S. Fresno plaintiffs also asserted because of the Department\u2019s refusal to admit Robert S. to NSH, the county had to use substantial amounts of community Short-Doyle moneys to house and attempt to treat him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>locally; those <em>moneys </em>would have otherwise <em>gone </em>to treat other mentally ill residents; and restoration of those moneys to the county would thus be an appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"AXW\">In their closing brief Fresno plaintiffs asserted the state defendants\u2019 refusal to admit Robert S. to NSH before December 1989 resulted in the diversion of $290,539.22 in local mental health funds to attempt to treat Robert S.; and ordering the state to pay that sum of money back to the county to use for additional mental health services would allow county residents \u201cto receive the benefits of these monies which they previously were prohibited from doing due to the State\u2019s violation of Section 504.\u201d Fresno plaintiffs thus asked the court to order the state defendants to pay the county $290,539.22 less an offset \u201cas reimbursement for monies expended by Fresno County in attempting to treat Robert S. during the period of time that the State unlawfully refused to admit Robert S. to Napa State Hospital.\u201d In an additional closing brief Fresno plaintiffs asserted the \u201cdamages sustained by Plaintiff County of Fresno due to this specific Section 504 violation totalled [sic] $290,539.22.\u201d Seeking a judgment ordering the Department \u201cto reimburse the County of Fresno the money specified above\u201d less an appropriate offset, Fresno plaintiffs asserted upon being awarded damages the county would use the money \u201cto benefit its local residents who need mental health services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtM\">In objecting to the proposed statement of decision and proposed judgment, Fresno plaintiffs asserted: \u201cIf a consequence of the State\u2019s violation of Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is that a county is forced to expend some of its Short-Doyle monies in a way which reduces the county\u2019s ability to provide other mental health services, then, a fortiori, the county and its residents are damaged by the loss of use of that amount of money.\u201d Thus, according to Fresno plaintiffs, the judgment should award damages to the \u201cCounty of Fresno.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"60\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Perhaps recognizing their standing claim to be tenuous, Fresno plaintiffs alternatively claim entitlement as third party beneficiaries under their contract with state defendants. Fresno plaintiffs also suggest if damages may be awarded only to benefit Robert S. directly, the court should fashion a remedy awarding them damages to be held in trust to provide mental health services to Robert S. However, at this late date Fresno plaintiffs may not change their theories of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">Similarly, Fresno plaintiffs contend at a minimum their public conservators had standing to pursue Robert S.\u2019s interests since the conservators were charged with \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d providing \u201cservices designed for the financial and personal protection of [the conservatee]\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 9, \u00a7 548) and had authority to \u201c[cjommence and maintain actions and proceedings for the benefit of the . . . conservatee\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 2462). However, at trial Fresno plaintiffs sought damages for the county, not for Robert S.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b752-16\">In light of our determination Fresno plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute the FRA claim, we do not reach Fresno plaintiffs\u2019 contention of court error in allocating the burden to prove the amount of any offset.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
