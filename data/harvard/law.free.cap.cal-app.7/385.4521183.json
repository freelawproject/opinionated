The superior court upon the hearing vacated and set aside said order of incorporation. From this judgment the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\">The vital question involved upon this appeal, and the one upon which the judgment of the lower court was based, relates to the constitutionality of the act of the legislature passed in 1887 [Stats. 1887, p. 108], repealing a former act of February 20, 1872 [Stats. 1872, p. 108], entitled: \u201cAn Act to incorporate the town of Wilmington,\u201d as well as a certain act amendatory thereof. It is petitioner\u2019s contention that under the constitution the legislature could not repeal an act creating a municipality in existence at the date of the constitution, as such instrument guaranteed to municipal corporations organized theretofore the right of continuing their existence and of saving their form of government. Our supreme court in <em>People ex rel. McConnell </em>v. <em>City of Wilmington, </em>151 Cal. 649, [91 Pac. 524], has determined that the guaranty referred to extends only to such municipalities as were organized before the adoption of the constitution and does not prevent legislation where the corporation, although previously created, has failed to organize as such. The matter of organization previous to the adoption of the constitution, then, became a fact to be heard and determined by the board of supervisors upon a hearing of the petition for incorporation. It had jurisdiction to hear and determine this question. If, as a fact, the town of Wilmington had not organized under the act of 1872, the act of 1887 became operative and the territory embraced within the petition was subject to the order of the board with reference to incorporation. Respondent\u2019s contention is that the action of the board of supervisors upon such hearing was judicial; upon that assumption the intendments in favor of the regularity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>of the judgment of such board, nothing to the contrary appearing, will presuppose the taking of testimony with reference to such previous organization. In our opinion, the board of supervisors was not without jurisdiction, and, so far as disclosed by the record, its order creating the municipality was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The judgment of the superior court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Shaw, J., and Taggart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
