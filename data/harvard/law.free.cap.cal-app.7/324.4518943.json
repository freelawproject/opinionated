The supplemental complaint alleges that by certain blasting done by defendants subsequent to the filing of the complaint the dwelling-house of plaintiff was injured and damaged, and the walls and ceilings of the rooms thereof broken and cracked, and the furniture and ornaments of said house broken and destroyed, to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of $1000, for which she asked judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The office of a supplemental .complaint is to plead facts material to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accruing after the filing of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">It is not proper to set forth a new and independent cause of action, but only such matters as may he consistent with and in aid of the case made by the original complaint. \u201cIt is no objection to a supplemental complaint that different or additional relief is asked for. Indeed, the object of the supplemental complaint is to obtain additional or different relief without resort to a new trial.\u201d <em>(Jacob </em>v. <em>Lorenz, </em>98 Cal. 332, [33 Pac. 119] ; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bartel, </em>6 Cal. 483.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>135 Ill. 190, [25 N. E. 756], it is said: \u201cIf the original bill is sufficient for one kind of relief and facts afterward occur which entitle the complainant to other and more extensive relief, he may have such relief by setting out the new matter in a supplemental bill.\u201d (See, also, <em>Candler </em>v. <em>Pettit, </em>1 Paige, 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In the ease at bar the original complaint charged in substance that defendants threatened to do certain blasting that would impair and destroy the lateral and subjacent support to the lot of land of plaintiff, upon which was a dwelling-house occupied by her and her family. Subsequently to the filing of the complaint defendants did the threatened blasting, with the result, not of injuring the support of the lot of plaintiff, as she had feared, but damaging and injuring the house and its contents. Under these circumstances we are unable to see why it was not proper to permit the pleading of this new matter. It was not an independent cause of action, hut rather matter consistent with and in aid of the original cause of action, and calling for different and additional relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Appellants also attack the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain certain findings of the court, but we find sufficient evidence in the record to sustain all the findings complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The court found that the house and its furnishings had been damaged and injured by the soot, smoke and dirt emitted from the engines operated by defendants, and also by the blasting pleaded in the supplemental complaint, in the total sum of $307.50. In discussing the evidence to sustain this finding appellants confine themselves to the evidence tending to prove the allegations of damage under the original complaint; but the supplemental matter was properly pleaded; and when we consider the evidence introduced to sustain the damages alleged in the supplemental complaint as well as that tending to support the damages alleged in the original complaint we find ample to sustain the finding made by the court on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">So, too, the finding to the effect that the defendants intend to use and operate a steam shovel and other machinery, emitting greasy dirt, soot and smoke, near to the residence of plaintiff, is supported by the evidence, especially in view of the answer of appellants, which seems to insist on their right to use the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The other matters discussed in appellants\u2019 brief concern the sufficiency of the complaint and the correctness of the judgment so far as it enjoins defendants from doing certain specified acts, and cannot properly be considered on an appeal from an order denying a motion for a new trial, but only on an appeal from the judgment. <em>(Bode v. Lee, </em>102 Cal. 583, [36 Pac. 936] ; <em>Evans v. Paige, </em>102 Cal. 132, [36 Pac. 406] ; <em>Brison </em>v. <em>Brison, </em>90 Cal. 323, [27 Pac. 186].)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The order is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Cooper, P. J., and Kerrigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
