Objection was made by the defendants to the introduction of oral testimony as to the contents of the bills and letters, and the objection was overruled. We think the court erred in its ruling. The witness stated that he had no personal knowledge that the communications addressed to Cunningham <em>&amp; Go. </em>were mailed, except that copies thereof appeared in the plaintiffs\u2019 copy-book, and that it was a general custom of his firm to place letters in a box in the store, from which they were taken to the post-office. No foundation, therefore, was laid for the introduction of the evidence. Assuming that secondary evidence could, under such circumstances, be introduced, the press copies were the best evidence, next to the originals themselves. The ruling was on a material matter, because the defendants testified that they never received the communications referred to. <em>(Brailsford </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>15 Md. 150; 74 Am. Dec. 562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Mr. Middleton, one of the defendants, was called as a \u25a0witness, and identified the ledger of the copartnership, showing the account of Ford &amp; Co. with Cunningham <em>&amp; </em>Co. from September 1, 1884, to the date of trial. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>was admitted by the plaintiffs that the entries therein were original entries, but they objected to the introduction of the same as evidence, on the ground that it was irrelevant, immaterial, and incompetent. The objection was sustained by the court, to which ruling the defendants excepted. There was no item of barley in the account offered. The ruling, we think, was error. The witness had stated that the ledger showed the true state of account between plaintiffs and defendants, and that the items had been entered by him at the time of the several transactions therein mentioned, <em>(Landis </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>14 Cal. 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
