The instrument in writing here presented by plaintiffs is a mere broker\u2019s contract, and does not authorize them to sell, or to receive the purchase-money, or to bind the defendant to convey, or to convey by deed themselves; for where an agent has the power to sell real estate, the authority to execute the proper instruments required by law to carry such sale into effect is necessarily incident. <em>(Blum </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>24 Cal. 127; <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>22 Pick. 85; 33 Am.

The plaintiff must recover, if at all, upon the cause of action set out in his complaint, and not upon some other developed by the proofs. <em>(Maynard </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>34 Cal. 48; 91 Am.

Dec. 126; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>3 Gill &amp; J. 377; 22 Am. Dec. 329.) A broker can onty recover commissions when he has brought a purchaser to the vendor who is willing to deal with him upon the terms proposed in a manner satisfactory to the vendor, and by showing that he was the efficient agent and procuring cause of the sale. <em>(McGavock </em>v. <em>Woodlief, </em>20 How. 221; <em>Wylie </em>v. <em>Marine National Bank, </em>61 N.

Rep. 349.) It must further appear that the broker performed the duty assumed by him within the time limited in his contract, or within such extension of time as may have been granted by his employer, unless the delay was caused by the negligence, fault, or fraud of the owner. <em>(Fultz </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Wimer, </em>34 Kan. 576; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Sturgis, </em>71 Cal. 226; <em>Zeimer </em>v. <em>Antisell, </em>75 Cal. 509.) A real estate broker is not entitled to commissions for making a sale of real estate for his principal, unless he strictly performs the services required of him according to the authority conferred upon him. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Sturgis, </em>71 Cal. 229; <em>Masten </em>v. <em>Griffing, </em>33 Cal. 111; <em>Sibbald </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Iron Co., </em>83 N. Y. 378; 38 Am. Rep. 441.) The plaintiffs must fail, because the purchaser was not bound by the contract to make any purchase. <em>(Minturn </em>v. <em>Baylis, </em>33 Cal. 129; <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>37 Cal. 250; <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>58 Mo. 242.) There is no right to commission until the purchase-money has passed and the sale is effected. <em>(Power </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>5 Wis. 265; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>37 Kan. 677; <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>31 Md. 250; 1 Am.

There is a complete failure of proof of the cause of action set out in the complaint, and not a variance within the meaning of sections 469 and 470 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Code Civ.

(Webster\u2019s Dict., tit. \u201carticle\u201d; Rapalje and Lawrence\u2019s Law Dict., 80, 81.) Where the language used indicates more than a mere broker\u2019s authority, the court must so find. <em>(Rutenberg </em>v. <em>Main, </em>47 Cal. 219; Civ. Code, secs. 1636, 1641, 1649, 1650, 1654, 1655.)

Soule,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cBy Geo. D. Fiske &amp; Co., his Agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2X\">The defendant refused to convey the property, after a tender of the money specified in this agreement, and also refused to pay the plaintiffs their commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">It is contended by the appellant that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, because the contract of sale was for $45 per acre <em>with </em>the crops, when the limit of their authority to sell was for that price <em>without </em>the crops, and $47.50 per acre with the crops. But the sale was made for a sum in gross which amounted to more than $47.50 per acre. There were 601 acres of land, and it was sold for $29,100, which amounted to $48.41 per acre. So that, conceding that the contract of sale included the crops growing on the land, the sale was for more than the highest amount the plaintiffs were required to sell for, and the sale was not beyond their authority. The sale agreed upon was for $48.50 per acre, supposing that there wrere 600 acres of the land, but it turned out that there were 601 acres. And when a tender was made to the defendant it was for $48.50 more than the written agreement called for, so as to cover the agreed price for the additional one acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The court below found, however, that the sale was for forty-five dollars per acre without the crops, and there was evidence to support this finding, so far as the verbal agreement between the plaintiffs and the purchaser was concerned, but not as to the written contract between them. The contract bound the defendant to convey the land without any reservation of the crops. This written contract was binding on the defendant, if the plaintiffs had the \u00a1lower to make it, unless corrected on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ground that by mistake it was not in accordance with the agreement actually made. Under its finding that the land was sold for $45 per acre without the crops, the court allowed the plaintiffs, as commissions, the difference between that sum and the sum of $29,148.50. The plaintiffs were bound by their agreement to account to the defendant for $47.50 per acre, if the crops went with the land, and were only entitled to the balance of the purchase price over and above that sum as their commissions, unless the defendant waived the form in which the agreement to sell and the deed tendered to him were made. We have seen that by the terms of the written agreement the crops must go with the land. Tl erafore the amount found in favor of the plaintiffs was excessive to the amount of $2.50 per acre upon the 601 acres of the land, if this written agreement was to be looked to alone. It may be that if the actual agreement was as'claimed by the plaintiffs, and a tender and a demand for a deed containing a reservation of the growing crops had been made, the plaintiffs could recover the full amount claimed in any event; but this does not appear to have been done. But there is another ground upon which we think the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the whole amount of their commissions. The sale was reported to the defendant as a sale at forty-five dollars per acre without the crops. He asked the plaintiffs to sell the crops to the parties for $2.50 per acre if possible. The plaintiffs consented, and attempted to do so, but the purchasers stated that they did not want the crops, and refused to buy them. The form of deed presented to the defendant, when a conveyance was demanded of him, was an ordinary grant deed without any reservation of the crops. But the defendant did not refuse to consummate the trade on the ground that the deed was not in proper form, or on the ground that the sale was not in accordance with the written authority given by him. The evidence shows clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that it was the understanding of all the parties, the purchaser included, that the crops were not to pass. If any such objection had been made, there can be no doubt that a deed containing the necessary reservation would have been accepted. It seems not to have been observed by any of the parties at the time that the contract of sale or the deed proffered wrere not in the form necessary to carry out the agreement of the parties. The defendant refused absolutely to consummate the sale or to negotiate with reference to it. It is perfectly apparent that the fact that the contract and deed were not in proper form had nothing whatever to do with his refusal to exe-. cute the deed. This being the case, he should not be allowed to offer that as an excuse for not complying with his contract by way of defense to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It is contended by the appellant that the contract given by the defendant to the plaintiffs did not authorize the plaintiffs to sell the land or to hind the defendant by their agreement to sell it, but only to secure a purchaser. This might be material if the action were by the purchaser to enforce a specific performance of the agreement to convey, but it is wholly immaterial in this case whether the power of the plaintiffs was to sell, or merely to procure a purchaser. They complied with their part of the contract. If the defendant did not see proper to convey to the purchaser they had procured, this was no reason why he should not pay their commissions. It is immaterial that the plaintiffs in their complaint construed and treated this as a power to sell, even conceding that it was not. The contract was set out and made a part of the complaint, and entitled them to whatever was authorized by its terms and the facts proved. The allegations were sufficient to entitle them to recover'as mere brokers. <em>(Dolan </em>v. <em>Scanlan, </em>57 Cal. 261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">It is claimed by the appellant that the authority given by the contract was revoked before the sale was made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>But the court found to the contrary, and there was evidence to support the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It is further contended that the contract of sale was not'within the power of the plaintiffs, because it required the defendant to convey by general warranty against all encumbrances. But the evidence shows that when the tender was made no such deed was demanded, nor do we think the contract required any such deed. The deed demanded \"was, as we have said, an ordinary grant deed, and its form was not objected to, nor was there any claim that the property was encumbered or that there was any reason why the plaintiff could not or should not execute such a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It is also insisted that the contract was unfair, and not mutual, because the purchaser was not bound, in any way, to pay the purchase-money, except by a forfeiture of the five hundred dollars cash payment. But this, if so, is immaterial. The whole purchase-money was tendered to the defendant when a deed was demanded of him, and before this commission was demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">It is further claimed that the sale was not made within the time limited by the contract. This is based upon the assumption that payment of the purchase-money was necessary to constitute a sale, which is not necessarily so. The purchaser could not he expected to pay the purchase-money before receiving a conveyance. Counsel say that the contract required a sale for cash. This we think is not so. By the terms of the contract the terms of payment were tobe \u201cas buyer and seller may agree.\u201d If this is to be construed as reserving to the defendant the right to agree in person upon the terms of payment, it is still clear that it did not impose upon the plaintiffs the duty of selling for cash. Besides, there could be no reasonable objection to the terms of payment when cash was tendered, and no such objection was made to the consummation of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Again, it is contended that the plaintiffs were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>entitled to recover until the purchase-money was paid. It may be conceded that this would be so if the purchaser had failed to pay the purchase-money, but the defendant could hardly defend on this ground when the purchase-money was not paid, solely because he refused to accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">It appears, from the evidence, that the title to the property was not in the defendant, but in his wife. This was not material. He gave it to the plaintiffs to sell <em>as his property, </em>so stated in his contract, and the evidence is to the effect and the court found that the plaintiffs had no knowledge, until after they had made the sale, that the title was not in him. Under such circumstances his want of title could not affect the plaintiff's right to recover their commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The court found on all the material issues; all of the findings necessary to a recovery are sustained by the evidence, and they support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Sharpstein, J., McFarland, J., Paterson, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
