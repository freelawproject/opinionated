That the validity of a certain paper writing, dated 28th of June, 1806, which at the instance of a certain Kosciusko Armstrong, was, on the 19th of November, 1828, proved as, and for the last will of the said Thadeus Kosciusko, might be allowed to contest the same, and that probate thereof might be revoked; and</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">2nd. That George Bomford, administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, with the will of the 5th of May, 1798, annexed, might be ordered to pay over to the petitioners the fund deposited by General Kosciusko with Mr. Jefferson.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The petitioners further state that the Orphans\u2019 Court, acting upon the said former petition on the 17th of February, 1846, ordered the Register of Wills to make up and transmit to the law side of the Circuit Court, District of Columbia, to be there tried, an issue, \u201c Whether the writing produced by the said Kosciusko Armstrong, and admitted to probate on the 19th of November, 1828, is the last will and testament of the said Thadeus Kosciusko or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">The petitioners state further that some of the former petitioners died, and S. S. Williams anti John F. Ennis have obtained letters of administration of their effects; that Colonel Bomford also died, and Eewis Johnson became administrator <em>de bonis non </em>in his place; that while the issue at law was pending in the Circuit Court in January, 1847, the will of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>June 28th, 1806, more fully described in the said former petition, was produced, proved and recorded among the wills of the Orphans\u2019 Court, by which will the testator expressly revoked \u201c all the wills which he might have hithertofore made;\u201d that the issue sent to the Circuit Court is now an issue at law and not of fact, and is cognizable in the Orphans\u2019 Court only:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Upon these grounds, and others which will be more fully set forth during the hearing of the case,\u201d they pray that \u201cfurther proceedings in that Court may be resumed, and that citations may be issued: 1st. To the said Kosciusko Armstrong, or his counsel of record, to show cause why the probate of the paper writing, purporting to be a will of General Thadeus Kosciusko of the 28th of June, 1806, should not be revoked and annulled. 2nd. To the said Uewis Johnson, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of said Kosciusko\u2019s estate, to show cause why the paper writing, purporting to be a will of said Thadeus Kosciusko, of the 5th of May, 1798, and the probate thereof, recorded among the wills of this Court, should not be stricken out from the records of this Court, and declared null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">This petition is signed by R.

It is this 2nd day of December, 1845, ordered that the said case be again examined and heard, and that notice be given to the said Kosciusko Armstrong to appear in this Court on or before the 3rd Tuesday of January next, in person or by solicitor, to show cause why the said probate of the said will shall not be set aside, and the said paper writing therein propounded by him as the last will of the said Thadeus Kosciusko be declared null and void; and provided that a copy of this order be published in the <em>National Intelligencer </em>once a week for three successive weeks previous to the 3rd Tuesday in January, 1846. Nathaniel P. Causin.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">No further proceeding appears upon the records of the Orphans\u2019 Court until the 22d of December, 1848, when the Judge made the following order, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">It is ordered that the Register of Wills issue citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">1st. To Richard S. Coxe, Esq., counsel of Kosciusko Armstrong, to appear in this Court on the 5th day of January, 1849, to show cause why the probate of the paper writing, purporting to be a will of General Thadeus Kosciusko, of the 22d of June, 1806, should not be revoked and annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">2d. To fiewis Johnson, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Kosciusko\u2019s estate, to appear on the same day, on the 5th of January, 1849, to show cause why the paper writing, purporting to be a will of Thadeus Kosciusko, of the 5 th of May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>1798, and the probate thereof recorded among the wills of this Court, should not be stricken out from the records of this Court and declared null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Nathaniel P. Causin, 22d Dec., 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The citations seem to have been issued and served on the same day, 22d Dec., 1848.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">On the day appointed, (January 5th, 1849,) Lewis Johnson, the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>appeared, by Mr. Morfit, his counsel, and objected, \u201c that the Orphans\u2019 Court should not hold or entertain jurisdiction of this cause at this time, or in the present form of this application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">1st. Because an issue is still pending on the law side of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, as to the validity of the respective wills named in the application of the parties for the citations, and that the said issue was taken on a petition before the Orphans\u2019 Court upon the same questions which are now presented; and the effect of the present petition, if sustained, will be to bring back a question before this Court which has, by having been put in issue elsewhere, passed beyond its present control.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">2d. If the issue should be stricken off the docket of the Circuit Court, it would be a surprise upon the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">3d. That the testator re-established the will of 1798 by a subsequent will, but of this this respondent has no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">4th. That there is a bill in equity pending in the Circuit Court, and involving all the matters contained in the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court in this case, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">5th. That this respondent is ready to pay over the money to any person authorized to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">6th. That there should not be a decision in any one of the cases until all are brought together.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-13\">Upon consideration of this case as it is now brought before this Court, I am of the opinion that the Orphans\u2019 Court, by sending an issue to this Court, to be tried at law, \u2018 \u2018 whether the writing produced by the said Kosciusko Armstrong, and admitted to probate on the 29th of November, 1828, is the last will and testament of the said Thadeus Kosciusko or not,\u201d had divested itself of the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that question, so long as it remains undecided by this Court the case was <em>coram non judice, </em>and the sentence of the Orphans\u2019 Court of the 6th of Februarjq 1849, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Upon appeal from the sentence of the Orphans\u2019 Court of the District of Columbia, passed on the 6th of February, 1849, declaring it to be the opinion of that Court that the will executed by Thadeus Kosciusko on the 4th of June, 1816, and recorded in that Court in 1847, revokes the wills of the 28th of June, 1806, and of the 5th of May, 1798, of the said Kosciusko, deceased, and revoking the probate of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It is considered and adjudged by this Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, this 5th day of November, 1850, that the said sentence of the said Orphans\u2019 Court be, and the same is hereby reversed with costs; the said sentence having been passed by the said Orphans\u2019 Court, while an issue sent by that Court to the Circuit Court aforesaid to be tried at law, whether the writing produced by the said Kosciusko, and admitted to probate on the 19th of November, 1828, is the last will and testament of the said Thadeus Kosciusko or not, was and is pending undecided in said Circuit Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b30-6\">Morsel, J., concurred in the opinion of Cranch, C.
