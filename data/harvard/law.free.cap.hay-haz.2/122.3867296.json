The Court pronounced an oral opinion; the following conclusions were reduced to writing by the presiding judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">\u2018 \u2018 The doctrine laid down by this Court in the case of Devaughn <em>vs. </em>Patterson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is affirmed and reasserted; the power of grading and regrading the public streets of Washington must be considered as a continuing power in the Corporation, to be exercised whenever and as often as the health, improvement and prosperity of the city makes it necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\"><em>\u201c </em>That the graduation and regraduation by said Corporation cannot be considered in the nature of a compact with the proprietor of the property fronting thereon, that it shall always so continue unchanged; and any such agreement to fetter or clog the exercise of legislative power would be void:\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>\u201cThat </em>by the conveyance of the streets and squares, &amp;c., from the Commissioners in 1796, to the United States possessed an unqualified fee-simple in the streets and public squares exclusively, to which the Corporation succeeded, so far as the power to grade and regrade is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">\u2018 \u2018 That though the right of ingress and egress in the proprietor of property fronting on a street is impaired by such regrading, it must be considered a loss in the nature of consequential damages, and not within the principle of the provisioti contained in the Constitution, forbidding the <em>taking private property </em>for public use without just compensation; it is <em>damnum absque </em>injuria, for which no action lies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u201c That there can be no breach of faith ascribed to the Corporation in changing the .graduation, because they had <em>no power to make </em>any pledge that it should always so continue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Asy\">1 \u2018 The foregoing propositions must however be considered as made, with the qualification that the jury shall find from the evidence that such claim became necessary for the health, improvement and prosperity of the city, <em>and was not capriciously or </em>unskillfully made; also that the same was <em>made in a proper manner and within the line of said street so graduated. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-12\"> Not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
