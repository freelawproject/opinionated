This motion was granted, from which the present appeal was prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Learned counsel for appellant states in his brief that the question presented is whether the wife, on the facts stated, is barred from her right to collect damages for-her husband\u2019s wrongful killing. Learned counsel for appellant further states that this question has heretofore not been directly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">We think, however, that this question is foreclosed by previous decisions in this state. <em>Koontz </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>17 Tenn. App. 1, 65 S. W. (2d) 82 <em>(certiorari </em>denied by this <em>Court); Heggie </em>v. <em>Barley, </em>5 Tenn. Civ. App. 78, and by the logic of the decision in <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Reasonover, </em>168 Tenn. 305, 77 S. W. (2d) 809. In <em>Koontz </em>v. <em>Fleming, supra </em>[17 Tenn. App. 1, 65 S. W. (2d) 824], the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\u201cWe do not believe that because the widow has been indiscreet or has committed a crime, her right as a widow and her children\u2019s rights should be affected so far as her or their right of action in this case is concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">In <em>Heggie </em>v. <em>Barley </em>it was declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">\u201cOur statutes providing for recoveries for personal injuries negligently inflicted resulting in deaths, and designating for whose benefit such recoveries may be had are clearly in the nature of statutes providing for the descent and distributing of estates, and we are of opinion that the Courts can no more inquire into the worthiness or unworthiness of such beneficiaries in such personal injury cases than they can inquire into the worthiness or unworthiness of those who are designated as beneficiaries of the estates of decedents, and that the Courts cannot deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>relief because of unworthiness in either case unless authorized so to dp by some statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">In <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Reasonover, </em>above, the Court distinguished between homestead and dower, holding that homestead might be lost by wrongful abandonment and neglect of the husband by the wife, but that as to dower it was an estate in land fixed by marriage and by the husband\u2019s death and is not waived by the wife\u2019s misconduct or abandonment of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em> </em>Section 8236 of the Code is in the nature of statutes providing for the descent and distribution of estates and the character of the beneficiaries under such statutes is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The holdings of our cases seem to be in accord with the decisions construing similar, statutes in other states. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Mayne, </em>C. C., 122 F. 836; <em>Napier\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Napier\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>210 Ky. 163, 275 S. W. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">It results that the action of the Chancellor is affirmed and costs of the appeal will be taxed against A. J. Johnson, as administrator, and the costs below as fixed by the lower Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Sitting for Chief Justice Green.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
