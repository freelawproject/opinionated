The residue of my estate, including my home and furnishings, to go to my nephew, Fred Watkins Evans, to handle as he sees fit during his lifetime ; and the balance to go to his two daughters, Ann and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Frances Evans. It is my wish that Fred Watkins Evans will look after my brother, William W. Evans, during his lifetime. To my nephew Daniel Gloode Evans $10',000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-3\">\u201cIt is my wish that my just taxes and burial taxes he taken care of first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">\u2018 \u2018 The reason I am not mentioning my other relatives is because they- are well provided for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201cIt is my wish that my nephew, Fred Watkins Evans, and my brother-in-law, Ernest Redman, jointly administer my estate without bond and without accounting to any courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">It will he observed that the testatrix bequeaths to named relatives and servants certain sums of money, \u201cthe residue to go to my nephew, Fred Watkins Evans, to handle as he sees fit during his lifetime, and the balance to go to his daughters, Ann and Frances Evans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">For this nephew, Fred Watkins Evans, it is contended, with the support of the executor, that (1) he is bequeathed a life' estate coupled with a power of disposition so unlimited that a fee or absolute estate vests in him and the limitation over to his children is void; or (2) in the alternative, that he takes a life estate with a, qualified power of disposition during his lifetime contingent upon his needs, wishes or desires, the balance remaining at his death to go to his named children.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The Chancellor was of opinion that Fred Watkins Evans was vested with a life estate only, with the right to use and consume only the income therefrom, but with unlimited authority to sell, transfer and convey and pass title to any and all of the real and personal property passing to him under the- will, free from any obligation to account therefor, but with the obligation to keep invested the proceeds and hold same for the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>remaindermen. These are the issues presented on this appeal by the Executor and Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"ANI\">Whatever may have been the rnle laid down by onr older cases, and invoked here for appellants, nnder which a life estate was converted into a fee by a provision for unlimited disposition, this rnle \u201cis now abrogated by statute,\u201d ds we said in <em>Mauk </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>175 Tenn. 443 at page 447, 135 S. W. (2d) 922, 923; this reference obviously being to Code provision 7603, appearing again as 8093, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\"><em>\u201cFirst taker\u2019s unexercised 'power of disposition, effect of.\u2014 </em>When the unlimited power of disposition, qualified or unqualified, not accompanied by any trust, is given, expressly, in any written instrument, to the owner of any particular estate for life or years, legal or equitable, such estate is changed into a fee absolute as to right of disposition, and rights of creditors and purchasers, but subject to any future estate limited thereon or executory devise thereof, in event and so far as the power .is not executed or the property sold for the satisfaction of debts during the continuance of the particular estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">And so GREen, C. J., in <em>Magevney </em>v. <em>Karsch, </em>167 Tenn. 32, at page 54, 65 S. W. (2d )562, at page 570, 92 A. L. R. 343 remarked that, \u201cThis rule, however, has now been circumscribed by the provisions of section 7603 of the Code of 1932, repeated in section 8093.\u201d And see <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Milam, </em>166 Tenn. 266, at page 273, 61 S. W. (2d) 674, at page 676, where it was said that even where an unrestricted power of disposition is given, \u201cthe limitation over would not be void under the provisions of the new Code,\u201d citing the above sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">(It should be noted that the wills under consideration in the <em>Mauk </em>and <em>Magevney Cases, supra, </em>had been executed and probated prior to the enactment of the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>of 1932 and disposition of these cases was, therefore, not affected by this statute.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">If then there is to he found on the face of this bequest of a life estate to Evans, either expressed, or by necessary implication, a power of disposition, \u201cqualified or unqualified,\u201d in so far as the power is not executed, or the property sold for debts during the continuance of the life estate, the estate will pass to the remaindermen named therein upon the death of the life tenant. This is the conclusion compelled by the Code provisions above cited, and is also in harmony with our holdings in a number of cases, in which we found coupled with a life estate a qualified or contingent power of disposition conferred on the life tenant. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Coldwell </em>172 Tenn. 214, 111 S. W. (2d) 367, 114 A. L. R. 941; Mauk v. <em>Irwin, supra, </em>in which older cases are cited. Also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>McMurrey, </em>25 Tenn. App. 47, 150 S. W. (2d) 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">There remains open for our consideration, therefore, only the alternative insistence of appellants, that there is coupled with this life estate either an unlimited power of disposition, or such as confers the right upon this life tenant to convert to his own use, or that of the testatrix\u2019s brother, William W. Evans, referred to in the will and made a charge upon the life tenant, such portions of the property passing to him under the will as he \u201csees fit during his lifetime\u201d \u2014 finds needful or desirable \u2014the balance remaining at his death to pass to the re-maindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">It is clear that the primary objects of this old lady\u2019s bounty were this nephew Fred and his two daughters and we are impressed that, if her will is to be construed as limiting the use and enjoyment of the property she bequeathed them to \u00b0the income only throughout the life expectancy of her nephew, which runs for many years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>then ,not the nephew and father only, but these girls will' be deprived of the benefit of this bounty at the very period when they will most need it for their education and support in a fashion befitting their station and prospects. This testatrix was doubtless aware of the shrinking purchasing power of the dollar, the rising tide of taxes and the limited yield of all safe income bearing securities. When these factors are given effect, the spendable income of this nephew for himself, his daughters and this invalid uncle, would be wholly inadequate. All of these, the particular objects of the testatrix\u2019s bounty, are thus cramped and restricted in the use of this estate bequeathed to them, while the years pass. No one is benefited by such a limitation upon the use of this estate. These girls, when they come to receive this bequest, if the father lives out his expectancy, will certainly have long passed the years when they needed it for their education, etc., and could most have enjoyed it. It is hard to conceive that it was the intention of this testatrix to bring about this static state of affairs and hold off from the full enjoyment of her bounty both this nephew and his daughters, so long as he should live and until the girls, if then living, are aged.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">With this appraisal in mind of the result to the primary beneficial objects of the testatrix of a construction which limits all use of the estate to the income for probably many years, we examine the language, of this residuary clause. A bequest is made to this nephew of the residue of this estate, \u201cto handle as he sees fit during his lifetime ; and the balance to go to his two daughters, \u2019Ann and Frances Evans.\u201d A right to use, enjoy and consume the income and incidentally to conserve and protect the <em>cor.pus </em>by re-investment, when necessary, of income bearing personalty, exists without express words of author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ity, so that, if this was all intended to be given him, expressions of the will authorizing the life tenant to \u201chandle as he sees fit,\u201d and referring to \u201cthe balance\u201d were unnecessary and nnappropriate. It mnst have been the intention by these expressions to confer upon the life tenant greater and further- power of use and consumption than he would have otherwise had.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">The Chancellor gave to these expressions, particularly \u201cto handle as he sees fit,\u201d coupled with the provision that neither bond nor accounting should be required, added meaning, holding that thereby the life tenant is empowered to sell, transfer and dispose of any part or parts of the estate, real and personal, and pass good title thereto to purchasers. We agree, but feel constrained to go further and hold that it was the intention that this life tenant might also, for his own use and benefit and that of the testatrix\u2019s brother, William, and of these daughters, encroach upon the <em>corpus </em>of the estate, \u201cthe balance\u201d remaining at the death of the life tenant to pass to these daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Indeed, adopting the narrower view of the phrase \u201cto handle as he sees fit during* his life time,\u201d which \u00e9xtends authority only to shifting and re-adjusting, collecting and re-investing without restriction, and free from all obligation of accounting in any manner to any court, as a practical result such a life tenant is left free to make absolute and unlimited disposition of any part or all of this estate coming into his hands. If one may do with securities <em>as he sees fit, </em>without legal responsibility for disposition, his power of disposition is in legal effect absolute. Such power of handling or use can hardly be distinguished' from absolute power of disposition expressly conferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Perhaps tlxe most significant expression on the face of this will supporting the view that it was intended that the life tenant might encroach upon the <em>corpus </em>is the reference following the provision authorizing Evans to handle, or use, this property \u201cas he sees fit,\u201d to \u201cthe balance.\u201d It is impossible to avoid the deduction that Mrs. Jackson had in mind that in his handling ,or use of the estate a part of the principal or <em>corpus </em>would or might be consumed by him, thus leaving a \u201cbalance.\u201d It is-as though she had said to this favorite nephew, \u201ctake all that remains of my estate, after payment of my debts and the legacies I have specified, and do with it as you see fit; \u2018the balance\u2019 remaining when you die I want'to go to your daughters.\u201d The Century Dictionary defines \u201cbalance\u201d as \u201cA surplus; a remainder; the rest; the residue; what remains or is left over; as, he bequeathed the <em>balance </em>of his estate to A. B.; the balance, of a meal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In more than one case this Court has recognized the significance of the use of the term \u201cbalance\u201d or its eqiiiv-alent, \u201cremaining.\u201d In <em>Downing, Executor, </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>45 Tenn. 229, it was \u201cbalance\u201d that was held to imply a power to encroach on the corpus; and in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Nashville Trust </em>Co., 145 Tenn. 575, at page 581, 238 S. W. 865, at page 866, Green, J. says: \u201cThe gift over of the \u2018remaining money\u2019 also <em>forces the implication </em>that George M. Spottswood was .to have an unlimited power of disposition when the money came into his hands.\u201d (Italics inserted.) <em>Meacham </em>v. <em>Graham </em>98 Tenn. 190, 200, 39 S. W. 12, and <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Carnes, </em>94 Tenn. 27, 27 S. W. 1007, 45 Am. St. Rep. 696, are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Under the sub-heading \u201cImplied power to sell,\u201d many cases are annotated in 2 A. L. R. 1310, 27 A. L. R. 1387, and 69 A. L. R. 835, construing the phrase, following a devise of a life estate, for the .use of the life ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ant, with, a limitation over of \u201cwhat remains,\u201d or \u201cthe remainder,\u201d as implying a power of disposition, and as indicating a purpose to vest in the remaindermen what is left only. We are unable to make any material distinction between the phrases \u201cthe remainder\u201d or \u201cwhat remains\u201d and \u201cthe balance.\u201d Both alike clearly imply a power conferred to encroach upon the <em>corpus. </em>It is only the balance, that is, what remains of the estate, that the testator passes by the will to the remainderman. For example, in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Hillier, </em>103 Me. 17, 67 A. 571, 125 Am. St. Rep. 283, where the will gave to the wife all the testator\u2019s estate \u201cfor her use during life\u201d and at her death \u201cwhatever may remain of said estates\u201d to a daughter, it was held that the use given the wife extended to a sale of the real as well as the personal property, as, otherwise, there was no practical significance in the use of the word \u201cremain\u201d in this connection. So here, the use of the phrase \u201cthe balance\u201d is meaningless, unless it connotes what is left after the life tenant has handled or used the estate during his lifetime \u201c as he sees fit. \u2019 \u2019 Illustrations might be multiplied indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Counsel for appellees, citing Webster, defines \u201chandle\u201d as \u201cto touch; to feel with the hand; to hold, take up, move or otherwise affect with the hand; to use the hands upon.\u201d These definitions referring to physical handling are quite obviously not applicable here. He proceeds more appropriately: Also, \u201cto have pass through one\u2019s hands; to buy, sell; to deal or trade in.\u201d Other definitions given by Webster have a broader meaning, more consonant with the likely intent here, such as, to use, manage, direct the course of. And when effect is given to the significance of the added words, \u201cas he sees fit,\u201d and to the provisions waiving bond and accounting, and the bequest over of \u201cthe balance\u201d only, we think it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>inescapable that it was tbe intention of tbe testatrix that tbis nepbew might encroach npon tbe <em>corpus </em>at least to tbe extent of bis needs and those of tbis invalid brother and these daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Tbe decree of tbe Chancellor is modified and a declaratory judgment will be entered here in accordance with tbe foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
