Because the Spachts claimed an interest in oil and gas rights to the real property of plaintiffs, they are necessary parties \u201cwho might be inequitably affected by a judgment in the action\u201d (CPLR 1001, subd [a]; see <em>Williams v Somers, </em>91 AD2d 545). The parties should be permitted to add the necessary parties or to consolidate this action with a pending action in which the Spachts are parties, and to address the issue whether the clause in the deed from the Federal Land Bank to the Spachts relating to gas and oil rights was a covenant running with the land. (Appeal from judgment of Supreme Court, Chautauqua County, Gossel, J. \u2014 summary judgment.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P. J., Denman, Boomer, O\u2019Donnell and Schnepp, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
