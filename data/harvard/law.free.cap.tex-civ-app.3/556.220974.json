That it was the general custom of defendant to receive cotton for shipment on said platform, and that it had no other place at Rhome for receiving cotton for shipment but said platform. That said cotton was placed on said platform by plaintiffs for the purpose of being shipped over defendant\u2019s and connecting lines of railway to Liverpool, England.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\u201cThat at the time of the destruction of the said thirty-two bales of cotton, the same was, at the place it was destroyed, of the value of $1500.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">From the allegations of the foregoing petition, it appears that the cotton in question had been delivered to the defendant, and was in its custody by virtue of a contract of shipment, and that while in its custody, it was destroyed because of the negligence of the defendant. These facts, we think, constitute a cause of action. No bill of lading was necessary to render the company responsible for negligence in taking care of the property thus delivered and in its custody. Railway v. Hall, 64 Texas, 615; Railway v. Nicholson, 61 Texas, 491; Hutch, on Carr., sec. 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Delivered June 28, 1893.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
