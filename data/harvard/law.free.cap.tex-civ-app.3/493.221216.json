Evidence of the value of the grass as hay, as well as for pasturage purposes, should be admitted for the consideration of the jury, and from a showing of all the purposes for which plaintiff\u2019s grass was useful and valuable, the jury should determine what its value was at the time at which and state in which it stood when burned.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b519-6\">Appeal from Burleson. Tried below before Hon. John Alexander, County Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-7\">This is a suit instituted in the Justice Court for $194.50 for burning 32-| acres of grass, of the value of $150, 75 posts of the value of $4.50, and injury to the turf by burning of said 32-J- acres, $40. Defendant filed answer in the Justice Court, where the case was tried, and judgment was rendered for the appellee for $194.50. Appeal was perfected to the County Court, where the case was tried before a jury, and verdict was rendered for appellee for the sum of $194.50. Before the entry of judgment in the County Court, plaintiff in open court remitted the sum of $37 from the amount of the verdict, whereupon judgment was rendered for the appellee for the sum of $157.50 and all costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-8\">The court charged the jury as follows: \u201cIf you find for the plaintiff, the measure of damages will be the difference between the value of the land alleged to have been injured immediately preceding the time of the burning and immediately after the time of burning, and you will so consider this matter from the evidence before you upon this trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-10\">Defendant was not permitted to prove the reasonable market value of grass land when used for hay or pasturage purposes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-11\"><em>J.

The correct measure was not the difference in the value of the land caused by the burning of the grass, because that was temporary. Railway v.

If the grass possessed a market value, that should be the criterion. But if, as is probable, there was no market value, considering it as useful for pasturage, its value when thus used should be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Any evidence tending to show what the grass was worth when put to any of the uses for which it was valuable should be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Evidence as to any temporary diminution of the value of the land resulting from the burning of the grass should be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remcmded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Delivered June 22, 1893.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
