Warranty deed, executed April 13, 1886, by William B. Wads-worth and wife, Julia Amelia Wadsworth, to Ludwig Jung, by which deed, for the consideration of $1000, said William B. and Julia Wads-worth conveyed to defendant Ludwig Jung 290 acres of land in Gillespie County, part of survey number 198, granted to D. C. Gilmore, assignee of C. Cooper, by letter patent number 150, volume 7, dated December 8, 1847; which deed was filed for record April 29, 1886, and duly recorded April 30, 1886, in the records of deeds of Gillespie County, Texas, in book I, pages 72 and 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">21. A deed as follows, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, S. G. Newton, surviving partner of the late firm of Hewitt <em>&amp; </em>Newton, of the county of Bexar, and State of Texas, for and'in consideration of $209.30, to me paid by Louis Young, have this day sold unto the said Louis Young, of the county of Gillespie and State of Texas, the following described property, to-wit, 150 acres of land on Palo Alto Creek, in Gillespie County, being the northeast part of survey number 198, in section number 1, together with all the rights and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anywise incident or appertaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">\u201cTo have and to hold the above described property unto the said Young, his heirs, assigns, or legal representatives forever. And I hereby warrant and will forever defend the title to the same against any and all claims lawfully made.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">\u201c In testimony whereof, I hereunto sign my name, at San Antonio, this 13th day of July, 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">\u201c S. G. Newton,</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">\u201c Surviving partner of Hewitt &amp; Newton.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">\u201c Witness:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">\u201cA. O. Coolet,</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">\u201cWilliam Lookf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">Which deed was filed for record November 18, 1865, and duly recorded November 18, 1865, in the records of deeds of the county of Gillespie, Texas, in book H, pages 372 and 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">22. It was shown by the testimony of H. R. Biberstein, a surveyor, that there is an excess of 40 to 50 acres in the Camel Cooper one-third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>league survey (number 198) on Palo Alto <em>Creek, </em>in Gillespie County; and that deducting the quantity of land sold to Julius and C. Broclcmann, Moritz, Behrends, Itz, and the 150 acres sold by S. G. Newton to Jung, from the quantity of land actually contained in the original survey, leaves from 291 to 293 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">23. It was shown by the evidence of A. 0. Cooley that said J. and C. Brockmann, E. Moritz, C. Behrends, and P. Itz bought their respective tracts of land and paid for them the amounts stated in their deeds, and took possession thereof prior to the partition between Galen Hodges and D. C. Gilmore, and that they each purchased without notice of the rights of Galen Hodges.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Opinion.\u2014This is an action of trespass to try title. Appellants, as husband and wife, were plaintiffs in the court below, and claimed the land as the property of appellant Anna Munnink.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The land sued for is about 291 acres in Gillespie County, Texas, part of a third of a league survey, patented to D. C Gilmore, assignee of Camel Cooper, and is described by metes and bounds in appellants\u2019 petition as follows: \u201c Beginning at the southwest corner of said survey number 198, 'thence north 1911 varas to the south boundary line of said Ludwig Jung\u2019s said 150 acres of land; thence east 867 varas to the southwest corner of said Ludwig Jung\u2019s 150 acres tract; thence south 1911 varas to the south boundary line of said survey number 198; and thence west 867 varas to the place of beginning.\u201d The Camel Cooper survey is designated as number 198 in section 1, on Palo Alto Creek, and it was patented in 1847 to D. C. Gilmore, as assignee of Camel Cooper. In 1856 Galen Hodges obtained a judgment in the District Court of Bexar County, against L. W. Alexander and the estate of D. C. Gilmore, vesting title in Hodges to the west half of said survey; and in May, 1858, Hodges conveyed the west half of his half of the survey to Ira L. Hewitt and S. G. Newton.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Appellants claim under a deed executed by Thomas G. Williams, as administrator of the estate of Ira L. Hewitt, and by S. G. Newton by his attorney in fact Thomas G. Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The order of the Probate Court under which the sale was made describes the land as \u201c 320 acres of land, survey number 198, section number 1, Palo Alto Creek.\u201d The inventory gives precisely the same description.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The order of the court confirming the sale describes it as \u201c 320 acres in survey number 198, section 1, on Palo Alto Creek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The deed executed by Thomas G. Williams, as administrator of the estate of Ira L. Hewitt and attorney in fact for S. G. Newton, purports to convey \u201call the right, title, and interest\u201d of said estate and of said S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>G. Newton in and to \u201c 320 acres, survey 198, section number 1, on Palo Alto Creek, in Gillespie County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">That this deed, aided by all the probate orders found in the record, did not convey the interest in the land sued for which belonged to the estate of Hewitt, is well settled. Norris v. Hunt, 51 Texas, 609. And while the same certainty of description is not required in conveyances voluntarily executed by the owner of property that is necessary to pass title under a judicial sale, still we do not think that this deed, aided, as it legitimately may be, by all the pertinent testimony in the record, conveyed Newton\u2019s interest in the land described in appellant\u2019s petition and sued for herein. It does not purport to convey Newton\u2019s interest in the original survey, nor an undivided interest of 320 or any other number of acres therein; but attempts to convey his \u201c right, title, and interest\u201d in an undesignated and undescribed 320 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The record does not show, even if such showing would suffice, that Newton, at the time the deed was executed, owned or claimed an interest in exactly 320 acres of the original survey. In fact, the record shows that prior to that time, acting as surviving partner of the firm of Hewitt &amp; Newton, he had sold and conveyed 150 acres of the Camel Cooper survey, and though the description given in the deed locates it in the northeast corner, the intention was to convey that number of acres in the northwest corner, part of the 369 acres conveyed by Galen Hodges to Hewitt &amp; Newton. If the original survey contained only 320 acres, then it might be held that the intention was to convey all Newton\u2019s interest in the survey. But, considering all the facts disclosed by the record, and the description given in the deed under consideration, it does not appear with reasonable certainty what particular 320 acres of the survey he intended to convey his interest in. Dev. on Deeds, sec. 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The fact that the court rendered judgment for appellee Ludwig Jung for 150 acres of land in the northwest corner of the survey affords appellants no ground of complaint. They alleged in their petition that said Jung owned this 150 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">If the court improperly excluded the evidence offered to explain the deed from John C. Jones to appellant Anna Munnink, the error is harmless. No such testimony was offered to aid the deed from Hewitt\u2019s estate and S. G. Newton; and if the excluded testimony had been admitted, appellants\u2019 title would still have been incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We find no reversible error in the record, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Delivered May 10, 1893.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
