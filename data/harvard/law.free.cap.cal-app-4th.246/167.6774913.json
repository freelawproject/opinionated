Code, \u00a7 288.7, subd. (b)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of attempted sexual intercourse (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 288.7, subd. (a)), and two counts of lewd or lascivious conduct (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)) \u2014 committed against an eight-year-old girl, D.C.; he was convicted of two additional sex offenses \u2014 two counts of lewd or lascivious conduct (\u00a7 288, subd. (a))\u2014 committed against D.C.\u2019s 10-year-old sister, M.C. The jury also found defendant committed lewd or lascivious acts against more than one victim. (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (e)(4).) The trial court sentenced defendant to serve 65 years to life in state prison and imposed other orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) the evidence was insufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the crime of sexual penetration; (2) the trial court abused its discretion and violated his constitutional right to due process by excluding certain evidence he claims was admissible to impeach testimony from the victims\u2019 older brother, S.S., who saw defendant\u2019s attempt to have sex with D.C. and called the police; (3) the trial court abused its discretion and violated his confrontation, due process, and jury trial rights by allowing testimony from an expert on child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome (CSAAS); (4) the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct in violation of defendant\u2019s right to due process; (5) the trial court\u2019s imposition of three consecutive life terms amounted to an unauthorized sentence and a denial of due process; and (6) the cumulative effect of the foregoing assertions of error deprived defendant of his right to due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">We affirm defendant\u2019s convictions and remand the matter for resen-tencing. As we explain, while there was no <em>direct </em>evidence of the specific act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of sexual penetration defendant was convicted of committing, other than his confession during interrogation, the circumstantial evidence was more than sufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the crime. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered evidence purportedly relevant to impeach S.S. or by allowing the challenged CSAAS testimony. Defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct is forfeited by his failure to object and request a curative instruction. Nor did defense counsel\u2019s failure to so object amount to constitutionally deficient performance. Defendant\u2019s assertion of cumulative prejudice also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">We do, however, agree the matter must be remanded for a new sentencing hearing. While the trial court\u2019s imposition of three consecutive life terms is not unauthorized, and therefore defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to this sentence below arguably forfeits the issue on appeal, it is apparent from the record that the trial court believed it was required to impose full, separate, and consecutive terms pursuant to section 667.6, subdivision (d), and rule 4.426 of the California Rules of Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that were not applicable to this case. Assuming the issue is forfeited, we conclude defense counsel\u2019s failure to object and correct the trial court\u2019s misunderstanding amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Defendant was 19 years old and volunteering at an after-school program when he met S.S. Despite the fact defendant was seven or eight years older than S.S., the two became friends. About a month later, defendant met S.S.\u2019s mother, C.C., at the after-school program and was invited over to their house to meet her husband, J.A., with whom defendant shared an interest in automotive repair and body work. At the house, defendant also met the other children in the household, D.C., M.C., and their younger brother, E.C. Over the course of about a year, defendant and J.A. became friends and worked on cars together. Defendant also routinely watched the children when their parents went out.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In August 2011, defendant committed the crimes involved in this case. He was 20 years old. His victims, D.C. and M.C., were eight years old and 10 years old, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\n<em>Crimes against M.C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Defendant stayed the night at the family\u2019s house on August 1, 2011. While watching a movie with the children in the living room, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>touched M.C. twice with his hand on her vaginal area, over her clothes, removing it about \u201ctwo seconds\u201d after M.C. told him to \u201cstop.\u201d The next morning, defendant was asked to watch the children while C.C. went to work and J.A. went to Pick-n-Pull. He agreed. Before J.A. left, M.C. told him defendant was \u201cbothering\u201d her; not understanding the seriousness of the situation, J.A. told her to \u201cjust tell him to stop bothering you.\u201d That day, the children had various chores to do. Defendant contributed by helping S.S. with the yard work. As defendant watered the front lawn, M.C. passed by him on her way to get a hedge trimmer for S.S. Defendant reached out and briefly touched her chest with the back of his hand. Believing defendant did so \u201con purpose\u201d because \u201che was smiling,\u201d M.C. told him to \u201cstop.\u201d Defendant responded that \u201che wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201d When she again passed by defendant to get a shovel for S.S., defendant again reached out and briefly touched her with the back of his hand, this time on her vaginal area. M.C. again told him to \u201cstop.\u201d Defendant again said he \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Defendant confirmed in his statement to police that he touched M.C.\u2019s chest \u201clike one time\u201d and he touched her vaginal area \u201clike twice,\u201d always over her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Based on these facts, as previously mentioned, defendant was convicted of two counts of committing a lewd or lascivious act on M.C., a child under the age of 14 years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\n<em>Crimes against D.C.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">After defendant finished watering the lawn, the children asked to play in the swimming pool. Defendant agreed. While he and S.S. finished up the yard work, the other children went inside the house to change into swimming suits. After the children had changed, defendant went into S.S.\u2019s bedroom to change into some shorts. The record is unclear as to whether D.C. was already in the bedroom when defendant came in, or whether she came into the room after defendant had changed. Either way, she began playing with S.S.\u2019s guitar on the bottom bunk of the bunk beds S.S. shared with his younger brother, E.C. Defendant took the guitar away and climbed on top of her. By his own account, he pulled her swimming suit to the side to expose her vagina, and pulled up one of the leg openings of his shorts to allow him to pull out his penis. He then attempted to insert his penis into D.C.\u2019s vagina, but was unsuccessful because his penis was not erect.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Unbeknownst to defendant, S.S. had entered the house looking for D.C. Having seen defendant touch M.C.\u2019s buttocks on two previous occasions, S.S. decided to keep \u201ca closer eye on him.\u201d With this purpose in mind, S.S. entered the house quietly through the back door, \u201csnuck around the corner to check the living room,\u201d and then \u201cwent down the hallway a little.\u201d From the hallway, S.S. saw defendant on top of D.C. on the bed. Defendant\u2019s \u201chip area . . . was moving up and down.\u201d D.C. told defendant to \u201c[s]top.\u201d Defendant responded: \u201cJust go with it.\u201d S.S. \u201cstood there for about a minute\u201d trying to decide what to do. He considered confronting defendant, but \u201cfigured if [he] did that, that [defendant] would leave and would most likely, probably, get away with it.\u201d Instead, S.S. left the house \u201cto go call the cops.\u201d On his way out, S.S. told M.C. to \u201cstay outside\u201d and that he \u201cwould be back.\u201d He then got on his bicycle and rode to a neighbor\u2019s house. When this neighbor was not home, S.S. rode to a nearby gas station and used a stranger\u2019s cell phone to call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Meanwhile, according to defendant\u2019s statement to police, he stopped his assault on D.C. shortly after it began and allowed her to go outside to play with her siblings. Defendant also told police he penetrated D.C.\u2019s vagina with one of his fingers while giving her a piggyback ride down the hallway. His statement is unclear as to when exactly this took place, except that it happened before he tried having sex with her and she was already wearing her swimming suit. Regardless of the precise timing, defendant admitted; \u201cI was tryinfg] to put it in there. My finger.\u201d He also admitted he succeeded in penetrating D.C.\u2019s vagina with his finger. When asked whether it turned him on, defendant answered: \u201cUh, yes, a little.\u201d When asked whether it probably caused him to then try something more with D.C., defendant responded: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Based on these facts, as previously mentioned, defendant was convicted of one count of sexual penetration, one count of attempted sexual intercourse, and two counts of committing a lewd or lascivious act on D.C., a child under the age of 14 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Police arrived at the house a short time after S.S. made the call to 911. Defendant was taken into custody, advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and questioned. He eventually admitted to touching M.C.\u2019s vagina and chest over her clothes, penetrating D.C.\u2019s vagina with his finger while giving her a piggyback ride, and attempting to penetrate her vagina with his penis while on the bed. Defendant also wrote down that he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d when he \u201ctr[ied] to put something in [D.C.],\u201d but he \u201cwas not thrusting\u201d and stopped when she told him to stop. He also wrote a letter apologizing to the family for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Establish the Corpus Delicti of Sexual Penetration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the crime of sexual penetration. He is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u201cIn every criminal trial, the prosecution must prove the corpus delicti, or the body of the crime itself \u2014 i.e., the fact of injury, loss, or harm, and the existence of a criminal agency as its cause. In California, it has traditionally been held, the prosecution cannot satisfy this burden by relying <em>exclusively </em>upon the extrajudicial statements, confessions, or admissions of the defendant. [Citations.] Though mandated by no statute, and never deemed a constitutional guaranty, the rule requiring some independent proof of the corpus delicti has roots in the common law. [Citation.] California decisions have applied it at least since the 1860\u2019s. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1168-1169 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 46 P.3d 372] <em>(Alvarez).) </em>\u201cThe purpose of the corpus delicti rule is to assure that \u2018the accused is not admitting to a crime that never occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Jones </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 279, 301 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 793, 949 P.2d 890] <em>(Jones), </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 368 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009] <em>(Jennings).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u201cThe independent proof may be circumstantial and need not be beyond a reasonable doubt, but is sufficient if it permits an inference of criminal conduct, even if a noncriminal explanation is also plausible. [Citations.] There is no requirement of independent evidence \u2018of every physical act constituting an element of an offense,\u2019 so long as there is some slight or prima facie showing of injury, loss, or harm by a criminal agency. [Citation.] In every case, once the necessary quantum of independent evidence is present, the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements may then be considered for their full value to strengthen the case on all issues. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1171; see <em>People v. Robbins </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 867, 885-886 [248 Cal.Rptr. 172, 755 P.2d 355] <em>(Robbins), </em>superseded by statute on another ground as stated in <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 387, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Defendant argues: \u201cThere was no evidence of count one, digital penetration of [D.C.] when she was on [defendant\u2019s] back (\u00a7 288.7, subd. (b)), other than [defendant\u2019s] own admission, in the course of the police interrogation, that he had touched her in that way while giving her a piggyback ride.\u201d We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>defendant\u2019s admission is the only <em>direct </em>evidence of the digital penetration. D.C. did not testify to this specific criminal act and did not reveal it in the special assault forensic evaluation (SAFE) interview. Nor did anyone else witness the crime. Nevertheless, we conclude the circumstantial evidence is more than sufficient to establish the corpus delicti of sexual penetration. In so concluding, we find three decisions of our Supreme Court to be particularly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">In <em>Jones, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 279, the defendant and another man, Tron\u00e9, abducted the victim and committed various sex offenses against her, including forcible rape and forcible oral copulation, before the defendant shot her in the head and left her to die on the side of an isolated road. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 291-292.) The defendant admitted to police that Tron\u00e9 forced the victim to orally copulate him in the backseat while the defendant drove. Accordingly, in addition to murder and other crimes, the defendant was charged with forcible oral copulation as an accomplice. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 300.) However, while semen was found in and around the victim\u2019s vagina and rectal area, no semen was found in her mouth. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 302.) The defendant argued at the preliminary hearing that the prosecution had no independent evidence of the corpus delicti of forcible oral copulation. The magistrate agreed and did not hold him to answer for that crime. The defendant then filed a motion under section 995 to set aside the subsequent information that charged the defendant with forcible oral copulation notwithstanding the magistrate\u2019s ruling. The trial court denied the motion, finding the prosecution\u2019s corpus delicti burden had been met. <em>(Jones, </em>at pp. 300-301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Our Supreme Court agreed with the trial court, explaining: the victim \u201cwas found some 10 feet from the roadway on a dirt median. She had been shot in the head and was alive when found, but died shortly thereafter. Medical experts found bruises on her thighs, knees, legs, and perineal area. She also exhibited injuries on her hands. Results from the sexual assault kit revealed the presence of semen inside her vagina, on her external genitalia, and in her rectal area. No trace of semen was found in [the victim]\u2019s mouth; an expert testified, however, that negative test results were not inconsistent with oral copulation because the mouth\u2019s natural rinsing processes eliminate semen. [The victim] was not wearing underpants, a brassiere, or shoes. Evidence showed she customarily wore such clothing.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 302.) The court continued: \u201cKeeping in mind the low threshold of proof required to satisfy the corpus delicti rule, we conclude that the magistrate erred in finding this low threshold was not met by the evidence presented at the preliminary examination. The state of the victim\u2019s clothing (no underwear or shoes) and the forensic evidence (semen in the victim\u2019s vagina and on her external genitalia and anus) indicates multiple sexual acts occurred. That the victim was forcibly abducted, beaten, shot in the head, and left by the side of the road for dead gives rise to an inference that the sexual activity that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>occurred was against the victim\u2019s will. This circumstantial evidence of multiple forcible sexual acts sufficiently establishes the requisite prima facie showing of both (i) an injury, loss or harm, and (ii) the involvement of a criminal agency.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court also rejected the defendant\u2019s argument \u201cthat the lack of evidence of the <em>specific </em>loss or harm,\u201d i.e., the fact that no semen was found in the victim\u2019s mouth, \u201cis fatal to the establishment of the corpus delicti\u201d of forcible oral copulation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Relying on <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 334, and <em>Robbins, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 867, which we discuss immediately below, the court held the corpus delicti requirement is \u201cnot so strict.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 334, the defendant, who was convicted of multiple murders, challenged an accompanying rape conviction as unsupported by sufficient evidence of the corpus delicti. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 366.) Our Supreme Court found the evidence, although \u201cminimal,\u201d to be sufficient, explaining: \u201cThe evidence shows that the victim . . . was found, unclothed, in an irrigation canal. She had been dead several weeks. Although her body was badly decomposed, experts determined she had suffered a broken jaw. While this evidence would satisfy the corpus delicti of murder (there being evidence that she died through the involvement of a criminal agency), the evidence of rape was not strong. For example, because of the advanced state of decay, there was no evidence of seminal fluids on the body [citations], or evidence of penetration [citations]. Further, there was no evidence that the victim\u2019s clothes were arranged in such a manner as to suggest a sexual assault. [Citation.] [\u00b6] Although the evidence of rape is thus minimal, we nevertheless deem it sufficient to satisfy the corpus delicti rule. When the body of a young woman is found unclothed in a remote locale, an inference arises that some sexual activity occurred, thus satisfying the requirement that there be some showing of a loss, injury, or harm. . . . [\u00b6] While the inference of sexual activity is by no means the only, or even the most compelling, one in this case [citation], it nevertheless remains a <em>reasonable </em>one, at least for corpus delicti purposes. Further, it is important that the victim was found in a location where her lack of clothing was not easily explainable, that she was dead, and that she had suffered a broken jaw. From these factors, we may infer that whatever sexual activity occurred, it occurred against the victim\u2019s will. The evidence thus satisfies the second prong of the corpus delicti rule, i.e., the involvement of a criminal agency.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 367-368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Similarly, in <em>Robbins, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 867, another murder case, our Supreme Court held the following to be sufficient independent evidence of the corpus delicti of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child: \u201cDefendant was seen by one witness riding a motorcycle in the area of (and on the date of) the victim\u2019s disappearance, and the victim was last seen by another witness riding a motorcycle with a man matching defendant\u2019s description; no clothes were found at the scene of the crime; defendant\u2019s own experts described his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u2018primary diagnosis\u2019 as pedophilia; his admission of similar sexual conduct as to the very similar Texas crimes was confirmed by scientific evidence; and finally, the physical evidence of the homicide lends reliability to other aspects of defendant\u2019s confession, namely, his description of the lewd and lascivious conduct. In view of the nature of the offense and the circumstances of this case (i.e., the body was not discovered for some time, hence it was impossible to verify the sexual conduct by scientific evidence, and there were apparently no eyewitnesses to the crime) we do not believe the corpus delicti rule can be interpreted to call for more; the law does not require impossible showings.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Returning to <em>Jones, </em>supra, 17 Cal.4th 279, our Supreme Court stated: \u201cAs <em>Jennings </em>and <em>Robbins </em>demonstrate, we have never interpreted the corpus delicti rule so strictly that independent evidence of every physical act constituting an element of an offense is necessary. Instead, there need only be independent evidence establishing a slight or prima facie showing of some injury, loss or harm, and that a criminal agency was involved.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Here, defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, independent of his confession, to establish the corpus delicti of sexual penetration with a child who is 10 years of age or younger. (\u00a7 288.7, subd. (b).) Conviction of this crime requires proof that (1) the defendant engaged in \u201cthe act of causing the penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal opening of any person or causing another person to so penetrate the defendant\u2019s or another person\u2019s genital or anal opening for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse by any foreign object, substance, instrument, or device, or by any unknown object\u201d (\u00a7 289, subd. (k)(l)), and (2) the defendant did so \u201cwith a child who is 10 years of age or younger\u201d (\u00a7 288.7, subd. (b)). There can be no doubt the crime is sufficiently established, beyond a reasonable doubt, when his confession is considered. He admitted to intentionally penetrating D.C.\u2019s vagina with his finger. There is no dispute D.C. was eight years old at the time. And based on defendant\u2019s statements in his confession and his conduct both before and after the penetration, i.e., touching M.C. inappropriately before the penetration and attempting to have sex with D.C. immediately thereafter, the jury could have reasonably inferred defendant\u2019s purpose in so penetrating was sexual arousal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">However, in order for defendant\u2019s confession to be considered for its full value to strengthen the case on all issues (see <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1171), there must be, independent of defendant\u2019s confession, \u201csome slight or prima facie showing of injury, loss, or harm by a criminal agency\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>As in <em>Jones, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 279, <em>Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 334, and <em>Robbins, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 867, there is no direct evidence, aside from defendant\u2019s confession, that the specific prohibited act occurred. But that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>not required. In <em>Jones, </em>the prima facie showing of injury, loss, or harm was supplied by circumstantial evidence that <em>other </em>sexual acts occurred, i.e., semen in and around the vagina and rectal area and the absence of underwear and shoes on the body. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 302.) In <em>Jennings, </em>the fact that the victim\u2019s body was found unclothed in a remote location supplied the requisite circumstantial evidence that <em>\u201csome </em>sexual activity occurred, thus satisfying the requirement that there be some showing of a loss, injury, or harm.\u201d <em>(Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 367, italics added.) And in <em>Robbins, </em>the lack of clothing on the body, evidence of the defendant\u2019s pedophilia diagnosis, and evidence substantiating his admission to other similar crimes supplied the prima facie showing of injury, loss, or harm. <em>(Robbins, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 886.) In each case, circumstantial evidence that <em>some </em>sexual activity occurred, coupled with circumstantial evidence the activity was criminal, satisfied the corpus delicti requirement; the defendant\u2019s statement could then be considered for its full value to fill in the precise nature of the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Here, there is a much greater showing. Unlike the foregoing murder cases, where the evidence of sexual activity was circumstantial, here, D.C. testified defendant touched her vagina on the bed. S.S. testified defendant was on top of D.C. on the bed, moving his hips up and down, while D.C. told him to \u201c[sjtop\u201d and defendant responded; \u201cJust go with it.\u201d M.C. testified defendant also touched her inappropriately, supplying direct evidence of the crimes committed against her and circumstantial evidence defendant also engaged in sexual conduct with D.C.

(a); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Merriman </em>(2014) 60 Cal.4th 1, 40 [177 Cal.Rptr.3d <em>1, </em>332 P.3d 1187] [evidence of sexual assault cross-admissible under Evid.

Catlin </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 145 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 26 P.3d 357] [other crimes evidence admissible to prove corpus delicti].) Thus, we have both direct and circumstantial evidence of sexual activity engaged in by defendant against D.C., and since she was eight years old at the time, there can be no dispute the activity was criminal in nature. We hold this evidence is more than sufficient to provide a prima facie showing of injury, loss, or harm by a criminal agency, such that defendant\u2019s confession may be considered for its full value to fill in the precise nature of the crimes committed against D.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Nor are we persuaded by defendant\u2019s assertion D.C. \u201crepeatedly denied that any such event occurred.\u201d In the SAFE interview, D.C. stated defendant \u201ctried touching\u201d her \u201cprivate part,\u201d which she indicated was her vagina, in the bedroom while she sat on the bed. While he did so, defendant said, \u201cjust let me, just let me,\u201d to which D.C. said, \u201cno\u201d and was eventually able to run outside. D.C. then stated S.S. went to the gas station to call the police because defendant \u201ckept on touching [her] there.\u201d She then said defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was \u201ctrying to touch [her].\u201d A short time later, D.C. said he did touch her vagina on top of her swimming suit three times while she told him to \u201cstop\u201d and tried to get away from him. The interviewer then asked D.C. whether defendant had done \u201canything else,\u201d whether he had touched her \u201cany other time besides that time,\u201d and whether \u201canything else ever happened.\u201d To each question, D.C. answered: \u201cNo.\u201d She also said defendant did not use \u201cany other part of his body,\u201d other than his hand, to touch her vagina. At trial, D.C. clarified defendant did not simply \u201ctry to touch\u201d her vagina with his hand while she was on the bed; he did so, and continued to touch her despite her demand for him to stop. D.C. did not remember much of what she had previously told the SAFE interviewer. She did, however, agree with defense counsel\u2019s leading questions: \u201cAnd [defendant] never did anything else to you; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d and, \u201c[i]sn\u2019t it true, [D.C.], [defendant] never put his finger in you, did he?\u201d and \u201c[defendant] never gave you a piggy-baclc ride, correct?\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether she understood what it meant to have something inside of her, D.C. answered: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">From the foregoing, it is apparent D.C. did not fully understand what defendant was doing to her on the bed. However, her testimony and statements in the SAFE interview, along with S.S.\u2019s eyewitness testimony, provide more than enough independent evidence that she suffered some injury, loss, or harm by a criminal agency. Her description of being touched on the bed corroborated defendant\u2019s statement to police concerning the same conduct, although we know from his statement that he actually pulled her swimming suit to the side and tried to insert his penis in her vagina. In turn, this corroboration lent reliability to defendant\u2019s additional confession that he also penetrated D.C.\u2019s vagina while giving her a piggyback ride down the hallway, which he admitted turned him on and probably caused him to then try to have sex with her in the bedroom. Based on this corroboration, we are confident defendant confessed to the penetration, not because of \u201c \u2018improper police activity or [his] mental instability\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jennings, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 368), but because it actually happened. Nor are we troubled by the fact D.C. did not remember the piggyback ride. She was eight years old at the time of these crimes. By defendant\u2019s own statement, the actual penetration while D.C. was on his back was a fleeting event and the penetration was slight.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We conclude there was sufficient evidence, independent of defendant\u2019s confession to police, to establish the corpus delicti of sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">ii-vr<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Defendant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.
