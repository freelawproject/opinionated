By all accounts, defendant was mentally disturbed when he did so. The central dispute during both the guilt and sanity phases of his murder trial involved the nature and severity of the disturbance \u2014 in the guilt phase, whether defendant actually \u201cpremeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice aforethought\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 28); in the sanity phase, whether defendant was \u201cincapable of knowing or understanding the nature and quality of his . . . act and of distinguishing right from wrong\u201d- \u2014 -when he stabbed his mother to death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u00a7 25, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder, during the commission of which he personally used a deadly weapon, and further found he was legally sane when he committed the crime. The trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for an indeterminate term of 15 years to life for the murder, plus a consecutive determinate term of one year for the use of a deadly weapon, and imposed other orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address and reject defendant\u2019s claims that (1) the trial court prejudicially erred and violated his federal constitutional right to due process by instructing the jury, during the guilt phase of the trial, with CALCRIM No. 362 on consciousness of guilt along with CALCRIM No. 3428 on the limited use of evidence of mental impairment and (2) the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder. With respect to the first claim, defendant argues the trial court should have modified CALCRIM No. 3428 to allow the jury to consider evidence of his mental illness or impairment \u2014 in addition to determining whether he premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice \u2014 in determining whether certain untruthful statements were knowingly made, and therefore evidenced his consciousness of guilt. As we explain, defendant did not object to either CALCRIM No. 362 or CALCRIM No. 3428 as given to the jury in this case. He has therefore forfeited the contention unless the claimed error affected his substantial rights, i.e., resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 919, 927 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 903].) While we agree the instruction should have been modified, on this record, there was no miscarriage of justice. Nor were defendant\u2019s due process rights violated. Accordingly, the claim is forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-7\">With respect to the second claim, we conclude there is no substantial evidence in this record indicating defendant did not actually form the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>to kill when he stabbed his mother 10 times with a kitchen knife. While there is substantial evidence indicating he may have believed she was a demon when he did so, whether or not this delusion existed, and if so, whether or not the delusion exonerated defendant for killing \u2014 with express malice \u2014 the person he believed to be a demon, was properly reserved for the sanity phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. Specifically, we reject his claim the trial court prejudicially erred and violated his federal constitutional rights by excluding certain out-of-court statements defendant made, e.g., that demons were coming after him, and admitting other out-of-court statements establishing the same, but limited the jury\u2019s consideration of these statements to circumstantially prove defendant\u2019s state of mind, rather than allowing the jury to consider the statements to prove the truth of the matters asserted. The latter statements were properly admitted as circumstantial evidence of defendant\u2019s state of mind, i.e., that he was hallucinating, and <em>not </em>to prove demons were actually coming after him. And while certain statements were improperly excluded, the error was harmless because the jury heard ample evidence to support the conclusion defendant was hallucinating. We also reject defendant\u2019s claim the trial court prejudicially erred and violated his constitutional rights by instructing the jury, during both the guilt and sanity phases of the trial, with a modified version of CALCRIM No. 360 regarding the testifying experts\u2019 reliance on out-of-court statements in forming their opinions. This contention is forfeited for failure to object to the modified instruction below; while we conclude the instruction was technically incorrect in certain respects, the error did not affect defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Defendant further asserts prosecutorial misconduct, including indirect comment on his failure to testify, requires reversal. This claim is also forfeited, and his alternative claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also fails. And while defendant did request an instruction informing the jury no adverse inference may be drawn from his failure to testify, the trial court\u2019s failure to provide such an instruction was harmless. Finally, defendant\u2019s claim of cumulative prejudice also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">Following the well-established rule of appellate review, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bogle </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 770, 775 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 739].) Because defendant pleaded both not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, trial was bifurcated into guilt and sanity phases in accordance with section 1026. (See <em>People v. Elmore </em>(2014) 59 Cal.4th 121, 140-141 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 413, 325 P.3d 951] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number><em>(Elmore).) </em>The vast majority of defendant\u2019s claims on appeal relate solely to the guilt phase. Indeed, in only one of his contentions does he claim an error that occurred in the guilt phase also occurred in the sanity phase. We therefore base our factual recitation solely on the evidence adduced during the guilt phase of the trial. Sanity phase evidence will be addressed, where relevant, in the discussion portion of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">\n<em>The Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">In October 2011, defendant lived with his mother and father, Kathleen and Thomas McGehee, in Manteca.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was 26 years old. While defendant previously worked as a music instructor and server at a local restaurant, his employment \u201cground to a halt\u201d earlier in the year. Defendant\u2019s younger sister, Katelyn, also lived at the house, having moved back home the previous month after completing a master\u2019s degree program. Thomas frequently traveled for business and was out of town during the latter part of October.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">On Friday, October 28, Katelyn went to a weekend church retreat with her friend Samantha. Defendant was home when Samantha came to pick Katelyn up. Despite the fact defendant and Samantha \u201chad been good friends and he had previously been a groomsman in her . . . wedding,\u201d defendant \u201cseemed like he wasn\u2019t very comfortable\u201d talking to her and \u201cended up leaving pretty quickly.\u201d Before Katelyn left for the retreat, her mother agreed to pick her up at the University of the Pacific (UOP) in Stockton the following Sunday, October 30. The plan was for Katelyn to call her mother about an hour before she arrived at the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The morning of October 30, Kathleen went to church with one of defendant\u2019s older brothers, Justin, and his family. Sometime during the day, she called another of defendant\u2019s older brothers, Colin, and left him a voicemail. Colin returned her call around 4:00 p.m. She was making jambalaya for a potluck the following day and needed instructions on how to use the rice cooker Colin left at his parents\u2019 house when he moved out. The potluck was part of a victims advocacy training program; Kathleen signed up to become a volunteer advocate in the program through her church. Colin provided his mother with the requested instructions. Kathleen mentioned during the phone call that she planned to pick Katelyn up that evening. Colin described his mother\u2019s mood as \u201cvery good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">Around 5:00 p.m., Katelyn called her mother to let her know she was about an hour away from UOP. There was no answer so Katelyn left a message on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>the home answering machine. A few minutes later, she received a call from defendant\u2019s cell phone, but the call ended \u201calmost immediately.\u201d Katelyn thought the call was a mistake because defendant \u201calmost never\u201d called her, so she did not try to call him back. Instead, she called her mother\u2019s cell phone, which also went unanswered. Katelyn left a voicemail. About a minute later, she received another call from defendant, who claimed he was \u201cjust calling to see how [she was].\u201d Katelyn told him she had been trying to reach their mother to pick her up. Defendant responded: \u201cOh, yeah, I think the home phone hasn\u2019t really been working.\u201d Katelyn said she also tried their mother\u2019s cell phone. Defendant responded: \u201cOh, yeah, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been working, either. I think she\u2019s having trouble with those two.\u201d Assuming defendant was home, Katelyn asked him to find out whether their mother was still coming to pick her up. Defendant replied sternly: \u201cI\u2019m not at home, Katelyn. I\u2019m not at home.\u201d Katelyn then asked defendant whether their mother asked him to pick her up. Defendant denied having been asked to do so before ending the call. Katelyn found the conversation to be \u201cbizarre\u201d because defendant rarely called her, and especially not \u201cto just chat.\u201d A couple of minutes later, Katelyn tried the home phone again and left another message.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Closer to 6:00 p.m., as Katelyn was approaching UOP, she called the home phone three more times, leaving a final message, and also tried her mother\u2019s cell phone once more. Two minutes after Katelyn\u2019s last message on the answering machine, defendant again called her. This time, defendant said: \u201cOh, you know what? We actually sort of talked about that, like maybe we had talked about maybe I could come pick you up.\u201d Defendant also \u201cmade a few remarks about how [their mother] had just been seeming kind of tired that day.\u201d Katelyn agreed to have defendant pick her up and hung up the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">Kathleen was murdered in her bedroom sometime between her conversation with Colin and Katelyn\u2019s missed calls. She was stabbed 10 times in the neck, chest, and abdomen. There was also evidence of neck compression. Strong circumstantial evidence pointed to defendant as the murderer, including the fact the jacket defendant was wearing when he was arrested two days later had his mother\u2019s blood on it, there was no sign of a break-in at the house, Kathleen\u2019s bedroom was \u201cneat, orderly, nothing appeared to have been taken or broken,\u201d defendant was the only other family member at the house that weekend, the strange phone calls between defendant and Katelyn described above, and his equally strange and incriminating behavior after he picked her up at UOP, which we recount immediately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Attempts to Prevent Discovery of the Body</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Katelyn\u2019s friend Samantha and Samantha\u2019s husband, Ben, waited with Katelyn until defendant arrived at about 6:30 p.m. Katelyn and Samantha were walking another girl to her apartment near the UOP campus when defendant pulled into the parking lot. Defendant engaged in \u201csmall talk\u201d with Ben while he waited for Katelyn to get back, but Ben \u201cgot the impression he didn\u2019t want to really talk.\u201d When Katelyn and Samantha returned and joined the conversation, defendant \u201cstarted looking elsewhere\u201d and \u201cseemed uncomfortable.\u201d Samantha and Ben then helped Katelyn get her bags loaded into defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">As defendant and Katelyn drove away, defendant said he had \u201csome errands\u201d to run, including picking up his \u201cmedicine,\u201d which Katelyn understood to be marijuana. Katelyn assumed these would be local errands. Instead, defendant got on the freeway and headed north to Sacramento. During the drive, defendant seemed \u201cmore social\u201d than he had been in recent years. Katelyn described: \u201cHe actually seemed like he was in a good mood. He seemed cheerful. He was talkative and chatty and just seeming like very casual.\u201d Defendant talked \u201cpositively\u201d about their mother, saying: \u201cOh, yeah, she\u2019s been doing great on her diet. She\u2019s lost 21 pounds in the last four weeks, but this diet she\u2019s doing it\u2019s only like 500 calories a day. She\u2019s been acting really tired lately. I think it\u2019s not enough calories for her. She\u2019s been seeming really tired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">At some point, Katelyn mentioned her lips were chapped. Defendant offered to stop at a drugstore so she could pick up some Blistex, which surprised Katelyn because defendant rarely offered to do things for people, at least during the previous few months. When defendant stopped at a Walgreens in Sacramento, Katelyn went inside, bought the Blistex, and used the restroom at the store. She then returned to the car, but defendant was not there. Katelyn found defendant inside the store, \u201csort of pacing the aisles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">After Walgreens, defendant and Katelyn drove to a fast-food restaurant to get some food. They ate in the car on the way to pick up the marijuana, but defendant appeared to be lost. He apologized and said: \u201cI usually come out here in the daylight, but it\u2019s dark this time, so I\u2019m \u2014 it\u2019s throwing me off a little bit.\u201d After about an hour of \u201cdriving up and down ... the same few streets,\u201d Katelyn asked defendant: \u201cIs there a specific street that you\u2019re looking for?\u201d They arrived at the apparent destination soon thereafter, which was \u201cmaybe a minute or two away\u201d from where they started at the Walgreens. Defendant parked at a Mexican restaurant and said: \u201cI know this might seem a little strange, but Mom understands. We\u2019ve done this before. I need to park here and walk to where I\u2019m going to go.\u201d Katelyn stayed in the car and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>locked the doors. Defendant returned from wherever he went about 20 minutes later and said he vomited during the walk back to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-4\">Defendant then drove Katelyn back to their home in Manteca, arriving just before 11:00 p.m., about four hours after they left UOP. Katelyn unloaded her bags in her room and then walked to the bathroom. Defendant stopped her in the hallway and said: \u201cKatelyn, Mom\u2019s asleep.\u201d Katelyn described his tone as \u201cabrupt and urgent.\u201d She found the warning to be strange since she assumed their mother was asleep and did not normally bother her in the middle of the night. Katelyn used the bathroom and then returned to her room. At various points later in the night, she left her room and found defendant \u201csort of pacing in the hallways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">The next morning, defendant was already up when Katelyn emerged from her room. He asked whether she got his text message. Katelyn\u2019s cell phone died the night before, so she had not. Defendant explained he texted her earlier in the morning to say their mother got up at 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. and told him she had not slept well so she would be staying in bed for the day. When defendant went outside for a few minutes, Katelyn knocked lightly on their mother\u2019s door and called for her, but did not receive a response. She tried to open the door, but it was locked. Concerned, but also conflicted because of what defendant told her about their mother not sleeping well the night before, Katelyn knocked a little louder and again called for her mother, but again received no response. Katelyn then went outside to try to look into her mother\u2019s window, but the shutters were closed. Feeling like she was being \u201cparanoid\u201d because she did not have any reason to disbelieve defendant, Katelyn returned to her room. She then went about her day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">At defendant\u2019s suggestion, which he claimed was a request their mother made earlier that morning, defendant drove Katelyn to the bank so she could take care of an errand there. Katelyn described his demeanor as \u201cmuch like the previous night,\u201d explaining: \u201cHe was being unusually, you know, cheerful, seeming \u2014 being chatty and just, you know, eager to have conversations, and just being very casual.\u201d After Katelyn was done at the bank, defendant asked if she needed to go anywhere else, suggesting Target. Katelyn said she did not need to go to Target and asked if he did. Defendant answered: \u201cNot really. Just for fun. Just to go walk around Target.\u201d Katelyn then asked to go to the AT&amp;T store located on the way back to the house to buy a phone charger. Defendant suggested they go to a different AT&amp;T store farther away from the house. After picking up the charger, they returned home. Katelyn then went out to lunch with a friend. When she returned later in the afternoon, defendant was not home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">Around 5:30 p.m., still seeing no sign of her mother, Katelyn decided to check on her again. Knocking on her door and calling for her, progressively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>louder with each attempt, Katelyn again received no response. She then called her brother Justin, who told her to call 911, which she did. Emergency responders arrived a short time later, broke the lock off the bedroom door, and found Kathleen\u2019s body in the condition previously described. Police were then dispatched to the scene. Defendant was arrested early the next morning. As mentioned, his mother\u2019s blood was on his jacket when he was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">\n<em>State of Mind Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">In college, defendant was \u201cenergetic,\u201d \u201coutgoing,\u201d \u201cfriendly and sociable.\u201d This began to change sometime between 2008 and 2010. According to Katelyn, he became reluctant to engage in social interaction and was \u201cnot very cheerful.\u201d During the two months Katelyn was back home before the murder, she and defendant \u201chad barely spoken.\u201d However, she did see defendant being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to their mother on more than one occasion during these two months. The worst such incident involved defendant, in Katelyn\u2019s words, \u201cjust berating her and belittling her.\u201d Katelyn continued: \u201cShe would speak up for herself sometimes, but [defendant] would usually just stare her down, and he just was more powerful with words than she was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Defendant\u2019s older brother Justin testified to changes he observed in defendant\u2019s physical movements, placing the onset of these changes around April 2011. That month, police officers responded to their parents\u2019 house based on a reported disturbance between defendant and their father that apparently involved defendant\u2019s belief his parents could not kick him out of the house without initiating eviction proceedings; one of the responding officers informed defendant he could in fact be removed from the house without such proceedings. According to Justin, it was after this incident that defendant\u2019s physical movements changed. Justin described: \u201cI observed him begin to exhibit a lot of physical mannerisms, physical behaviors that I hadn\u2019t seen before, and it was very sudden, sudden emerging of those things, not a very gradual one. It was very sudden. He began exhibiting lots of shaking mannerisms. He would look off to the side. He would talk differently, in a stuttering, halting way.\u201d Justin also explained he had seen similar mannerisms in an uncle, Kathleen\u2019s brother, who had died of Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, unlike his uncle\u2019s symptoms, defendant\u2019s mannerisms appeared to come and go. Justin described an incident in which defendant was reading a children\u2019s book to Justin\u2019s children when they were over at the house: \u201cI observed as he sat down t\u00f3 read to them and he began talking, all of his stuttering stopped and all of his physical shaking stopped. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [Later,] I saw his body go from completely normal, functioning normally, to suddenly resuming all of those physical shaking and eye movements and voice shaking. It went from on to off as he was reading and all the way back on when he was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>Justin also testified to a change in his mother\u2019s behavior before the murder. He explained she had been a \u201ccaretaker\u201d for both her brother who died of Parkinson\u2019s disease and her sister who died of a brain tumor, and she gravitated towards caring for defendant after her siblings passed away. According to Justin, his mother treated her children \u201cvery differently\u201d depending on \u201chow much life difficulty she believed [they] were experiencing,\u201d and based on that criterion, defendant received the most attention from her. Justin described her as \u201cfar more protective of him . . . than she was . . . of everyone else in her life put together.\u201d She also actively avoided conflict and made decisions based on whether the decision would upset anyone. However, when she began training to become a victim\u2019s advocate, she \u201cbegan to be more assertive.\u201d Justin explained he \u201cobserved her begin to say and do little things that were the kinds of things that would make someone mad because she believed it needed to be said or done,\u201d which was something she would never have done in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Defendant saw a psychiatrist, Dr. John Yarbrough, on two occasions during the weeks preceding the murder. Dr. Yarbrough described defendant as \u201cnoticeably agitated\u201d during the first interview, elaborating: \u201cHe was writhing, moving. He looked very restless, very uncomfortable. That was pretty much throughout the interview. And at different parts of the interview when we were talking about things that were very difficult to talk [about] he would demonstrate difficulty breathing, and it was very difficult even for someone to talk to him and watch the struggle that he was going through.\u201d Dr. Yarbrough diagnosed defendant as having posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and conversion disorder, the latter diagnosis pertaining to the abnormal physical movements that had no known medical reason. Defendant was taking Celexa, an antidepressant, prior to the first appointment. Dr. Yarbrough increased the dosage and added another medication, Klonopin, for the anxiety. Two weeks later, defendant came back for a follow-up appointment. His abnormal movements were slightly decreased during the second interview, but were \u201cstill quite visible.\u201d During neither appointment did defendant complain of auditory or visual hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">Based on the foregoing, and on expert testimony from Dr. Kent Rogerson, a psychiatrist who evaluated defendant following the murder and concluded he did not have a psychotic disorder, but instead suffered from \u201cmarijuana dependence in institutional remission!,] anxiety disorder with panic attacks and psychosomatic symptomatology, [and] adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression,\u201d the prosecution argued to the jury that defendant killed his mother with malice and with premeditation and deliberation. According to the prosecution\u2019s theory, defendant\u2019s mother was his caregiver and defender, at least until the incident that brought the police to the house the April before the murder. During that incident, defendant\u2019s mother did not come to his defense, but instead took her husband\u2019s side and acquiesced in defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>being told he could be kicked out at any time. From that point on, defendant started to mimic the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease he had seen his uncle exhibit in an attempt to gain his mother\u2019s sympathy. At the same time, his mother was becoming more assertive due to her victim\u2019s advocacy training, which led to confrontations with defendant, and ultimately to him stabbing her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">The defense theory was that defendant, if he killed his mother at all, did so because of hallucinations that demons were coming after him, negating the element of malice required for murder and the elements of premeditation and deliberation required for first degree murder. This theory was based on the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Dr. Wendy Weiss, a psychologist appointed by the trial court to evaluate defendant, testified he suffered from schizophrenia. She based this diagnosis on her review of the police case file, defendant\u2019s previous psychiatric records, and an interview with defendant she conducted at the jail. During the interview, defendant\u2019s grooming was \u201csloppy\u201d and he made \u201codd gestures\u201d with his hands, \u201crubbing his left arm with his right hand and . . . rubbing his abdomen in an unusual manner.\u201d Defendant also \u201ccomplained a lot about physical discomfort,\u201d explaining he felt like there was \u201cfire on his skin\u201d and \u201cblades under his fingernails.\u201d Defendant\u2019s history revealed he saw a psychiatrist in 2010, \u201ccomplaining of anxiety and hallucinations,\u201d was diagnosed with an unspecified \u201cpsychotic disorder,\u201d and prescribed perphenazine, an antipsychotic medication. He also reported hallucinations to at least one therapist he saw around the same time. Dr. Weiss also reviewed defendant\u2019s journal, which contained \u201cvoluminous\u201d references to religious concepts that Dr. Weiss concluded, \u201cwent well beyond simply having religious beliefs.\u201d In the journal, defendant recounted visions in which Jesus and the Holy Spirit visited him in different forms. However, at some point, the visions or hallucinations became darker, involving \u201cbeing basically haunted by demons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">Two of defendant\u2019s friends, Andrew Green and Jeffrey Moorehouse, also testified he complained of being tormented by demons. Green described an incident in which defendant showed up on his doorstep in the middle of the night wearing pajamas and saying, \u201cthere were demons after him, actual live demons.\u201d Green allowed defendant to spend the night on his couch, explaining: \u201cHe looked very disheveled. He began to twitch around. He said [the demons] were actually physically attacking him. He was scared. He didn\u2019t want to go home.\u201d Defendant also told Moorehouse about the demons. According to Green and Moorehouse, defendant also began to talk to himself, as though he were having a conversation with someone who was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>there. Green further confirmed defendant made \u201cshuddering\u201d and \u201ctwitching\u201d movements. Eventually, defendant stopped spending time with Green and Moorehouse altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Defendant\u2019s older brother Colin also testified during cross-examination that, beginning sometime in 2010, while Colin visited home, defendant would sometimes walk around the house at night, in the dark, wearing a Halloween-style mask and coveralls. Colin described two specific instances in which defendant walked into a room in the house wearing such a mask, for no apparent reason. On a third occasion, the previous April, Colin and defendant went to a horror movie together. While they began the movie sitting next to each other, defendant eventually got up and walked away from his seat. Colin did not see him for a while and got up to look around the theater. He spotted defendant sitting alone, in a different row and off to the side, again wearing a mask.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder. Following the sanity phase of the trial, the jury found he was legally sane when he committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">\n<em>Combination of CALCRIM No. 362 and CALCRIM No. 3428</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">Defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred and violated his federal constitutional right to due process by instructing the jury, during the guilt phase of the trial, with CALCRIM No. 362 on consciousness of guilt along with CALCRIM No. 3428 on the limited use of evidence of mental illness or impairment. Defendant did not object to these instructions at trial. \u201cFailure to object to instructional error forfeits the issue on appeal unless the error affects defendant\u2019s substantial rights. [Citations.] The question is whether the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice under <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243], [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at p. 927.) We conclude there was error, but no miscarriage of justice. The claim is therefore forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">As given to the jury in this case, CALCRIM No. 362 provided: \u201cIf the defendant made a false or misleading statement before this trial related to the charged crime, knowing the statement was false or intended to be \u2014 to mislead, that conduct may show he was aware of his guilt of the crime and you may consider it in the determining of his guilt. [\u00b6] If you conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>the defendant made the statement, it is up to you to decide its meaning and importance. However, evidence that the defendant made such a statement cannot prove guilt by itself.\u201d CALCRIM No. 3428, as given to the jury, provided: \u201cYou have heard evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect or disorder. You may consider this evidence <em>only for the limited purpose of deciding whether at the time of the charged crime, the defendant acted with the intent or mental state required for that crime. </em>[\u00b6] The People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the required intent or mental state, specifically express or implied malice aforethought. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of murder.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Defendant argues the trial court should have modified CALCRIM No. 3428 to allow the jury to consider evidence of defendant\u2019s mental disturbance in determining whether the false statements he made to Katelyn following the murder (i.e., their mother asked him to pick Katelyn up at UOP, she was asleep when defendant and Katelyn returned home later that night, she got up early the next morning and told defendant she would be spending the day in bed, and she asked defendant to take Katelyn to run an errand at the bank) were knowingly false, and therefore evidenced his consciousness of guilt. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiidanen </em>(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 526 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 736] <em>(Wiidanen), </em>the defendant was convicted of orally copulating an unconscious person. He was intoxicated at the time of the crime. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 528.) When interviewed by police a few hours later, the defendant repeatedly denied he orally copulated anyone. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 533.) We held \u201cthe trial court erred in instructing the jury with both the consciousness of guilt instruction (CALCRIM No. 362) and an unmodified version of the voluntary intoxication instruction (CALCRIM No. 3426)\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 528) that informed the jury it may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication \u201c \u2018only in deciding whether the defendant had the knowledge that the victim was unconscious of the act at the time of its occurrence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 532, fn. 5.) As we explained, prohibiting the jury from considering evidence of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication for any purpose other than deciding whether he knew the victim was unconscious of the oral copulation was error because such evidence was also probative of whether or not the defendant\u2019s denials to police were knowingly false and therefore evidenced his consciousness of guilt. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">Similarly, here, CALCRIM No. 3428 prohibited the jury from considering evidence of defendant\u2019s mental illness or impairment for any purpose other than deciding whether he possessed the required mental state for murder. Like intoxication, mental illness or impairment has obvious relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>to the question of ability to perceive or recall events. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gurule </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 591-592 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 345, 51 P.3d 224] [mental illness can be relevant on the issue of credibility if such illness affects the witness\u2019s ability to perceive, recall or describe events]; <em>People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 356-357 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 28 P.3d 34] [insane delusions of a witness relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the witness\u2019s ability to perceive and recollect events].) Here, defendant presented evidence he was suffering from insane delusions at the time he stabbed his mother to death. Shortly after the murder, as Katelyn was trying to reach her mother to pick her up at UOP, defendant called Katelyn and said their mother had asked him to pick her up. Later that night, defendant stopped Katelyn in the hallway and told her their mother was asleep. The next morning, defendant told Katelyn their mother got up early, asked defendant to take Katelyn to run an errand at the bank, and then said she would be staying in bed all day because she had not slept well. None of these statements was true. If defendant knew them to be false, they would be evidence of his consciousness of guilt. If, however, defendant\u2019s mental illness or impairment prevented him from knowing those statements were false, the statements would not have been probative of his consciousness of guilt. The jury should have been allowed to consider the evidence of defendant\u2019s mental illness or impairment for purposes of assessing consciousness of guilt. (See <em>Wiidanen, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.4th at p. 533.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Defendant also argues the combination of CALCRIM Nos. 362 and 3428 created an \u201cirrational permissive inference\u201d in violation of his right to due process under the federal Constitution. Not so. As we explained in <em>Wiidanen, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.4th 526, \u201c \u2018[a] permissive inference violates the Due Process Clause only if the suggested conclusion is not one that reason and common sense justify <em>in light of the proven facts before the jury.\u2019\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 533, italics added.) We concluded there was no due process violation in <em>Wiidanen </em>\u201cbecause the \u2018suggested conclusion,\u2019 i.e., defendant was aware of his guilt when he made the false statements, was reasonable \u2018in light of the proven facts before the jury,\u2019 \u201d explaining: \u201cIt was not reasonable that defendant made these false statements due to his intoxication (and therefore without knowledge they were false) because, as pointed out by the prosecutor during closing argument, defendant selectively remembered certain things about what allegedly happened at the party that, if believed, would exculpate him (i.e., he did not orally copulate anybody) but claimed a hazy memory about other facts (i.e., whether he returned to the house that night) that would not necessarily inculpate or exculpate him. That defendant had the ability to fake a clear memory about events that exculpated him and to fake a hazy memory about neutral facts suggested defendant knew how to contrive even while allegedly drunk. Therefore, the permissive inference, i.e., defendant was aware of his guilt when he made the false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>statements, was reasonable, and the court did not violate defendant\u2019s due process rights by giving these instructions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 534.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">Here, too, the suggested conclusion defendant was aware of his guilt when he made the false statements at issue in this case was reasonable in light of the proven facts before the jury. Indeed, we conclude such a conclusion was more reasonable in this case than in <em>Wiidanen, </em>supra, 201 Cal.App.4th 526. In addition to making the false statements, defendant engaged in a concerted effort to keep Katelyn away from their deceased mother. He picked Katelyn up at UOP and, rather than drive her home, defendant took her on a four-hour road trip to Sacramento, purportedly to pick up marijuana. When Katelyn mentioned her lips were chapped, defendant stopped at Walgreens to allow her to purchase Blistex, which was contrary to his usual reluctance to do things for people. He then paced the aisles when Katelyn was in the restroom. Back on the road, defendant drove back and forth down the same street, claiming to be lost. When he eventually arrived at the purported location, defendant parked the car and disappeared on foot. Defendant did not drive Katelyn back to the house until after the time their mother usually retired to her bedroom, which gave defendant the pretext to tell Katelyn not to disturb her while she slept. Defendant also seemed to be patrolling the hallway that night. The following day, defendant told Katelyn their mother got up early and told him she would be staying in bed all day, but she wanted him to take Katelyn to run an errand at the bank. While defendant and Katelyn ran that errand, defendant also asked if Katelyn wanted to go to Target to just walk around. Finally, when Katelyn said she did not need to go to Target, but wanted to go to the AT&amp;T store on the way back to the house, defendant suggested they go to a different store location, farther from the house. There would be no reason for defendant to have engaged in this effort to keep Katelyn away from their mother if he actually believed she were alive. Thus, the permissive inference that defendant was aware of his guilt when he made the false statements was reasonable, and the trial court did not violate his due process rights by giving the challenged instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">As we concluded in Wiidanen: \u201cFor the same reason the instructions did not violate due process, the error in giving these instructions was harmless under the state law standard articulated in <em>People v. Watson[, </em>supra, ]46 Cal.2d 818 . . . . Namely, it was not \u2018reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Wiidanen, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.4th at p. 534.) This also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>means the error did not affect defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>(People v. Anderson, supra, </em>152 Cal.App.4th at p. 927.) Therefore, the claim is forfeited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">\n<em>Failure to Instruct on Involuntary Manslaughter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Defendant also claims the trial court prejudicially erred by failing to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on involuntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense to murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">In a criminal case, the trial court \u201cmust instruct on lesser included offenses, even in the absence of a request, whenever there is substantial evidence raising a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense are present. [Citations.] \u2018Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to \u201cdeserve consideration by the jury,\u201d that is, evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 645 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Souza </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 90, 114 [141 Cal.Rptr.3d 419, 277 P.3d 118].) \u201cOn appeal, we review independently whether the trial court erred in failing to instruct on a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Booker </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 141, 181 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 722, 245 P.3d 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">\u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice aforethought.\u201d (\u00a7 187, subd.

Our Supreme Court has explained express malice \u201crequires an <em>intent to kill </em>that is \u2018unlawful\u2019 because . . . \u2018 . there is no justification, excuse, or mitigation for the killing recognized by the law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] Malice is implied when an unlawful killing results from a willful act, the natural and probable consequences of which are dangerous to human life, performed with conscious disregard for that danger.

Prior to 1981, a third factor mitigating an intentional killing to voluntary manslaughter was diminished capacity. (See <em>Bryant, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at pp. 969-970; see also <em>People v. Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1110-1111 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588] <em>(Saille).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">\u201cInvoluntary manslaughter is \u2018the unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought <em>and without an intent to kill.\u2019 </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

[Citation.] In a murder case, if this evidence is believed, the only supportable verdict would be involuntary manslaughter or an acquittal. If such a showing gives rise to a reasonable doubt, the killing (assuming there is no implied malice) can be no greater than involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1117; see also \u00a7 28, subd. (a) [\u201cEvidence of mental disease, mental defect, or mental disorder is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the accused actually formed a required specific intent, premeditated, deliberated, or harbored malice aforethought, when a specific intent crime is charged\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Thus, in a murder case, instructions on involuntary manslaughter are required where there is substantial evidence that may come in the form of evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness, raising a question as to whether or not that defendant actually formed the intent to kill. <em>(Rogers, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 884.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Here, defendant stabbed his mother 10 times in the neck, chest, and abdomen. Eight of these stab wounds were independently fatal. There was also evidence of neck compression. The medical examiner aptly described the infliction of these injuries as \u201coverkill.\u201d There can be no serious dispute defendant intended to kill when he did this to his mother. Nor does defendant claim he lacked an intent to kill. Instead, defendant argues: \u201cIf [he] believed, due to a hallucination or delusion, that he was being tormented and attacked by a demon, as he had hallucinated in the past, the killing would be without express or implied malice, because he did not believe that he was acting against a human life.\u201d This argument is foreclosed by the reasoning of <em>Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th 121, as we explain immediately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>In <em>Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th 121, the mentally ill defendant stabbed a woman to death at a bus stop with a sharpened paintbrush handle. He claimed at trial certain unspecified delusions made him actually, although unreasonably, believe he needed to defend himself. After requested instructions on imperfect self-defense voluntary manslaughter were refused, the defendant was convicted of first degree murder. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 130-132.) Our Supreme Court held the instructions were properly refiised because the imperfect self-defense theory, \u201ca form of mistake of fact,\u201d has \u201cno application when the defendant\u2019s actions are entirely delusional,\u201d explaining: \u201cA defendant who makes a factual mistake misperceives the objective circumstances. A delusional defendant holds a belief that is divorced from the circumstances. . . . Unreasonable self-defense was never intended to encompass reactions to threats that exist only in the defendant\u2019s mind.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 136-137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The court then rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, similar to the one made in this case, that section 28, subdivision (a), allowed him to introduce evidence of his mental illness, which \u201cgave rise to his belief in the need for self-defense, and precluded him from actually harboring malice.\u201d <em>(Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th at p. 139.) Acknowledging such an interpretation of the section was \u201clogically defensible\u201d based on its plain meaning, the court concluded the statutory scheme as a whole and section 28\u2019s legislative history required a different result. <em>(Elmore, </em>at p. 139.) The court explained: \u201cUnder California\u2019s statutory scheme, \u2018[p]ersons who are mentally incapacitated\u2019 are deemed unable to commit a crime as a matter of law. [Citation.] Mental incapacity ... is determined by the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>test for legal insanity provided in section 25, subdivision (b). [Citations.] Under <em>M\u2019Naghten, </em>insanity is established if the defendant was unable either to understand the nature and quality of the criminal act, or to distinguish right from wrong when the act was committed. [Citations.] [\u00b6] A claim of unreasonable self-defense based solely on delusion is quintessentially a claim of insanity under the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>standard of inability to distinguish right from wrong. Its rationale is that mental illness caused the defendant to perceive an illusory threat, form an actual belief in the need to kill in self-defense, and act on that belief without wrongful intent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">Where, as in <em>Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th 121 and this case, a defendant pleads both not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, \u201c[t]he trial is bifurcated, with the question of guilt tried first. The defendant is presumed innocent, of course, but in order to reserve the issue of sanity for the second phase of trial the defendant is also conclusively presumed to have been legally sane at the time of the offense. [Citations.] Evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental state may not be admitted at the guilt phase <em>to prove insanity. </em>[Citations.] If the defendant is found guilty, the trial proceeds to the sanity phase, where the defendant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. [Citations.] \u2018The separation of the two stages of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>bifurcated trial is solely for the purpose of keeping the issues of guilt and sanity distinct; for other purposes, the trial is regarded as single and continuing.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th at pp. 140-141, italics added, fns. omitted; see \u00a7\u00a7 1020, 1026; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Mills </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 663, 681 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 833, 286 P.3d 754] [\u201cLegislature\u2019s intent in providing for bifurcation when a defendant pleads both not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity was to <em>simplify </em>the issues before the jury, by \u2018remov[ing] entirely from the first stage of the trial any issue as to legal sanity\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Thus, while section 28, subdivision (a), \u201callows defendants to introduce evidence of mental disorder to show they did not actually form a mental state required for guilt of the charged crime,\u201d this provision \u201cis necessarily limited by the presumption of sanity, which operates at a trial on the question of guilt to bar the defendant from claiming he [or she] is not guilty <em>because he [or </em>she] <em>is legally </em>insane.\u201d <em>(Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th at p. 141, italics added.) That, the court concluded, is exactly what the defendant in <em>Elmore </em>attempted to do when he claimed imperfect self-defense based solely on delusion during the guilt phase of the trial: \u201cA claim of self-defense based solely on delusion is more than a claim of unreasonable self-defense; as we have shown, it is a claim of legal insanity. If section 28(a) were applied to allow the defendant to make that claim at the guilt phase, the burden would shift to the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not insane. The statutory scheme would be turned on its head.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 145.) Instead, only \u201crelevant evidence of mental states <em>short of insanity </em>is admissible at the guilt phase under section 28(a)\u201d to negate malice under an imperfect self-defense theory, e.g., where a defendant \u201cmistakenly believed that <em>actual circumstances </em>required [his or her] defensive act . . . even if [the] reaction was distorted by mental illness.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 146, italics added.) However, evidence that \u201cpurely delusional perceptions caused the defendant to believe in the necessity of self-defense\u201d may be presented only during the sanity phase of the trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">Here, while defendant makes a slightly different argument than the one advanced in <em>Elmore, supra, </em>59 Cal.4th 121, the result is the same. Defendant does not argue he was entitled to voluntary manslaughter instructions because substantial evidence supported the view he hallucinated an attack by a demon, and therefore actually, although unreasonably, believed in the need to use deadly force in self-defense. Such an argument would be foreclosed by the holding in <em>Elmore. </em>Instead, defendant argues he was entitled to involuntary manslaughter instructions because substantial evidence supported the view he hallucinated an attack by a demon, and therefore did not intend to kill <em>a human being, </em>but instead intended to kill a demon. This too is quintessentially a claim of insanity. Its rationale is that because of defendant\u2019s mental illness, he was unable to understand the nature and quality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>criminal act, i.e., he was killing a human being rather than a demon. Such a claim may be made, but must be made during the sanity phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">The trial court did not err in declining to provide the jury with involuntary manslaughter instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">m-vr<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1145-8\">Robie, Acting P.
