Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (count 1), second degree robbery (\u00a7 211) (count 2), and assault with a semiautomatic firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) (count 5). The jury also found true an allegation that Lucero committed the murder during the course of a robbery. In addition, with respect to counts 1, 2, and 5, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>found true allegations that Lucero personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury or death within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (d) and personally and intentionally discharged a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On appeal, Lucero claims that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on count 1 on the lesser included offenses of second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter, given the evidence of his voluntary intoxication presented at trial. In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that any error in failing to instruct on second degree murder was harmless and that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Lucero also claims that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could not consider evidence of Lucero\u2019s voluntary intoxication in determining whether he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing bodily injury or death within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (d) and personally and intentionally discharged a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (c). In a published portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury that it could not consider Lucero\u2019s voluntary intoxication for purposes of determining the truth of these firearm enhancement allegations. Finally, in an unpublished portion of this opinion, we direct the trial court to correct an error in the abstract of judgment. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court to prepare a corrected abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A0m\">A. <em>Factual background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">1. <em>The events leading up to the robbery and killing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Ahmed Silmi frequently kept cash deposits from his businesses in the trunk of his Mercedes. One of Silmi\u2019s friends, victim Darius Silveira, owned a barbershop in Fontana. On May 23, 2012, at approximately 6:30 p.m., Silmi went to visit Silveira at the barbershop. Silmi had a large amount of cash in the trunk of his Mercedes. Approximately 30 minutes later, Lucero, whom Silmi had known for a few weeks, arrived at the barbershop. The three men smoked methamphetamine together.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Silmi went outside the barbershop and smoked a cigarette with Lucero. While the two men were outside, Silmi received a phone call from one of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>employees. Silmi and the employee discussed Silmi picking up deposits. After the phone call, Silmi told Lucero that he had to leave to pick up some deposits. Silmi left the barbershop shortly thereafter. Lucero also left the barbershop in a separate vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">At approximately 7:54 p.m., Lucero called Fontana Police Officer Buddy Porch. Lucero told Officer Porch that the driver of a Mercedes with Silmi\u2019s license plate number had something illegal on his person. Lucero described the location of the Mercedes. Officer Porch responded to the location and conducted a traffic stop of Silmi\u2019s vehicle. Silmi had $18,228 in cash and 44 cellular phones in the Mercedes. Silmi was taken into custody on an outstanding traffic warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">With Officer Porch\u2019s permission, Silmi contacted Silveira and asked Silveira to come to the location of the traffic stop and take possession of the cash and the phones. According to Silmi, before Silveira arrived, Lucero appeared at the scene of the traffic stop and told Silmi that he could take \u201cwhat it is that I was trying to get to Silveira,\u201d to him. Silmi declined the offer, and Lucero left. Silveira then arrived, placed the cash and phones in the trunk of the car he was driving and left. Officer Porch took Silmi to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Authorities released Silmi from jail the following morning at approximately 6:30 a.m. Silmi sent a text message to Silveira at approximately 6:45 a.m., requesting that Silveira pick him up from the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">2. <em>The robbery and killing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Meanwhile, at some point after leaving the location of the traffic stop, Lucero went back to the barbershop and visited with Silveira throughout the rest of that night and into the morning. At approximately 7:00 a.m. the following morning, Silveira agreed to give Lucero a ride to his van on his way to pick up Silmi from jail. Silveira drove Lucero to his van. As he was exiting the car, Lucero pointed a gun at Silveira and told him to open the trunk of the car. When Silveira attempted to drive away, Lucero shot him several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Alejandro Cardoso was driving his car near the scene of the shooting immediately after the shooting occurred. Cardoso saw the car that Silveira was driving crash into a house. Moments later, he observed Lucero run to a van parked nearby and drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">At approximately 7:06 a.m., Officer Michael Bernholtz of the Fontana Police Department arrived at the scene of the crash. Bernholtz saw that a vehicle had crashed into a house and also saw a man, later identified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Lucero, standing in the front yard of the house. When Lucero saw the officer, he yelled, \u201cOh, fuck\u201d and ran across the street to a parked black Honda. Lucero got into the Honda and drove off rapidly, with Officer Bernholtz in pursuit. Shortly thereafter, Lucero crashed the Honda. Lucero got out of the Honda and began to run. Lucero ran for about 15 feet and then surrendered as another police officer approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Authorities found Silveira in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle that had crashed into the house. Silveira suffered a total of six gunshot wounds, all to his upper body and head. Silveira died from the gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">3. <em>Lucero\u2019s police interview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Approximately six hours after the killing, Fontana Police Detective Daniel Delgado interviewed Lucero.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the interview, Lucero admitted calling Officer Porch the night before the killing in order \u201cto get [Silmi].\u201d Lucero also acknowledged going to the scene of Officer Porch\u2019s traffic stop of Silmi and asking Silmi if Silmi wanted him to take possession of Silmi\u2019s Mercedes. According to Lucero, Silmi declined the offer, explaining to Lucero that he had \u201cdrop-offs\u201d from his business.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Lucero told Detective Delgado that Silveira came and got Silmi\u2019s money. Lucero explained that later that evening, he went back to the barbershop and visited with Silveira for the remainder of the night. The following morning, at approximately 7:00 a.m., Silmi called Silveira and asked Silveira to pick him up from jail. Lucero asked Silveira to drive him to his van, which was parked around the corner from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">When they arrived at Lucero\u2019s van, Lucero sat in his seat for a few seconds. Silveira asked Lucero, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s up?\u201d Lucero then \u201cturned on him,\u201d pulled out a .32-caliber handgun and told Silveira to \u201cpop the trunk.\u201d Lucero started to get out of the car. Silveira screamed and began to drive off. Lucero fired several gunshots at Silveira.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Lucero watched the car Silveira was driving crash into a house. He then ran to his van and drove home. He wrapped the gun in a towel and placed it on the back part of the couch behind the house. Lucero stated that he then \u201cfigured, fuck I just killed him. And now I\u2019ve got to get the money, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">After changing shirts, Lucero drove back to the scene of the shooting in a Honda, parked around the comer, and removed the license plates from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Honda. Lucero then approached the vehicle Silveira was driving and saw that Silveira was dead. Lucero reached inside a window of the car, unlocked the door, put the car in park, and grabbed the keys. Lucero then removed bags of cash from the trunk of the car. At that point, Lucero saw a police officer, and said, \u201c[0]h[,] fuck.\u201d Lucero dropped the bags of cash, ran to his Honda, and drove off. Shortly thereafter, he crashed the Honda and surrendered to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">At one point in the interview, Lucero stated, \u201cThis was just fucking [the] answer to all of my problems so fast. You know? Money is a bitch, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">4. <em>Evidence of Lucero\u2019s use of methamphetamine prior to the killing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">During his interview with Detective Delgado, while discussing the killing, Lucero said, \u201cIt was a mistake. A horrible mistake. A drug induced mistake.\u201d Lucero stated that the night before the killing, he had been \u201csmoking dope [methamphetamine] all night,\u201d and explained that he, together with Silveira and another person, had smoked a total of two grams of methamphetamine. Lucero also said that recently, he had been \u201csmoking it all day.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Near the end of the interview, Lucero read a statement to Detective Delgado that he had written after being taken into custody. In the statement, Lucero wrote that he had been \u201cheavy on drugs.\u201d Lucero also stated, \u201cMeth is the worst thing that ever happened to . . . me. Today I felt out of body. I didn\u2019t have self conscious [sic] to stop. I couldn\u2019t. . . . The dope still has me in a daze.\u201d Lucero also stated, \u201cI haven\u2019t slept more than [five] hours the last four days. ... I lost control of myself between 7 pm and this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">After Lucero read his statement, Detective Delgado asked Lucero whether he would like to see his wife. Lucero answered, \u201cI can\u2019t . . . not like this.\u201d Detective Delgado responded, \u201cWell you\u2019re still high,\u201d and told Lucero, \u201cCouple of days, sober up . . . she\u2019s going to be able to visit you over there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Detective Delgado testified Lucero appeared to be drowsy and fell asleep while in custody at the police station prior to the interview. Delgado also testified that he believed that Lucero was still \u201chigh\u201d during the interview because he was \u201chaving problems speaking.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Detective Delgado said that Lucero had difficulty reading his own handwriting toward the end of the interview when Lucero read his statement to Delgado.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>B. <em>Procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">A jury found Lucero guilty of murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)) (count 1), robbery (\u00a7 211) (count 2), unlawful possession of ammunition (\u00a7 30305, subd. (a)(1)) (count 3), possession of a firearm by a felon (\u00a7 29800, subd. (a)) (count 4), and assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)) (count 5). In addition, with respect to counts 1, 2, and 5, the jury found that Lucero personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing bodily injury or death within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (d), personally and intentionally discharged a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (c), and personally used a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.53, subdivision (b). The jury further found Lucero committed the murder during the course and commission of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found that Lucero had suffered a prior strike conviction (\u00a7\u00a7 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d), 667, subds. (b)-(i)) and a prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The trial court sentenced Lucero to a determinate sentence of 3 years 4 months, and an indeterminate sentence of 105 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">A. <em>Any error in failing to instruct on the lesser included offense of second degree murder was harmless and the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on the lesser included offenses of voluntary manslaughter and involuntary </em>manslaughter<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">B. <em>The trial court properly instructed the jury that it could not consider Lucero\u2019s voluntary intoxication for purposes of determining the truth of the section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) firearm enhancement allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Lucero claims that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could not consider his voluntary intoxication for purposes of determining the truth of the section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) firearm enhancement allegations attached to counts 1, 2, and 5. Lucero contends that \u201cthe mental state required for a true finding on the gun allegation^] is clearly one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>specific intent,\u201d and thus, evidence of his voluntary intoxication was admissible in determining the truth of such allegations. We review Lucero\u2019s claim de novo. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Guiuan </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 558, 569-570 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 239, 957 P.2d 928] [jury instruction claim that involves the determination of applicable legal principles is reviewed de novo].)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The trial court instructed the jury pursuant to a modified version of CALCRIM No. 3426 in relevant part as follows: \u201cYou may consider evidence, if any, of the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication only in a limited way. You may consider that evidence only in deciding whether the defendant acted with the specific intent to take property by force or fear. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] You may not consider evidence of voluntary intoxication for any other purpose. Voluntary intoxication is not a defense to . . . any of the special allegations.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Section 12022.53, subdivision (c) provides a sentence enhancement for any person who, in the commission of specified felonies, \u201cpersonally and intentionally discharges a firearm . . . .\u201d Section 12022.53, subdivision (d) provides a sentence enhancement for any person who, in the commission of certain specified felonies, \u201cpersonally and intentionally discharges a firearm and proximately causes great bodily injury, as defined in Section 12022.7, or death, to any person other than an accomplice . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\u201c[E]vidence of voluntary intoxication is <em>admissible </em>on the issue of whether or not a defendant actually formed a required specific intent . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Mathson </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1297, 1312 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 167], italics added.) However, \u201c[e]vidence of voluntary intoxication is <em>inadmissible </em>to negate the existence of general criminal intent.\u201d <em>(People v. Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76, 81 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660], italics added; see \u00a7 29.4, subd. (b) [\u201cEvidence of voluntary intoxication is admissible solely on the issue of whether or not the defendant actually formed a required specific intent . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">\u201c \u2018The distinction between specific and general intent crimes evolved as a judicial response to the problem of the intoxicated offender\u2019 and the availability of voluntary intoxication as a defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hering </em>(1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>20 Cal.4th 440, 445 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 839, 976 P.2d 210] <em>(Hering).) </em>\u201cWhen the definition of a crime [or an enhancement] consists of only the description of a particular act, without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence, we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act. This intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent. When the definition refers to defendant\u2019s intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence, the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 456-457 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370] <em>(Hood).) </em>In addition, \u201cwhen the Legislature intends to require proof of a specific intent in connection with a sentence enhancement provision, it has done so explicitly by referring to the required intent in the statute. (See, e.g., former \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 873, \u00a7 3.)\u201d <em>(In re Tameka C. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 190, 199 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 730, 990 P.2d 603].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) both provide for additional punishment for a defendant who \u201cpersonally and intentionally discharges a firearm\u201d under specified circumstances. Both subdivisions refer only to the description of a particular act \u2014 discharging a firearm- \u2014 -without reference to the defendant\u2019s intent to achieve any additional consequence. Further, neither subdivision includes \u201clanguage typically denoting specific intent crimes, such as \u2018with the intent\u2019 or \u2018for the purpose of.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hering, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 446.) For instance, neither subdivision states that the discharge of the firearm must be done <em>with the intent to inflict </em>injury. (Cf. \u00a7 12022.55 [\u201cany person who, <em>with the intent to inflict great bodily injury or death, </em>inflicts great bodily injury, as defined in Section 12022.7, or causes the death of a person, other than an occupant of a motor vehicle, as a result of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle in the commission of a felony or attempted felony, shall be punished\u201d (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We are not persuaded by Lucero\u2019s argument that the statute\u2019s specification that the use of the word \u201cintentionally\u201d in section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) indicates that the statute specifies a <em>specific </em>rather than a <em>general </em>intent. \u201cAn intentional use of a firearm in the commission of a crime does not encompass any specific intent.\u201d <em>(People v. Wardell </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1494 [77 Cal.Rptr.3d 77] [rejecting argument that a \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a) firearm use enhancement \u201crequires proof that the perpetrator <em>specifically intended </em>\u2018to facilitate the commission of the underlying crime\u2019 \u201d].) In short, because section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) \u201cconsist^ of only the description of a particular act,\u201d \u2014 i.e. discharging a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>firearm \u2014 \u201cwithout reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence,\u201d the enhancements require only proof of the defendant\u2019s general intent. <em>(Hood, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 456-457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury that it was not to consider evidence of Lucero\u2019s voluntary intoxication in determining the truth of the section 12022.53, subdivisions (c) and (d) firearm enhancement allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">C. <em>The abstract of judgment must be corrected</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The judgment is affirmed.
