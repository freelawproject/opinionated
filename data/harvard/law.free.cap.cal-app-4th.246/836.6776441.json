It also found him guilty of assault with a firearm (count 3), and found true allegations he personally used a firearm and committed the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members. The trial court sentenced defendant to a total term of 17 years in prison: three years for the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction; 10 years for the gang enhancement on that crime; one year for the assault conviction; one year four months for the firearm enhancement on that crime; and one year eight months for the gang enhancement on that crime. The trial court also stayed a firearm enhancement of four years with respect to the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction based on the imposition of the gang enhancement for that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) the trial court prejudicially erred by instructing the jury with CALCRIM No. 3471, regarding mutual combat or an initial aggressor, without also providing an optional portion of the instruction excusing an initial aggressor from withdrawing from a fight in which the victim of the aggressor\u2019s simple assault responds with a \u201csudden and deadly\u201d counterattack; or (2) alternatively, he received ineffective assistance of counsel who failed to request this instruction; and (3) there was insufficient evidence that defendant\u2019s Oak Park subset of the Norte\u00f1o gang qualifies as a criminal street gang for purposes of the gang enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We conclude that the instruction regarding an original aggressor\u2019s simple assault being met with deadly force from the victim is a special theory on which the trial court had no duty to instruct in the absence of a request. We also conclude that defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails because he cannot establish any prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction and the firearm use findings (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>We directed the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs on the effect of our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>People v. Prunty </em>(2015) 62 Cal.4th 59 [192 Cal.Rptr.3d 309, 355 P.3d 480] <em>(Prunty). </em>In that case, our Supreme Court \u201cdecide[d] what type of showing the prosecution must make when its theory of why a criminal street gang exists turns on the conduct of one or more gang subsets.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67.) The People contend that <em>Prunty </em>is inapplicable because the prosecution\u2019s theory was that the entire Norte\u00f1o gang \u2014 not a specific subset \u2014 satisfied the definition of a criminal street gang. Alternatively, the People assert that the prosecution presented sufficient evidence of an associational or organizational connection among the Norte\u00f1os, the Oak Park subset, and any applicable Sutter County subset(s). We disagree. The prosecution\u2019s theory and evidence in this case was not meaningfully different than the prosecution\u2019s theory and evidence in <em>Prunty. </em>Thus, there was insufficient evidence that defendant committed the offenses for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members. (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).) Accordingly, we will modify defendant\u2019s sentence by striking the corresponding sentence enhancements. Because, however, the trial court stayed a four-year sentence on a separate firearm enhancement on the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction only because of the gang enhancement it was imposing on that crime, we will also modify defendant\u2019s sentence by lifting the stay on that firearm enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">A. <em>Self-defense Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In the early morning hours of January 29, 2012, defendant and at least one other individual were arguing on the dance floor at Big John\u2019s Bar and Grill in Yuba City, California. After a bouncer escorted them outside, defendant and Eric Baca continued to exchange words in the parking lot of the shopping center, located on Bridge Street and Oji Way.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The prosecution\u2019s theory and evidence presented at trial was that during the argument, defendant moved to his truck, fired his gun into the air, and then fired again at a crowd of people, including Baca. Defendant then shot Michael Ybarra while defendant was driving his truck and Ybarra was running away.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">It is undisputed that Baca incurred a nonfatal gunshot wound to his chest and Ybarra was struck by bullets in the arm and foot. Numerous eyewitnesses testified at trial. Because defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal require there to be substantial evidence that his use of deadly force was in response to a \u201csudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>and deadly\u201d counterattack, we need only summarize the eyewitness testimony that could be used to suggest this may have been the sequence of events. Even this select evidence produces contradictory versions of the events that led to the shooting of Baca and Ybarra:</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Rodney Drumm testified at trial that on the night of the shooting he went to the bar at Big John\u2019s and followed people outside to the parking lot where four to five people were gathered around each other looking like they were \u201cgoing to have a street fight.\u201d The people were \u201c[threatening each other back and forth who\u2019s going to whoop whose ass.\u201d The group proceeded towards a silver pickup. Drumm \u201csaw a few people trying to get in the truck and all of a sudden a couple guns came out and bullets started flying.\u201d Drumm did not recall any shots fired into the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Detective Scotty Clinkenbeard of the Yuba City Police Department testified that he had interviewed Drumm about a week after the shooting. At that time, Drumm stated that a female got into the cab of the pickup through the driver\u2019s side rear door. A man standing at this door was the first person Drumm saw pull out a gun. According to the interview notes, Drumm said that individual pointed a black semiautomatic handgun \u201cup in the air\u201d and fired two or three shots. Then, a shirtless man standing 10 feet behind the pickup pulled a handgun out from his waist area and started shooting at the driver\u2019s side. Two individuals at the pickup \u201creturned fire.\u201d \u201cThe guy standing at the back driver\u2019s door was shooting, and another guy from the passenger side came around the back of the pickup truck with a handgun shooting at the no shirt guy.\u201d In total, three to four men and one woman left in the truck. Once the shooting stopped and the truck left, the shirtless man met up with another man in front of the bar. The two men walked toward Bridge Street raising their hands in the air in what appeared to be celebration. Eventually, Drumm saw a man in a gray T-shirt collapsed in the parking lot; the man had just been shot. Drumm stated he could not remember if the \u201cvictim\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been involved in the shooting. Despite the fact that defendant relies on evidence of Drumm\u2019s interview, the parties agree that the evidence at trial established that the shirtless individual was Baca, and that Baca was on the ground in the parking lot when the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Alana Hinojosa testified that she had accompanied defendant to Big John\u2019s, but stayed inside while he went out to smoke. Eventually, she followed a group of men who were rushing outside. There, she found defendant by himself facing a group of men by the front door. Michael Ybarra asked defendaht where he was from. Hinojosa testified that she and defendant were \u201cbacking up\u201d to the track and more than four people followed them, including Baca and Ybarra, the latter of whom \u201cshowed his gun.\u201d Baca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>removed his shirt and took a wild swing at defendant that missed him entirely. Hinojsa testified that as she and defendant retreated, she repeatedly told the group of males in front of them to \u201cback up\u201d and not to \u201crush\u201d her \u201cbaby\u2019s daddy.\u201d Meanwhile, she stayed between them and defendant. When she and defendant reached the pickup, Ybarra was at the driver\u2019s side headlight, Baca and two other individuals were at the back of the truck, defendant was at the driver\u2019s door, and she was at the rear door. Defendant fired one shot into the air \u201cto get everybody back,\u201d then Michael Ybarra shot at defendant, and Hinojosa \u201cjust remember[s] all kinds of gunshots just going off.\u201d Defendant pushed her into the truck and drove away while the pickup \u201cwas getting shot from like every end, every end.\u201d Despite Hinojosa\u2019s testimony to the contrary, defendant does not dispute that he \u201cmay have fired a few gunshots out one of the truck\u2019s windows\u201d and that Ybarra left the parking lot, bleeding, on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">B. <em>Gang Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Section 186.22, part of the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act (the STEP Act; \u00a7 186.20 et seq.), imposes an additional term of imprisonment on \u201cany person who is convicted of a felony committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1).) For purposes of this sentence enhancement, a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d is defined as \u201cany ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of the criminal acts enumerated in [the statute], having a common name or common identifying sign or symbol, and whose members individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>subd. (f).) A \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d is \u201cthe commission of, attempted commission of, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of, sustained juvenile petition for, or conviction of two or more of [certain] offenses [identified in the statute], provided at least one of these offenses occurred after the effective date of [the law] and the last of those offenses occurred within three years after a prior offense, and the offenses were committed on separate occasions, or by two or more persons.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The prosecution\u2019s gang expert, Michael Bullard from the Yuba City Police Department, testified that the \u201cNuestra Familia ... is a prison gang that started and has control over the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang.\u201d He explained that \u201cNorte\u00f1os operate under a big umbrella so there\u2019s different gangs or levels of the gangs within them. So the Norte\u00f1o being the big umbrella, the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang and there are subsets within that gang.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>subsets include the Oak Park Norte\u00f1os from Sacramento, and the Yuba City Norte\u00f1os, Varrio Live Oak Norte\u00f1os and East Morez from in and around Sutter County.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Bullard opined that defendant was an active participant in the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang at the time of the shooting. Bullard\u2019s opinion was based in part on the fact that defendant had previously been documented to be an active participant in a subset from Oak Park in the Sacramento area. Bullard also opined that defendant committed the charged crimes for the benefit of or in association with the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang, and to further, promote or assist criminal conduct by the Norte\u00f1o gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In response to the prosecution\u2019s attempt to elicit that there were at least three members of the relevant criminal street gang in the area, Bullard estimated that, at the time of the trial, there were approximately 250 Norte\u00f1os in Sutter County. He also testified that Norte\u00f1os use the color red and the number 14 to identify themselves. The prosecution asked Bullard, \u201cas of January 2012 what was the primary activity of the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang <em>in our </em>area?\u201d (Italics added.) In response, Bullard listed several crimes including murder, assault with a deadly weapon and robbery. He then testified as to predicate offenses involving members of \u201cthe Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang\u201d that he personally investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">A. <em>Jury Instructions Regarding Self-defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The trial court instructed the jury using CALCRIM No. 3470 that defendant had a right to self-defense if he reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of suffering bodily injury, if he reasonably believed that the immediate use of force was necessary to defend himself, and if he used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">CALCRIM No. 3471, as given to the jury in this case, provides: \u201cA person who engages in mutual combat or who starts a fight has a right to self-defense only if: [\u00b6] 1. He actually and in good faith tried to stop fighting; [\u00b6] AND [\u00b6] 2. He indicated, by word or by conduct, to his opponent, in a way that a reasonable person would understand, that he wanted to stop fighting and that he had stopped fighting; [\u00b6] If the defendant meets these requirements, he then had a right to self-defense if the opponent continued to fight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Defendant did not object to this instruction at trial. The only error asserted by defendant is that the first part of one of the optional bracketed portions of CALCRIM No. 3471 should also have been provided: \u201cHowever, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>defendant used only non-deadly force, and the opponent responded with such sudden and deadly force that the defendant could not withdraw from the fight, then the defendant had the right to defend (himself/herself) with deadly force . . . .\u201d This bracketed portion continues, \u201cand was not required to try to stop fighting (,/or) communicate the desire to stop to the opponent^ or give the opponent a chance to stop fighting].\u201d Defendant did not request that the trial court give any part of the bracketed portion of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">1., 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">B. <em>Evidence of a Criminal Street Gang</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\"><em>People v. Prunty </em>involved a similar challenge to the sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s evidence to sustain a gang enhancement. <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at pp. 70-71.) The court held \u201cthat the STEP Act requires the prosecution to introduce evidence showing an associational or organizational connection that unites members of a putative criminal street gang.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67.) And \u201cwhere the prosecution\u2019s case positing the existence of a single \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 for purposes of section 186.22[, subdivision] (f) turns on the existence and conduct of one or more gang subsets, then the prosecution must show some associational or organizational connection uniting those subsets.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 71.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The STEP Act also \u201crequires that the gang the defendant sought to benefit, the individuals that the prosecution claims constitute an \u2018organization, association, or group,\u2019 and the group whose actions the prosecution alleges satisfy the \u2018primary activities\u2019 and predicate offense requirements of section 186.22[, subdivision] (f), must be one and the same.\u201d <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at pp. 75-76.) The prosecution does not need to demonstrate the exact scope of the criminal street gang, but the jury must be able to infer that the gang the defendant sought to benefit included the group that committed the primary activities and predicate offenses under the STEP Act. <em>(Prunty, </em>at p. 76.) \u201cAnd where, as in this case, the alleged perpetrators of the predicate crimes under section 186.22[, subdivision] (f) are members of particular subsets, the behavior of those subsets\u2019 members must connect them to the gang the defendant sought to benefit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 80.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The evidence showed that Prunty identified as Norte\u00f1o generally and that he claimed membership in a Detroit Boulevard subset. <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at pp. 67, 68.) \u201c[T]he prosecution\u2019s gang expert testified about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Sacramento-area Norte\u00f1o gang\u2019s general existence and origins, its use of shared signs, symbols, colors, and names, its primary activities, and the predicate activities of two local neighborhood subsets.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67.) The expert also testified in support of the prosecution\u2019s theory that Prunty committed the charged assault with the intent to benefit the Sacramento-area Norte\u00f1os. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 67, 69.) The court held that \u201cwhere the prosecution\u2019s evidence fell short is with respect to the predicate offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 82.) The prosecution introduced evidence of two predicate offenses involving three alleged Sacramento Norte\u00f1o subsets \u2014 Varrio Gardenland Norte\u00f1os, Del Paso Heights Norte\u00f1os and Varrio Centro Norte\u00f1os. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The prosecution\u2019s gang expert, Detective John Sample, characterized these groups as Norte\u00f1os, but \u201che otherwise provided no evidence that could connect these groups to one another, or to an overarching Sacramento-area Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In particular, he \u201cnever addressed the Norte\u00f1o gang\u2019s relationship to any of the subsets at issue. . . . Instead, Sample simply described the subsets by name, characterized them as Norte\u00f1os, and testified as to the alleged predicate offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 83.) While he testified that Norte\u00f1o street gangs are associated with the Nuestra Familia prison gang, he did not testify about any relationship between any Nuestra Familia shot callers and any of the Sacramento-area Norte\u00f1o subsets. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This testimony was insufficient \u201cto permit the jury to infer that the organization, association, or group at issue included the subsets that committed the predicate offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The People contend that <em>Prunty </em>has no effect on defendant\u2019s appeal because \u201cthe prosecution endeavored to prove that the Norte\u00f1o gang \u2014 not a specific subset of the gang \u2014 met the statutory definition of a criminal street gang by introducing evidence of its primary activities and the requisite predicate offenses.\u201d This argument is at odds with our Supreme Court\u2019s statement that it \u201cgranted review in <em>[Prunty] </em>to address the showing prosecutors must make when attempting to show that \u2018multiple subsets of the Norte\u00f1os may be treated as a whole\u2019 under section 186.22[, subdivision] (f).\u201d <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 71, fn. 2; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 70 [\u201cWe granted Prunty\u2019s petition for review to address the type of evidence required to support the prosecution\u2019s theory that various alleged gang subsets constitute a single \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 under section 186.22[, subdivision] (f).\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">At defendant\u2019s trial, the prosecution\u2019s gang expert, Michael Bullard, testified that the Norte\u00f1os are an umbrella organization and that \u201cthere\u2019s different gangs or levels of the gangs within them.\u201d The evidence showed that defendant, like Prunty, was a member of the Norte\u00f1os generally and a particular Norte\u00f1o subset \u2014 here, the Oak Park Norte\u00f1o subset from Sacramento. The prosecution asked Bullard, \u201cas of January 2012 what was the primary activity of the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang <em>in our areaT </em>(Italics added.) After listing several crimes, Bullard testified as to two predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>offenses involving members of \u201cthe Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang.\u201d Bullard, a narcotics and gang task force agent of the Yuba City Police Department, personally investigated both cases. His testimony therefore suggests that the primary activities and predicate offenses he was testifying about were committed by members of one of the subsets he had identified as operating in Sutter County \u2014 Yuba City Norte\u00f1os, Varrio Live Oak Norte\u00f1os or East Morez. Regardless, there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that these offenses were committed by members of a subset in Oak Park in Sacramento County. Thus, <em>Prunty </em>controls this case because it \u201cturns on the conduct of one or more gang subsets.\u201d (Prunty; <em>supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 67.) And this is critical because \u201c[n]one of [the gang expert\u2019s] testimony indicated that any of the alleged subsets had shared information, defended the same turf, had members commonly present in the same vicinity, or otherwise behaved in a manner that permitted the inference of an associational or organizational connection among the subsets.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Further, the STEP Act \u201crequires the prosecution to show that a \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 exhibits some level of informal association among its members.\u201d <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th. at p. 76.) It is clear from <em>Prunty </em>that sharing a common name, identifying symbols, enemy, ideology, and even self-identification are not sufficient to establish the existence of a criminal street gang. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 74-75, 79, 82-84.) What is sufficient is more nuanced. Our Supreme Court provided \u201csome illustrative examples of how the prosecution can show a criminal street gang to exist, particularly when the theory advanced is that various alleged gang subsets should in fact be treated as a single entity for purposes of the STEP Act.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 76.) The People emphasize a paragraph explaining that subsets can be treated as a single organization when they have established certain details about their chain of command; \u201cThe most straightforward cases might involve subsets connected through formal ways, such as shared bylaws or organizational arrangements. Evidence could be presented, for instance, that such subsets are part of a loose approximation of a hierarchy. Even if the gang subsets do not have a formal relationship or interact with one another \u2014 -indeed, even if they are unaware of one another\u2019s activities \u2014 the subsets may still be part of the same organization if they are controlled by the same locus or hub. For example, Norte\u00f1o gang subsets may be treated as a single organization if each subset contains a \u2018 \u201cshot callerQ\u201d \u2019 who \u2018answer[s] to a higher authority\u2019 in the Norte\u00f1o chain of command.\u201d <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 77, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 983, 988 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Here, Bullard testified generally that Nuestra Familia \u201cstarted and has control over the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s a paramilitary type setup of the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang where they have what they call regiment commanders or they have a regimen <em>[sic] </em>set up.\u201d But the illustrative examples and the paragraph relied upon by the People require, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>minimum, the prosecution to introduce evidence regarding the actual subsets at issue. (See <em>Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 83 [\u201c[The gang expert] did not testify, for instance, about any relationship between Nuestra Familia shot callers and any of the Sacramento-area Norte\u00f1o subsets.\u201d]; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 77, 78 [explaining that \u201cevidence that two seemingly unrelated Norte\u00f1o cliques routinely act to protect the same territory or \u2018turf\u2019 could suggest that they are part of a larger association\u201d and \u201cevidence that two Norte\u00f1o subsets have professed or exhibited loyalty to one another would be sufficient to show that the two subsets collaborate or cooperate\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 80 [\u201cEvidence of self-identification must refer to the particular activities of subsets . . . .\u201d].) Indeed, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>general testimony regarding the larger group\u2019s hierarchy, including \u201cshot callers,\u201d was insufficient where the evidence was not specific to the smaller group. <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.4th at p. 988 [\u201cDilbeck\u2019s general references to \u2018shot callers\u2019 answering to a higher authority within the prison system were insufficient, absent any testimony that the group calling themselves the Small Town Peckerwoods contained such a person, or that such a person was a liaison between, or authority figure within, both groups.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The People also rely on language from <em>Prunty </em>that states \u201c[s]ubsets may also be linked together as a single \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 if their independent activities benefit the same (presumably higher ranking) individual or group. An example would be various Norte\u00f1o subset gangs that share a cut of drug sale proceeds with <em>the same members of </em>the Nuestra Familia prison gang.\u201d <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 77, italics added.) The evidence in this case does not satisfy this example either. Bullard explained that \u201c[t]he Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang <em>in general </em>pays tax.\u201d (Italics added) \u201c[T]here\u2019s a paramilitary type setup of the Norte\u00f1o criminal street gang where they have what they call regiment commanders or they have a regimen <em>[sic] </em>set up. So if you\u2019re conducting illicit activity in that business, you have to pay a specific percentage of your taxes to the regiment commander who in turn sends that money into the prison where members of the Nuestro Familia will get that money.\u201d Bullard gave no testimony regarding how the Oak Park subset actually operates, let alone which subset(s) committed the predicate offenses. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 81 [\u201cin a case, like this one, where the prosecution\u2019s theory of a criminal street gang turns on the activities of two or more alleged gang subsets ... the evidence the prosecution introduces to show an organizational or associational connection must be sufficient to show that the \u2018criminal street gang\u2019 at issue includes <em>those particular </em>subsets\u201d (italics added)].) His testimony is thus insufficient to satisfy the requirements of <em>Prunty </em>and not meaningfully different from the expert testimony offered in that case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>e.g., <em>Prunty, </em>at pp. 83-84 [\u201c[The gang expert] testified extensively about \u2018the Norte\u00f1os\u2019 ... as to the group\u2019s size, its geographic location, and its general practices,\u201d and that \u201c \u2018Norte\u00f1o street gangs\u2019 are \u2018associate^]\u2019 with the Nuestra Familia prison gang\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><em>Prunty </em>also instructs that we must decline the People\u2019s invitation to conclude that the jury could have inferred that the Oak Park subset of Sacramento County and the relevant Sutter County subset(s) have the requisite organizational connection where the gang expert did no more than characterize the relevant individuals as Norte\u00f1os, explain that Norte\u00f1os are associated with the Nuestra Familia prison gang, and give general testimony not linked to the particular subsets involved in this case. <em>(Prunty, supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at pp. 82, 83 [\u201cContrary to the minority opinions\u2019 suggestions, we should neither speculate to fill evidentiary gaps [citation], nor defer to the jury\u2019s findings when there is no reasonable basis to do so [citations].\u201d \u201c[The gang expert] did not testify, for instance, about any relationship between Nuestra Familia shot callers and any of the Sacramento-area Norte\u00f1o subsets,\u201d or explain how those relationships connected with the predicate crimes committed by Sutter County subsets. \u201cWhile he did reference \u2018written\u2019 and \u2018unwritten\u2019 rules that govern \u2018what gang members can and can\u2019t do,\u2019 he did not explain whether these rules applied to the particular subsets in this case.\u201d].) At a minimum, <em>Prunty </em>requires that the prosecution, in a case involving Norte\u00f1os and testimony that Norte\u00f1os operate through subsets, introduce evidence specific to the subsets at issue. Here, the prosecution\u2019s evidence was insufficient to meet this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Accordingly, the additional terms of imprisonment imposed on defendant for the enhancements under the STEP Act (10 years as to the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction and one year eight months for the assault conviction) must be stricken. As we have noted, however, in addition to imposing an additional 11 years eight months of imprisonment under the STEP Act (which now must be stricken), the court \u201cstayed\u201d a firearm enhancement of four years on the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction based on the imposition of the gang enhancement for that crime. Because we now strike that gang enhancement, the reasons for the stay no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>exist, and we will modify defendant\u2019s sentence to lift the stay. Defendant\u2019s sentence will now be a total of nine years four months in prison: three years for the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction (count 2); four years for personally using a firearm in the commission of that crime; one year for the assault conviction (count 3); and one year four months for personally using a firearm in the commission of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Defendant\u2019s sentence is modified by striking both of the enhancements under the STEP Act and by lifting the stay on the four-year sentence enhancement for use of a firearm on the attempted voluntary manslaughter conviction (count 2). As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and to forward that amended abstract to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<judges id=\"b785-7\">Raye, P.

At trial, the defense only disputed Bullard\u2019s opinion that defendant committed the alleged crime for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the Norte\u00f1os or its Oak Park subset. \u201cThe defense did not contest that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Norte\u00f1os exist as an umbrella group that qualifies as a criminal street gang and operates through neighborhood subsets.\u201d (Prunty; <em>supra, </em>62 Cal.4th at p. 93, fn. 3 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Corrigan, J.).)
