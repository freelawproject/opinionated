They allege the constitutional sections provide for a judicially enforceable right to an education of \u201csome quality\u201d for all public school children, and, alternatively, that the Legislature is currently violating its constitutional obligations to \u201cprovide for\u201d and \u201ckeep up and support\u201d the \u201csystem of common schools\u201d by its current educational financing system. However, we find no support for finding implied constitutional rights to an education of \u201csome quality\u201d for public school children or a minimum level of expenditures for education, as appellants urge us to read into sections 1 and 5 of article IX. To the contrary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>the language of these constitutional sections do not include qualitative or funding elements that may be judicially enforced by the courts. Rather, the constitutional sections leave the difficult and policy-laden questions associated with educational adequacy and funding to the legislative branch. Consequently, we must affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaints as appellants have failed to state a claim for which judicial relief may be accorded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The two lawsuits before us were deemed related but not consolidated in the trial court. In <em>Campaign for Quality Education </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>plaintiffs are several nonprofit associations and guardians ad litem for minor students attending public schools in California, as well as one adult taxpayer and homeowner and two adult taxpayers and homeowners who are parents of students attending public schools in California. Similarly, in <em>Maya Robles-Wong v. State of California, </em>plaintiffs are several nonprofit associations and guardians ad litem for several students attending public schools in California, as well as several California school districts. Intervener California Teachers Association filed a complaint in intervention in the <em>Robles-Wong </em>action. Defendants in each action are the State of California and various named persons sued in their official capacities as state officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In their operative complaints, all named plaintiffs and intervener (collectively, appellants) seek declaratory and injunctive relief based, in pertinent part, on allegations that all named defendants (collectively, respondents) are violating sections 1 and 5 of article IX. The overarching nature of the causes of action sought to be reinstated are based on allegations that all public school children have a constitutional right to an education of \u201csome quality,\u201d and, alternatively, that the Legislature is currently failing to meet its constitutional duty by employing an irrational educational funding scheme. According to appellants, the Legislature\u2019s current method of funding education fails to ensure that all public school children have the opportunity to become educationally proficient according to current legislatively mandated academic standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Resolving respondents\u2019 separate demurrer and motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court sustained the demurrer and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings, without leave to amend, as to those portions of the causes of action alleging that respondents are violating sections 1 and 5 of article IX. The court granted appellants the right to amend their complaints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>relative to other causes of action, but appellants declined to do so. Accordingly, the court entered judgments dismissing the lawsuits in their entirety. Appellants\u2019 timely appeals ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">I. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In ruling on a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court examines the pleading to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory, with the facts being assumed true for purposes of this inquiry. <em>(Committee for Green Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 32, 42 [105 Cal.Rptr.3d 181, 224 P.3d 920] <em>(Committee for Green </em>Foothills); <em>Pang v. Beverly Hospital, Inc. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 989 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 643].) Our review is de novo. <em>(Committee for Green Foothills, </em>supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 42; <em>Schabarum </em>v. <em>California Legislature </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 745] <em>(Schabarum).) </em>\u201c[W]e treat the properly pleaded allegations of [the] complaint as true, and also consider those matters subject to judicial notice. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1226, 1232 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 900 P.2d 601].) \u201c[T]he allegations of the complaint must be liberally construed with a view to attaining substantial justice among the parties. [Citation.] If there is any reasonable possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error and an abuse of discretion to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend. [Citations.] However, leave to amend is properly denied if the facts and nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claims are clear and under the substantive law, no liability exists. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Beck v. County of San Mateo </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 374, 379 [201 Cal.Rptr. 365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">As noted, appellants limit their appeals to seeking reinstatement of those portions of the causes of action that seek to impose liability on respondents for their alleged violations of sections 1 and 5 of article IX.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants urge us to hold that their claims are justiciable in that if we were to remand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>cases for trial, they would be able to demonstrate that the Legislature\u2019s current education finance system is in violation of the fundamental right to an education guaranteed by article IX, and, the legislative and executive branches of the state should be compelled to take \u201cappropriate action under court supervision.\u201d However, even assuming the truth of the facts as alleged in the complaints, appellants have failed to state causes of action based on alleged violations of sections 1 and 5 of article IX by respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">II. <em>Principles of Constitutional Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">\u201c[I]t is well established that it is a judicial function to interpret the law, including the Constitution, and when appropriately presented in a case or controversy, to declare when an act of the Legislature or the executive is beyond the constitutional authority vested in those branches.\u201d <em>(Schabarum, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 1213.) We must \u201c \u2018enforce the provisions of our Constitution and \u201cmay not lightly disregard or blink at ... a clear constitutional mandate.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Riverside </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 278, 285 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 713, 66 P.3d 718].) \u201c \u2018It is within the legitimate power of the judiciary, to declare the <em>action </em>of the Legislature unconstitutional, where that action exceeds the limits of the supreme law; but the Courts have no means, and no power, to avoid the effects of non-action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(California State Employees\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 103, 109 [108 Cal.Rptr. 60].) \u201cUnlike the federal Constitution, which is a grant of power to Congress, the California Constitution is a limitation or restriction on the powers of the Legislature. [Citations.]  Two important consequences flow from this fact. First, the entire law-making authority of the state, except the people\u2019s right of initiative and referendum, is vested in the Legislature, and that body may exercise any and all legislative powers which are not expressly or by necessary implication denied to it by the Constitution. [Citations.] In other words, \u2018we do not look to the Constitution to determine whether the [L]egislature is authorized to do an act, but only to see if it is prohibited.\u2019 [Citation.] [\u00b6] Secondly, all intendments favor the exercise of the Legislature\u2019s plenary authority: \u2018If there is any doubt as to the Legislature\u2019s power to act in any given case, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the Legislature\u2019s action. Such restrictions and limitations [imposed by the Constitution] are to be construed strictly, and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Methodist Hosp. of Sacramento v. Saylor </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 685, 691 [97 Cal.Rptr. 1, 488 P.2d 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In interpreting sections 1 and 5 of article IX, \u201cour paramount task is to ascertain the intent of those who enacted it\u201d by looking \u201c \u2018to the language of the constitutional text.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 117, 122 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 46, 18 P.3d 1198].) We \u201ccannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>insert or omit words to cause the meaning of [the sections] to conform to a presumed intent that is not expressed. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]; <em>California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 633 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].) \u2018As a judicial body, it is our role to interpret the [sections] as they are written.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Knight v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 14, 23 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 687] <em>(Knight).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">III. <em>Sections 1 and 5 of Article IX Do Not Provide a Qualitative Education Element</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Appellants contend the language and history of sections 1 and 5 of article IX, and seminal judicial decisions declaring public education to be a fundamental right, lead to the inexorable conclusion that public school students have a judicially enforcible constitutional right to an education of some quality. After addressing certain preliminary matters, we conclude that sections 1 and 5 of article IX do not provide for an education of some quality that may be judicially enforced by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">First, there can be no doubt that the fundamental right to a public school education is firmly rooted in California law as it \u201chas historically been accorded an ascendant position in this state. Indeed, at the very start, article IX of our 1849 Constitution created the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction; required the Legislature to encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement; required the Legislature to establish a system of common schools; and established a fund for the support of the common schools. (See Stats. 1849, p. 32.) . . . Section 1 of article IX of the Constitution now provides, as it has since 1879; \u2018A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.\u2019 Section 5 of article IX presently mandates, as it has since 1879: \u2018The Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.\u2019 \u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Hayes </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1522 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 699] <em>(Hayes).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201cThe early case of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1874) 48 Cal. 36, considered the provisions of the Constitution of 1849 relative to educational affairs which, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>all material respects, [are] similar to the present Constitution. The Supreme Court said: \u2018The opportunity of instruction at public schools is afforded the youth of the state by the statute of the state, enacted in obedience to the special command of the constitution of the state, directing that the legislature shall provide for a system of common schools, by which a school shall be kept up and supported in such district. . . , etc. ([A]rt. XIX, [former] [\u00a7] 3). The advantage or benefit thereby vouchsafed to each child, of attending a public school is, therefore, one derived and secured to it under the highest sanction of positive law. <em>It is therefore, a right </em>\u2014 a <em>legal right </em>\u2014 as distinctively so as the vested right in property owned is a legal right, and as such it is protected, and entitled to be protected by all the guarantees by which other legal rights are protected and secured to the possessor.\u2019 <em>([Ward, supra,] </em>48 Cal. at p. 50, italics added; quoted in <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Big Pine School Dist. </em>(1924) 193 Cal. 664, 670 [226 P. 926].)\u201d <em>(Slayton v. Pomona Unified School Dist. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 538, 548-549 [207 Cal.Rptr. 705], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">Second, there is no dispute that \u201cour Constitution vests the Legislature with sweeping and comprehensive powers in relation to our public schools <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>City of Taft </em>[(1956)] 47 Cal.2d [177,] 179 [302 P.2d 574]), including broad discretion to determine the types of programs and services which further the purposes of education <em>([Hayes,] supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1528),\u201d and \u201csuch functions as educational focus, teaching methods, school operations, furnishing of textbooks and the like.\u201d <em>(Wilson v. State Bd. of Education </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1134-1135 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 745] <em>(Wilson); </em>see <em>California Teachers Assn. v. Board of Trustees </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 249, 255 [146 Cal.Rptr. 850] [\u201cthe curriculum and the courses of study included in the common state curriculum are not prescribed by the Constitution, but are details left to the discretion of the Legislature,\u201d and \u201c[t]hey do not constitute a part of the system, but are simply a function of that system\u201d].) And, as appellants admit, the Legislature, consistent with its constitutional authority, has addressed the quality of education to be afforded public school students. (See, e.g., Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 52052-52052.9 [public school performance accountability program], 60640-60649 [California assessment of student performance and progress], 60851-60852.2 [high school exit examination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Third, we agree with the general proposition, embodied in appellants\u2019 arguments, that an education of some quality accords with good public policy. However, the question in this case is not whether the concept of an education of some quality comports with good public policy. The question before us is whether the right to an education of some quality is enshrined, as a <em>constitutional </em>right, under sections 1 and 5 of article IX. Having properly framed the issue, we now analyze appellants\u2019 claims under well-settled principles that guide our interpretation of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>At the outset we note that our Supreme Court has not addressed the issue raised by appellants- \u2014 to wit, whether the right to an education of some quality is enshrined under sections 1 and 5 of article IX. Appellants ask to find that such a constitutional right is judicially enforceable based on the language in sections 1 and 5 of article IX, and as found by courts in other states that have analyzed constitutional provisions similar to article IX. However, as we now discuss, we conclude the language of sections 1 and 5, when read singly or together, in the context of article IX, does not provide for such an enforceable right based on our constitutional language and persuasive decisions of other states that have analyzed almost identical constitutional language. (See <em>Bonner v. Daniels </em>(Ind. 2009) 907 N.E.2d 516, 520 <em>(Bonner); Committee for Educational Equality v. State </em>(Mo. 2009) 294 S.W.3d 477, 488 <em>(Committee for Educational Equality).)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Current sections 1 and 5 of article IX were adopted as part of the California Constitution of 1879. After section l\u2019s \u201cprecatory introduction stressing the importance of knowledge and learning to the preservation of a free government,\u201d the remaining text of sections 1 and 5 imposes two duties on the Legislature. <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>907 N.E.2d at p. 520.) The first is the duty to encourage the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement by \u201call suitable means.\u201d (\u00a7 1.) The second is the duty to \u201cprovide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district.\u201d (\u00a7 5.) Thus, section 1 \u201cis general and aspirational,\u201d but makes no provision for how the Legislature is to achieve its goal except to use \u201c \u2018all suitable means.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>907 N.E.2d at p. 520; see <em>Committee for Educational Equality, supra, </em>294 S.W.3d at p. 489 [\u201c[t]he aspiration for a \u2018general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence\u2019 concerns policy decisions, and these political choices are left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>to the discretion of the other branches of government\u201d].) Section 5 is \u201cmore concrete \u2014 the assignment of a specific task with performance standards\u201d <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>907 N.E.2d at p. 520), namely, to create \u201ca system of common schools,\u201d \u201cfree,\u201d and \u201ckept up and supported in each district\u201d (\u00a7 5). But, section 5 does not \u201cdelineate or identify any specific outcome standards to be achieved by the [Legislature\u2019s] performance of its duty to provide for a system of common schools.\u201d <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>907 N.E.2d at p. 521; see <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1893) 97 Cal. 429, 432 [32 P. 558] [\u201c[t]he term \u2018system,\u2019 \u201d as used in art. IX, \u00a7 5 \u201cimports a unity of purpose as well as an entirety of operation, and the direction to the [Legislature to provide \u2018a\u2019 system of common schools means <em>one </em>system which shall be applicable to all the common schools within the state\u201d].)  \u201cAs can be seen from the text of [sections 1 and 5, the] language speaks only of a general duty to provide for a system of common schools and does not require the attainment of any standard of resulting educational quality. The phrases [\u2018a system of common schools,\u2019 \u2018free,\u2019 and \u2018kept up and supported in each district\u2019] do not require or prescribe any standard of educational achievement that must be attained by the system of common schools.\u201d <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>at p. 521.) Thus, we-find no explicit textual basis from which a constitutional right to a public school education of a particular quality may be discerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Appellants seemingly acknowledge the absence of textual support for the inchoate right to a quality education that they assert here. As such, they argue that sections 1 and 5 of article IX, when read together in the context of article IX, support a finding of an \u201cimplicit\u201d right to an education of \u201csome quality.\u201d However, we are not at liberty to infer the existence of a constitutional right based on well-established principles of constitutional interpretation that counsel otherwise. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>People v. John B. Weller </em>(1858) 11 Cal. 77, 86; \u201cWe do not . . . approve of that principle of constitutional construction, which seeks by vague surmises, or even probable conjecture, or general speculation of a policy not distinctly expressed, to control the express language of the instrument; since such a mode would not unfrequently change the instrument from what its framers made it, into what the Judges think it should have been. Chief Justice Marshall, in Gibbons v. Ogden, ([(1824) 22 U.S. 1;] [6 L.Ed. 23, 9 Wheat. 1]) speaking of the Federal Constitution, says \u2018[the framers,] and the people who adopted it, must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said <em>[id. </em>at p. 188],\u2019 \u201d and, earlier, in <em>Sturges v. Crowninshield </em>(1819) 17 U.S. 122 [4 L.Ed. 529], Chief Justice Marshall says, \u201calthough the spirit of an instrument, especially of a constitution, is to be respected not less than its letter, yet the spirit is to be collected chiefly from its words\u201d (17 U.S. at p. 202). And, more recently, in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 702 [138 L.Ed.2d 772, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 117 S.Ct. 2302], the high court, in addressing the contours of a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>constitutional substantive due process claim, said that \u201c[b]y extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore \u2018exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field,\u2019 [citation], lest the liberty protected ... be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the members of this Court, [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 720.) Consequently, as these decisions instruct, we reject appellants\u2019 invitation to glean, through surmise or speculation, an implicit right to educational adequacy from these sections. We hasten to add that our interpretation of sections 1 and 5 of article IX flows not only from the language of article IX itself, but from a consideration of its purpose.  (See <em>Lungren v. Davis </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 806, 825 [285 Cal.Rptr. <em>777] </em>[\u201cin construing the meaning of the constitutional provisions at issue, we must consider their purposes\u201d].)  \u201c \u2018The proper province of a declaration of rights and constitution of government, after directing its form, regulating its organization and the distribution of its powers, is to declare great principles and fundamental truths, to influence and direct the judgment and conscience of legislators in making laws, rather than to limit and control them, by directing what precise laws they shall make.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>48 Cal. at p. 55 <em>(Ward).) </em> Sections 1 and 5 are \u201c \u2018precisely of this character\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ward, supra, </em>at p. 55) \u2014 the sections declare \u201c \u2018great principles and fundamental truths\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>but do not mandate the Legislature to act in a particular manner regarding what precise laws shall be made to implement these principles and truths. (See <em>Clausing v. San Francisco Unified School Dist. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1224, 1236-1237 [271 Cal.Rptr. 72].) \u201cWe decline [appellants\u2019] invitation to amplify the words and meaning of our Constitution as crafted by its framers and approved by its ratifiers.\u201d <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>907 N.E.2d at p. 522.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>We conclude our discussion here with the views expressed by the Illinois Supreme Court, in <em>Committee for Educational Rights v.

Nor is education a subject within the judiciary\u2019s field of expertise, such that a judicial role in giving content to the education guarantee might be warranted. Rather, the question of educational quality is inherently one of policy involving philosophical and practical considerations that call for the exercise of legislative and administrative discretion. [\u00b6] To hold that the question of educational quality is subject to judicial determination would largely deprive the members of the general public of a voice in a matter which is close to the hearts of all individuals in [the State], Judicial determination of the type of education children should receive and how it can best be provided would depend on the opinions of whatever expert witnesses the litigants might call to testify and whatever other evidence they might choose to present. Members of the general public, however, would be obliged to listen in respectful silence. We certainly do not mean to trivialize the views of educators, school administrators and others who have studied the problems which public schools confront. But nonexperts \u2014 students, parents, employers and other[s] \u2014 also have important views and experiences to contribute which are not easily reckoned through formal judicial fact-finding. In contrast, an open and robust public debate is the lifeblood of the political process in our system of representative democracy. Solutions to problems of educational quality should emerge from a spirited dialogue between the people of the State and their elected representatives.\u201d (672 N.E.2d at p. 1191; see also <em>Wells v.

As a remedy for the purported failure, appellants seek a declaration declaring that the Legislature\u2019s current allocation of funds does not provide an adequate education for all public school students, and an order compelling the Legislature to implement an education financing system that complies with the constitutional right to an education <em>under court supervision. </em>We conclude that appellants are not entitled to the requested relief as they cannot show that the constitutional provisions they invoke restrict legislative discretion in allocating funds for the education of public school children.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">An overview of California\u2019s educational financing scheme, as established by legislation and interpreted by the courts, is helpful to our analysis of appellants\u2019 funding claim. \u201cUnder the state Constitution, the Legislature is obligated to provide for a public school system. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7 5; <em>Wells[, supra,] </em>39 Cal.4th [at p.] 1195 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 108, 141 P.3d 225].) Seeking to promote local involvement, the Legislature established school districts as political subdivisions and delegated to them that duty. <em>(Wells, [supra,] </em>at p. 1195; <em>Butt v. State of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 680-681 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240]; see also <em>[Hayes, supra,] </em>5 Cal.App.4th [at p.] 1523 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 699].) Historically, school districts were largely funded out of local property taxes. <em>(Serrano v. Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 592 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241] <em>(Serrano </em>1); <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest[, supra,] </em>18 Cal.3d [at pp.] 737-738 [135 Cal.Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929] <em>(Serrano II); </em>see <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Sasaki </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1442, 1450 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 103].) Under the California system of financing as it existed until the 1970\u2019s, different school districts could levy taxes and generate vastly different revenues; because of the difference in property values, the same property tax rate would yield widely differing sums in, for example, Beverly Hills and Baldwin Park. <em>(Serrano I, </em>at pp. 592-594.)\u201d <em>(California Redevelopment Assn. v. Matosantos </em>(2011) 53 Cal.4th 231, 243 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 267 P.3d 580] <em>(Matosantos).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">In <em>Serrano v. Priest, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 584 <em>(Serrano I) </em>and <em>Serrano II, </em>our Supreme Court invalidated the 1970\u2019s system of education financing, \u201cholding that education was a fundamental interest <em>(Serrano I, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 608-609; <em>Serrano II, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 765-766) and that financing heavily dependent on local property tax bases denied students equal protection (S<em>errano I, </em>at pp. 614-615; <em>Serrano II, </em>at pp. 768-769, 776). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number><em>Serrano </em>decisions threw \u2018the division of state and local responsibility for educational funding\u2019 into \u2018 \u201ca state of flux.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 414, 419 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 590].) In their aftermath, a \u2018Byzantine\u2019 system of financing <em>([Hayes, supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at p. 1525]) evolved in which the state became the principal financial backstop for local school districts. Funding equalization was achieved by capping individual districts\u2019 abilities to raise revenue and enhancing state contributions to ensure minimum funding levels. (Lockard, <em>In the Wake of </em>Williams v. State: <em>The Past, Present, and Future of Education Finance Litigation in California </em>(2005) 57 Hastings L.J. 385, 388-391; see generally <em>Wells[, supra,] </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 1194 [discussing current funding regime].)\u201d <em>(Matosantos, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 243-244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Thereafter, in 1978, the voters adopted Proposition 13 (art. XIII A, added by Prop. 13, as approved by voters, Primary Elec. (June 6, 1978)), which \u201ccapped ad valorem real property taxes imposed by all local entities at 1 percent (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 1, subd. (a)), reducing the amount of revenue available by more than half (Stark, <em>The Right to Vote on Taxes </em>(2001) 96 Nw.U.L. Rev. 191, 198). In place of multiple property taxes imposed by multiple political subdivisions, it substituted a single tax to be collected by counties and thereafter apportioned. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 1, subd. (a).)\u201d <em>(Matosantos, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 244.) \u201cProposition 13 transformed the government financing landscape in at least three ways .... First, by capping local property tax revenue, it greatly enhanced the responsibility the state would bear in funding government services, especially education. [Citations.] Second, by failing to specify a method of allocation, Proposition 13 largely transferred control over local government finances from the state\u2019s many political subdivisions to the state, converting the property tax from a nominally local tax to a de facto state-administered tax subject to a complex system of intergovernmental grants. [Citations.] Third, by imposing a unified, shared property tax, Proposition 13 created a zero-sum game in which political subdivisions (city, counties, special districts, and school districts) would have to compete against each other for their slices of a greatly shrunken pie.\u201d <em>(Matosantos, supra, </em>at pp. 244-245, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\u201cIn 1988, the voters added another wrinkle with Proposition 98, which established constitutional minimum funding levels for education and required the state to set aside a designated portion of the General Fund for public schools. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8; see <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.4th at p. 420; <em>[Hayes,] supra, </em>5 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1517-1518.) Two years later, the voters revised and effectively increased the minimum funding requirements for public schools. (Prop. Ill, as approved by voters, Primary Elec. (June 5, 1990), amending Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8; see <em>County of Sonoma </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1289 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 784].)\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>(Matosantos, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 245.) With this background in mind, we now turn to an analysis of appellants\u2019 funding claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">As previously stated, appellants assert that the California Constitution mandates that the Legislature appropriate funds for education that are sufficiently adequate to provide all public school students with an equal opportunity to meet proficiency standards currently set by the Legislature. In the <em>Serrano </em>decisions, our Supreme Court determined that the courts were competent to decide whether or not the Legislature\u2019s distribution of state funds for education was consistent with the equal protection of the law provisions of the state Constitution. <em>(Serrano II, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 768-769, 776; <em>Serrano I, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at pp. 614-615.) Appellants argue that the declaratory and injunctive relief they seek is \u201cprecisely the type of relief\u2019 authorized by our Supreme Court in its <em>Serrano </em>decisions. We find no support for appellants\u2019 argument in the <em>Serrano </em>decisions. To the contrary, our Supreme Court made clear in <em>Serrano I </em>that there is no constitutional mandate for the Legislature \u201cto provide funds for each child in the State at some magic level to produce either an adequate-quality educational program or a high-quality educational program.\u201d <em>(Serrano v. Priest </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 36, fn. 6 [141 Cal.Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303] [describing the decision in <em>Serrano </em>I]; see also <em>Serrano I, supra, </em>at p. 596 [\u201carticle IX, section 5 makes no reference to school financing\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellants eschew that they are seeking a court directive compelling the Legislature to provide for \u201ca magic level\u201d or any specific level of educational funds. \u201cFunctionally, however,\u201d their funding claim would require this court to impose its \u201cjudgment over that of the Legislature in order to determine whether a particular policy benefits public education.\u201d <em>(Woonsocket School Committee v. Chafee </em>(R.I. 2014) 89 A.3d 778, 793.) Thus, unlike the <em>Serrano </em>decisions on which appellants rely, allowing appellants\u2019 funding claim to proceed would require the courts to intrude into the Legislature\u2019s appropriation powers, which we decline to do. (See <em>Grossmont Union High School Dist. v. State Dept. of Education </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 869, 889 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 890] (Grossmont) [\u201cunder the California Constitution, the judiciary has no general authority to compel appropriations or second-guess legislative spending decisions\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>We conclude our discussion here by \u201cemphasizing] that the Legislature\u2019s power over our public school system is plenary, subject only to constitutional restraints. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 1134.) Thus, appellants\u2019 assertion \u201cthat the Legislature is not providing enough funding for [education] is not a basis for a lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Grossmont, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at p. 886; see <em>California School Bds. Assn. v.

Appellants raise \u201ca public policy claim, \u2018properly resolved ... in the halls of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Grossmont, supra, </em>at p. 892.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We agree wholeheartedly with appellants that the provision of a quality education for all public school students is an important goal for society as it ensures full participation in our constitutional democracy. Nonetheless, we must deny their request to reinstate those portions of their complaints\u2019 causes of action based on alleged violations of sections 1 and 5 of article IX. When read singly or together, sections 1 and 5 of article IX evince no constitutional mandate to an education of a particular standard of achievement or impose on the Legislature an affirmative duty to provide for a particular level of education expenditures.  Our decision is consistent with the \u201crules of constitutional interpretation, which require that constitutional limitations and restrictions on legislative power \u2018 \u201c \u2018are to be construed strictly, and are not to be extended to include matters not covered by the language used.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.]  Under these principles, there is no basis for applying [sections 1 and 5 of article IX] as an equitable remedy to cure the perceived unfairness resulting from political decisions on funding priorities\u201d (City <em>of San Jose v. State of California </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1802, 1816-1817 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 521]), or to \u201cdelineate or identify any specific outcome standards to be achieved by [the Legislature\u2019s] performance of its duty to provide for a system of common schools\u201d <em>(Bonner, supra, </em>907 N.E.2d at p. 521). In the absence of a challenge to any legislative enactment, we conclude sections 1 and 5 of article IX, standing alone, do not allow the courts to dictate to the Legislature, a coequal branch of government, how to best exercise its constitutional powers to encourage education and provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>and support a system of common schools throughout the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because sections 1 and 5 of article IX do not impose on the Legislature any duties that can be judicially enforced, there is no reason for a judicial evaluation as to whether there has been a breach of those alleged duties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even if the matter were remanded for a trial, appellants would not be entitled to the declaratory and injunctive relief requested in their pleadings. \u201cThe quandary described in the complaint[s] is lamentable, but the remedy lies squarely with the Legislature, not the judiciary.\u201d (Grossmont, <em>supra, </em>169 Cal.App.4th at p. 892.)

I am writing separately to address my particular impressions and observations of the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">There is no question that this case is largely about the adequacy of state financial support for California public schools. Defendants are the State of California, the Governor, State Controller and the Director of the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>of Finance. The Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board of Education are not parties. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief to require the state to \u201cset apart the revenues\u201d to \u201cprovide and support an education finance system\u201d that will provide students \u201cthe opportunity to obtain a meaningful education and to learn the academic content standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Plaintiffs allege that our state\u2019s constitutionally recognized right to education brings with it an obligation of the state to fund education at a qualitative level \u2014 an obligation that arises organically and by implication from a reading of article IX, sections 1 and 5 of our state Constitution together. They say, \u201cTaken as a whole, the language and history of article IX make clear that the fundamental right to an education must have some qualitative meaning, and it is the duty of the State to keep up and support an educational system that provides all California school children that fundamental right.\u201d This implicit constitutional obligation is yet inchoate and undefined, and no court of our state has yet recognized it.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">As much as I can appreciate plaintiffs\u2019 frustration and dissatisfaction with the overall adequacy of California\u2019s public schools, and recognize our Legislature\u2019s challenges in adequately funding schools to meet the standards it sets, I cannot agree that article IX of the California Constitution provides a right to command the state to fund schools at some qualitative level. I so conclude for three principal reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Our state Constitution contains provisions that, plaintiffs acknowledge, explicitly set a minimum level of funding to public schools. But it also contains provisions that set a maximum. Proposition 98 passed by the voters in 1988 and Proposition 111 passed in 1990 established a minimum level of funding commonly known as the minimum funding guarantee, but also established a limit of excess revenues that can go to the schools. (Cal. Const., art. XYI, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 8.5.) Moreover, as recently as 2014, voters approved a measure placed on the ballot by the Legislature to add section 21 to article XVI of the state Constitution to create a state reserve for schools and community colleges and thereby lessen the impact of any economic downturn on the amount of money available to the schools under constitutional formulas. To me, these express provisions conflict with plaintiffs\u2019 argument that an implicit constitutional right to educational adequacy mandates some other minimum specific level of state support to the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Second, I have no quibble with plaintiffs\u2019 position that the state must afford students the \u201copportunity to obtain a meaningful education and to learn the academic content standards.\u201d To me, assessing whether that obligation has been fulfilled begins and ends with whether our educational system enables sufficient numbers of students to meet the standards articulated in state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>statutes. The Superintendent of Public Instruction is required by law to develop an Academic Performance Index that measures the performance of school districts, schools and pupils. This index is required to take into account results of statewide achievement tests administered to students in grades 2 through 11. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52052, subd. (a)(1) &amp; (4)(A).) In 2013, this system of assessment was modified to utilize a new testing method. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52052, as amended by Stats. 2013, ch. 489, \u00a7 1.) The new testing and assessment scheme reflects the \u201cintent of the Legislature that the state\u2019s system of public school accountability be more closely aligned with both the public\u2019s expectations for public education and the workforce needs of the state\u2019s economy. It is therefore necessary that the accountability system evolve beyond its narrow focus on pupil test scores to encompass other valuable information about school performance, including, but not limited to, pupil preparedness for college and career, as well as the high school graduation rates already required by law.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52052, subd. (a)(4)(H).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Plaintiffs say the academic standards articulated in our Education Code inform the constitutional right to a quality education but do not prescribe it. I disagree. It seems to me that our state\u2019s obligation to ensure that most students perform at adequate levels is prescribed in the statutory academic standards. In the event that large numbers of students cannot meet expected levels of achievement, an action should arise under the statutes to improve the performance of our public schools without resort to the general language of article IX of the California Constitution as authority. Such a statutory basis for an action would also be in accord with the general principle of judicial restraint that courts should not decide constitutional questions where other grounds are available and dispositive of the issues. <em>(Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 220, 230 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207, 902 P.2d 225].) Plaintiffs did not allege any statutory theory for a cause of action in this case, so the parameters of such a claim must await another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Finally, also in 2013, our Legislature modified our school funding formula to better address needs based upon differences between school district populations and appropriated an additional $2 billion to the public schools. (Stats. 2013, ch. 47.) Whatever this may mean for the future, one thing seems clear to me. State policymakers are working on the problem, and an action that primarily seeks to increase the amount of state funds provided to the schools may not be the prescription for success. Rather, the balance between more resources and operational and organizational change in the schools may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>need to be differently struck. Recognition of some duty to support and fund the schools at some particular level may, in the end, do little to advance the cause of educational adequacy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\"> A general description of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress System along with reports of the most recent scores can be found on the State Department of Education Web site at &lt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/&gt; (as of Apr. 20, 2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b855-4\">POLLAK, J., Dissenting. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"AyI\">Of the numerous issues presented by this difficult case, two are fundamental: Do sections 1 and 5 of article IX of the California Constitution compel the state to maintain an elementary school system for grades kindergarten through 12 (K-12) that meets some minimal qualitative standard and, if so, is the claim that the present school system fails to meet that standard justiciable \u2014 that is, may the courts entertain that claim and seek to compel the appropriate state agencies to correct the deficiency? Neither question is susceptible to a facile response. The same issues have been considered at length under similar provisions of other state constitutions by the highest courts of numerous states \u2014 with different outcomes. Most state supreme courts addressing the question have read their state constitutions implicitly to mandate a minimum qualitative educational system which they have struggled to enforce,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while a lesser number have either held the mandate lacking or the courts unsuited to articulate and enforce any such qualitative standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the parties here attempt to distinguish many of these out-of-state cases based on differences in the terminology of the respective state\u2019s constitutional provisions, as a general proposition these differences in phraseology are insignificant. All of the constitutions, like the California Constitution, in substance require the state to support a system of public or common schools. Although some state constitutional provisions refer to the maintenance of \u201cefficient\u201d or \u201cthorough and efficient\u201d schools or school systems, or like terms, none explicitly indicate a particular level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>achievement that is required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The different outcomes result less from differences in the wording of the respective constitutions than from different perceptions of the role properly played by the courts in overseeing compliance with the state\u2019s basic charter. I respectfully dissent from my colleagues\u2019 decision to align California with those few state courts that have declined to accept the responsibility to enforce the right of every child to an adequate education.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">1. <em>Do sections 1 and 5 of article IX of the California Constitution impose a minimum qualitative standard?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">There is, of course, no question but that the California Constitution mandates a public school system, which has been held to apply to grades K-12. <em>(Levi </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 700, 708 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 691].) Section 5 of article IX of the California Constitution requires the Legislature to <em>\u201cprovide\u201d </em>for a system of common schools that <em>\u201cshall be kept up and supported\u201d </em>for at least six months of the year. (Italics added.) While this section says nothing explicitly about the necessary quality of such schools, its meaning is informed by section 1 of article IX of the California Constitution. Section 1 begins with the recognition that \u201c[a] general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence\u201d is essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, and requires the Legislature to \u201cencourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.\u201d Presumably the system of common schools prescribed by section 5 must encourage the promotion of such improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In holding that education is a fundamental interest under our state Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, in the landmark decision <em>Serrano v. Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241], the Supreme Court began \u201cby examining the indispensable role which education plays in the modern industrial state. This role, we believe, has two significant aspects: first, education is a major determinant of an individual\u2019s chances for economic and social success in our competitive society; second, education is a unique influence in a child\u2019s development as a citizen and his participation in political and community life. \u2018[The] pivotal position of education to success in American society and its essential role in opening up to the individual the central experiences of our culture lend it an importance that is undeniable.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, education is the lifeline of both the individual and society.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number><em>(Id. </em>at p. 605.) The <em>Serrano </em>court went on to quote from the historic <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>decision <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 483, 493 [98 L.Ed. 873, 74 S.Ct. 686]), that \u201c \u2018[i]n these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.\u2019 \u201d (5 Cal.3d at p. 606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">As the majority opinion recognizes, and I repeat here two paragraphs of the opinion, \u201cthere can be no doubt that the fundamental right to a public school education is firmly rooted in California law as it \u2018has historically been accorded an ascendant position in this state. Indeed, at the very start, article IX of our 1849 Constitution created the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction; required the Legislature to encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement; required the Legislature to establish a system of common schools; and established a fund for the support of the common schools. (See Stats. 1849, p. 32.) . . . Section 1 of article IX of the Constitution now provides, as it has since 1879: \u201cA general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.\u201d Section 5 of article IX presently mandates, as it has since 1879: \u201cThe Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.\u201d \u2019 <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. Hayes </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1522 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 699] . . . .) [\u00b6] The early case of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1874) 48 Cal. 36 considered the provisions of the Constitution of 1849 relative to educational affairs which, in all material respects, [are] similar to the present Constitution. The Supreme Court said: \u201cThe opportunity of instruction at public schools is afforded the youth of the state by the statute of the state, enacted in obedience to the special command of the constitution of the state, directing that the legislature shall provide for a system of common schools, by which a school shall be kept up and supported in such district . . . , etc. ([A]rt. XIX, [former] [\u00a7] 3). The advantage or benefit thereby vouchsafed to each child, of attending a public school is, therefore, one derived and secured to it under the highest sanction of positive law. <em>It is therefore, a right </em>\u2014 a <em>legal right </em>\u2014 as distinctively so as the vested right in property owned is a legal right, and as such it is protected, and entitled to be protected by all the guarantees by which other legal rights are protected and secured to the possessor.\u201d <em>([Ward, supra,] </em>48 Cal. at p. 50, italics added ....)\u2019 <em>(Slayton v. Pomona Unified School Dist. </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 538, 548-549 [207 Cal.Rptr. 705], fn. omitted.)\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 906-907.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Thus, our state\u2019s jurisprudence makes clear that our children have a right to an education. And, as Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye wrote when sitting on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Court of Appeal, \u201cnaturally\u201d the school system mandated by the Constitution \u201cshould provide a high quality education for all the students of our state.\u201d <em>(Levi v. O\u2019Connell, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.4th at p. 708.) In that case, involving the demands of a highly gifted teenager, the court held that California Constitution, article IX, section 5 does not confer \u201ca right to a free college education.\u201d <em>(Levi, </em>p. 710.) But neither that nor any other decision takes issue with our Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Serrano v. Priest, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at page 607, that \u201csurely the right to an education today means more than access to a classroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">As the majority of state courts addressing this issue has recognized, if the constitutional provision is to have meaning, it must imply that the system of common schools must provide some minimum qualitative level of education. Such a reading of article IX of the California Constitution is fully consistent with, if not compelled by, the importance that our Supreme Court historically has placed on the role of education and the recognition that it is a fundamental right of all the state\u2019s children. Certainly there are extremes that all would agree fail to meet the constitutional standard \u2014 such as a curriculum that did not include reading or arithmetic, or a schedule of only one day or one hour per week. As stated by the Texas Supreme Court in a case much like the one before us, \u201cno one would dispute that a public education system limited to teaching first-grade reading would be inadequate.\u201d <em>(Neeley </em>v. <em>West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra, </em>176 S.W.3d at p. 778.) Indeed, in <em>Butt </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 668 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240], in determining whether the truncation of the school term by a school district violates the state Constitution\u2019s guaranty of educational equality, our Supreme Court pointed to the need to consider \u201cthe actual quality of the district\u2019s program, viewed as a whole.\u201d <em>(Butt, supra, </em>at pp. 686-687; see also, e.g., <em>Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell, supra, </em>990 A.2d at pp. 249-250 [\u201cour research has revealed that those state courts that have reached the merits of the issue overwhelmingly have held that there is a floor with respect to the adequacy of the education provided pursuant to their states\u2019 education clauses; that education must be in some way \u2018minimally adequate\u2019 or \u2018soundly basic\u2019 \u201d (fn. omitted)]; <em>Gannon v. State, supra, </em>319 P.3d at p. 1228] [\u201c <em>\u2018There is a point where the legislature\u2019s funding of education may be so low </em>that ... it would be impossible to find that the legislature has made \u201csuitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state.\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The seemingly obvious point, with which my colleagues disagree, that the constitutional mandate to provide a public school system implies the need to maintain public schools at some minimum level of competence, is brought home by comparison to the right to counsel. Although both the federal and state Constitutions say merely that there is a right to \u201cthe assistance of counsel\u201d (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15), there is no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>that this right implies that the assistance must be effective or adequate assistance. As noted by one commentator, \u201c[t]he parallels between the right to adequate counsel and a right to adequate education have not gone unnoticed by the California Supreme Court; the court compared the two in its first <em>Serrano </em>decision, and even noted that \u2018from a larger perspective, education may have far greater social significance\u2019 than the right to a fair trial.\u201d (Gordon, <em>supra, </em>67 Hastings L.J. at p. 350; see <em>Serrano v. Priest, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Recognizing that the public schools must operate at some minimum level of proficiency admittedly does not define the quality of the system that must be maintained. Certainly the Constitution does not mandate particular curriculum or instructional methods, specifics that are within the discretion of the Legislature to determine. \u201cThere can thus be no doubt that our Constitution vests the Legislature with sweeping and comprehensive powers in relation to our public schools <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>City of Taft </em>[(1956)] 47 Cal.2d [177,] 179 [302 P.2d 574]), including broad discretion to determine the types of programs and services which further the purposes of education <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, 5 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1528).\u201d <em>(Wilson v. State Bd. of Education </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1134-1135 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 745].) \u201c[T]he curriculum and courses of study are not constitutionally prescribed [but] ... are <em>details </em>left to the Legislature\u2019s discretion [and] ... do not constitute part of the system but are merely a function of it. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>[(1978)] 82 Cal.App.3d [249,] 255 [146 Cal.Rptr. 850].) The same could be said for such functions as educational focus, teaching methods, school operations, furnishing of textbooks and the like.\u201d <em>(Wilson, supra, </em>at p. 1135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Yet, the specifics of the education system prescribed by the Legislature do not necessarily create a system that provides students with a minimally acceptable basic education. The complaints before us forcefully allege that the current system does not do so. Plaintiffs allege that although \u201cthe state has established a comprehensive education program that defines specific academic knowledge, skills, and abilities that all public schools are expected to teach and all students are expected to learn . . . , [t]here is . . . one glaring omission in the state\u2019s required educational \u2018system\u2019: The state makes absolutely no attempt to align funding policies and mechanisms with the educational program it has put in place, to determine the actual cost of the educational program, or to provide districts with the financial resources to provide the programs and services it has prescribed. Nor does the state\u2019s funding scheme take into account the learning needs of certain populations of students, including English Learners and economically disadvantaged children, to ensure that all children receive an opportunity to achieve the state\u2019s educational goals and thus have an opportunity to participate in civic life and become productive participants in the economy. Instead, the state bases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>funding for its education program on formulas that were cobbled together decades ago for a very different educational program and very different needs.\u201d Plaintiffs quote the 2007 report of the Governor\u2019s Committee on Education Excellence, \u201c \u2018California\u2019s current K-12 education finance system is the most complex in the nation but yields little benefits. Core funding is based on anachronistic formulas, neither tied to the needs of individual students nor to intended academic outcomes.\u2019 \u201d The same report characterizes the educational system as \u201cfundamentally flawed. It is not close to helping each student become proficient in mastering the state\u2019s clear curricular standards, and wide disparities persist between rich and poor, between students of color and others, and between English learners and native English speakers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Under the current system and the minimum funding guarantee of Proposition 98<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 which plaintiffs allege \u201chas become an artificial cap on education spending whose formulas are routinely manipulated by the state for further reductions or delays in funding\u201d \u2014 per pupil spending in California in 2008 and 2009, adjusted for regional cost differences allegedly \u201cwas $2,856 less per pupil than the national average, or an abysmal 47th in the country.\u201d In 2007 and 2008, according to the allegations in one complaint, \u201cCalifornia ranked at or near the bottom in the nation in staffing ratios: 49th in total school staff; 47th in principals and assistant principals; 49th in guidance counselors; 50th in librarians; and 49th in access to computers. California educates over 1.7 million students more than Texas, but does so with 16,700 fewer teachers.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Besides insufficient and undertrained staff, plaintiffs allege that the state\u2019s public schools suffer from inadequate instructional programs, insufficient materials, equipment and facilities, inadequate data systems and an inadequate system for ensuring uniform teacher quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Consequently, the complaints allege: \u201cCalifornia students are directly harmed by the state\u2019s failure to meet its constitutional obligation to support its system of public schools. In 2008-09, only 50% of California\u2019s students were proficient in English-Language Arts; only 37% of African-American students, 37% of Hispanic students. 36% of economically disadvantaged students, and 20% of English Learners reached this level. Only 46% of California\u2019s students were proficient in Mathematics; this percentage dropped to 30% for African-American students, 36% for Hispanic students, 37% for economically disadvantaged students, and 32% for English Learners. By eleventh grade, students in these groups had fallen even farther- \u2014 in English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>language Arts, only 25% of African-American students, 26% of Hispanic students and economically disadvantaged students, and 5% of English Learners reached proficiency. Even for California students who are not economically disadvantaged, California still ranks tied for 43rd in fourth grade reading and tied for 41st in eighth grade math. [\u00b6] These dismal statistics reflect only the students who remain in school through eleventh grade. . . . Fewer than 70% of California students graduate from high school. The graduation rates are even lower for African-American and Hispanic students, whose graduation rates are both less than 60%. Less than half of African-American males graduate from high school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">The lengthy complaints and extensive briefing, filled with references to a multitude of official reports and academic studies and papers, provide considerably more specifics, criticisms, and proposals than would be profitable to set out at this point. Among other reasons why further specificity here would be pointless is that in the several years that these cases have been pending, there have been legislative and funding changes that may affect the present accuracy of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. Should these actions proceed to trial, the focus would of course be on current conditions to the extent that relevant data is available. Nonetheless, despite changes \u2014 hopefully improvements \u2014 that have occurred more recently, the fundamental issues raised by the complaints remain: Does the California Constitution imply minimum qualitative requirements for the state\u2019s educational system, and is it for the courts to determine whether those requirements are satisfied and to enforce them if they are not?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The contention that the current system fails to satisfy a constitutional mandate necessarily supposes a standard by which to define a minimally acceptable quality of education. The inherent difficulty of articulating such a standard, and the absence of such an articulation within the language of the state constitutions, in large part underlies the refusal of those state supreme courts that have declined to interpret their constitution to imply such a standard. However, decisions from many other states demonstrate that courts are capable of articulating such a standard, albeit a standard that is general and requires intensive factual analysis to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In <em>Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State, supra, </em>655 N.E.2d 661 <em>(Campaign I), </em>for example, the New York Court of Appeals, with only the pleadings before it, did \u201cnot attempt to definitively specify what the constitutional concept and mandate of a sound basic education entails\u201d but \u201carticulate[d] a template reflecting [its] judgment of what the trier of fact must consider in determining whether defendants have met their constitutional obligation\u201d (id., at pp. 666-667). The court held that a sound basic education within the meaning of the New York Constitution \u201cshould consist of the basic literacy, calculating, and verbal skills necessary to enable children to eventually function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>productively as civic participants capable of voting and serving on a jury.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 666.) Further, \u201cChildren are entitled to minimally adequate physical facilities and classrooms which provide enough light, space, heat, and air to permit children to learn. Children should have access to minimally adequate instrumentalities of learning such as desks, chairs, pencils, and reasonably current textbooks. Children are also entitled to minimally adequate teaching of reasonably up-to-date basic curricula such as reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies, by sufficient personnel adequately trained to teach those subject areas.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Following a trial, in <em>Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State of New York </em>(2003) 100 N.Y.2d 893 [769 N.Y.S.2d 106, 801 N.E.2d 326] <em>(Campaign II), </em>the court defined \u201csound basic education\u201d more exactly, as the \u201copportunity for a meaningful high school education, one which prepares [children] to function productively as civic participants.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>801 N.E.2d at p. 332; see <em>Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc. v. State of New York </em>(2006) 8 N.Y.3d 14 [828 N.Y.S.2d 235, 861 N.E.2d 50, 53] <em>(Campaign III).) </em>\u201cTo determine whether New York City schools in fact deliver the opportunity for a sound basic education, the trial court took evidence on the \u2018inputs\u2019 children receive \u2014 teaching, facilities and instrumentalities of learning \u2014 and their resulting \u2018outputs,\u2019 such as test results and graduation and dropout rates.\u201d <em>(Campaign II, supra, </em>at p. 332.) Ultimately, based on the evidence presented at trial, the high court upheld the finding that there was a causal link between the state\u2019s funding system and the failure of New York City\u2019s schools to provide children \u201cthe constitutionally-mandated opportunity for a sound basic education.\u201d <em>(Campaign II, supra, </em>at p. 340; see <em>Campaign III, supra, </em>861 N.E.2d at p. 52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">A somewhat similar standard was articulated by the Supreme Court of Kentucky. <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Council for Better Education, supra, </em>790 S.W.2d 186.) Interpreting its state constitutional provision requiring the legislature to \u201cprovide for an efficient system of common schools\u201d (Ky. Const., \u00a7 183), the court held that \u201c[t]he essential, and minimal, characteristics of an \u2018efficient\u2019 system of common schools\u201d include providing all children with an adequate education, and that an adequate education is one which has as its goal the development of \u201cat least the seven following capabilities: (i) sufficient oral and written communication skills to enable students to function in a complex and rapidly changing civilization; (ii) sufficient knowledge of economic, social, and political systems to enable the students to make informed choices; (iii) sufficient understanding of governmental processes to enable the student to understand the issues that affect his or her community, state, and nation; (iv) sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental and physical wellness; (v) sufficient grounding in the arts to enable each student to appreciate his or her cultural and historical heritage; (vi) sufficient training or preparation for advanced training in either academic or vocational fields so as to enable each child to choose and pursue life work intelligently; and (vii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>sufficient levels of academic or vocational skills to enable public school students to compete favorably with their counterparts in surrounding states, in academics or in the job market.\u201d (790 S.W.2d at p. 212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered \u201c[t]he guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court of Kentucky [to] fairly reflect [its] view\u201d of the applicable guidelines under the Massachusetts Constitution. <em>(McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Education, supra, </em>615 N.E.2d at p. 554.) And the Supreme Court of Kansas \u201cexpressly adopted the <em>Rose </em>court\u2019s articulated standards like other supreme courts,\u201d deeming them \u201cminimal standards\u201d that \u201c \u2018should be considered as minimum goals in providing an adequate education.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gannon </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>319 P.3d at p. 1236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded, \u201cconsistent with the conclusions of other state courts that have considered similar constitutional guarantees, that [the Connecticut constitutional provision that \u2018there shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state\u2019] embodies a substantive component requiring that the public schools provide their students with an education suitable to give them the opportunity to be responsible citizens able to participate fully in democratic institutions such as jury service and voting, and to prepare them to progress to institutions of higher education, or to attain productive employment and otherwise to contribute to the state\u2019s economy.\u201d <em>(Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell, supra, </em>990 A.2d at p. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Other state supreme courts have defined the contours of an acceptable system of public education in their own way, but have similarly concluded that the constitutional requirement of maintaining a system of public schools implies the duty to support the system at some qualitative level. (E.g., <em>McCleary v. State, supra, </em>269 P.3d at pp. 231, 236, 250 [education required under state constitution \u201cconsists of the <em>opportunity </em>to obtain the knowledge and skills\u201d described in a prior opinion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in four learning goals specified in a subsequently adopted and amended basic education act and in academic learning requirements \u201cin nine separate content areas, including reading, math, science, writing, communication, social studies, the arts, health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>fitness, and educational technology\u201d]; <em>Pauley </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>255 S.E.2d 859, 877-878 [\u201ca thorough and efficient system of schools . . . develops, as best the state of education expertise allows, the minds, bodies and social morality of its charges to prepare them for useful and happy occupations, recreation and citizenship, and does so economically.

[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . \u2022 [T]he Thorough and Efficient Clause requires the development of certain high quality educational standards, and ... it is in part by these quality standards that the existing educational system must be tested.\u201d]; see also, e.g., <em>Robinson v. Cahill, </em>69 N.J. 449 [355 A.2d 129] [\u201cThe Constitution\u2019s guarantee must be understood to embrace that educational opportunity which is needed in the contemporary setting to equip a child for his role as a citizen and as a competitor in the labor market.\u201d]; <em>Campbell County School Dist. v.

Secretary of the Executive Office of Education, supra, </em>615 N.E.2d at page 517, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered these issues in the context of the commonwealth\u2019s constitutional provision requiring the commonwealth to \u201ccherish\u201d the public schools. The court reviewed the history of public education in Massachusetts and noted the importance attached to such education. The court concluded that \u201c[w]hat emerges from this review is that the words are not merely aspirational or hortatory, but obligatory. What emerges also is that the Commonwealth has a duty to provide an education for <em>all </em>its children, rich and poor, in every city and town of the Commonwealth at the public school level . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 548.) The record in that case \u201cshow[ed] clearly that, while the present statutory and financial schemes purport to provide equal educational opportunity in the public schools for every child, rich or poor, the reality is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>children in the less affluent communities (or in the less affluent parts of them) are not receiving their constitutional entitlement of education as intended and mandated by the framers of the Constitution.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 552.) The court concluded \u201cthat the Commonwealth has failed to meet its constitutional obligation.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In <em>Abbeville County School District v. State, supra, </em>767 S.E.2d at page 167, the Supreme Court of South Carolina \u201cacknowledge[d] that the Defendants enacted a robust education scheme designed to address the critical aspects of public education,\u201d but observed that \u201cstudent performance in the Plaintiff Districts demonstrates an apparent disconnect between intentions and performance.\u201d According to the court, \u201cThe measurable inputs and outputs show that the Defendants have failed to provide students in the Plaintiff Districts the requisite constitutional opportunity. Inadequate transportation fails to convey children to school or home in a manner conducive to even minimal academic achievement. Students in the Plaintiff Districts receive instruction in many cases from a corps of unprepared teachers. Students in these districts are grouped by economic class into what amounts to no more than educational ghettos, rated by the Department of Education\u2019s guidelines as substandard. Large percentages of the students in the Plaintiff Districts \u2014 over half in some instances \u2014 are unable to meet minimal benchmarks on standardized tests, but are nonetheless pushed through the system to \u2018graduate.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 175.) The court held that \u201cSouth Carolina\u2019s educational funding scheme is a fractured formula denying students in the Plaintiff Districts the constitutionally required opportunity [for a basic education].\u201d (Id., at p. 173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">As have the courts of these many states and others, I too conclude that the provisions of our state Constitution requiring the state to support a system of common schools is not without substance, and that the Constitution requires a system that provides students with a meaningful basic education in reality as well as on paper. As demonstrated by the experience in those states in which their Constitution has been interpreted to mandate an educational system meeting a qualitative standard, a standard such as those articulated in the opinions quoted above, though general, permits meaningful evaluation of a school system by educational professionals and experts. \u201cThese standards import a wide spectrum of considerations and are admittedly imprecise, but they are not without content. . . . The constitutional standards provide an appropriate basis for judicial review and determination.\u201d <em>(Neeley </em>v. <em>West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra, </em>176 S.W.3d at pp. 778-779.) As noted by the Connecticut Supreme Court, its \u201cexplication of a constitutionally adequate education\u201d (quoted above) was \u201ccrafted in broad terms.\u201d <em>(Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v. Rell, supra, </em>990 A.2d at p. 254.) But, the court points out, this breadth reflects not only the \u201crecognition of the political branches\u2019 constitutional responsibilities, and indeed, greater expertise, with respect to the implementation of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>educational policies\u201d and that \u201cthe specific educational inputs or instrumen-talities suitable to achieve this minimum level of education may well change over time,\u201d but that \u201clike any other principle of constitutional law, this broad standard likely will be refined and developed further as it is applied to the facts eventually to be found at trial in this case.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 254-255.) Using such a standard, the courts can determine whether the existing system of funding and governing California\u2019s public schools complies with the constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">2. <em>Is the claim that the public school system fails to comply with the constitutional standard </em>justiciable?</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Defendants here make the same contention that other states have made in most of the cases cited above. As in the South Carolina case, they argue that \u201c \u2018the term \u201cminimally adequate education\u201d is purposely ambiguous, objectively unknowable, and unworkable in a judicial setting,\u2019 and that determining whether the Defendants are meeting their constitutional duty presents a non-justiciable political question.\u201d <em>(Abbeville County School Dist. v. State, supra, </em>767 S.E.2d at p. 163.) My two colleagues essentially adopt this view but, like the Supreme Court of South Carolina, I respectfully disagree. As the court there stated, \u201cCourts may experience difficulty in determining the precise parameters of constitutionally acceptable behavior; however, this imprecision does not necessarily signify that courts cannot determine when a party\u2019s actions, or the results of those actions, fall outside the boundaries of such constitutional parameters. [Citations.] [\u00b6] . . . [A]s Chief Justice John Marshall famously stated, \u2018[I]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison </em>(1803) 5 U.S. 137, 138 [2 L.Ed. 60].)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The justiciability of a claim that the state is not providing students with a basic education required by the state constitution has been exhaustively analyzed in the opinions of numerous other state supreme courts. As did the Kansas Supreme Court, many have focused on the \u201c \u2018six characteristics or elements one or more of which must exist to give rise to a political question\u2019 \u201d that is nonjusticiable set out in <em>Baker v. Carr </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 186, 217 [7 L.Ed.2d 663, 82 S.Ct. 691]. <em>(Gannon </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>319 P.3d at p. 1218; see <em>id., </em>at pp. 1219-1231.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the Kansas court concluded, \u201cMost state supreme courts have rejected the nonjusticiability argument \u2014 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>necessarily include those courts that have expressly rejected the contention that no judicially manageable standards were contained in the education articles of their own constitutions.\u201d <em>(Gannon, </em>supra, at p. 1226.) That court observed that a majority of state courts, including the Texas Supreme Court, have held that \u201c \u2018the separation of powers does not preclude the judiciary from determining whether the legislature has met its constitutional obligation to the people to provide for public education.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1230, quoting <em>Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra, </em>176 S.W.3d at pp. 780-781.) As many other courts have concluded, while the courts must \u201c \u2018defer to the [legislature in matters of policymaking,\u2019... \u2018it is the province of the [j]udicial branch to define, and safeguard, rights provided by the [state] Constitution, and order redress for violation of them.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Campaign III, supra, </em>861 N.E.2d at p. 58; see <em>Leandro v. State </em>(1997) 346 N.C. 336 [488 S.E.2d 249, 253-254] [\u201cWhen a government action is challenged as unconstitutional, the courts have a duty to determine whether that action exceeds constitutional limits. . . . Therefore, it is the duty of this Court to address [the plaintiffs\u2019] constitutional challenge to the state\u2019s public education system.\u201d (citation omitted)]; <em>De Rolph </em>v. <em>State </em>(1997) 78 Ohio St.3d 193 [1997 Ohio 84, 677 N.E.2d 733, 737] [\u201cWe will not dodge our responsibility by asserting that this case involves a nonjusticiable political question. To do so is unthinkable. We refuse to undermine our role as judicial arbiters and to pass our responsibilities onto the lap of the [legislature].\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">To a large extent, defendants\u2019 argument and the opinions of my two colleagues rest on the premise that plaintiffs are seeking to compel the California Legislature to appropriate additional funds for K-12 education, which is beyond the constitutional province of the judiciary. While plaintiffs\u2019 complaints surely indicate that additional funding is required to bring the public schools up to minimal constitutional quality, there are several reasons for which this limitation on judicial authority and respect for the role of the legislative and executive branches of government do not compel the dismissal of the action. Initially, the complaints address more than the level of present funding. Plaintiffs do not allege simply that the amount of funds appropriated to the schools is insufficient, but that the system by which funds are allocated among schools and school districts is significantly responsible for the inadequacies in the educational system. \u201c[M]oney is only one of a number of elements that must be studied in giving definition and content to the constitutional promise of a thorough and efficient education.\u201d <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Cahill </em>(1976) 69 N.J. 449 [355 A.2d 129, 132].) An observation of the Texas Supreme Court may well apply here: following trial, the court there was convinced \u201cthat defects in the structure of the public school finance system expose the system to constitutional challenge. Pouring more money into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>system may forestall those challenges, but only for a time. They will repeat until the system is overhauled.\u201d <em>(Neeley </em>v. <em>West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra, </em>176 S.W.3d at p. 754, fn. omitted.) Plaintiffs here point, for example, to the reliance on average daily attendance to determine the amount of base funding each school receives, rather than on the educational needs of each school\u2019s student population. At the same time (and perhaps somewhat inconsistently) plaintiffs allege that approximately one-third of educational funds are distributed in the form of categorical grants that impose unduly restrictive conditions and reduce available teaching hours by requiring excessive paperwork and administrative chores. The current funding system, they allege, provides insufficient flexibility to the individual schools and school districts to fashion their curriculum and programs to meet the particular educational needs of the students in their school or school district. Plaintiffs allege that the present system incorporates inadequate teacher training, and some plaintiffs also attribute deficiencies to the methods of teacher evaluation, promotion and discipline.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, even if one assumes that full correction of the alleged deficiencies in the educational system cannot be achieved without additional funding, it does not follow that causative defects cannot be identified in judicial proceedings and steps ordered to correct them without overstepping the proper limits of judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Furthermore, to the extent that more funds are necessary to provide all students with the basic education mandated by the Constitution, the court\u2019s inability to compel the Legislature to appropriate those funds is no reason for the court to refrain from exercising its proper authority to determine whether the state is complying with the constitutional mandate. We need not presume that the Legislature will fail to respond appropriately if the court should ultimately determine that the Constitution is being violated by the lack of sufficient funding. Indeed, our Supreme Court has previously expressed its confidence that \u201cthe Legislature, aided by what we have said today . . . will be able to devise a public school financing system which achieves constitutional conformity.\u201d <em>(Serrano v. Priest </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 728, 775, fn. 54 [135 Cal.Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929].) Many other courts, while recognizing the need for deference to the role of the legislature, have echoed this view. (E.g., <em>Ex parte James </em>(Ala. 1997) 713 So.2d 869, 882 [\u201c[T]he judiciary should not presume <em>at the outset </em>of litigation of this nature that legislative and executive officials will be derelict in their duties. Indeed, it must assume the contrary.\u201d].) Moreover, as the experience in other states confirms, various forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>of relief are available short of ordering the legislature to appropriate funds. Courts have required plans to be developed to address and correct adjudicated deficiencies. The intensive examination of the system that trial of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations would necessarily entail may be expected to yield other specific forms of relief. I would not at this preliminary stage attempt to predict the outcome of further proceedings, but I do not assume that no meaningful relief is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">It is true that the experience in some states where the courts have ordered relief has not been entirely positive. In the State of Washington, the Washington Supreme Court has held the state in contempt for failing to comply with its orders. <em>(McCleary </em>v. <em>State of Washington, </em>84362-7, Supreme Ct. Order, Sept. 11, 2014.) In Kansas, school closings have been threatened as the result of judicial intervention. (Eveld, <em>Kansas Supreme Court voices aggravation at Legislature in school funding case, </em>The Kansas City Star (Nov. 6, 2015) &lt;http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article43417731.html&gt; [as of Apr. 20, 2016].) Litigation in Texas has given rise to multiple decisions from the Texas Supreme Court since 1989, producing this dissenting opinion in 2005: \u201cOf course, the true goal of this litigation is to put pressure on the Texas Legislature. We demanded legislative changes by holding the Texas school-finance system unconstitutional in [three separate cases] . . . [and] warned that we might do so again soon in [two other cases]. The Court fulfills that threat today. But there is no end in sight; if the past is any indication, the new funding will not last long, and public education will not change much.\u201d <em>(Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra, </em>176 S.W.3d at pp. 800-801 (dis. opn. of Brister, J.), fns. omitted.) Litigation in those states is still ongoing, however, so that it cannot yet be said to what extent the court\u2019s involvement will have improved the quality of education in those jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In other states extended litigation following the court\u2019s recognition of a constitutional mandate for quality education has produced meaningful improvements in the educational system. In Massachusetts, for example, in 1993 its highest court directed entry of a declaration that the provisions of the commonwealth\u2019s constitution \u201cimpose an enforceable duty on the magistrates and Legislatures of this Commonwealth to provide education in the public schools for the children there enrolled\u201d and \u201cthat the constitutional duty is not being currently fulfilled by the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>(McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of Executive Office of Education, supra, </em>615 N.E.2d at p. 555.) The court articulated broad guidelines, and \u201cassume[d] that the Commonwealth will fulfil its duty to remedy the constitutional violations that [it] identified.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 554.) The court declared that \u201cit is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to take such steps as may be required in each instance effectively to devise a plan and sources of funds sufficient to meet the constitutional mandate\u201d (id., at pp. 555-556) and authorized the lower court to \u201cretain jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>determine whether, within a reasonable time, appropriate legislative action has been taken\u201d (id., at p. 556). In 2005, although the lower court had ruled that the state had not yet fully met its constitutional obligations, a majority of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded, \u201cIn the twelve years since <em>McDuffy </em>was decided, the elected branches have acted to transform a dismal and fractured public school system into a unified system that has yielded, as the judge found, \u2018impressive results in terms of improvement in overall student performance.\u2019 She found that \u2018spending gaps between districts based on property wealth have been reduced or even reversed. The correlation between a district\u2019s median family income and spending has also been reduced.\u2019 Public dollars for public education are now being allocated to where they are the most effective: defining core educational goals for all students, evaluating student performance toward those goals, and holding schools and school districts accountable for achieving those goals. ... A system mired in failure has given way to one that, although far from perfect, shows a steady trajectory of progress.\u201d <em>(Hancock </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Education </em>(2005) 443 Mass. 428 [822 N.E.2d 1134, 1138-1139], citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In New York, the high court\u2019s ruling that the education article of their state constitution \u201crequire[d] the State to offer all children the opportunity for a sound basic education\u201d <em>(Campaign I, supra, </em>655 N.E.2d at p. 666) led to a trial at which it was determined that inadequate funding caused New York City children not to receive that opportunity <em>(Campaign II, supra, </em>801 N.E.2d at pp. 340-344). The court directed the state to ensure by means of \u201c[r]eforms to the current system of financing school funding and managing schools . . . that every school in New York City would have the resources necessary for providing the opportunity for a sound basic education.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 348.) The court directed the state to ascertain the actual cost of providing a sound basic education in New York City, rather than the state as a whole, and set a deadline to implement its directive. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 348-349.) In response, the governor promptly issued an executive order creating the New York State Commission on Education Reform, charged with recommending education financing and other reforms that would ensure that all children in New York State have an opportunity to obtain a sound basic education. <em>(Campaign III, supra, </em>861 N.E.2d at p. 53.) Based on a methodology explained in <em>Campaign III, </em>and the resulting estimated \u201cspending gaps,\u201d the governor proposed legislation to provide increased funding to fill those gaps. That legislation was not initially enacted <em>(id., </em>at p. 55), but according to the 2007 update from the New York State Assembly Education Committee, \u201cin response to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Governor Eliot Spitzer and the legislature dedicated hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to education in a revised formula which made high-needs children the state\u2019s priority. The City of New York will benefit greatly from this new approach.\u201d (Rep. Catherine Nolan, 2007 Update from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>N.Y.

I conclude only that plaintiffs have alleged ongoing violations of our state Constitution, that it is the responsibility of the courts to adjudicate the merits of that claim, that the courts are capable of fulfilling that responsibility, and that, should plaintiffs\u2019 allegations be proven, the potential for meaningful relief cannot be dismissed. It may well be that the extent to which proven deficiencies in California\u2019s educational system ultimately are corrected will depend on the good faith of legislators and other public officials and the play of political forces. Nonetheless, I would not assume that a judicial edict, entered and upheld after the searching inquiry demanded by our court system, would be for naught. I would therefore reverse the order sustaining demurrers and granting judgment on the pleadings as to the causes of action alleging the ongoing violation of section 5 of article IX of the California Constitution, and remand so that the accuracy of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations can be fully evaluated and appropriate relief thoughtfully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The petition of appellants Campaign for Quality Education and Maya Robles-Wong for review by the Supreme court was denied August 22, 2016,</p>\n<p id=\"AkE\">S234901.</p>\n<judges id=\"Amq\">Chin, J., Liu,.J., and Cu\u00e9llar, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</judges>\n<p id=\"AeV\">The following statements were filed.</p>\n<author id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935a\">*935a</page-number>LIU, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Auq\">The question at the heart of this case is whether California\u2019s K-12 (kindergarten through grade 12) education system has fallen below a minimum level of quality guaranteed by our state Constitution. Plaintiffs include dozens of students of various races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, from first graders to 12th graders, all of whom attend public schools throughout the state. Citing a wide range of studies and indicators, these schoolchildren allege that the state is failing to provide access to a meaningful education that prepares them to meet the state\u2019s academic standards, to achieve economic and social success, and to participate in the political and civic life of their communities. This failure, they contend, violates the education clauses of the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 1 [\u201cA general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.\u201d], 5 [\u201cThe Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The Court of Appeal, in a two-to-one decision, affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaints. <em>(Campaign for Quality Education v. State of California </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 896 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 484] <em>(Campaign for Quality Education).) </em>The panel produced three opinions. The majority, in an opinion by Justice Jenkins, held that \u201csections 1 and 5 of article IX do not provide for an education of \u2018some quality\u2019 that may be judicially enforced by appellants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 906.) Those provisions, the majority explained, \u201cdo not allow the courts to dictate to the Legislature, a coequal branch of government, how to best exercise its constitutional powers to encourage education and provide for and support a system of common schools throughout the state.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 915-916.) Justice Siggins, in a concurring opinion, took the view that \u201cthe academic standards articulated in our Education Code\u201d essentially define \u201cthe constitutional right to a quality education\u201d and that any claims of systemic inadequacy \u201cshould arise under the statutes . . . without resort to the general language of article IX.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 918 (cone. opn. of Siggins, J.).) Justice Poliak dissented, saying that \u201cif [article IX] is to have meaning, it must imply that the system of common schools must provide some minimum qualitative level of education. Such a reading of article IX of the California Constitution is fully consistent with, if not compelled by, the importance that our Supreme Court historically has placed on the role of education and the recognition that it is a fundamental right of all the state\u2019s children.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 922 (dis. opn. of Poliak, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935b\">*935b</page-number>Because this case presents unsettled questions of the utmost importance to our state and its schoolchildren, the petition before us readily meets our criteria for review. We are clearly being asked \u201cto settle an important question of law.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.500(b)(1).) Plaintiffs have made serious allegations of chronic deficiencies in California\u2019s K-12 education system, and they have asserted constitutional claims that only this court can definitively resolve. The issues are ones that divided our colleagues in the Court of Appeal, whose three opinions illuminate the momentous and complex nature of the controversy. That court ultimately held that the constitutional adequacy of the largest function of our state government is not an issue within the judiciary\u2019s purview. A holding of this magnitude, whether correct or not, warrants a full and reasoned examination by the state\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The high courts in more than two-thirds of the states have addressed these issues over the past three decades in cases arising under the education clauses of their state constitutions. A substantial majority of these courts have decided it is their duty to resolve the constitutional issues; the minority that have found the issue nonjusticiable have done so in published opinions. Many courts have articulated standards for educational adequacy, and such standards have led to progress in some states but not others. All of this experience is available to aid our resolution of this case. Yet this court today decides that the issues presented do not merit our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">It is not the judiciary\u2019s job to make educational policy or to run the public schools. Those functions are constitutionally committed to the political branches (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 5, 7), and no system will ever be perfect. But plaintiffs do not complain of mere imperfections. They allege that systemic deficiencies have deprived large numbers of children of the most basic educational opportunities, have disproportionately harmed the least advantaged children, and have persisted not only for years but for decades \u2014 even as \u201cthere can be no doubt that the fundamental right to a public school education is firmly rooted in California law ....\u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 906.) It is regrettable that this court, having recognized education as a fundamental right in a landmark decision 45 years ago <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584 [96 Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241]), should now decline to address the substantive meaning of that right. The schoolchildren of California deserve to know whether their fundamental right to education is a paper promise or a real guarantee. I would grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In order to understand the significance of this case, it is useful to have some historical context. Fifty years ago, California\u2019s public schools were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935c\">*935c</page-number>envy of the nation. As an eminent scholar of California history has written, \u201c[i]n the so-called Golden Age following World War II, the schools of California were considered among the best in the nation, and test scores proved it.\u201d (Starr, California: A History (2005) p. 335.) During that period, \u201c[p]ublic schools were being built by the hour, and dedicated. And public school architecture was at its best. An entire generation of talented young men and women went into public school teaching and administration. There was a sense that a utopia was being formed in the classroom.\u201d (Learning Matters, <em>First to Worst </em>(2004) [video program; Kevin Starr interview].) So confident were the state\u2019s leaders in the educational future of California\u2019s schoolchildren that they devised and executed a \u201cMaster Plan\u201d to build what many regard as the best public university system in the world. (Starr, Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance (2009) pp. 217-244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">\u201cBut by the early 1990s, California had dropped to the lowest rankings in terms of scores and dollars spent on K-12 education. In 1993, for example, fourth-graders in California were vying with fourth-graders in Mississippi for the dubious distinction of being the worst readers in the nation.\u201d (Starr, California: A History, <em>supra, </em>at p. 335.) This decline of California\u2019s K-12 education system, as the student population has become more diverse, is well documented. (See Carroll et al., Rand Corp., California\u2019s K-12 Public Schools: How Are They Doing? (2005).) For two decades now, California has trailed most states on student achievement and education funding. (See <em>Quality Counts, </em>Education Week (1997-2016) &lt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/qc/&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) The allegations in the complaints, which we must accept as true at this stage of the litigation <em>(Schifando v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569]), paint a sobering picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">According to one of the complaints (there are two in this case), \u201c[d]espite having one of the most diverse and challenging student population [sic] in the nation, California per pupil spending in 2008-09 was $2,131 below the national average, ranking the State 44th in the country. California\u2019s per pupil spending was less than each of the largest 10 states in the nation, with New York spending almost $6,000 more per pupil.\u201d The staffing of California\u2019s public schools reflects the state\u2019s low spending levels. In 2007 and 2008, plaintiffs allege, \u201cCalifornia ranked at or near the bottom in the nation in staffing ratios: 49th in total school staff; 47th in principals and assistant principals; 49th in guidance counselors; 50th in librarians; and 49th in access to computers. California educates over 1.7 million students more than Texas, but does so with 16,700 fewer teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The test scores of California students, on average and disaggregated by subgroups, are among the lowest in the nation, as measured by the federally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935d\">*935d</page-number>administered National Assessment of Educational Progress. On the 2009 assessment, one complaint alleges, \u201cCalifornia tied for 47th of fourth grade reading and tied for 46th in eighth grade math. [\u00b6] Academic performance is low for all subgroups of students. Even for students who are not academically disadvantaged, California ranks tied for 43rd in fourth grade reading and tied for 41st in eighth grade math. For California students whose parents graduated from college, the rank is still 40th in fourth grade reading and 39th in eighth grade math. . . . [\u00b6] . . . California\u2019s economically disadvantaged students rank 49th in fourth grade reading and 48th in eighth grade math when compared to economically disadvantaged students in other states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">In addition, plaintiffs allege, large majorities of our African-American, Latino, and low-income students as well as English learners do not achieve proficiency according to the state\u2019s own academic standards: \u201cIn 2008-09, only 50% <em>of </em>California\u2019s students were proficient in English-Language Arts; only 37% of African-American students, 37% of Hispanic students, 36% of economically disadvantaged students, and 20% of English Learners reached this level. Only 46% of California\u2019s students were proficient in Mathematics; this percentage dropped to 30% for African-American students, 36% for Hispanic students, 37% for economically disadvantaged students, and 32% for English Learners. By eleventh grade, students in these groups had fallen even farther \u2014 in English language Arts, only 25% of African-American students, 26% of Hispanic students and economically disadvantaged students, and 5% of English Learners reached proficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Moreover, according to one complaint, California sends a smaller percentage of its high school graduates to four-year colleges and universities than all but three states: \u201cOf those California students who do graduate from high school, many fail to successfully complete the course requirements (known as \u2018A-G requirements\u2019) needed to even <em>apply </em>for admission to California\u2019s four-year public universities. Of 550,000 students who enrolled in California public schools as ninth graders in the fall of 2004, only about one quarter completed the A-G requirements and graduated eligible for a four-year college or university. [Rogers et al., California Educational Opportunity Report (2010) p. 7]. . . . [\u00b6] Among those graduates who do gain admission into California\u2019s university system, many are unprepared to succeed there. Sixty percent of freshmen in the California State University system are not proficient in either Math or English, or both, and beginning in 2012, will be required to take remedial courses in these subjects before they can begin college.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Although the legislative process has produced a variety of education initiatives over the years, none has yet to substantially reverse these indicators. The passage of Proposition 98 in 1988 and Proposition 111 in 1990, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935e\">*935e</page-number>which guarantee K-12 education a minimum share of the state\u2019s General Fund, was arguably the last time the policymaking process sought to establish a constitutional minimum for the state\u2019s commitment to public schools. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8.) In 1992, the Legislature passed the Charter Schools Act of 1992, which launched the growth of charter schools in California. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 47600 et seq.) In 1996, the Legislature enacted the Class Size Reduction Program, which seeks to limit class sizes to 20 students per certificated teacher. (Ed. Code, former \u00a7 52120 et seq.) In 1999, the Legislature passed the Public Schools Accountability Act of 1999, which set the stage for California\u2019s compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Pub.L. No. 107-110 (Jan. 8, 2002) 115 Stat. 1425) by introducing a comprehensive system of assessments and accountability mechanisms to track and facilitate student progress toward statewide academic standards. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52050 et seq.) Also in 1999, the Legislature created the California High School Exit Examination (Stats. 1999, 1st Ex. Sess. 1999-2000, ch. 1, \u00a7 5, p. 8075), but in 2015, the Legislature suspended it, and it is no longer a condition of receiving a diploma (Stats. 2015, ch. 572, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">More recently, the voters in 2012 passed Proposition 30, which imposed temporary tax increases to support K-12 education and community colleges. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 36, subd. (e).) And in 2013, the Legislature restructured the school finance system by creating the Local Control Funding Formula, which is designed to improve the ability of school districts to flexibly use state education dollars to address the most pressing areas of need. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 42238.02.) Each district now receives a base funding allocation per student, plus supplemental funding depending on the district\u2019s population of English learners and low-income students as well as the concentration of those students in the district. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">As these efforts suggest, educational policymaking in California has not been a tale of intransigence. At the state and local levels, many educational leaders have labored mightily to provide all children with access to a decent education, and we should not ignore their successes. (See Cal. Dept, of Education, Success Stories &lt;http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/re/ss/&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) However, as the complaints allege, the past two decades have not produced a tale of overall efficacy either. It is of course unrealistic to expect a major turnaround of any large school system to occur overnight; such \u201cmiracles\u201d are properly met with skepticism. But some states have made significant gains in education over the past 20 years (see Hanushek et al., Achievement Growth: International and U.S. State Trends in Student Performance (2012) pp. 5-16), even as student achievement in California, despite some progress, has remained generally low.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">It is against this backdrop that plaintiffs have turned to the courts for an elaboration of the Legislature\u2019s duty to provide for a system of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935f\">*935f</page-number>schools. The schoolchildren who brought these actions do not claim they are entitled to a world-class education. They ask only whether the California Constitution protects them from being deprived of a minimally adequate education. They are asking the judiciary, as the ultimate guarantor of constitutional rights, to define and safeguard their fundamental right to education.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Despite recognizing that education is a fundamental right under the California Constitution, the Court of Appeal found \u201cno explicit textual basis [in section 1 or section 5 of article IXof the California Constitution] from which a constitutional right to a public school education of a particular quality may be discerned.\u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 909.) The court said that section 1 is \u201c \u2018general and aspirational\u2019 \u201d and that section 5 does not \u201c \u2018delineate or identify any specific outcome standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, </em>at pp. 908-909.) The court also refused to read sections 1 and 5 together to find a right to an education of some quality. <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, </em>at p. 909.) Further, the Court of Appeal invoked separation of powers principles in finding the controversy nonjusticiable, concluding that \u201c \u2018[t]he quandary described in the complaint[s] is lamentable, but the remedy lies squarely with the Legislature, not the judiciary.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">As Justice Poliak argued in dissent, there is significant reason to question the Court of Appeal\u2019s holdings that California Constitution article IX\u2019s education clauses do not imply any minimum standard of quality and do not impose any duties on the Legislature that are judicially discernible or enforceable. These holdings reflect the minority view among the more than 30 state high court opinions addressing similar issues under their state constitutions. (See <em>Campaign for Quality Education, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 920 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.) [\u201cThe different outcomes [among state high courts] result less from differences in the wording of the respective constitutions than from different perceptions of the role properly played by the courts in overseeing compliance with the state\u2019s basic charter.\u201d].) A significant number of these courts have recognized a judicially enforceable right to an adequate education. The adequacy standards articulated by the high courts of Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming are reviewed in Justice Poliak\u2019s dissent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 925-929 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.), citing <em>Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v.

These decisions \u201cdemonstrate that courts are capable of articulating such a standard, albeit a standard that is general and requires intensive factual analysis to apply.\u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, </em>at p. 925 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Justice Poliak concluded \u201cthat the provisions of our state Constitution requiring the state to support a system of common schools is not without substance, and that the Constitution requires a system that provides students with a meaningful basic education in reality as well as on paper. ... [A] standard such as those articulated in the opinions quoted above, though general, permits meaningful evaluation of a school system by educational professionals and experts.\u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 929 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).) Judicial formulation of broad and general standards \u201creflects not only the \u2018recognition of the political branches\u2019 constitutional responsibilities, and indeed, greater expertise, with respect to the implementation of specific educational policies\u2019 and that \u2018the specific educational inputs or instrumentalities suitable to achieve this minimum level of education may well change over time,\u2019 but that \u2018like any other principle of constitutional law, this broad standard likely will be refined and developed further as it is applied to the facts eventually to be found at trial in this case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 929-930 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Apart from its concerns about formulating an adequacy standard, the Court of Appeal worried that adjudication of plaintiffs\u2019 claims would potentially put the judiciary on a collision course with the Legislature in violation of the separation of powers. Two points from Justice Poliak\u2019s dissent are pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">First, \u201c[t]o a large extent,\u201d this worry \u201crest[s] on the premise that plaintiffs are seeking to compel the California Legislature to appropriate additional funds for K-12 education, which is beyond the constitutional province of the judiciary.\u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 931 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).) However, \u201c[pjlaintiffs do not allege simply that the amount of funds appropriated to the schools is insufficient, but that the system by which funds are allocated among schools and school districts is significantly responsible for the inadequacies in the educational system.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935h\">*935h</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, \u201c[plaintiffs allege that the present system incorporates inadequate teacher training, and some plaintiffs also attribute deficiencies to the methods of teacher evaluation, promotion and discipline.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 932 (dis. opn. of Poliak, J.).) At this point, it is far from clear that any remedy for a proven violation would require the courts to order increased spending on education. \u201c[A]s the experience in other states confirms, various forms of relief are available short of ordering the legislature to appropriate funds. Courts have required plans to be developed to address and correct adjudicated deficiencies. The intensive examination of the system that trial of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations would necessarily entail may be expected to yield other specific forms of relief.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 932-933 (dis. opn. of Poliak, J.).) Indeed, it may be that reforms designed to make more efficient use of existing funds would provide an important measure of relief if plaintiffs were to prove a violation. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 918-919 (conc. opn. of Siggins, J.) [\u201cthe balance between more resources and operational and organizational change in the schools may need to be differently struck\u201d]; <em>Vergara v. State of California </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 619, 640-641 [202 Cal.Rptr.3d 262] [trial court found that hiring and retention of grossly ineffective teachers severely hamper students\u2019 educational progress].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Second, and more fundamentally, whatever limitations on judicial authority may constrain a court\u2019s ability to order remedies for proven violations, \u201c[w]e need not presume that the Legislature will fail to respond appropriately if the court should ultimately determine that the Constitution is being violated by the lack of sufficient funding.\u201d <em>(Campaign for Quality Education, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 932 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).) Although courts in some states have clashed with their legislatures over educational adequacy remedies (e.g., Kansas and Washington), there are also examples of such litigation resulting in interbranch collaboration and important reform (e.g., Kentucky and Massachusetts). Like Justice Poliak, \u201cI would not presume to predict the long-term consequences of permitting plaintiffs\u2019 disturbing allegations to be examined at trial and the appropriateness of any remedy for confirmed inadequacies evaluated on appeal. ... It may well be that the extent to which proven deficiencies in California\u2019s educational system ultimately are corrected will depend on the good faith of legislators and other public officials and the play of political forces. Nonetheless, I would not assume that a judicial edict, entered and upheld after the searching inquiry demanded by our court system, would be for naught.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 935 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">This last point bears emphasis. The potential for conflict between courts and the political branches is inherent in the power of judicial review. Even so, \u201c[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d <em>(Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison </em>(1803) 5 U.S. 137, 177 [2 L. Ed. 60]; <em>see Marin Water etc. Co. v. Railroad Com. </em>(1916) 171 Cal. 706, 711-712 [154 P. 864] [\u201cThe judicial function is to \u2018declare the law and define the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935i\">*935i</page-number>the parties under it.\u2019 ].) I do not underestimate the uncertainties that might attend a judicial declaration of the law in this context. But it has always been the case that \u201c[t]he judiciary . . . has no influence over either the sword or the purse .... It may truly be said to have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\u201d (The Federalist No. 78 (Cooke ed., 1961) p. 523 (Hamilton).) We ought to proceed in this case, as we do in all constitutional cases, with a strong presumption that public officials \u2014 having taken the same oath we have taken to \u201c \u2018support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California\u2019 \u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 3) \u2014 will work in good faith to effectuate any judgment duly entered by the courts. This understanding is not only a matter of the respect we owe the coordinate branches of government, but also an essential underpinning of the rule of law as practiced in our constitutional tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Asi\">The challenges facing California\u2019s K-12 education system remain within the purview of the Governor, the Legislature, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and other state and local officials. This court\u2019s passivity in the face of plaintiffs\u2019 claims should not be understood as an implied judgment that those claims are unmeritorious or unfit for judicial resolution. Our denial of review suspends, for now, the prospect of judicial elaboration of what the fundamental right to education entails. But it is possible that the complexion of the issue and, in turn, this court\u2019s posture may change if our education system further stagnates or worsens.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">At the same time, my vote to grant review should not be construed as a judgment that plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation. Apart from the unsettled questions of justiciability and interpretation of article IX of the California Constitution, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations have not been tested at trial, and it appears that some of the conditions alleged in the complaints have changed. Since 2010, the year plaintiffs filed their complaints, state funding of K-12 education has risen significantly. Proposition 98 funding per pupil is projected to exceed $10,000 in 2015 and 2016, a 28 percent real increase since 2010 and 2011. (Legis. Analyst, The 2016-17 Budget, EdBudget Tables, K-12 Education, K-12 Proposition 98 Funding Per Pupil &lt;http://lao.ca.gOv/7Publications/7Report/3326#8&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) The current budget returns our K-12 system to the funding level that existed in 2007 and 2008, before the economic downturn. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Whether education funding will continue its current upward trajectory remains to be seen. (See Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 36, subd. (f) [Prop. 30\u2019s tax increases to fund education will expire in 2016 (sales tax) and 2018 (personal income tax)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935j\">*935j</page-number>As a result of the Local Control Funding Formula, enacted in 2013, a significant portion of education dollars are now allocated to districts according to their numbers of low-income students and English learners as well as the concentration of those students in the district. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 42238.02.) The formula replaced what many believed to be an outdated and arbitrary funding scheme with a more rational and equitable distribution. School districts now have more discretion in spending their funds, and each district is responsible for adopting a three-year local control and accountability plan. (Id., \u00a7 52060 et seq.) This devolution of control and accountability marks a pronounced shift from the decades of centralized education governance catalyzed by Proposition 13 and reinforced by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Time will tell whether these reforms prove effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Meanwhile, student achievement remains low. On the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress, California ranked 48th in fourth-grade math, 49th in fourth-grade reading, 41st in eighth-grade math, and 44th in eighth-grade reading. (U.S. Dept. Education, Nat. Center for Education Statistics, NAEP State Comparisons &lt;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/ statecomparisons/&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) These low rankings persist when test scores are disaggregated by subgroups. In fourth-grade reading, for example, California students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch ranked 48th compared to their counterparts in other states; students who were not eligible ranked 40th. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Although the initiatives above are significant, none of them directly addresses the fundamental question of adequacy at the heart of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. Proposition 98 funding is designed to increase with growth in the economy and K-12 attendance, but the funding level is not based on what resources are needed to provide a minimally adequate education to all students. The Local Control Funding Formula aims to distribute funds more equitably according to student needs, but it does not purport to prescribe adequate funding levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In order to identify a concerted effort to examine the adequacy of California\u2019s K-12 education system, one has to go back a full decade. In 2005, a bipartisan group of state leaders \u2014 the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Governor\u2019s Committee on Education Excellence, and the Secretary of Education \u2014 commissioned a comprehensive review of California\u2019s school finance and governance systems. Funded by four major foundations, this initiative enlisted dozens of scholars throughout California and the nation, and resulted in over 20 research papers not only on resource adequacy and equity, but also on state and local governance, teacher policies, and data and information systems. (Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis, Getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935k\">*935k</page-number>Down to Facts &lt;https://cepa.stanford.edu/77gdtf/overview&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) This unprecedented body of research was completed in 2007, but its potential impact in the policymaking arena was largely eclipsed by a severe recession. Now that economic conditions have improved, there have been calls to renew the wide-ranging inquiry that began a decade ago. (Cal. School Boards Assn., California\u2019s Challenge: Adequately Funding Education in the 21st Century (2015).)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Today this court declines to decide whether our state Constitution lends urgency or guidance to such inquiry. This is unfortunate given what is at stake. In <em>Serrano v. Priest, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 584, we described \u201cthe indispensable role which education plays in the modern industrial state. . . . [F]irst, education is a major determinant of an individual\u2019s chances for economic and social success in our competitive society; second, education is a unique influence on a child\u2019s development as a citizen and his participation in political and community life. . . . Thus, education is the lifeline of both the individual and society.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 605.) We quoted <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 483, 493 [98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S.Ct. 686]: \u201c \u2018Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. ... It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Serrano v. Priest, </em>at p. 606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">We should not leave the schoolchildren of California to wonder whether their fundamental right to education under our state Constitution has real content or is simply hortatory. The policymaking process may eventually address plaintiffs\u2019 claims, or it may not. Plaintiffs urge this court to clarify the state\u2019s obligation. They seek an education system that is truly capable of fulfilling its vital role for all children of the Golden State. These issues, however we might resolve them, deserve this court\u2019s full consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">I respectfully dissent from the denial of review.</p>\n<author id=\"b882-7\">CU\u00c9LLAR, J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">Time and again we have emphasized how fundamental the right to education is for California. (See <em>Butt v. State of California </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 668, 686 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 480, 842 P.2d 1240] [\u201ceducation is ... a fundamental interest for purposes of equal protection analysis under the California Constitution\u201d]; <em>Serrano v. Priest </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 608-609 [96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935l\">*935l</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 601, 487 P.2d 1241] [\u201cthe distinctive and priceless function of education in our society warrants, indeed compels, our treating it as a \u2018fundamental interest\u2019 \u201d].) And rightly so: Meaningful access to public education is foundational not only to economic opportunity for millions of students, but to our shared civic life. But what good are such judicial exhortations if that right has no meaningful content?</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Arguing that such content must exist to render meaningful the fundamental right to education, plaintiffs allege that the California public schools fail to provide large numbers of students with a level of minimally acceptable education in violation of article IX of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, California does too little to define a minimally adequate education for its students. It ranks at or near the bottom relative to other states in terms of educational outcomes and staffing ratios. It provides inadequate teacher training, and fails to provide the resources students need to succeed. As a result of these deficiencies, plaintiffs allege, California students are directly harmed: nearly two-thirds of low-income and minority students fail to meet the state\u2019s own standard of proficiency in mathematics or language arts; and fewer than 60 percent of African-American and Latino students even graduate from high school. (See <em>Campaign for Quality Education v. State of California </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 896, 924-925 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 484] (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Whether plaintiffs could have proven as much at trial \u2014 this case having been squelched at the pleading stage \u2014 remains unanswered. So do the important questions of state constitutional law presented by this case that our court is best suited to resolve. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.500(b)(1).) Indeed, the question whether our state Constitution demands <em>some </em>minimum level of educational quality, as opposed to resolving precisely how schools should be administered, lies at the core of what this institution is empowered to adjudicate. And because plaintiffs\u2019 claims here concern a range of state activities affecting education, the key question in this case implicates more than simply an exercise in defining the appropriate level of funding or of any other single input to support an adequate education.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We consider that question against the backdrop of separation of powers principles that are vital to our government. Yet never have these principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935m\">*935m</page-number>meant that we should strain to avoid our responsibility to interpret the state Constitution simply because the right at issue touches on concerns the Legislature might ultimately address, or because the task of resolving a case implicating the right to education demands careful attention to the proper role of courts as well as our sister branches. We routinely treat as justiciable those challenges based on other fundamental rights, such as the right to marry, vote, or engage in free speech. (See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage Cases </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 757, 809 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 183 P.3d 384] [right to marry]; <em>Fashion Valley Mall, LLC </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 850, 865 [69 Cal.Rptr.3d 288, 172 P.3d 742] [right to free speech]; <em>Gould v. Grubb </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 661, 670 [122 Cal.Rptr. 377, 536 P.2d 1337] [right to vote].) The right to education is no less fundamental, nor is it any less worthy of protection. Courts of other states, when faced with similar challenges based on this right, overwhelmingly agree. (See, e.g., <em>Gannon </em>v. <em>State </em>(2014) 298 Kan. 1107 [319 P.3d 1196, 1226] [\u201cMost state supreme courts have rejected the nonjusticiability argument . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">It is especially important for California\u2019s highest court to speak on this issue. Our state educates one-eighth of all public school students in the country. (See Nat. Education Assn., Rankings &amp; Estimates: Rankings of the States 2015 and Estimates of School Statistics 2016 (May 2016) p. 11.) Many of those kids who come from low-income families find themselves concentrated in particular schools or districts that, despite the best intentions, fail to deliver an education remotely worthy of the students they are serving. These realities make it all the more critical that the representative branches play the crucial role that belongs to them, but with greater clarity about the scope of the right to education \u2014 clarity only this court can provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Respectfully, I would grant review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-5\"> E.g., <em>Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, Inc. v.
