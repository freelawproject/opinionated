Citizens Casualty Co. of N.Y., 431 F.2d 409, Part I (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1082-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">This direct criminal appeal arises from a conviction for possessing a 16-gauge sawed-off shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5861. Appellant contends that the court erred in concluding that the United States carried its burden of demonstrating that his in-custody inculpatory statement was voluntary and was obtained in compliance with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent opinion on this subject, Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 92 S.Ct. 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972) such a decision is to be resolved on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence rather than under the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In announcing its resolution of this issue, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD-q\">I am going to deny the motion to suppress. We have a direct conflict between these two individuals as to whether the statement was voluntarily, knowingly and understanding^ made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-7\">However, there is evidence in the record from a witness who testified that he saw Mr. Britt with one of these guns which is named as Government\u2019s Exhibit No. 2, which is the 12 gauge sawed off shotgun described in count one. I am going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-8\">Call the Jury back in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">The second paragraph of the court\u2019s announcement makes it explicit that a forbidden consideration \u2014 truth\u2014entered</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">the Judge\u2019s decision. See Lego v. Twomey, <em>supra, </em>n. 12, 404 U.S. at 484, 92 S.Ct. at 624. Therefore, at a minimum, a new hearing on voluntariness must be conducted at which consideration is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">On the present appeal, appellant further contends that he was entitled to an attorney\u2019s advice on whether he should have waived his <em>Miranda </em>defined rights. Acceptance of this contention would effectively negate the waiver procedures which underpin the Supreme Court\u2019s codification of these police conduct rules, and we reject this contention outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">The case is remanded to the district court with directions to reassess the issue of voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statement without any regard to whether the content of the statement was reliable or authentic. Such reassessment may be based on the transcript of the prior hearing or may be supplemented by new evidence, in the discretion of the district judge. If, .after such reassessment the court concludes that the statement was voluntary, appellant\u2019s conviction shall stand affirmed. If the court concludes that the statement was involuntary, it shall grant appellant a new trial at which such confession and its fruits shall be excluded. <em>See </em>United States v. Hamlet, 456 F.2d 1284 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-14\">Remanded, with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
