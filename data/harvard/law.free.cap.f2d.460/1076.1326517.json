Appellant asserts that appellee\u2019s mark so resembles CHERRY JULEP, used and registered <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by appellant prior to appellee\u2019s asserted first use, and CHERRY JUBILEE, allegedly used by appellant\u2019s predecessor since a date prior to appellant\u2019s asserted date of first use, both used for wine, as to be likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceptively cause purchasers to believe that appellee\u2019s wines have their origin with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-11\">Appellant introduced evidence including testimony of its president, Jack Poust, and documentary exhibits. Appellee took no testimony and thus is restricted to its filing date for first use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-18\">Appellant\u2019s claim to rights in the mark CHERRY JUBILEE is based on activities beginning one year before Poust testified in December of 1967. Poust testified that he was advised through the Customs Bureau at that time that a shipment of CHERRY JUBILEE wine was coming into the country. He stated that he then contacted a representative of Tower Eximpo, Inc., the importer, whom he advised that he considered CHERRY JUBILEE an infringement of the mark CHERRY JULEP. Poust further stated that appellant then bought the imported CHERRY JUBILEE stock and sold it and that Tower Eximpo, Inc. \u201ctransferred the rights of the label, the brand name\u201d to appellant. The sale of the label was said to have occurred some time in May 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-19\">Appellant offered certain documentary material procured from Tower Eximpo with the explanation that it was all that was available because that company was small and had destroyed its records. The material consisted of a photocopy of an Internal Revenue Service certificate of approval of a CHERRY JUBILEE label issued February 8, 1960 to Tower Eximpo, Inc.; a copy of a schedule of minimum consumer resale prices on CHERRY JUBILEE wine dated March 31, 1960; and two Tower Eximpo invoices, dated January 2, 1963 and March 1, 1963, referring to two shipments of CHERRY JUBILEE wine by that company to a consignee in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-20\">The board ruled that the testimony of Poust regarding use of CHERRY JUBILEE by Tower Eximpo, the certificate of label approval and the schedule of minimum resale prices were not probative of any sales prior to 1967. The board stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1135-21\">[A]s to the invoices, opposer\u2019s president obviously could not testify as to the circumstances surrounding the events covered thereby and the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>voices could only suggest that two sales of \u201cCHERRY JUBILEE\u201d wine occurred both in 1963. There is no evidence of any probative value to establish any sales from 1963 until May 1967 when opposer allegedly succeeded to Tower Eximpo, Inc.\u2019s interest, in the mark. In summation, opposer\u2019s record as to use of the mark \u201cCHERRY JUBILEE\u201d is at best sufficient to show that opposer acquired the rights to the mark \u201cCHERRY JUBILEE\u201d in May 1967 along with an \u201cinventory\u201d of wine, apparently the shipment detained by the Customs Department, and that it promptly disposed of this inventory in minimal shipments after applicant filed its application to register the mark in question. Hence, op-poser has failed to sustain its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of prior rights in the unregistered mark \u201cCHERRY JUBILEE\u201d and must, therefore, in support of its claim of damage herein, rely solely on the mark \u201cCHERRY JULEP\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">We are in full agreement with the board that appellant\u2019s meager evidence is not adequate to establish rights in CHERRY JUBILEE extending to any date prior to its own sales in 1967. We note that Poust admitted that his knowledge of sales by Tower Eximpo, Inc. was limited to the two 1963 invoices. With regard to appellant\u2019s own sales, it has not been established that any of them took place prior to appellee\u2019s application date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">With regard to appellant\u2019s reliance on its prior use and registration of CHERRY JULEP, the board noted appellee\u2019s contention that the mark is weak, with CHERRY indicating the flavor of the product and with JULEP having a meaning of \u201ca sweet drink variously prepared, and sometimes medicated.\u201d It also defined JUBILEE as \u201cthe celebration of any of certain anniversaries\u201d and \u201cany reason or occasion of rejoicing or festivity.\u201d It then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-6\">We acknowledge that the marks \u201cCHERRY JULEP\u201d and \u201cCHERRY JUBILEE\u201d are alike in that each are two-word marks having in common the first word \u201cCHERRY\u201d and the initial two letters \u201cJU\u201d of the second word. We also recognize that the marks are composed of words possessing well-known dictionary definitions; that the common word \u201cCHERRY\u201d possesses little, if any, trademark significance as applied to cherry flavored wines; and that the words \u201cJULEP\u201d and \u201cJUBILEE\u201d are distinctly different in meaning, significance, and sound. In view of these factors and considering that the marks must be considered in their entireties in resolving the issue before us, it is our opinion that \u201cCHERRY JUBILEE\u201d creates a commercial impression distinctly different from \u201cCHERRY JULEP\u201d and does not, in any way, suggest opposer\u2019s registered mark. See: In re General Electric Company [49 CCPA 1186, 304 F.2d [688] 691,] 134 USPQ 190 (CCPA, 1962); and Dan River Mills [Inc.] v. The Yorke Shirt Corporation [55 CCPA 867, 390 F.2d 734,] 156 USPQ 401 (CCPA, 1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">Appellant cites a number of decisions where likelihood of confusion was found in what it apparently considers circumstances similar to those here, but none of them are particularly pertinent here. An example is Standard International Corp. v. American Sponge &amp; Chamois Co., 55 CCPA 1155, 394 F.2d 599, 157 USPQ 630 (1968) wherein a prior registration of DUST \u2019N GLOW for a cleaning and polishing cloth was held to preclude registration of DUST \u2019N WAX for furniture polish. An important consideration in that case was that the common part of the marks, DUST \u2019N, was found to possess a certain distinctiveness. The facts there contrast markedly with the present case where CHERRY is the name of the flavor and the second words are distinctly different in the three respects pointed out by the board. Accordingly, we are satisfied that CHERRY JUBILEE does not so resemble CHERRY JULEP as to be likely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>where applied to wine, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"ADi\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1135-12\">.
