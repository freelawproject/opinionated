JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">Petitioner Woods appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his serial federal habeas corpus petition on the ground that it was an abuse of the writ. <em>See </em>Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 cases. Guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>McCleskey v. Zant, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">This is Woods\u2019s third application for a federal writ of habeas corpus. His first application, filed in September 1980, was treated as a \u201cmixed\u201d habeas and \u00a7 1983 petition and was dismissed without prejudice to allow Woods to exhaust his claim in state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From the Louisiana courts, he then successfully obtained a reduction from a life sentence to twenty years imprisonment on his convictions for drug and firearms offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">In November 1986, Woods filed a new federal habeas petition, following a second state petition, which asserted that Louisiana law shifted the burden of an element of the charged offense to the accused and that his twenty-year sentence was excessive. This court affirmed a dismissal on the merits. <em>Woods v. Butler, </em>847 F.2d 1163 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 970, 109 S.Ct. 502, 102 L.Ed.2d 538 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">The third federal habeas petition tracked a third state petition in alleging that Woods received ineffective assistance of counsel at his original trial, because counsel did not win the motion to suppress on grounds that Woods\u2019s arrest, search and seizure were accomplished without probable cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court sent Woods the model form inquiring why his petition should not be barred as successive under Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 cases. In response, Woods claimed that he was unaware of the facts and legal theories of his present claims prior to filing. The district court dismissed Woods\u2019s third petition with prejudice, holding that it was barred under Rule 9(b) and alternatively, that his claims were meritless. Woods appeals following the grant of a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In <em>McCleskey v. Zant, supra, </em>the Supreme Court recently held that \u201cthe same standard used to determine whether to excuse state procedural defaults should govern the determination of inexcusable neglect in the abuse of the writ context.\u201d Ill S.Ct. at 1468. This means that a petitioner\u2019s serial habeas petition must be dismissed as an abuse of the writ unless he demonstrates that there was \u201ccause\u201d not to have raised the point in a previous federal habeas petition, and \u201cprejudice\u201d if the court fails to consider the new point. <em>See Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). The Court explained this standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">In procedural default cases, the cause standard requires the petitioner to show that \u201csome objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts\u201d to raise the claim in state court. <em>Murray v. Carrier, 477 </em>U.S. [478] at 488 [106 S.Ct. 2639, 2645, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986) ]. Objective factors that constitute cause include \u201c \u2018interference by officials\u2019 \u201d that makes compliance with the state procedural rule impracticable, and \u201ca showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, constitutionally \u201cineffective assistance of counsel ... is cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Attorney error short of ineffective assistance of counsel, however, does not constitute cause and will not excuse a procedural default. <em>Id. </em>at 486-488 [106 S.Ct. at 2644-2646]. Once the petitioner has established cause, he must show \u201c \u2018actual prejudice\u2019 resulting from the errors of which he complains.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 168 [102 S.Ct. 1584, 1594, 71 L.Ed.2d 816] (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH2\">Ill S.Ct. at 1470.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The court also held in <em>McCleskey </em>that if an abuse of writ defense is clearly raised by the state<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, the petitioner must then disprove abuse by showing cause and prejudice. No evidentiary hearing is required if the district court determines as a matter of law that the petitioner cannot satisfy this standard. Even if the petitioner cannot show cause for not raising the claim in an earlier petition, this error may nonetheless be excused if he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the serial petition. Because a \u201cfundamental miscarriage\u201d implies that a constitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of an innocent person, however, this is a very narrow exception. Ill S.Ct. at 1470-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Although this case was decided by the district court prior to the issuance of <em>McCleskey, </em>the procedure the court followed and the result it reached comport with that case. Woods\u2019s appellate brief does not add to his explanation of \u201ccause\u201d for not raising ineffective assistance of counsel in an earlier petition. Rather, he simply cites Supreme Court caselaw that has now been authoritatively supplemented by <em>McCleskey.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The only \u201ccause\u201d Woods has alleged is his previous ignorance of the facts and legal theories underlying the ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Woods\u2019s ignorance does not constitute \u201ccause\u201d as that term was used in <em>McCles-key. </em>No external force, such as government interference or lack of available facts, prevented Woods from learning about any alleged ineffectiveness of his counsel at the suppression hearing. <em>McCleskey, </em>111 S.Ct. at 1470-71. He obviously knew that his trial counsel did not persuade the Louisiana courts to grant his motion to suppress. Moreover, the fourth amendment legal theory on which Woods relies as a basis for counsel\u2019s incompetence is precisely the theory addressed and rejected by the Supreme Court of Louisiana on Woods\u2019s direct appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even if Woods did not specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>know how to evaluate counsel\u2019s performance on the suppression motion before he filed his third federal habeas petition, it is clear that he should have known the basis for such a claim. <em>McCleskey, </em>in examining \u201ccause\u201d for a petitioner\u2019s delay in raising a habeas claim, held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">The requirement of cause in the abuse of the writ context is based on the principle that <em>petitioner must conduct a reasonable and diligent investigation aimed at including all relevant claims and grounds for relief in the first federal habeas petition. </em>If what petitioner knows or could discover upon reasonable investigation supports a claim for relief in a federal habeas petition, what he does not know is irrelevant. Omission of the claim will not be excused merely because evidence discovered later might also have supported or strengthened the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Ill S.Ct. at 1472 (emphasis added). The question is no longer whether a petitioner <em>had </em>actual knowledge of the facts or legal theories supporting a habeas claim that he failed to raise on the first federal go-round; it is whether, by reasonably diligent investigation, he <em>should have had </em>that knowledge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Woods knew or should have known, as early as the date of affirmance of his conviction, of the circumstances that he now describes as incompetence of counsel, he cannot establish \u201ccause\u201d under <em>McCleskey </em>for failure to raise that claim in his prior petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Not only is Woods unable to demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d as a matter of law for failing earlier to question counsel\u2019s competence, but he has in any event never suggested that failure to grant this third petition would cause a fundamental miscarriage of justice \u2014 he has never asserted his innocence. In this regard, we are hard put to see how the erroneous receipt into evidence of evidence illegally seized could ever result in prejudice sufficient to justify its omission from an earlier writ. <em>See Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 2591, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring). Justice Powell there observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">We have held repeatedly that such evidence [illegally seized] ordinarily is excluded only for deterrence reasons that have no relation to the fairness of defendant\u2019s trial ... it has long been clear that exclusion of illegally seized but wholly reliable evidence renders verdicts less fair and just, because it \u201cdeflects the truthfinding process and often frees the guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\"><em>Id. </em>106 S.Ct. at 2594.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">In accordance with <em>McCleskey, </em>we must conclude that Woods abused the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>habeas corpus in filing his third application, and the court correctly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-15\">. Because the federal district court dismissed Woods\u2019 first habeas petition without prejudice, we disregard it for purposes of abuse of the writ analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-16\">. The third federal petition also alleged a fourth amendment claim challenging Woods\u2019s arrest and the subsequent search and seizure of items, but, on appeal, he has abandoned that issue and we need not address it. <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1039, 107 S.Ct. 897, 93 L.Ed.2d 848 (1987). We would have been precluded from reviewing it. in any event under <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">.There is no reason to infer that <em>McCleskey </em>changed our previous rule that abuse of the writ may be pleaded by the state or raised by the district court <em>sua sponte. Schouest v. Smith, </em>914 F.2d 713, 715 (5th Cir.1990), <em>modified </em>by <em>Schouest v. Whitley, </em>927 F.2d 205 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Daniels v. Blackburn, </em>763 F.2d 705, 707 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">. Woods did not have a lawyer for the prior federal habeas proceedings; consequently, he cannot assert incompetence of that counsel as \u201ccause.\u201d <em>See McCleskey, </em>111 S.Ct. at 1470.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\">. Woods contends that trial counsel was incompetent for failing to persuade the courts that police officers did not independently verify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>reliable informant\u2019s tip that correctly predicted the time and location of Woods's involvement in a transfer of illegal drugs and correctly warned that Woods might be armed. The Louisiana Supreme Court, confronted with this argument, held that the tip was sufficiently corroborated to authorize the officers to stop Woods, pat him down for weapons, then arrest him for carrying a concealed firearm, and finally search him incident to arrest. <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">. In some prior cases, when considering abuse of the writ, we have drawn a distinction between pro se petitioners and those represented by counsel. Pro se petitioners have been held guilty of abuse only if they had \"actual knowledge\u201d of the facts and theories of the new claims when they filed earlier petitions. <em>See, e.g., Schouest v. Whitley, </em>927 F.2d 205 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Matthews v. Butler, </em>833 F.2d 1165, 1170-71 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Passman v. Blackburn, </em>797 F.2d 1335, 1344 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 948, 107 S.Ct. 1609, 94 L.Ed.2d 794 (1987). Petitioners represented by counsel were bound to the \"awareness that a competent lawyer would have possessed.\u201d <em>Jones v. Estelle, </em>722 F.2d 159, 169 (5th Cir.1983) (era <em>banc), cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 976, 104 S.Ct. 2356, 80 L.Ed.2d 829 (1984); <em>Daniels v. Blackburn, </em>763 F.2d 705, 707 (5th Cir. 1985). <em>McCleskey </em>draws no similar distinction for purposes of deciding whether a petitioner had \"cause\u201d not to raise a particular claim in a prior federal habeas proceeding. Indeed, the Supreme Court stated that its adaptation of a \"cause and prejudice\u201d test for writ abuse does not imply that there is a constitutional right to legal counsel on collateral attack of a conviction. <em>McCleskey, </em>111 S.Ct. at 1471 (citing <em>Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 1993, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987)). It may be, although we need not reach the point, that our cases requiring a pro se petitioner\u2019s \"actual knowledge\" of potential claims before abuse of the writ may be found are inconsistent with <em>McCleskey.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
