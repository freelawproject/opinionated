For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, Irma Dorsey, filed suit in the 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson against Jon Purvis, individually, Purvis Contracting Group, LLC (hereinafter collectively \"Purvis\"), its insurer, Scottsdale Insurance Company, and various subcontractors, for damages arising out of work performed during the renovation of plaintiff's home following Hurricane Katrina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her petition, plaintiff alleged that her home sustained significant damages during Hurricane Katrina and that, on October 26, 2007, she contracted with Purvis to perform a complete rehabilitation and renovation of her home for the total sum of $78,643.88. Plaintiff further alleged that, after repairs began, Purvis sought an additional $35,000.00 over the contract price for the work performed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In her petition, plaintiff claimed that some of the work included in the contract was not performed as required under the contract and other work was not performed in a workmanlike manner. Specifically, plaintiff claimed that the HVAC system in her home was not repaired properly; the wooden frame of her garage doors was not replaced; her front doors were not varnished or refinished; the plumbing lines repaired have burst or\n   leaked; the exterior walls were not sufficiently insulated; one concrete stair is missing from the patio area; and the toilet and vent in her bathroom, the doorbell, and the garbage disposal have never functioned properly. Plaintiff additionally alleged in her petition that Purvis misrepresented that he was a licensed general contractor rather than a licensed home improvement contractor, which is distinguishable based upon the total repair contract price permitted. Plaintiff subsequently alleged that her home was tested at elevated levels of mold, which she claims has affected her health and caused mental distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 3, 2017, Scottsdale filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that plaintiff's claims are excluded under the terms of the general commercial liability insurance policies issued to Purvis. Specifically, Scottsdale claimed that it issued four policies to Purvis that exclude coverage for (1) plaintiff's claims for damage to Purvis' work product or the cost to remediate Purvis' work product; (2) the cost of reimbursement for incomplete work; (3) the cost to repair faulty work when the faulty work does not cause damage to other property; (4) plaintiff's claims of mental anguish, inconvenience, or loss of income; (5) any damages caused by fraud or unfair trade practices; and (6) plaintiff's alleged damages resulting from mold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, Scottsdale asserted that it issued four policies to Purvis (policy numbers CLS1291796 (the 2006 policy), CLS1401402 (the 2007 policy), CLS1511135 (the 2008 policy), and CPS1048078 (the 2009 policy) ). Scottsdale attached an authenticated copy of each policy to its motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed an opposition to Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment. In her opposition, plaintiff acknowledged that the \"only policy in question for this matter is Policy # CLS1401302, which covered Purvis from July 25, 2007 to July 25, 2008,\" the time period during which Purvis performed work on her home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In her opposition, plaintiff claimed that she suffered the following damages: (1) an advertising injury arising out of Purvis' advertisement as a Louisiana state licensed general contractor and not a home improvement contractor; (2) personal injury, including mold exposure, mental anguish, and distress; (3) property damage to her home involving her plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems, as well as the installation of an insufficient amount of insulation in her home and (4) the loss of use of her home during subsequent repair as a result of Purvis' incomplete and improper work performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff attached various exhibits to her opposition to Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment, which included: (1) the Home Improvement Contract between Plaintiff and Purvis; (2) Home Inspection Report; (3) Gracie Hart Electrical Inspection Report; (4) Mr. Cool repair estimate; (5) JC Services AC, LLC report; (6) Gurtler Bros. Inspection Report; (7) Winston Wood Inspection Report and Amended Report; (8) Winston Wood's curriculum vitae; (9) excerpts from Scottsdale Insurance 2007 policy; (10) Purvis Contracting Group Home Improvement Contractor License; and (11) correspondence from the Louisiana State Licensing Board of Contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Scottsdale filed a reply memorandum to plaintiff's opposition. In its reply memorandum, Scottsdale objected to the admissibility of all of plaintiff's exhibits attached to her opposition to Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment, contending that the attachments were not admissible summary judgment evidence as provided in La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(4). Scottsdale asserted that plaintiff's exhibits were not authenticated by affidavit and did not otherwise fall under the exclusive list of documents and evidence admissible in a summary judgment proceeding under La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its reply memorandum, Scottsdale further addressed plaintiff's allegation that she sustained an \"advertising injury,\" which Scottsdale asserted plaintiff raised for the first time in her opposition to its motion for summary judgment. Nevertheless, concerning plaintiff's claims that Purvis falsely advertised its qualifications, Scottsdale first argued that the policy provides no coverage for the alleged injuries arising from false advertisement or unfair practices. Scottsdale further pointed to its policy's \"Material Published with Knowledge of Falsity\" exclusion, which provides that coverage is excluded for a \"personal and advertising injury\" arising out of oral or written publication of material, if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity. Scottsdale again asserted that the policy in question provides no coverage for any of plaintiff's claims asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the April 7, 2017 hearing on Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment, counsel for Scottsdale orally re-urged its objection to the exhibits attached to plaintiff's opposition to its motion for summary judgment. The trial judge found that plaintiff's exhibits were not admissible summary judgment evidence under La. C.C.P. art. 966(A)(4) and did not consider the attachments in rendering his judgment on Scottsdale's motion. On April 17, 2017, the trial judge issued a written judgment granting Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment and dismissing all of plaintiff's claims against it with prejudice. Plaintiff timely appeals the summary judgment, contending that the trial court erred in its determination that the Scottsdale policy excludes coverage for all of plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A motion for summary judgment is a procedural device used to avoid a full-scale trial when there is no genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

La. C.C. art. 1983. An insurance policy is a contract, which must be construed employing the general rules of interpretation of contracts.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds[ v.

If the insurance policy's language clearly expresses the parties' intent and does not violate a statute or public policy, the policy must be enforced as written. However, if the insurance policy is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations, then it is considered ambiguous and must be liberally interpreted in favor of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Reynolds, supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Newby v.

The Supreme Court went on to state that the work product exclusion in a general commercial liability policy identical to the Scottsdale policy at issue \"applies to both the contractor as well as others acting on his behalf-subcontractors\" and \"does not insure any obligation of the policyholder to repair or replace his own defective product.\"\n   <em>\n    Supreme Servs. &amp; Specialty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8313541\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/958/634/#p638\">\n    958 So.2d at 641, 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A review of the policy at issue in this case reflects that the damages plaintiff alleges directly resulted from the work Purvis performed and are specifically excluded under the policy. Plaintiff claims that the work performed- rehabilitating and renovating her entire residence, which was gutted to the wall studs, following Hurricane Katrina-was not completed properly or in a workman like manner. The physical property damage plaintiff alleges is related to Purvis' work performed to her home pursuant to the contract. Thus, plaintiff's property damage claims are specifically excluded from coverage under the work product and damage to your work exclusions. As stated above, Louisiana jurisprudence has consistently held that a GCL policy does not serve as a performance bond and does not cover damages to the property on which the contractor worked and arising out of faulty or substandard work.\n   <em>\n    Supreme Servs. &amp; Specialty Co., supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, we find that the policy at issue does not provide coverage for plaintiff's remaining claims. As to plaintiff's claim for damages arising out of mold exposure, those claims are specifically excluded under the policy's \"Fungi or Bacteria Exclusion.\" Further, although the policy does provide coverage for a \"personal and advertising injury,\" plaintiff's fraud claims and unfair practice claims related to Purvis' alleged false advertisement as a licensed general contractor do not fall within the policy's provisions for coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Scottsdale's policy at issue provides coverage for \"those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'personal and advertising injury' to which this insurance applies.\" The policy specifically defines \"personal and advertising injury\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (14) \"Personal and advertising injury\" means injury, including consequential \"bodily injury\", arising out of one or more of the following offenses:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   a. False arrest, detention or imprisonment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   b. Malicious prosecution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   c. The wrongful eviction from, wrongful entry into, or invasion of the right of private occupancy of a room, dwelling or premises that a person occupies, committed by or on behalf of its owner, landlord or lessor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   d. Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   e. Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person's right of privacy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   f. The use of another's advertising idea in your \"advertisement\"; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   g. Infringing upon another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in your \"advertisement\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff's claims related to Purvis' alleged fraud, false advertising, and misrepresentation as a general contractor do not arise out of any of the enumerated offenses set forth in the policy's \"personal and advertising\" coverage provision. Therefore, we find that coverage for plaintiff's remaining claims, arising out of Purvis' alleged false and misleading advertisement as a Louisiana state licensed general contractor, do not fall within the policy's definition of \"personal and advertising injury\" and thus are not covered under the terms of the policy at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons provided herein, we find that the Scottsdale policies issued to defendant Purvis do not provide coverage for plaintiff's claims under the facts of this case and, thus, the trial judge was correct in granting Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Plaintiff initially filed a \"Petition for Damages, For Breach of Contract, and for Fraud\" on November 12, 2008, in the 24\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Judicial District Court, against Jon Purvis individually and Purvis Contracting Group, LLC.
