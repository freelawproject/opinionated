R.S. 14:42.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on February 23, 2015. Defense counsel also made an oral motion to appoint a sanity commission on that date. A sanity hearing was set for March 25, 2015. Thereafter, on March 25, 2015, the parties stipulated to the qualifications of experts in the fields of forensic psychiatry and psychology and their opinion of defendant's competency. The trial court accepted the stipulation and found defendant competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later on that same day, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to the charge of forcible rape pursuant to\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v.

On March 28, 2017, defendant filed an Ex Parte Motion for Special Proceeding, wherein he sought reinstatement of his appeal rights. On April 3, 2017, the\n   trial court granted defendant an out-of-time appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the guilty plea proceeding, the State asserted that if the matter had proceeded to trial, it would have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that on or between September 13 and 14, 2014, in Jefferson Parish, defendant knowingly and intentionally violated La. R.S. 14:42.1 in that he had sexual intercourse with L.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   without her consent and with use of force, threats, or physical violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The bill of information similarly provides that on or between September 13 and 14, 2014, defendant violated La.

Accordingly, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    State v.

The request must be accompanied by \"a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\" so as to provide the reviewing court \"with a basis for determining whether appointed counsel have fully performed their duty to support their clients' appeals to the best of their ability\" and to assist the reviewing court \"in making the critical determination whether the appeal is indeed so frivolous that counsel should be permitted to withdraw.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

The court\n   explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant's appellate counsel asserts that after a detailed review of the record, she could find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. Counsel asserts that defendant was informed of the forcible rape charge against him. She contends that the trial court advised defendant of his right to a jury trial, his right to confront his accusers, and his privilege against self-incrimination, and he acknowledged his understanding of these rights. She provides that defendant indicated his understanding of the sentencing range he faced and the terms of the plea agreement. Counsel notes that the State merely recited the bill of information when asked to provide a factual basis for the plea, but she points out that the preliminary hearing transcript included in the record contains additional evidence of defendant's guilt. She further mentions that defendant received a twenty-year sentence without benefits as the trial judge had previously apprised defendant during the colloquy and that defendant was advised of his obligation to register as a sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellate counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for defendant which states she has notified defendant of her motion. Additionally, this Court sent defendant a letter by certified mail informing him that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief had been filed on his behalf and that he had until September 14, 2017 to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief. As of the date of the case's submission for decision, defendant had not filed a brief with this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State provides that defendant voluntarily and intelligently entered his plea of guilty and that his sentence should be upheld. Thus, the State agrees with appellate counsel's assertion that this case presents no non-frivolous issues for review and that her motion to withdraw should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The bill of information properly charged defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the charged offense. It also sufficiently identified defendant and the crime charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. arts. 464 - 466. As reflected by the minute entries and the commitment, defendant appeared at each stage of the proceedings against him. As such, defendant's presence does not present any issues supporting an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, defendant pled guilty to forcible rape, a violation of La. R.S. 14:42.1. If a defendant pleads guilty, he\n   normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading to the guilty plea proceedings and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wingerter\n   </em>\n   , 05-697 (La. App. 5 Cir. 3/14/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8440853\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/662/#p664\">\n    926 So.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664. The record does not reflect that any rulings were preserved for appellate review under the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Also, prior to defendant's guilty plea proceeding, the trial court found him competent to stand trial. Defendant's guilty plea waived his right to challenge his competency on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Camp\n   </em>\n   , 16-473 (La.

According to\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , a defendant may plead guilty, without foregoing his protestations of innocence, if \"the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to defendant[,] ... especially where the defendant was represented by competent counsel whose advice was that the plea would be to the defendant's advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which requires the establishment of a factual basis for the plea when a defendant protests that he is innocent. When a defendant pleads guilty under\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , constitutional due process requires that the record contain strong evidence of actual guilt.\n   <em>\n    McCoil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1123\">\n    924 So.2d at 1122-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State offered a factual basis for the plea, which the trial court found to be sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . As mentioned, during the guilty plea proceeding, the State asserted that if the matter had proceeded to trial, it would have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that on or between September 13 and 14, 2014, in Jefferson Parish, defendant knowingly and intentionally violated La. R.S. 14:42.1 in that he had sexual intercourse with L.S. without her consent and with use of force, threats, or physical violence. We also find the State's factual basis to be sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the trial judge asked defendant whether he was withdrawing his plea of not guilty and pleading guilty because he was in fact guilty, to which defendant responded in the affirmative. Therefore, we find that the record demonstrates strong evidence of defendant's actual guilt as well as defendant's admission of his commission of the crime of forcible rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A review of the record reveals no irregularities in defendant's guilty plea. Once a defendant is sentenced, only those guilty pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief. A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and\n   voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    McCoil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1123\">\n    924 So.2d at 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The record shows that defendant was aware he was pleading guilty to forcible rape in violation of La. R.S. 14:42.1. In the waiver of rights form and during the colloquy, defendant was advised of his right to a trial by judge or jury, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination, as required by\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   . In the waiver of rights form, defendant placed his initials next to a provision indicating that his attorney had advised him of each of these rights and his waiver of those rights. Defendant signed his full name at the bottom of the waiver of rights form. In addition, during the colloquy, defendant verbally confirmed his understanding that he was waiving these rights by entering a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Also during the colloquy, defendant provided that he had a seventh grade level of education. He acknowledged that the act of pleading guilty must be free and voluntary and that no promises or threats were made to encourage him to enter his plea. He indicated that he understood the possible legal consequences of pleading guilty. He also stated that he was satisfied with the way his attorney had handled his case and had no questions for the trial judge. The trial judge also advised defendant that his guilty plea could be used to enhance a subsequent penalty. Defendant was further advised of his right to appellate review of an adverse verdict at trial and the right to the assistance of an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, defendant was correctly informed during the colloquy and in the waiver of rights form that he faced a sentencing range of five to forty years at hard labor for a conviction of forcible rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial judge advised defendant that if he pleaded guilty, he would receive a sentence of twenty years at hard labor, and the waiver of rights form contains that defendant would receive a twenty-year sentence without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant subsequently received a sentence of twenty years at hard labor without benefits. The waiver of rights form provides that the trial court accepted defendant's plea as having been knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made by defendant. This provision is contained directly above the signatures of defense counsel, defendant, and the trial judge, as well as the date of the guilty plea proceeding. Further, during the colloquy, the trial judge implicitly accepted defendant's plea to forcible rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, it is noted that the colloquy reflects that the trial court implicitly accepted defendant's guilty plea prior to advising defendant of the sex offender registration/notification requirements. La. R.S. 15:543(A) requires the trial court to \"provide written notification to any person convicted of a sex offense and a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor of the registration requirements and the notification requirements of this Chapter.\" Notification must be given on the statutorily required form and \"shall be included on any guilty plea forms and judgment and sentence forms provided to the defendant, and an entry shall be made in the court minutes stating that the written notification was provided to such offenders.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1123\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Failure to advise a defendant of the requirements of registration and notification is a factor that may undercut the voluntary nature of a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

After the acceptance of defendant's plea for forcible rape and the imposition of all defendant's sentences, the State asserted that in connection with defendant's conviction for forcible rape, the trial court was required to advise defendant of his obligation to register as a sex offender. The State further asserted that it \"believe[d] Your Honor prepared a notification to Sex Offender of Registration obligations. Mr. Marenco has reviewed that with his attorney. He's executed that document. I'd ask that Your Honor sign that document as well in open court.\" The trial court then ordered defendant to notify and register as a sex offender, and the record reflects that the deputy provided defendant with a copy of the registration obligations in open court. The Notification to Sex Offender form contains both defendant and the trial judge's signatures and contains the date of March 25, 2015, the date of the guilty plea proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, we find that the record shows that defendant was aware of the notification/registration requirements despite the trial court's failure to advise him of the requirements during the plea colloquy. The State's comments indicate that prior to the entry of his plea, defendant executed the Notification to Sex Offender form and was advised of the notification/registration obligations by his attorney. Finally, defendant does not challenge his plea on the basis of the time he received notice of the sex offender registration requirements. Accordingly, under the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, we find that the trial court's failure to advise defendant of the sex offender registration and notification requirements before the taking of the plea did not affect its voluntariness and does not present an issue for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Last, defendant's sentence does not present an issue for appeal.

The preliminary examination was conducted on October 1, 2014; probable cause was found to hold defendant on the subject charge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    During the same proceeding, defendant pled guilty to the crime of cyberstalking in case number 13-5008, the crimes of simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in case number 14-1370, and the crime of possession of alprazolam in case number 14-5075.

Thus, the delay for taking an appeal elapsed thirty days after the rendition of judgment on March 25, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    La. C.Cr.P. art. 914(B)(1). Following the thirty-day delay from March 25, 2015, defendant's conviction and sentence became final.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

La. C.Cr.P. art. 930.8 provides time limitations for filing an application for post-conviction relief, including applications which seek an out-of-time appeal. Such applications shall not be considered if filed more than two years after the judgment of conviction and sentence has become final under the provisions of Article 914 or 922 (finality of judgment on appeal), unless certain exceptions apply.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    La. C.Cr.P. art. 930.8(A). Therefore, defendant's Ex Parte Motion for Special Proceeding, postmarked on March 28, 2017, was timely filed within two years after the judgment of conviction and sentence became final.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    To observe the principle of protecting victims of sex offenses set forth in La.

At the preliminary examination, Detective David Ray testified that upon his arrival at the scene of a reported rape, he met with the victim who stated that she had been out with defendant, with whom she had been Facebook friends for a couple of months but only had recently met in person. Upon going back to a residence after a night out together, she was locked in the residence and forced by defendant to engage in various sexual acts without her consent. She stated that defendant told her if she did not cooperate, he would injure her and her family, and she believed him. According to the detective, the victim called 9-1-1 and placed the phone under the pillow in hopes that the police could trace the call. They could not, but a 9-1-1 call was logged in. The victim eventually left the residence after defendant fell asleep, whereupon she flagged down help.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <em>\n     Boykin v.

However, the colloquy reflects that the trial court questioned defendant as to whether he understood all the possible legal consequences of pleading guilty and whether his rights had been fully explained to him. The trial court additionally asked defendant whether he had any further questions. Defendant acknowledged his understanding of the legal consequences and of his rights. He additionally denied having any questions. Following this exchange, defense counsel indicated that defendant \"would like his plea, in this particular case, to be taken pursuit to\n    <em>\n     Alford\n    </em>\n    .\" The trial court then stated: \"All right. You waive all legal delays?\" Therefore, we find that a review of the colloquy reflects an implicit acceptance of defendant's plea by the trial court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    According to\n    <em>\n     State v.
