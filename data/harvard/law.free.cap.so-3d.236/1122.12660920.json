The trial court had Hooks read, initial, and sign a form entitled \"Self-Representation Advisory Form/Trial\" (\"the form\"). The trial court then asked if Hooks read over the form carefully. Hooks answered in the affirmative. The trial court then proceeded to reiterate the disadvantages of self-representation and that Hooks had to make a voluntary and knowing decision to do so. The trial court then asked if Hooks still wanted to waive his right to counsel. Hooks again answered in the affirmative. The trial court then discharged Hooks' counsel, but allowed her to remain as standby counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Immediately before trial commenced, the trial court once again asked Hooks if he still wanted to represent himself. After speaking to his standby counsel, Hooks replied affirmatively. Hooks then represented himself throughout the trial and probation violation proceedings. The jury found Hooks guilty as charged. The trial court sentenced Hooks accordingly, and found Hooks guilty of violating probation, revoked probation, and sentenced him on those charges as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hooks never objected to the sufficiency of the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry at trial.

In 1972, the Florida Supreme Court adopted Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.111, entitled \"Providing Counsel to Indigents,\" which established procedures for appointment of counsel to indigent defendants.\n   <em>\n    In re Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9726214\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/272/65/\">\n    272 So.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1972). The rule addressed a defendant's waiver of appointed counsel as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   No waiver shall be accepted where it appears that the defendant is unable to make an intelligent and understanding choice because of his mental condition, age, education, experience, the nature or complexity of the case, or other factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.111(d)(3) (1973). Two years after this rule became effective, the United States Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   , which, as stated, recognized that\n   a defendant has the right to self-representation. But based on Rule 3.111(d), Florida courts held that a trial court must make specific inquiry on the record relating to the defendant's age, ability to read and write, education, and other factors, before a waiver of counsel was deemed sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11763364\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/724/144/#p145\">\n    724 So.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (Fla. 1st DCA 1998) ;\n   <em>\n    Gillyard v.

By mandating these specific questions, these cases suggested that a court had an obligation to deny a request for self-representation unless the defendant was sufficiently aged, educated, and literate, to handle self-representation, seemingly in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Faretta.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Florida Supreme Court addressed the tension between the waiver of counsel provision of Rule 3.111(d) and\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906042\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/248/\">\n    698 So.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1997). In\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , the trial court refused to accept the defendant's waiver of counsel based upon the factors enumerated in Rule 3.111(d)(3), in particular that the defendant's education was insufficient to represent himself in a complex case.\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906042\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/248/\">\n    698 So.2d at 250-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The supreme court reversed, holding that \"once a court determines that a competent defendant of his or her own free will has 'knowingly and intelligently' waived the right to counsel, the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   are satisfied, the inquiry is over, and the defendant may proceed unrepresented.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906042\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/248/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906042\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/248/\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[N]o citizen can be denied the right of self-representation-or any other constitutional right-because he or she has only a high school diploma.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906042\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/248/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11906042\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/248/\">\n    at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, Rule 3.111(d) reflects the understanding that\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   does not require certain \"magic words\" to effectuate self-representation.\n   <em>\n    Potts v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11697096\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/718/757/#p760\">\n    718 So.2d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (Fla. 1998). The amended rule also added a provision to subsection (2) of Rule 3.111(d) requiring the court to \"advise the defendant of the disadvantages and dangers of self-representation\" before determining whether a waiver of counsel is knowing and intelligent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In short, a competent defendant who does not suffer from severe mental illness and who has been advised of the disadvantages and dangers of self-representation cannot be denied the right to\n   self-representation, regardless of age, education, experience, or the nature or complexity of the case. While these factors may be relevant in determining competence, failure to inquire specifically into any of the factors does not automatically render a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry deficient. We ruled in\n   <em>\n    Edenfield v.

However, these holdings are based on a prior version of Rule 3.111(d)(3).

Did you get a\n   chance to read over that real carefully?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [HOOKS]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And, and I'll say, again, it's your absolute right to represent yourself if you want to. I almost never advise it, because a lawyer-it says on that form-has got a lot of knowledge and experience, knowledge about procedures, knowledge about rules of evidence, things that you might not know about.

Hooks initialed every paragraph and signed the form, swearing that he read and understood the form. The court then reiterated on the record the dangers of self-representation, specifically asked Hooks on the record whether he read the form carefully (to which Hooks responded affirmatively), and told him that his decision to represent himself must be voluntary. We see nothing in the record that would have given the court \"reason to doubt the defendant's competence,\"\n   <em>\n    Godinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355530\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/389/\">\n    509 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   401 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355530\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/389/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Hooks has suggested none.

Hooks asks that we also certify conflict. I concur in the denial of this motion, including his request for rehearing and rehearing en banc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I write separately to emphasize two points. First, Hooks claims we have overlooked that the Supreme Court \"approved\" a standard\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   colloquy as part of the 1998 amendment to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.111(d) and \"added\" the standard colloquy to the rule. In fact, the model colloquy is not part of Rule 3.111. The Court only asked the Criminal Procedure Rules Committee to make suggestions for standardizing\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiries.\n   <em>\n    Amendment to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.111(d)(2)-(3)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11691502\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/719/873/\">\n    719 So. 2d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1998). The Court's request was passed to the Conference of Circuit Judges, which developed a model colloquy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11691502\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/719/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court attached the model colloquy as an appendix to its opinion amending the rule in order to make it available to trial judges.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Court neither \"approved\" the model colloquy nor \"added\" it to Rule 3.111. While the model colloquy is useful, it does not establish an enforceable standard for ensuring an adequate waiver of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neal v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036978\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/1132/#p1135\">\n    60 So. 3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011) (noting that \"[w]hile the model colloquy contained in the rules is very helpful, failure to follow it to the letter does not compel a finding that a defendant has not made a knowing and intelligent choice of self-representation.\");\n   <em>\n    Vega v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7031435\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/57/259/#p262\">\n    57 So. 3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (Fla. 5th DCA 2011) (\"trial courts are not bound to follow the model\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   colloquy suggested by the supreme court\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, Hooks argues that we have overlooked the trial court's failure to ask him numerous questions about, for instance, his age, his education, his \"mental status,\" and his experience in criminal proceedings, and that without answers to these questions the court failed to ensure\n   that he was competent to waive counsel. I note that he does not claim that his answers to any of these questions would have suggested that he was not competent to waive counsel. In fact, the record shows the opposite. Before jury selection, Hooks gave a clear statement regarding the issues in the case and his defense theory. Hooks actively participated in jury selection, making two cause challenges and a peremptory strike. Hooks gave a coherent opening statement, cross-examined all four of the State's witnesses, actively participated in sidebar discussions, moved for judgment of acquittal after the State rested, and gave a cogent closing argument. The court confirmed at every critical stage of the proceeding that Hooks wished to continue representing himself, until sentencing, when Hooks chose to be represented by stand-by counsel. At sentencing, the court indicated that Hooks appeared to be a \"pretty intelligent guy,\" and called him \"articulate.\" Hooks asks that we reverse the trial court not because the court allowed an incompetent defendant to represent himself, but because the court failed to ask a list of questions that would have shown what the record already shows, and what even Hooks himself does not dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Unlike a plea colloquy, where the case is usually over soon after the defendant enters the waiver (of trial), a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry allows the case to proceed after the defendant enters the waiver (of counsel). Thus-and again unlike a guilty plea-the court has ample opportunity after the waiver of counsel to determine whether the defendant appears competent. In my view the questions to ascertain competency prior to the waiver are far more important in the plea context than in the waiver-of-counsel context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, nothing that occurred at trial would have given the trial court any indication that, perhaps, Hooks had not been competent to waive counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I recognize that the Florida Supreme Court has held that\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   and Rule 3.111(d)\"require reversal when there is not a proper\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7488888\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/626/655/#p657\">\n    626 So. 2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 (Fla. 1993).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Case v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286605\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/865/557/#p559\">\n    865 So. 2d 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559 (Fla. 1st DCA 2003) (citing\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"[w]hen a defendant waives the right to counsel, the trial court's failure to perform an adequate\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   inquiry is per se reversible error\"). As such, Hooks is not obligated to show that he was incompetent. However, the United States Supreme Court has held that a court is required to make a competency determination when a defendant seeks to waive his or her right to counsel \"only when a court has reason to doubt the defendant's competence.\"\n   <em>\n    Godinez v. Moran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355530\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/389/\">\n    509 U.S. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401 n.13 (1993). In other words, a defendant who is plainly competent cannot show prejudice from the court's failure to ask questions to confirm that he is competent. Nothing else demonstrates more that this case is an example of \"Simon Says\" jurisprudence, where judgments are to be reversed not because a party suffered prejudicial error, but because the court failed to say the right words the right way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In this case, the trial court adequately determined that Hooks' waiver of counsel was voluntary. As Hooks has failed to demonstrate that we overlooked any law or facts, his motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    This does not include, of course, the situation where the defendant waives counsel and enters a guilty plea at the same time. But in this circumstance, the court must also comply with the requirements for ensuring a valid guilty plea, irrespective of the requirements for ensuring a valid waiver of counsel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
