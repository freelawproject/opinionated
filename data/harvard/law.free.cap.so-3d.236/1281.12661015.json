Taylor, appeals his convictions and sentences for three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. For the following reasons, we affirm defendant's convictions. In addition, we affirm defendant's sentence imposed with respect to his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Because we find the district court imposed indeterminate sentences with respect to each of the three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, we vacate defendant's sentences for these counts and remand for resentencing in a manner consistent with this opinion. Further, we grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record for defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 10, 2012, a Jefferson Parish Grand Jury returned a multi-count indictment charging defendant with five counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (counts two, three, five, seven, and nine),\n   one count of attempted second degree murder in violation of La. R.S. 14:27 and La. R.S. 14:30.1 (count four), one count of second degree murder in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1 (count six), and one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A) (count ten). Defendant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on May 11, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant filed several motions during the pre-trial proceedings. On August 10, 2012, defendant filed omnibus motions to suppress his confession, identification and physical evidence. No hearing was conducted on these omnibus motions. On March 14, 2013, defendant filed motions to sever the trials of the defendants and the offenses filed against him, which the district court denied on May 28, 2013. On April 23, 2013, defendant filed a motion to quash the five counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, arguing that La. R.S. 14:95.1 was unconstitutional. The district court granted the motion to quash and found these counts unconstitutional on May 28, 2013. The State filed an appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which reversed the ruling granting the motion to quash in\n   <em>\n    State v. Eberhardt\n   </em>\n   , 13-2306, 14-209 (La. 7/1/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925351\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/377/\">\n    145 So.3d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 14, 2015, defendant filed a motion to recuse the prosecutor, which the district court denied on January 14, 2016. On February 23, 2017, the district court denied defendant's reurged motion to sever the defendants and offenses. On March 16, 2017, defendant filed a motion to declare La. C.Cr.P. art. 782(A) unconstitutional because it permits non-unanimous jury verdicts for felony charges, and a motion in limine to exclude autopsy photos. On March 17, 2017, the district court denied the motion contesting the constitutionality of La. C.Cr.P. art. 782(A), but granted in part the motion to exclude certain autopsy photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 20, 2017, the parties began jury selection. On the following day, defendant agreed to enter into a plea agreement. The State entered a\n   <em>\n    nolle prosequi\n   </em>\n   on the attempted second degree murder charge (count four) and second degree murder charge (count six), as well as two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (counts five and seven). Defendant withdrew his pleas of not guilty to the remaining counts, and after being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, entered pleas of guilty to three counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (counts two, three, and nine) and one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine (count ten), pursuant to\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v. Alford\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v.Crosby\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In accordance with the plea agreement, the district court sentenced defendant on counts two, three, and nine to 15 years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to count ten, the district\n   court sentenced defendant to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor with the first two years to be served without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The court further ordered the sentences to run concurrent with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the same date, the State filed a multiple offender bill of information on count ten, alleging defendant to be a second felony offender. Defendant stipulated to the multiple bill after being advised of his rights. The district court vacated defendant's original sentence on count ten, and pursuant to the multiple offender plea agreement, sentenced defendant as a second felony offender under La. R.S. 15:529.1, to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor, with the first two years to be served without benefits. The court further ordered defendant's enhanced sentence to run concurrent with the other sentences imposed in this case, and recommended defendant participate in any self-help programs available to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following sentencing on March 21, 2017, defendant filed a motion for appeal which was granted by the district court on March 22, 2017. Defendant's appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because defendant's convictions were the result of guilty pleas, the facts underlying the crimes of conviction are not fully developed in the record. Thus, the facts were gleaned from the factual basis provided by the State at the guilty plea proceeding. The State submitted that with regard to counts two, three, and nine, the evidence would have established that on June 21, 2011 (count two), August 2, 2011 (count three), and January 9, 2012 (count nine), defendant violated La. R.S. 14:95.1 by possessing firearms after he was previously convicted of the crime of possession of cocaine in Case No. 04-383 in the United States District Court Eastern District of Louisiana. With respect to count ten, the State alleged the evidence would establish that on January 9, 2012, defendant violated Louisiana R.S. 40:967(A) in that he knowingly possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANDERS BRIEF\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.

Appellate counsel maintains that defendant's decision to change his plea from not guilty to guilty was fully informed as he was advised of the legal consequences of a guilty plea by both his counsel as well as the district court. Counsel avers that the district court informed defendant of the sentencing ranges for the offenses and the sentences the court would impose, including the enhanced sentence, upon the acceptance of defendant's guilty pleas. Accordingly, appellate counsel asserts that defendant is now restricted by law from appealing his sentences. Additionally, appellate counsel notes that while defendant entered his guilty pleas pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , he did not specify which pre-trial rulings were being preserved for appeal. Thus, because the pre-trial motions filed by defendant do not substantially relate to his guilt, appellate counsel concludes no adverse rulings were preserved for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellate counsel filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record indicating counsel notified defendant of the filing of the motion and advised him of his right to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief in this appeal. Additionally, this Court sent defendant a letter by certified mail informing him that his counsel filed an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief and allowed him until September 17, 2017, to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief. On September 12, 2017, this Court granted defendant's request to view the appellate record, as well as an extension until October 12, 2017, to file his brief. On October 10, 2017, defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief raising four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that no non-frivolous issues for appeal exist. Our review, however, reveals errors patent that require correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The bill of indictment properly charged defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the charged offenses. It also sufficiently identified defendant and the crimes charged.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. arts. 464 - 466. As reflected by the minute entries and\n   commitment, defendant appeared at each stage of the proceedings against him, including arraignment, guilty plea proceedings and sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If a defendant pleads guilty, he normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea, and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Wingerter\n   </em>\n   , 05-697 (La.

Additionally, an unconditional plea, willingly and knowingly made, waives any and all non-jurisdictional defects and bars a defendant from later asserting on appeal that the State failed to produce sufficient proof at the multiple offender hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v. Schaefer\n   </em>\n   , 97-465 (La.

The State provided a factual basis for defendant's guilty pleas as required under\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, while defendant also entered a\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   plea, he failed to specify which pre-trial rulings he desired to reserve for appeal. A defendant's failure to specify which pre-trial ruling he desires to reserve for appeal as part of a guilty plea entered pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   may limit the scope of appellate review, but does not preclude review altogether.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the record indicates defendant filed standard omnibus pre-trial motions, including motions to suppress, which were not ruled upon prior to the time defendant entered his guilty pleas. When a defendant does not object to the trial court's failure to hear or rule on a pre-trial motion prior to pleading guilty, the motion is considered waived.\n   <em>\n    State v. Corzo\n   </em>\n   , 04-791 (La.

Thus, there were no rulings on defendant's motions to suppress to preserve for appeal under\n   <em>\n    Crosby, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, the additional motions filed by defendant, including a motion to recuse the prosecutor, motions to sever defendants and offenses, and a motion to declare La. C.Cr.P. art. 782(A) unconstitutional, which the district court denied, do not substantially relate to guilt and as such, these adverse rulings were not preserved for appellate review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, a review of the record reveals no irregularities in defendant's guilty pleas that would render them invalid. Once a defendant is sentenced, only those guilty pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief. A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea\n   bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    State v. McCoil\n   </em>\n   , 05-658 (La.

Defendant was properly advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights by the district court and via the waiver of rights form. During the colloquy, the district court advised defendant of his right to a judge or jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant verbally indicated he understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving these rights and further placed his initials next to the rights he was waiving. His signature at the end of the waiver of rights form indicated he understood he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court also informed defendant that his guilty pleas could be used to enhance a penalty for any future conviction. Defendant indicated he understood the possible legal consequences of pleading guilty and confirmed his guilty pleas were entered freely and voluntarily and that no promises or threats had been made to encourage him into entering his guilty pleas. He also stated he was satisfied with the handling of his case by his attorney. Defendant was informed during the colloquy, and by means of the waiver of rights form, of the sentencing ranges for the offenses as well as the sentences the district court would impose upon acceptance of defendant's guilty pleas. Defendant was further advised that the State would file a multiple offender bill of information against him as to count ten. Defendant indicated he had no questions for the court and again professed his desire to plead guilty. After the colloquy, the judge accepted defendant's guilty pleas as knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A review of the record also reveals no constitutional infirmity in defendant's stipulation to the multiple bill. Our review of the multiple offender proceedings reveals the district court advised defendant of his multiple offender rights prior to stipulating to the multiple bill. An unconditional plea, willingly and knowingly made, waives any and all non-jurisdictional defects and bars a defendant from later asserting on appeal that the state failed to produce sufficient proof at the multiple offender hearing.\n   <em>\n    Schaefer\n   </em>\n   , 704 So.2d at 304. La. R.S. 15:529.1(D)(1)(a) provides the court shall inform a defendant of the allegations contained in the bill of information and of his right to be tried as to the truth thereof according to law. Implicit in this directive is the additional requirement that the defendant be advised of his constitutional right to remain silent.\n   <em>\n    State v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , 09-788 (La. App. 5 Cir. 4/13/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051268\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/1162/#p1167\">\n    35 So.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 10-1448 (La. 9/2/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7029426,7029386\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/68/534/\">\n    68 So.3d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The multiple offender waiver of constitutional rights form signed by defendant indicates he was advised of his right to a hearing at which the State would have to prove his multiple offender status and of his right to remain silent throughout the hearing. The district court also informed defendant of these rights at the hearing. Both during the multiple bill plea colloquy and on the form, defendant was also advised of the potential sentencing range of 15 years to 60 years as a second felony offender, and of his actual sentence of 20 years. Defendant also indicated he had not been forced or coerced into stipulating to the multiple bill. After conducting the plea colloquy, the district court accepted his stipulation to the multiple bill as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made by defendant. We find no error in this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lastly, defendant's sentence as to count ten does not appear to present issues for\n   appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   His original and enhanced sentences on count ten fall within the sentencing ranges prescribed by La. R.S. 40:967(B)(4)(b) and La.

App. 5th Cir. 1990).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Initially, we noticed from the face of the record that it is unclear from the sentencing transcript whether defendant received separate, individual sentences on counts two, three, and nine, respectively. The trial court stated: \"At this time the Court is going to sentence the defendant as follows: In Count 2, 3, 9 the charge of convicted felon in possession of a firearm the sentence is going to be 15 years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.\" The commitment reflects that defendant received \"15 years hard labor on counts 2, 3, 9 concurrently,\" and the Uniform Commitment Order (\"UCO\") reflects that defendant received 15 years on each of these counts. Furthermore, defendant's guilty plea form indicates he would receive a 15-year sentence on each count. Although it appears that the trial court and parties intended for defendant to receive 15 years on each count, the sentencing transcript is unclear and it is well-established that the transcript prevails.\n   <em>\n    Lynch, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 879 provides that if a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, the court shall impose a determinate sentence. Therefore, defendant's three convictions for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon require the imposition of three separate sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 16-537 (La. App. 5 Cir. 5/17/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370066\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/222/935/\">\n    222 So.3d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because it is not clear from the sentencing transcript as to whether the district court imposed separate sentences on counts two, three and nine, we find these sentences are indeterminate. Therefore, we vacate the sentences imposed by the trial court in counts two, three and nine and remand for resentencing. On remand, we instruct the district court to impose a separate, individual sentence for each count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Furthermore, there are several discrepancies between the commitment, the UCO and the transcript:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   1) While the commitment indicates defendant pleaded guilty under\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v. Alford\n   </em>\n   , it does not reference the fact that defendant also pleaded guilty under\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   2) The UCO only references one offense date, namely for count two which was committed on June 21, 2011, and fails to reference the offense dates for the remainder of the offenses for which defendant pleaded guilty-specifically, August 2, 2011, for count three, and January 9, 2012, for counts nine and ten.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   3) The UCO provides that \"defendant is given 20 Year(s) without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\" However, this is inaccurate. Defendant was given a 15-year sentence on counts two, three, and nine without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and a 20-year enhanced sentence on count ten with the first two years to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and as statutorily mandated under La. R.S. 15:529.1, the remainder of the 20-year sentence is served without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   4) On the UCO and in two places on the commitment-once after the imposition of defendant's original sentences, and once after the imposition of his enhanced sentence on count ten-it provides that the \"court ordered that the above sentence is to run concurrently with\n   any/all sentence(s) that the Defendant is currently serving.\" However, the transcript provides that after defendant's original sentencing, the court ordered defendant's \"sentences are to run concurrent with each other,\" and after imposition of his multiple offender sentence, the court ordered his enhanced sentence to \"run concurrent with all sentences pursuant to Case No. 12-1225.\" Case No. 12-1225 is the district court case number for the convictions and sentences imposed in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Where there is a conflict between the transcript and the minute entry, the transcript prevails.\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638942\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/441/732/#p734\">\n    441 So.2d at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
