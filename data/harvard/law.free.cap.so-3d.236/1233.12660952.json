Code Civ. Pro. art. 971, the so-called anti-SLAPP statute, where the appellate court found that plaintiff's petition did not involve a \"public issue.\" For the reasons expressed below, we find the court of appeal was correct in reversing the trial court's ruling. We hold that La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(F)(1)(a), which states that \"[a]ny written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial body\" is an \"[a]ct in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech ... in connection\n   with a public issue,\" must nonetheless satisfy the requirement of La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(A)(1), that such statements be made \"in connection with a public issue....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Philip Shelton, M.D. (hereinafter \"Dr. Shelton\") married Judith Shelton (hereinafter \"Mrs. Shelton\") in 2001. During their marriage, the couple each owned a life insurance policy that named the other as the beneficiary. At some point, Mrs. Shelton was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and Hepatorenal Syndrome (rapid deterioration of kidneys) as a result of alcoholism. In July 2011, Mrs. Shelton was admitted to Ochsner Baptist Medical Center for treatment and was soon discharged to Woldenberg Village, an inpatient assisted living facility. Mrs. Shelton died on December 31, 2011, at the age of 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Mrs. Shelton's death, Dr. Shelton learned that, in July 2011, she had changed her beneficiary to her personal assistant/paralegal/friend, Nancy Pavon. In November 2013, Dr. Shelton filed a Petition to Nullify Change of Beneficiary. He alleged Mrs. Shelton had lacked the capacity to execute a change of beneficiary form due to her poor health, including dementia, confusion, disorientation, and personality changes. Alternatively, he alleged Mrs. Shelton's signature on the change of beneficiary form was a forgery or had been obtained through undue influence by Ms. Pavon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response, Ms. Pavon filed an answer and reconventional demand alleging Dr. Shelton's petition constituted defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . In response, Dr. Shelton filed a Special Motion to Strike pursuant to La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971. Ms. Pavon opposed the motion to strike, arguing that it should be dismissed as a matter of law because Dr. Shelton's petition to nullify did not involve a public issue. She also argued that a motion to strike was not the proper mechanism to dismiss her defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a hearing and taking the matter under advisement, the trial court granted Dr. Shelton's special motion to strike. The trial court reasoned that, under La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(A)(1), the moving party must first satisfy the burden of proof that the \"cause of action against [the moving party] arise [s] from any act of that person in furtherance of his right of petition or free speech under the United States or Louisiana Constitution in connection with a public issue....\" Thus, the trial court noted it must first consider whether Dr. Shelton's action, that is, the petition to nullify change of beneficiary, arises from an act in the exercise of his right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue. The trial court concluded Dr. Shelton's petition fell into the category of such \"acts\" as defined in La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(F)(1)(a), because it is a \"written ... statement or writing made before a ... judicial proceeding.\" The trial court then noted that pursuant to Article 971(A)(1) the burden shifted to the non-mover, Ms. Pavon, to show a probability of success on her claim for defamation. The trial court ultimately concluded she could not. The trial court then awarded attorney fees to Dr. Shelton as the prevailing party on the motion, pursuant to La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Pavon sought review in the court of appeal, which ultimately reversed the trial court's ruling. The court of appeal observed that the trial court was correct in first determining whether Dr. Shelton's petition to nullify the change of beneficiary constituted an act in furtherance of his right to petition in connection with a public issue. However, the court of appeal disagreed with the trial court's conclusion that Dr. Shelton met his prima facie burden under Article 971. The court of appeal\n   found the language of Article 971(F)(1)(a) was ambiguous because it was susceptible to different meanings. Relying on the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Yount v.

Civ. Code art. 10, because it does not conform to the purpose of the law. In his view, Article 971(F)(1) sets forth specific examples of what the legislature meant by an \"act in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or Louisiana Constitution in connection with a public issue,\" expressly providing that such acts include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) Any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (b) Any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official body authorized by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Applying the article's plain and unambiguous language to this case, and adhering to the legislature's express intent in La. Acts 1999, No. 734, \u00a7 2 that Article 971 be broadly construed, Dr. Shelton argues his Petition to Nullify Change of Beneficiary and his allegations of forgery and undue influence on the part of Ms. Pavon constitute written statements before a judicial proceeding as defined in Article 971(F)(1)(a). He contends Ms. Pavon's defamation claim against him thus arises from the allegations set forth in his petition, and, therefore, Ms. Pavon's defamation claim is subject to a special motion to strike under Article 971. However, he claims the court of appeal's opinion rewrites the law, because the court concluded that La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(F)(l)(a) requires the statements made in a judicial proceeding be made in connection with a public issue. Dr. Shelton asserts this interpretation effects a change in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ms. Pavon supports the ruling of the Fourth Circuit below, which properly resorted to this court's rules of statutory interpretation after determining the language of La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971 is ambiguous and its application leads to absurd consequences. Ms. Pavon asserts the lower court correctly found that Article 971 (F)(1)(a) was ambiguous, that reading it broadly to apply to any act in furtherance of one's right of petition leads to absurd results, and that it was therefore superseded by the operative clause of Article 971, namely subparagraph 971(A)(1), which mandates that the act in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech must be made in connection with a public issue. She also points out that the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Yount\n   </em>\n   similarly held that Article 971(F)(1)(b) was ambiguous and leads to absurd consequences and was therefore subject to the operative clause of Article 971(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties have correctly noted that Article 971(F)(1)(a) defines an act in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or Louisiana Constitution in connection with a public issue as \"[a]ny written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.\" As observed by the Fourth and Fifth Circuits, though the latter with regard to Article 971(F)(1)(b), this language can be read to provide that a special motion to strike will apply to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   issue brought before a judicial proceeding, because it was made in furtherance of the person's right of petition. On the other hand, Article 971(F)(1)(a) may as easily be interpreted to mean that a special motion to strike will apply\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to statements or writings before a judicial proceeding in connection with a\n   <em>\n    public issue\n   </em>\n   . Clearly there is ambiguity in this language given that all five of our circuit courts have reviewed and interpreted this language, with two circuits adopting the latter view, and three circuits adopting the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ultimately, pursuant to our duty to resolve such impasses, we agree that a reading of the statute to apply to any issue made before a judicial proceeding, without a requirement that it be connected to a public issue, can lead to absurd results. As the\n   <em>\n    Yount\n   </em>\n   court explained with regard to La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(F)(1)(b), which is analogous, under such an interpretation \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cause of action arising from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   written or oral statement made in connection with\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   kind of government activity or proceeding would be subject to special motions to strike regardless of whether or not the statements were made in connection with a public issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Yount\n   </em>\n   , 14-919, p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860456\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/381/\">\n    171 So.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Interpreting subsection (F)(1)(b), the\n   <em>\n    Yount\n   </em>\n   court concluded that \"any party could defame or invade the privacy of a person involved in a divorce\n   proceeding, traffic violation, child custody dispute, marriage, mortgage registration, passport application, or driver's license renewal and be immunized from legal repercussions of damage to others through the use of an extraordinary procedural remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860456\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/381/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 14-919, p. 8-9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860456\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/381/\">\n    171 So.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That same logic applies to subsection (F)(1)(a), as the court below found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We nevertheless acknowledge the views of the other circuits. The First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gibbs v. Elliott\n   </em>\n   , for example, found that the plain language of Article 971(F)(1)(a) and (b) provides that an act \"in connection with a public issue\" includes by definition \"[a]ny written ... statement or writing made before a ... judicial proceeding\" or \"made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a ... judicial body.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibbs,\n   </em>\n   12-2121, p. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822588\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/186/667/\">\n    186 So.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff's defamation suit was dismissed pursuant to a special motion to strike under La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971. The defamation suit in\n   <em>\n    Gibbs\n   </em>\n   was based on allegations made against Gibbs in a succession matter, wherein it was alleged that Gibbs had engaged in efforts to transfer assets for purposes of evading judgment creditors. In dismissing Gibbs's claim, the First Circuit reviewed the assignment of error that the Article 971 special motion to strike should have been denied because the alleged defamatory statements did not arise out of a matter of public significance, but rather was related to a dispute between private parties. The First Circuit court declined to interpret the provisions of La. Code Civ.

Therefore, Dr. Shelton did not satisfy his initial burden of demonstrating that his petition is an act in furtherance of his right of petition \"in connection with a public issue\" as required by Article 971(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the court of appeal in this case awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs to Ms. Pavon as the prevailing party pursuant to La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(B), to be determined by the trial court on remand. Dr. Shelton asserts in this court that the court of appeal erred in awarding Ms. Pavon attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party under La. Code Civ. Pro. art. 971(B), citing this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Jeansonne v.

Ms. Pavon distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Jeansonne\n   </em>\n   , arguing this court reversed the award of attorney fees in\n   <em>\n    Jeansonne\n   </em>\n   because the appellate court itself had fixed the amount rather than remanding the matter to the district court for it to determine reasonable attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We do not find\n   <em>\n    Jeansonne\n   </em>\n   necessarily instructive on this issue. There, the plaintiff sued an attorney and a funeral home alleging the attorney, by misleading the court, had improperly orchestrated an exhumation of the plaintiff's daughter for an autopsy. The trial court sustained the defendant attorney's exception of no cause of action, but denied the defendant attorney's Article 971 special motion to strike the allegations against him and accompanying request for attorney fees. The court of appeal affirmed the trial court's ruling sustaining the exception of no cause of action, but reversed the trial court's denial of the special motion to strike and awarded attorney fees in the amount $2500. This court denied the plaintiff's writ application, but granted the application in part to reverse the award of attorney fees, stating the court of appeal had erred in awarding attorney fees pursuant to Article 971. Because the\n   <em>\n    Jeansonne\n   </em>\n   court did not explain the basis of its ruling, we find it of little value as to whether attorney fees in the instant case were properly awarded by the court of appeal, to be determined on remand by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the instant case, Dr. Shelton filed a special motion to strike Ms. Pavon's allegations\n   against him; the trial court granted Dr. Shelton's motion and awarded him attorney fees and costs. The appellate court reversed that ruling, finding that Dr. Shelton had not met his initial burden of proof because the statements in question were not made in furtherance of his right to petition in connection with a public issue.\n   <em>\n    Shelton v.

Accordingly, we decline to review the matter further. Because Ms. Pavon was ultimately \"a prevailing party\" on the Article 971 special motion to strike, we find the court of appeal correctly awarded her reasonable attorney fees and costs, to be determined by the trial court on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yount\n   </em>\n   , p. 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860456\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/381/\">\n    171 So.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After reviewing the applicable law, we hold that La.

Code Civ.

C.C.P. art. 971 is strikingly clear. It encompasses the plaintiff's claim for defamation arising out of written statements made in a judicial proceeding without any separate \"public issue\" requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Louisiana C.C.P. art. 971(A) makes subject to the special motion to strike \"[a] cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or Louisiana Constitution in connection with a public issue.\" For purposes of this provision, an \" '[a]ct in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or Louisiana Constitution in\n   connection with a public issue,' \" is defined to include \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ny\n   </em>\n   written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law.\" La. C.C. P. art. 971 (F)(1)(a) (emphasis supplied). Thus, plainly read, La. C.C.P. art. 971 encompasses a cause of action against a person arising from\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   statement made in a judicial proceeding. I find there is nothing ambiguous about this language. Apart from noting there is a split among the courts of appeal as to the proper interpretation of the code article, no authority, legal or grammatical, is provided for the conclusion that the language of La. C.C.P. art. 971(F)(1)(a) is ambiguous. Quite the opposite: the finding of ambiguity results solely from the decision of some courts to insert qualifying language\n   <em>\n    not present\n   </em>\n   in La. C.C.P. art. 971(F)(1)(a) -the phrase \"in connection with a public issue\"-to otherwise clear and straightforward language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the thin thread upon which the finding of ambiguity rests, the conclusion reached in the opinion is that a literal reading of the codal provision \"can lead to absurd results\" because its application could extend beyond matters of \"public significance\" into purely private concerns.\n   <strong>\n    Shelton\n   </strong>\n   , op. at ----. However, the legislative response to this objection is found in the plain language of the provision itself: pursuant to La.

C.C.P. art. 971(F)(1)(a) and (b), reflects a clear choice by the legislature in these two provisions to define a \"public issue\" in terms of setting or context rather than content. Thus, under La. C.C.P. art. 971(F)(1)(a), it is the setting-in this case, a judicial proceeding-that makes the issue a public one. There is no additional requirement that the statement relate to an issue of public significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This is, incidentally, consistent with, and reflects the legislature recognizing the special protection that has been afforded statements made in the course of judicial proceedings. That protection is embodied in the qualified privilege that exists in Louisiana with respect to such speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also reflective of a legislative recognition that any matter pending before the judiciary possesses some measure of \"public significance\" owing to the public nature of judicial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thus, a plain reading of the language of La. C.C.P. art. 971(F)(1)(a) demonstrates that the article does not limit its application to the content or context of statements\n   made in the course of judicial proceedings, but applies to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Rules of Statutory Construction\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   My conclusion in this regard is buttressed by the rules of statutory construction. Louisiana C.C.P. art. 971(F)(1) lists four protected acts that are included within the definition of an \"[a]ct in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or Louisiana Constitution in connection with a public issue.\" In addition to the acts protected under La.

Believing that the legislature included the phrase in clauses (c) and (d) for some definite purpose, I cannot support an interpretation that would render that phrase meaningless when there is a reasonable interpretation of the language that would give it meaning.
