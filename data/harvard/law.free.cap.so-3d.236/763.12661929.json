C.C.P. art. 591.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 24, 2005, plaintiffs, Robert Harvey, Darleen Jacobs Levy, Susan Laurendine, and William Laurendine, filed\n   a claim for damages with a request for class action certification against the Board of Commissioners for the Orleans Levee District for the Parish of Orleans (the \"Levee District\"), asserting that the Levee District was negligent in its design and construction of flood walls along the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street and London Avenue Canals in Orleans Parish, which flood walls collapsed during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, resulting in damages to their respective properties located in Orleans Parish. Plaintiffs further asserted that \"the number of business and property owners affected by the negligence of the defendant are too numerous to mention and that this lawsuit should be certified as a class action for all residents, business owners, and occupants of the affected areas in the New Orleans area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 7, 2006, plaintiffs filed a First Supplemental and Amending Petition. Al LeBeouf, Aline Hodges, Pierre Ascani, Theresa Harvey, Dale Atkins and Anita L. Sarrat were added as plaintiffs, and Robert Harvey and Darlene Jacobs Levy were deleted as plaintiffs. Additional allegations of negligence were asserted against the Levee District. The next day, on June 8, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the action as a class action pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 592.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Second Supplemental and Amending Petition on July 10, 2006, adding as defendants the State of Louisiana, Department of Transportation and Development (the \"DOTD\"), and the Sewerage and Water Board for the Parish of Orleans (the \"SWB\"), asserting additional acts of negligence by these defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Case Management and Scheduling Order No. 1 signed by the trial court on December 23, 2013, the proposed class was defined by plaintiffs as follows: \"All residents, domiciliaries, property owners and business owners of the parishes of Orleans and Jefferson (limited to Hoey's Basin) in the State of Louisiana whose properties or businesses were damaged by flooding caused by the failure of the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street Canal and London Avenue Canal hurricane protection levees and floodwalls in New Orleans, Louisiana on or after August 29, 2005.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a lengthy procedural history that is largely irrelevant to the instant appeal, the trial court conducted a hearing on plaintiffs' motion to certify the class on November 10 and 14, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the close of plaintiffs' evidence, the trial court granted defendants' oral motion for involuntary dismissal and denied class certification, finding that plaintiffs had failed to produce evidence to support the requirements of commonality and typicality, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 591(A)(2) and (3), respectively, and superiority, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 591(B)(3). The trial court gave detailed oral reasons for its ruling. A written judgment to this effect was signed on November 22, 2016. Plaintiffs' appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial court procedurally erred in granting defendants' motion for involuntary dismissal, asserting that the class certification hearing was not a trial on the merits of the case. They also argue that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony and report of their expert engineer, James Phipps. Plaintiffs further argue that the trial court erred in finding that plaintiffs failed to prove commonality, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 591(A)(2), and superiority of\n   the class action suit, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 591(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The standard of review for class certification is bifurcated: factual findings are reviewed under the manifest error/clearly wrong standard, but the trial court's judgment on whether to certify the class is reviewed by the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Pollard v.

They argue that the motion for involuntary dismissal was procedurally improper in the current posture of the case, because the certification hearing was not a trial on the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Upon review, we find that plaintiffs' arguments in this assignment of error are without merit. La. C.C.P. art. 1672(B) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   In an action tried by the court without a jury, after the plaintiff has completed the presentation of his evidence, any party, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal of the action as to him on the ground that upon the facts and law, the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court may then determine the facts and render judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the moving party or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Article 1672(B), by its own terms, applies to \"an\n   <em>\n    action\n   </em>\n   tried by the court without a jury.\" (Emphasis added.) The Article, therefore, is not limited in application to a trial on the merits. The term \"action\" is broader than a trial, and includes a hearing on a motion to certify a class. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Ladieux v. Jefferson Parish Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 2\n   </em>\n   , 14-449 (La. App. 5 Cir. 11/25/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868081\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/165/109/#p110\">\n    165 So.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110, a motion for involuntary dismissal was granted by the trial court following the presentation of plaintiffs' evidence, denying class certification. Given that plaintiffs bore the burden of proof regarding class certification, we find no merit to plaintiffs' assertion that the use of this procedural device is inappropriate at a hearing for class certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Exclusion of expert testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony and report of James Phipps, a geotechnical engineer whom plaintiffs engaged to analyze the potential liability of the two remaining defendants in this case, the SWB and the DOTD. Plaintiffs argue that the trial court misapplied the standards of La. C.E. art. 702 by delving into the merits of the litigation as a whole, rather than the specific issue of whether plaintiffs bore their burden of proof to certify the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   La. C.E. art. 702 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (1) The expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (2) The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (3) The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (4) The expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In its ruling to exclude Mr. Phipps' testimony and report, the trial court found that subparagraphs (1) and (2) of Article 702 were not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Mr. Phipps testified that he was retained in 2014 by plaintiffs to consider the potential liability of the two remaining defendants, the SWB and the DOTD. He was offered as an expert geotechnical engineer, which he described as the application of engineering principals to the interaction of soils and structures. He testified that he had a masters degree in civil engineering, which focuses on design and building of large structures, which could include drainage systems, levees, and floodwalls. He was a licensed professional engineer in three states: Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. His job experience as a geotechnical engineer included designing and building high-rise buildings\n   with deep excavations, distress evaluations, evaluations of retaining walls, and the occasional damn or levee project. He had experience in soil sampling. He had previously been offered as an expert witness in foundation distress cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As preparation for testifying in this case, Mr. Phipps said that he visited the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal, along with the adjoining neighborhoods, in 2014, prior to the certification hearing, but conducted no inspections or testing of any kind at the sites. He also reviewed several comprehensive reports made by other entities regarding the flooding, as well as historical documents that chronicled various dredging projects on the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street Canal. These reports were referred to as IPET (Interagency Performance Evaluation Task Force), ILIT (Independent Levee Investigation Team), DOTD Team Louisiana, and the Delft University of Technology (Holland) reports. He also reviewed Corps of Engineer manuals regarding flood works and flood control projects, and the deposition of a SWB employee. Mr. Phipps prepared a report for this litigation, based on his review of the aforementioned materials provided by plaintiffs' counsel, before he visited New Orleans or saw the sites of the breaches. Between reviewing the background reports and writing his report, Mr. Phipps estimated that he spent approximately 20 hours of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On traversal, Mr. Phipps admitted that he had never designed a floodwall or a drainage canal. He also had never conducted a forensic analysis of levee, floodwall, or canal designs. He also had never conducted an engineering analysis of the design of a levee or floodwall. He also had never worked on a flood case prior to this one. Mr. Phipps admitted that he did not completely read the reports on which he relied (for instance, he testified that he read around 300 pages of the 8,000 page IPET report). Mr. Phipps acknowledged that he only considered the various reports and materials furnished to him by plaintiffs' counsel, and did not conduct any independent research into the failure of the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street or London Avenue Canals, or read any other reports about the flooding, after acknowledging that other reports existed. He agreed that 30-40 per cent of his expert report was in fact written by plaintiffs' counsel, specifically the historical text section of the report, and the footnotes citing legal cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Mr. Phipps agreed that in the 20 hours he spent on this report, he did not have time to read the entirety of any of the source reports furnished to him by plaintiffs' counsel. Mr. Phipps acknowledged that he did not visit any of plaintiffs' properties. He clarified that he was not a hydrologist, and had done no calculations or hydrology assessments to determine all of the sources of water that accumulated within three \"polders\" of New Orleans included in this putative class action: the Lakeview polder, the west Gentilly polder, and the east Gentilly polder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mr. Phipps stated, during traversal, that he was not charged with trying to determine why the levees failed, or to do exhaustive research. He also confirmed that he was asked to focus on the actions of the SWB and the DOTD leading up to the breach, but was not to consider the actions\n   of the Army Corps of Engineers, nor the Orleans Levee District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At the hearing, the trial court noted that this was not a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing. It considered Mr. Phipps' testimony only in the context of whether it would aid the court in determining whether to certify the proposed class and if it met the other criteria in Article 702. After considering Mr. Phipps' testimony at the hearing, the trial judge was careful to explain that while he recognized Mr. Phipps' educational qualifications, he found that Mr. Phipps' testimony and report would not be helpful to the court in determining whether to certify the class,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether plaintiffs had met the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, and identifiability. The court implicitly found that Mr. Phipps' testimony was not based on sufficient facts or data, given the limited scope of materials he consulted prior to making his report, and further that the testimony was not the product of reliable principles and methods, given the facts that Mr. Phipps considered only materials furnished to him by plaintiffs' counsel, which he did not thoroughly read, that he did not conduct any other research into the levee breaches, and that he spent a relatively scant amount of time reviewing the materials and formulating his report, considering the volume of materials provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After careful review of the record and the applicable law, we find no abuse of the trial court's discretion in excluding the testimony and report of Mr. Phipps at the class certification hearing. The trial court's assessment of the limited scope of Mr. Phipps' report is supported by the record. Further, given that limited scope, we find no abuse of the trial court's discretion in its conclusion that the testimony would not aid the court in determining the existence of the required factors for class certification found in Article 591(A). This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class certification: Commonality\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On the issue of class certification, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in finding that they failed to prove the \"commonality\" of plaintiffs' claims. La. C.C.P. art. 591(A)(2). They argue that they have established at least three undisputed common facts that exist within the putative class: that defendants had a duty (or duties) to build and/or maintain the levee walls (of the 17\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street and London Avenue Canals) properly; that the levee walls failed; and that every one of the members of the proposed class suffered direct and ascertainable damage to some degree as a result of the flooding. In brief, they contend that the commonality prerequisite is \"not high,\" citing federal Fifth Circuit cases from 1986 and earlier. Plaintiffs also note that the court certified the class in\n   <em>\n    Chicago Property Interests\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in which residents of Jefferson Parish sued governmental entities for flooding damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.

Martin\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court reversed the certification of a class. The mass tort that allegedly caused damages to the putative class involved emissions from an industrial plant into a neighborhood over a significant period of years. The Court found that the factual scenario did not meet the commonality requirement of \"only mass torts 'arising from a common cause or disaster' [being] appropriate for class certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Price v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027614\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/79/960/#p966\">\n    79 So.3d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the emissions came from one plant, the plant had at least three owners/operators over the time period in question, only two of which had been sued, thus making it extremely difficult to quantify each particular defendant's participation/fault. The Court found that the evidence showed that the issue of breach would turn on different conduct, by different defendants, at different times, under different legal standards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027614\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/79/960/#p966\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027614\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/79/960/#p966\">\n    at 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The instant matter shows similar parallels. Though the damages in question were alleged to have been caused by the failure of the flood walls following Hurricane Katrina, the evidence presented at the certification hearing shows two defendants along with at least two other actors whose fault must be considered, and the failure of floodwalls on two canals caused by different conduct by multiple actors, occurring at different times. Further, it was shown that flooding in the three polders in question was possibly caused by different sources, including but not limited to floodwall breach, floodwall overtopping, and accumulated\n   rainfall, that varied depending on the particular location within each polder and the particularities of each property, making it difficult if not impossible to quantify each actor's contribution to the flooding at any particular property. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Price v. Martin\n   </em>\n   , the flooding damages of each property will not turn on common evidence, but rather on a myriad of property-specific facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   case involved flooding damages against multiple defendants following a heavy rain event. The class sought to be certified included three different \"basins;\" however, the testimony at the certification hearing showed that the predominate cause of the flooding varied from basin to basin, and that secondary causes of flooding damages would vary depending on specific property conditions such as elevation. The Supreme Court affirmed the court of appeal's decertification of the class originally granted by the trial court, observing that \"the cause of flooding must be the same for each member of the class, and if there is more than one cause of flooding, each of these causes must be the same for each class member. This is difficult in a mass tort case involving more than one defendant, more than one cause, and more than one theory of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Brooks v. Union Pacific Railroad Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059071\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/546/#p554\">\n    13 So.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though it applied the version of La. C.C.P. art. 591 as it read prior to the 1997 revision thereof, the case remains instructive for the applicability of the class action procedural device to mass torts.\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   held that mass torts may only be brought as a class action if they arose from a common cause or disaster, based on the fact that causation is an essential part of the liability determination, and if causation differed for each plaintiff, individual trials would be required which would defeat the purpose of the class action device.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059071\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/546/#p554\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059071\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/546/#p554\">\n    at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Chicago Property Interests\n   </em>\n   as supportive of class certification, because that case allowed the certification of a class of property owners who suffered flooding damages in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in Jefferson Parish, finding commonality. However, that case is clearly distinguishable from the instant case because the evidence in\n   <em>\n    Chicago Property Interests\n   </em>\n   showed that the flooding arose from the same set of operative facts and related to all class members: the shutting off of drainage pumps in Jefferson Parish during the hurricane and its immediate aftermath, allegedly stemming from a plan or policy promulgated by Jefferson Parish.\n   <em>\n    Chicago Property Interests, LLC v. Broussard\n   </em>\n   , 11-0788 at p. 18. In the instant case, the evidence showed that the causes of flooding varied throughout the geographical area and thus were not common to all plaintiffs, as in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chicago Property Interests\n   </em>\n   . Thus, though the two cases both involved flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Chicago Property Interests\n   </em>\n   met the required burden of proving commonality, whereas plaintiffs in this case did not. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Class certification: Superiority\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On the issue of class certification, the trial court also found that La.

Plaintiffs argue in brief that the court erred because \"aggrieved persons may be without effective means of redress absent the class action device\" and that \"the alternatives, (including joinder, intervention, consolidation, and the use of a test case), do not sufficiently protect the legal rights of the aggrieved parties,\" yet such statements are conclusions without supporting evidence. As such, plaintiffs have failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in so finding.

C.C.P. art. 591(A)(3) was not met, but plaintiffs do not brief this on appeal. As previously noted, the trial court must find that plaintiff proved\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the requirements of Article 591(A), including typicality.
