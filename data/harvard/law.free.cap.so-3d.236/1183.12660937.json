We grant the motion for rehearing and the motion to certify. We withdraw the previous opinion and substitute the following in its stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This certiorari proceeding concerns the proper methodology to determine the application of the deductible authorized under section 627.739(2), Florida Statutes (2014), when personal injury protection (\"PIP\") benefits are sought by an insured. The decision we review (rendered by the circuit court in its appellate capacity) provides that, when calculating the amount of PIP benefits due to the insured, section 627.739(2) requires the deductible to be subtracted from the total medical care charges before applying the statutory reimbursement limitations provided in section 627.736(5)(a)1.b., Florida Statutes (2014). The respondent, Florida Hospital Medical Center, contends that the court applied the correct law in utilizing this methodology. Progressive argues that the statutory limitations must be applied first and the deductible subtracted from that amount. The issue is thus framed, and we must decide whether the circuit court properly interpreted the pertinent statutory provisions and applied the correct methodology. This issue has generated numerous conflicting decisions by the county and circuit courts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   so we issue this opinion to provide precedent and a basis of continuity\n   for future trial court rulings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla.

It is enough to say that after the insured, Jonathan Parent, was involved in an automobile accident, he incurred bills for the medical care he received from Florida Hospital. Those bills exceeded the deductible amount of $1000 provided in the insurance policy issued by Progressive. As is typical in these cases, Parent assigned his PIP benefits under the policy to Florida Hospital (hence the designation \"a/a/o\" in the caption, which means \"as assignee of\"). The bill Florida Hospital sent to Progressive for Parent's treatment calculated the amount owed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-14\">$2,781.00 Total hospital charge - $1,000.00 Parent's PIP deductible _________ $1,781.00 \u00d7 75% Applying section 627.736(5)(a)1.b. _________ $1,335.75 \u00d7 80% Applying section 627.736(5)(a)1. _________ $1,068.60 Amount Due</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Progressive remitted payment, but it used a different payment methodology when applying section 627.736(5)(a)1.b.'s reimbursement limitation provision:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-16\">$2,781.00 Total hospital charge \u00d7 75% Applying section 627.736(5)(a)1.b. _________ $2,085.75 - $1,000.00 Parent's PIP deductible _________ $1,085.75 \u00d7 80% Applying section 627.736(5)(a)1. _________ $ 868.60 Amount Due</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Florida Hospital thereafter filed suit against Progressive in the county court seeking the $200 difference between what it calculated the PIP benefit amount to be and what Progressive paid. After Progressive filed an answer denying liability and asserting affirmative defenses, both parties filed motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The county court entered a final summary judgment in favor of Florida Hospital in the amount of $200, plus interest, thus adopting Florida Hospital's argument that the plain language of section 627.739(2) required Progressive to subtract Parent's deductible from Florida Hospital's total charges before applying section 627.736(5)(a)1.b.'s reimbursement limitation. Progressive appealed, and the circuit court affirmed the county court's judgment. This certiorari proceeding followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before continuing further, it is necessary to note the limitations of our review. Second-tier certiorari review is limited to determining whether the circuit court: (1) accorded procedural due process and (2) applied the correct law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Dep't of High.

The deductible amount\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be applied to\n   <em>\n    100 percent\n   </em>\n   of the\n   <em>\n    expenses and losses described\n   </em>\n   in s. 627.736.\n   <em>\n    After\n   </em>\n   the deductible is met, each insured is eligible to receive up to $10,000 in total\n   <em>\n    benefits\n   </em>\n   described in s. 627.736(1). However, this subsection shall not be applied to reduce the amount of any benefits received in accordance with s. 627.736(1)(c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a7 627.739(2), Fla. Stat. (2014) (emphasis added). This statute distinguishes between \"expenses and losses\" and \"benefits.\" The second sentence states that the deductible \"must be applied to 100 percent of the expenses and losses.\" In the very next sentence, the statute provides that \"[a]fter the deductible is met, each insured is eligible to receive up to $10,000 in total benefits.\" Thus, the statute indicates that the deductible applies to \"100 percent of the expenses and losses\" whereas \"benefits\" refers to the calculated amount\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the deductible has been applied to the total expenses and losses and after application of the statutory reimbursement limitations found in section 627.736.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Expenses and losses\" are not defined in the statute, but they are described in section 627.736(1). Section 627.736(1)(a) specifically provides that the insured may be entitled to \"[e]ighty percent of all reasonable\n   <em>\n    expenses\n   </em>\n   for medically necessary medical, surgical, X-ray, dental, and rehabilitative services.\" \u00a7 627.736(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2014) (emphasis added). Similarly, section 627.736(1)(b) refers to \"[s]ixty percent of any\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   of gross income and\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   of earning capacity\" and \"all\n   <em>\n    expenses\n   </em>\n   reasonably incurred in obtaining from others ordinary and necessary services\" associated with the disability of an insured. \u00a7 627.736(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2014) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In addition to describing expenses and losses, section 627.736(1) also describes benefits and establishes separate methodologies (80% reimbursement limitation for medical expenses and 60% reimbursement limitation for disability expenses and losses) for calculating how much of the expenses and losses will be paid as benefits. On the other hand, section 627.739 requires that the deductible must be applied to \"100 percent of the expenses and losses.\" In other words, the 80% and 60% methodologies in section 627.736(1) are intended to limit reimbursements in order to establish benefits. They are not intended to describe the application of the deductible under the 100% methodology provided in section 627.739(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Specifically, Progressive contends that the reimbursement limitations contained in section 627.736(5)(a) 1.b. should be applied to reduce the expenses and losses and that the deductible should be subtracted from that reduced amount to arrive at the benefit amount owed to the insured. We disagree because, using that methodology, the deductible is not being applied toward 100% of the expenses and losses as required by section 627.739(2). Section 627.736(5)(a) 1. provides the insurer with an option to determine benefits pursuant to a schedule of reimbursement limitations. This statutory provision is part of legislative amendments enacted in 2008. It states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1. The insurer\n   <em>\n    may limit reimbursement\n   </em>\n   to 80 percent of the following schedule of maximum charges:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   b.

(1999) (emphasis added).

In response to\n   <em>\n    Govan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Arnone\n   </em>\n   , the Florida Legislature in 2003 amended section 627.739(2) to require:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) ... The deductible amount must be applied to 100 percent of the expenses and losses described in s. 627.736.

Thus, the current version of the statute provides a clear distinction between \"expenses and losses\" for purposes of applying the deductible and \"benefits\" that are due to the insured after the reimbursement limitations are applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The legislative amendment in 2003 constituted a substantive change in the sequence of applying the deductible in PIP cases. The Legislature, by requiring that the deductible be applied to 100% of the expenses and losses, abandoned the previous methodology of subtracting the deductible from the benefits due under the policy after applying the reimbursement limitations. Despite this legislative change in 2003, Progressive and the dissent argue that the methodology advanced in the previous version of section 627.739 (as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Govan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Arnone\n   </em>\n   ) should continue to be applied by the courts under the current version of the statute. We do not believe that the Legislature would find it necessary to amend the statute as it did in 2003 if, as Progressive and the dissent essentially argue, there was to be no change in the methodology. As we have previously indicated, the Legislature does not intend to enact useless legislation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.

The reasonableness of the medical bills for services rendered to Parent in the instant case is not an issue raised by any party in these proceedings. Indeed, Progressive stated in its petition for writ of certiorari that \"the point of contention in this case is whether the deductible applies to a charge before the charge is limited by the 75% payment limitation provided by Florida Statute \u00a7 627.736(5)(a) 1.b, or after the charge is limited by the 75% payment limitation.\" In any event, we reject this argument for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, it overlooks the distinctions between a deductible and a statutory reimbursement limitation, and it disregards the reason the Legislature approved the applicable provisions. The deductible provisions of section 627.739(2) were enacted to allow for reductions in the amount of the premiums charged by the insurer and to determine the amount of risk through self-insurance the insured has agreed to assume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercury Ins. of Fla. v.

As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Mercury Insurance\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he meeting of the contracted-for deductible unlocks the insured's right to access his/her $10,000 in PIP benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6768162\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/661/#p667\">\n    182 So.3d at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   This interpretation is consistent with the recognized purpose of a deductible.

In effect, the insured agrees to \"self-insure\" for the deductible amount. Where an accident occurs, the insured (not the insurer) becomes responsible for payment of claims that are otherwise impacted by the deductible amount in the insurance policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7537252\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/552/908/#p911\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We do not believe that the Legislature intended the statutory reimbursement limitations to be applied to expenses and losses that fall within the insured's deductible, which the insured alone is obligated to pay and which are not recoverable as benefits under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the insured certainly has the right to contest any bill that the insured is required to pay to meet the deductible. The Legislature has provided that an \"insured is not required to pay a claim or charges ... [t]o any person who knowingly submits a false or misleading statement relating to the claim or charges.\" \u00a7 627.736(5)(b) 1., Fla. Stat. (2014). Moreover, medical care providers are prohibited from rendering any bill for services that is false or fraudulent, and those that do may suffer severe criminal and civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 817.234(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2014). Section 817.234 also prohibits a medical care provider from rendering a bill it does not intend to collect from the insured in order to meet the deductible amount and trigger coverage under the policy. \u00a7 817.234(7)(a), Fla. Stat. (2014) (\"It shall constitute a material omission and insurance fraud ... for any service provider, other than a hospital, to engage in a general business practice of billing amounts as its usual and customary charge, if such provider has agreed with the insured or intends to waive deductibles or copayments, or does not for any other reason intend to collect the total amount of such charge.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Third, it bears repeating that the provisions of the No-Fault Law must be construed in favor of the insured. Interpreting the pertinent statutory provisions in a manner that supports the methodology urged by Progressive and the dissent would not further the principle of providing broad PIP coverage to the insured. Rather, as established by the calculation made by Progressive in its benefits payment (which is discussed at the beginning of this opinion), that interpretation would\n   allow the insurer to pay less in benefits than would otherwise be due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, the dissent bases its argument on a quote from the decision in\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   , 23 Fla. L. Weekly Supp. at 708a. The quote states that several sections in 627.736, which are specifically cited by the\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   court, refer to expenses \"covered by the policy.\" We believe this decision is flawed because not one of the provisions of section 627.736 cited by the court in\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   contains the language \"covered by the policy.\" In any event, there are an equal number of circuit court opinions that reach the opposite result, and we believe they are the better reasoned decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We conclude that application of the methodology advanced by Progressive and the dissent would require that we revert to the provisions of section 627.739(2) that were in effect before the 2003 amendment. It is not for this court to pick and choose which version of the statute to apply; we must apply the law as it currently exists. Section 627.739(2) currently requires that the deductible be applied to 100% of the expenses and losses, and that is the version the circuit court properly applied. We see no divergence from the correct law in the circuit court's decision, and we see no violation of a clearly established principle of law that results in a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, we deny the petition for writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We certify the following question to the Florida Supreme Court as a matter of great public importance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   WHEN CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF PIP BENEFITS DUE AN INSURED, DOES SECTION 627.739(2), FLORIDA STATUTES, REQUIRE THAT THE DEDUCTIBLE BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MEDICAL CHARGES BEFORE APPLYING THE REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATION UNDER SECTION 627.736(5)(a) 1.b., OR MUST THE REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATION BE APPLIED FIRST AND THE DEDUCTIBLE SUBTRACTED FROM THE REMAINING AMOUNT?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   PETITION DENIED and QUESTION CERTIFIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   EDWARDS, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   PALMER, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part, with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Progressive Select Ins. v.

This provision has the effect of requiring PIP to pay more in benefits than it does now if a deductible is elected.
