Memorandum: We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the credible evidence fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt defendant\u2019s guilt of second degree burglary and third degree robbery. With respect to the burglary conviction, the jury was entitled to credit the testimony of complainant that defendant had no license or privilege to enter her apartment <em>(see, People v Graves, </em>76 NY2d 16, 20). With respect to the robbery conviction, the proof establishes that defendant exercised \"dominion and control [over complainant\u2019s identification cards] wholly inconsistent with the continued rights of the owner\u201d <em>(People v Olivo, </em>52 NY2d 309, 318). Defendant\u2019s contention concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the court\u2019s charge is unpreserved and we decline to reach it in the interest of justice <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [6]). We find defendant\u2019s sentence neither harsh nor excessive. (Appeal from Judgment of Erie County Court, D\u2019Amico, J. \u2014 Burglary, 2nd Degree.) Present \u2014 Pine, J.
