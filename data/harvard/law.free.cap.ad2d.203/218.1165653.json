The plaintiff moved for a protective order and the defendant cross-moved to compel the plaintiff to produce the documents. The court granted the plaintiffs motion and denied the cross motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that tax returns should be discoverable in all actions to recover under a business interruption policy is without merit. Courts do not favor disclosure of income tax returns without some showing that the particular information in tax returns has some specific application to the case or that other sources of information are likely to be inaccessible or unproductive <em>(see, Mayo, Lynch &amp; Assocs. v Fine, </em>123 AD2d 607; <em>Glenmark, Inc. v Carity, </em>22 AD2d 680; 3 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 3101.10).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Sullivan, J. P., Lawrence, Pizzuto, Joy and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
