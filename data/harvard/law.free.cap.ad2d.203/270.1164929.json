A <em>Yellowstone </em>injunction <em>(see, First Natl. Stores v Yellowstone Shopping Ctr., </em>21 NY2d 630) was specifically requested in their reply. Moreover, the court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in denying the motion. The motion was untimely, since the plaintiffs did not move for injunctive relief until after the expiration of the cure period specified in the defendants\u2019 notice to cure, and after the termination notice had been served <em>(see, Ritz Entertainment Org. v Unity Gallega, </em>166 AD2d 186). Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate their willingness to cure their default short of vacating the premises <em>(see, Linmont Realty v Vitocarl, Inc., </em>147 AD2d 618, 620). There is no indication that the plaintiffs were willing to seek a use variance. Nor did they attempt to compel the defendants to do so. Instead, the plaintiffs commenced the present action to, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>alia, </em>rescind the commercial lease. Therefore, the record establishes that the plaintiffs seek to discharge their default by rescinding the lease and not to reform the lease or cure the default and occupy the leased premises.</p><p id=\"b309-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions are unpreserved for appellate review. Rosenblatt, J. P., Lawrence, Altman and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
