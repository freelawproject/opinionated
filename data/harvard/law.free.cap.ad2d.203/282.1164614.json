The appellant then failed to come forward with evidence to demonstrate otherwise <em>(see, Matter of Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v McMichael, </em>176 AD2d 315; <em>Matter of Nationwide Ins. Co. [Dye </em>\u2014 Metro. <em>Prop. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co.], </em>170 AD2d 683; <em>Matter of Insurance Co. v Castro, </em>163 AD2d 313; <em>Matter of Insurance Co. v Castillo, </em>158 AD2d 691). The appellant\u2019s contention that the court improperly excluded certain evidence is without merit. Bracken, J. P., Miller, Santucci and Altman, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
