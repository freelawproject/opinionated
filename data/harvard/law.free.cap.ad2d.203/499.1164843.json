However, the defendant did not move to withdraw his plea of guilty on this ground <em>(see, People v Bell, </em>47 NY2d 839; <em>People v Willingham, </em>194 AD2d 703; <em>People v Rhodes, </em>176 AD2d 828). Therefore, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.</p><p id=\"b537-8\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Thompson, J. P., Rosenblatt, Ritter, Friedmann and Krausman, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
