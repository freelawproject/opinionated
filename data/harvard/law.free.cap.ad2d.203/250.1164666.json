Throughout their marriage both parties worked, demonstrating nearly equal earning power. The defendant was, however, unemployed for periods during the duration of the marriage. After living together for years in an atmosphere of alienation and acrimony, in September 1987 the plaintiff filed for divorce.</p><p id=\"b289-7\">The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s granting of a judgment of divorce to the plaintiff on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment on both procedural and substantive grounds. His argument that the trial court improperly considered acts of violence allegedly committed by him against his wife more than five years prior to the commencement of the action is without merit. The court\u2019s decision was not based on any acts of violence committed prior to the five-year period. On the merits, the evidence adduced at trial established that the defendant\u2019s behavior, including his physical and verbal abuse of the plaintiff and his flagrant involvement in a long-term extramarital relationship, so endangered the plaintiff\u2019s mental well-being as to render it unsafe or improper for cohabitation to continue <em>(see, </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 170 [1]; <em>Hird v Hird, </em>170 AD2d 1049; <em>Barry v Barry, </em>93 AD2d 797).</p><p id=\"b289-8\">On the issue of custody, there was no question as to each parent\u2019s fitness. A court-appointed psychiatrist described the parties as loving and \"highly devoted parents\u201d, who laudably insulated their children from their \"chronic\u201d acrimony, and the court concurred in this conclusion. The children themselves, who were 16 and 13 years of age, respectively, at the time of trial, expressed a preference to remain with their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>mother. \"While the express wishes of children are not controlling, they are entitled to great weight, particularly where their age and maturity would make their input particularly meaningful\u201d <em>(Koppenhoefer v Koppenhoefer, </em>159 AD2d 113, 117; <em>see, Bergson v Bergson, </em>68 AD2d 931, 932). Under the circumstances, the court\u2019s award of custody to the plaintiff was appropriate.</p><p id=\"b290-4\">The Supreme Court\u2019s granting of the wife\u2019s application for counsel fees was an improvident exercise of discretion. Although the matter of counsel fees is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, it is \"nonetheless to be controlled by the equities of the case and the financial circumstances of the parties\u201d <em>(Maimon v Maimon, </em>178 AD2d 635; <em>see, </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 [b]; <em>Matter of O\u2019Neil v O\u2019Neil, </em>193 AD2d 16, 20). Where, as here, neither party has assets greater than, nor earning power far superior to, the other, and the defendant, in fact, was unemployed and in substantial debt at the time of trial, the award was inappropriate <em>(see, Maimon v Maimon, supra; Pontorno v Pontorno, </em>172 AD2d 734).</p><p id=\"b290-5\">The defendant\u2019s other contentions do not warrant further modification of the judgment. Thompson, J. P., Pizzuto, Santucci and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
