Defendant Sony USA is the successor in interest to the original landlord of the lease and is the net lessee of the entire building. The complaint alleges violations of the lease resulting from extensive renovations being performed by Sony to the arcade space. The Motion Court, on an application for a preliminary injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>tion, enjoined defendants from interfering with plaintiffs access to the kiosks, enjoined defendants from demolishing the kiosks without plaintiffs consent, required defendants to post a two million dollar bond prior to commencing the renovation work, and required defendants to make interim payments to plaintiff representing the diminution of gross receipts as compared to the same month in 1990. We hold that the foregoing injunctive relief constitutes an abuse of discretion and that plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">We are satisfied that the renovation work being performed is authorized by the unambiguous terms of the lease. Therefore, we grant summary judgment to defendants only to the extent of dismissing the fourth cause of action which seeks a permanent injunction. Triable issues of fact are presented as to the first three causes of action. Concur \u2014 Murphy, P. J., Sullivan, Rosenberger and Wallach, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
