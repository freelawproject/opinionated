But the court charged the jury, that if the defendant, when she delivered the money to <em>O </em>to he by him given to <em>A, </em>knew that it had been stolen, then such delivery was a tortious conversion by her; but that a suspicion on her part, even if founded on reasonable or probable cause, that the \u2018 money had been stolen by <em>A, </em>was not sufficient to render her liable to the plaintiff by the delivery of the money to <em>G </em>for <em>A; </em>that such delivery would not he a conversion.

Soon after, and on the same morning, Billy with Jenkins left her house, with the avowed intention of going to Birmingham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>on business. On the afternoon of the same day, and before their return, the defendant, Hayes, was informed by some lads \u201c that the officers were looking after Billy,\u201d but was not informed for what purpose. Jenkins soon returned, and she thereupon immediately gave the money to him, with directions to return it' to Billy, and he forthwith left for that purpose. Soon after, Billy came and requested his money, but upon being informed of what had been done immediately left. Mrs. Hayes had never used the money, or received any benefit from it, and during all the time it was in her hands had no knowledge that it was stolen. There was no evidence that the money was ever returned by Jenkins to Billy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">The plaintiff claimed from all the evidence that the circumstances connected with the delivery of the money to Mrs. Hayes were suspicious, and thereupon requested the court to charge the jury, that \u201c if the defendant, Hayes, when she received the money, or at any time before she delivered it to Jenkins, had reasonable or probable cause to believe either that it was stolen, or that Billy came improperly or dishonestly by it, or that it did not honestly belong to him, then she was guilty of a tortious conversion, and is liable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">The court did not so charge the jury, but charged them that \u201c if Mrs. Hayes, when she delivered the money to Jenkins to be by him given to Lake, knew that it had been stolen, then such delivery was a tortious conversion on her part, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover its value from her in this action; but a suspicion on her part, even if founded on reasonable or probable cause, that the money had been stolen by Lake, is not sufficient to render her liable to the plaintiff by the delivery of the money to Jenkins for Lake; such delivery would not be a conversion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">The defendants offered in evidence the deposition of the defendant, Hayes, in which she testified that when Lake gave her the money,-her daughter and son-in-law, Jenkins, counted it, and then added the remark that \u201c they always attended to her business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-8\">From this, which was all the evidence upon the point, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>plaintiff claimed, and requested the court so to charge the jury, that Jenkins was the general agent of the defendant, Hayes, and that she was justly chargeable with his knowledge and acts in respect to the money; that if he knew it was stolen before he delivered it to Lake, the defendant, Hayes, would be equally liable with himself, and equally so for- any other conversion or use of the money, or failure to deliver it to the plaintiff on demand; and that if Jenkins knew when he took the money of the defendant, Hayes, that it was stolen, his knowledge was her knowledge, and she was legally chargeable with it, inasmuch as he was, and was acting; as, her agent throughout the whole transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">On this part of the case the court charged the jury as follows : \u201c If Jenkins was the general agent of the defendant, Hayes, and you so find from the testimony, and shall further find that Hayes put this money into the hands. of Jenkins with special directions to deliver it to Lake, then Jenkins is in this case only her agent for that purpose, and even if Jenkins knew that the money had been stolen from the plaintiff by Lake, Mrs. Hayes is not chargeable with such knowledge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, Hayes, and the plaintiff moved for a new trial for error in the charge, and for a refusal to charge as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-7\"><em>White </em>and <em>Sanford, </em>in support of the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU69\">cited 1 Swift Dig., 536; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>55 Maine, 147; <em>Vining </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>53 id., 544; <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Kidder, </em>54 id., 189; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>5 Coldw.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0l\">The defendant, Hayes, was a mere depositary of Lake, and returned the money to her bailor without knowledge that it was not his, and there was no demand and refusal. The plaintiff must therefore rely on a re-delivery, <em>tortious </em>in its nature as to him. He claimed in his first request as to the charge, that a re-delivery of property to the bailor by such a bailee, having \u201c reasonable or probable cause to believe either that it was stolen, or that he came improperly or dishonestly by it, or that it did not belong to him,\u201d is a <em>tortious </em>conversion in respect to a then unknown owner. There is no such doctrine in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">None of the cases cited sustain the proposition. Those from Swift were actions <em>between bailor and bailee, </em>where there had been a wrongful delivery to a <em>third person, </em>or a wrongful <em>use, </em>or wrongful <em>appropriation </em>of the property. Of the same character was <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Bull, 1 </em>Cow., 322, <em>Syeds </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>4 T. R., 260, and the cases cited from 4 Bingham. <em>McCombie </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>6 East, 538, was a case of wrongful detention, without re-delivery to the bailor, by a pawnee of property wrongfully pawned by <em>an agent. Thorp </em>v. <em>Burling, </em>11 Johns., 285, was a case of wrongful <em>taking </em>from the agent of the owner. Upon a question whether the cartman employed by the defendants was liable as a co-trespasser, it was holden that he was, as he was in no sense a public officer, and there were suspicious circumstances to put him on inquiry. But that cartman was a <em>servant </em>of the wrongful takers, and not a bailee. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Peacock, </em>3 Bing., 406, was trover by the owner of a stolen bank note against a <em>purchaser </em>from the thief, under suspicious circumstances, who had appropriated it to his own use, and refused to deliver it up\u2014a very different case from this. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>19 Conn., 319, was a case of tortious <em>talcing </em>and tortious <em>appropriation </em>both. None of these or the other cited cases are in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">On the other hand, there are authorities to the effect that to constitute a conversion in such case, there must be a wrongful intention to aid in depriving the owner of his property, and that re-delivery to the bailor, even with knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the property was stolen, but without such wrongful intention, will not be a conversion. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Lillystone, </em>8 Exch., 442; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>3 Allen, 575; <em>Polley </em>v. <em>Lenox Iron Works, </em>2 id., 182, and cases cited; <em>Fouldes </em>v. Willoughby, 8 M. &amp; <em>W., </em>540. The charge on this point was favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The charge of the court in relation to agency was unexceptionable. It did not appear that the defendant, Hayes, carried on a general business as depositary, or that Jenkins was her general agent in that or any other business. If he was, the charge was not objectionable. In relation to the re-delivery of the money in question, Jenkins was a special agent, if agent at all, and the defendant, was not chargeable with any knowledge Jenkins might have possessed. Moreover, the plaintiff had not shown, nor was there any evidence in the case tending to show, that Jenkins had any such knowledge. The claim was therefore hypothetical, and nedd not have been noticed, and the charge, if wrong, did not prejudice the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">A new trial is not advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In this opinion the other judges concui\u2019red; except Granger, J., who did not sit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
