Mello, was a partner with Michael W. Costa in the business of Pine Grove Auto Sales when that enterprise sold a Jaguar motor vehicle to the plaintiff, Kathleen F. Liarikos. The jury also found that Costa or Mello violated an express warranty to the plaintiff with respect to the odometer reading on the Jaguar at the time of the sale, and that Costa or Mello deceived and committed a fraud on the plaintiff. In addition, the jury found that the plaintiff made an effective revocation of the acceptance of the Jaguar to Pine Grove Auto Sales after discovery of the odometer change, and they assessed damages in the sum of $31,150. A judgment for that sum plus interest was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The trial also dealt with the plaintiff\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 9 (1992 ed.). That claim was tried in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement that the jury\u2019s verdict would be advisory in nature and the judge would reserve final judgment on that claim. In deciding the c. 93A claim, the judge adopted the jury\u2019s determination that a partnership existed between Mello and Michael Costa<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that they had committed an unfair or deceptive act in violation of c. 93A. The judge rejected the jury\u2019s finding that the partners had acted wilfully or knowingly. He also expressly found that Mello had not committed any of the unfair acts, but held him liable for Costa\u2019s acts as Costa\u2019s partner in the enterprise known as Pine Grove Auto Sales. A separate judgment on the c. 93A claim was entered limiting the plaintiff\u2019s recovery to her attorney\u2019s fees and costs and ordering the plaintiff to continue to make the automobile available to Mello for repossession by Mello pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s rejection of the vehicle. The defendant appeals from both judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Mello appealed to the Appeals Court, challenging the admission in evidence of financial statements made by him in 1990 and 1991, the judge\u2019s finding on the c. 93A claim that a partnership existed between Costa and Mello, and the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury that continued use of an automobile may be consistent with a valid revocation of acceptance if special circumstances' exist. We transferred the case here on our own initiative. We conclude that the judge properly admitted the financial records, that the instruction on continued use was correct, and that the judge\u2019s finding that a partnership existed was warranted by the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The dispute that led to the litigation arose from the plaintiff\u2019s, Kathleen F. Liarikos, purchase of a 1984 Jaguar XJS automobile from Pine Grove Auto Sales in 1988. The plaintiff dealt almost exclusively with Michael Costa in regard to the purchase, although she asserted that Mello had made representations regarding the vehicle\u2019s low mileage. After experiencing various mechanical problems with the automobile, the plaintiff discovered in 1990 that the vehicle\u2019s odometer had been turned back. She sent a c. 93A demand letter to Pine Grove Auto Sales to which neither Mello nor Costa responded. The plaintiff asserts, and the defendant appears to agree, that the demand also served as the plaintiff\u2019s revocation of acceptance of the vehicle. The plaintiff continued to use the vehicle after the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The judge found that Mello did not personally engage in any unfair or deceptive act or practice. Therefore, Mello\u2019s liability, if any, must be based on his status as a partner with Costa, in 1988, in the Pine Grove Auto Sales enterprise. In order to prove the existence of the 1988 partnership, the plaintiff introduced in evidence records consisting of financial statements that had been prepared by Mello in 1990 and 1991. In the financial statements, Mello listed the inventory of Pine Grove Auto Sales as a personal asset. He also listed a fifty percent interest in \u201cPine Grove Auto\u201d in the \u201cBusiness Ventures\u201d schedule of the 1990 statement. Mello objected at trial to the introduction of those documents, arguing that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>because they were prepared in and for 1990 and 1991, they are not relevant to his status as a partner with Costa in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Proffered evidence is relevant if it \u201crender [s] the desired inference more probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>369 Mass. 47, 59 (1975). In this case, the financial statements, while not themselves sufficient to prove the existence of a partnership in 1988, are relevant when viewed in conjunction with the testimony of three witnesses that Mello had held himself out and acted as a partner in Pine Grove Auto Sales prior to and during 1988. Relevant evidence need not bear directly on the ultimate fact; it is sufficient if it constitutes a link in the chain of proof. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>257 Mass. 426, 428 (1926). \u201cWe accord the judge substantial discretion in deciding whether evidence is relevant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>392 Mass. 604, 613 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Mello challenges the judge\u2019s finding that a partnership existed between Costa and himself for the purpose of the c. 93A ruling. He reasons that the jury\u2019s advisory opinion was reached in part due to their consideration of what he characterizes as erroneously admitted financial statements. He argues that because the judge\u2019s finding was derived from the jury\u2019s advisory opinion it is infected by the erroneous admission of the financial statements in evidence. Because we hold that the financial statements were properly admitted, Mello\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The final issue argued by Mello raises a question not previously addressed by this court. In instructing the jury, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">\u201c[T]he general rule of law is that a continued use after rejection does not permit this remedy of rescission or rejection unless there are some special circumstances that you as the jurors may consider for whatever considerations you want to give to them; whether or not there was any conduct by the plaintiff, in other words, incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sistent with her intent to reject it after she rejected it and if she did reject it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Mello claims that this instruction was in error because continued use after revocation, if unexplained, constitutes an acceptance. Mello contends that only assurances of repair by the seller or an intent on the buyer\u2019s part to preserve the goods may explain continued use after revocation. After approximately one hour of deliberation, the jury asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cIn reference to Question No. 5 [which read \u2018did the plaintiff make an effective revocation of the acceptance of the Jaguar to Pine Grove Auto Sales after discovery of the odometer change\u2019] if the demand letter has been presented to the defendant and no response has been made to the demand can the plaintiff continue to use the vehicle until some resolution has been made to the demand?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In response to the question, the judge replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cPersons such as the plaintiff cannot continue to accept the vehicle and reject it at the same time. You cannot accept it and also reject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cConsistent[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] use after rejection of a motor vehicle or after being offered back to a dealer may be construed as continued acceptance unless the jury finds that there have been some special circumstances by reason of its continued use not inconsistent with rejection, but she must hold it in her possession with reasonable care after there has been a valid rejection, assuming there has been, so as to permit its availability to the seller to get possession of it; and consistent use may or may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>in conformity with that obligation, depending upon how the jury resolves the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Mello objected again on the grounds that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d are not an accepted explanation for continued use and that there was no evidence of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The judge\u2019s instruction and answer to the jury\u2019s question, although not as full as they might have been, were not erroneous. A buyer who has validly rejected goods or revoked acceptance has a duty to treat the goods in a manner not inconsistent with the seller\u2019s ownership. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 2-602 (2) (a) &amp; 2-608 (3) (1992 ed.). In interpreting identical provisions, a few courts have held that the continued use of an automobile after a valid revocation operates as a second or continuing acceptance, thereby invalidating the revocation. See, e.g., <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Prenger, 717 </em>S.W.2d 242, 244 (Mo. Ct. App. 1986) (\u201cappellants continued to use the automobile as their own and not in a manner compatible with the attempted rescission . . . [t]he effect was to nullify the prior revocation of acceptance\u201d); <em>Wendt </em>v. <em>Beardmore Suburban Chevrolet, Inc., 219 </em>Neb. 775, 780 (1985) (\u201cLogically; then, the Code requires that Plaintiffs\u2019 continued use of the automobile after their attempted rejection invalidates the revocation of acceptance,\u201d quoting <em>Waltz </em>v. <em>Chevrolet Motor Div., </em>307 A.2d 815, 816 [Del. Super. Ct. 1973]). Other courts have held, however, that \u201c[a] blanket rule prohibiting a revoking buyer from continuing to use the goods would contravene the code\u2019s rule of reasonableness and its underlying purpose of modernizing commercial transactions.\u201d <em>Johannsen </em>v. <em>Minnesota Valley Ford Tractor Co., </em>304 N.W.2d 654, 658 (Minn. 1981). In reaching this conclusion, these courts \u201cemphasize the practical consideration that an individual who buys an automobile . . . may very well be unable, without extraordinary financial difficulty, to tender the automobile . . . and. do without it until the litigation concerning it is complete.\u201d <em>Ex parte Stem, </em>571 So. 2d 1112, 1114 (Ala. 1990). We find this reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The continued reasonable use of an automobile should not as a matter of law prevent the buyer from revoking acceptance. See <em>Ibrahim </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>214 Cal. App. 3d 878, 897 (1989), and cases cited. What constitutes reasonable use is a question of fact for the jury which must be decided under the circumstances of each case. The reasonableness of continued use has been based on the existence of so called special circumstances. See <em>Wendt, supra </em>at 427-428. The judge in the instant case charged the jury using the special circumstances language. As demonstrated in the recitation of the judge\u2019s instruction above, the term \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d by itself does little to direct the jury\u2019s deliberations toward the determinations which will likely throw light on the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s continued use. In the future, juries should be instructed that continued use, if reasonable, does not invalidate a revocation of acceptance. The jury should be further instructed that factors to consider on the issue of reasonable use are \u201cthe seller\u2019s instructions to the buyer after revocation of acceptance; the degree of economic and other hardship that the buyer would suffer if he discontinued using the defective goods; the reasonableness of the buyer\u2019s use after revocation as a method of mitigating damages; the degree of prejudice to the seller; and whether the seller acted in bad faith.\u201d <em>Johannsen, supra </em>at 658. See also <em>Ozark Kenworth, Inc. </em>v. <em>Neidecker, </em>283 Ark. 196, 200-201 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In the present case, the jury would have been warranted in finding that the defendant ignored the plaintiff\u2019s request that he refund the purchase price and take back the automobile. Indeed, the evidence was. not in conflict with respect to that point. In addition, the jury would have been warranted in finding, and again there was little controversy, that the plaintiff relied on her automobile to conduct her business and would have been harmed by lack of access to an automobile. Accordingly, while the judge\u2019s instruction was not optimal, it was sufficient in view of the evidence in this case, and the jury were warranted in finding that the plaintiff\u2019s continued use was reasonable. Mello\u2019s contention that continued use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>may only be explained by reliance on assurances of repair by the seller or as an attempt to preserve the value of the defective goods is an overly restrictive interpretation of reasonable continued use.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The judge found that Costa actually sold the automobile to Liarikos and committed the unfair and deceptive acts. He was a codefendant in the Superior Court. However, after he filed a suggestion of bankruptcy, the claims against him were dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\">There are two places in the quoted language where the transcript reads \u201cconsistent,\u201d yet \u201ccontinued\u201d seems to be the appropriate word in the context of the instruction. It is unclear if the judge misspoke or the transcription is faulty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
