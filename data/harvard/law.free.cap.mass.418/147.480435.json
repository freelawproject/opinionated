McGonigle commenced this action in the county court challenging the Governor\u2019s decision to suspend him without pay from the office of sheriff of Middlesex County. The Governor purported to act, pending the completion of a trial on a Federal criminal indictment lodged against the sheriff, pursuant to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25 (1992 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ed.). A single justice reserved and reported the question whether \u201cthe Governor of the Commonwealth is \u2018the appointing authority\u2019 of the Sheriff of the County of Middlesex within the meaning of those words in G. L. c. 268A, sec. 25.\u201d We hold that where the sheriff is an elected official, the Governor was not an \u201cappointing authority\u201d and, accordingly, lacked the power to suspend the plaintiff under the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"ADd\">The relevant facts taken from the amended verified complaint are as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 10, 1985, the then Governor appointed the plaintiff as sheriff of Middlesex County to fill the unexpired term of his predecessor. On November 4, 1986, the plaintiff was elected to a six-year term, and on November 3, 1992, he was reelected to another-term.</p>\n<p id=\"AIu\">On April 8, 1994, a United States grand jury for the District of Massachusetts returned a multi-count indictment against the plaintiff charging him with racketeering conspiracy, racketeering, extortion, conspiracy to defraud, and filing false tax returns. At his arraignment in Federal court, the plaintiff pleaded not guilty to all charges and was released on a $25,000 unsecured bond.</p>\n<p id=\"AKk\">On April 13, 1994, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney received notification, by a letter signed by both the Governor and the Attorney General, that, pursuant to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, the plaintiff had been suspended without pay from his position as sheriff of Middlesex County. This letter also indicated that (1) appropriate action would be taken to replace the plaintiff \u201con at least a temporary basis\u201d; and (2) the Governor and the Attorney General intended, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), to file a complaint seeking the plaintiff\u2019s permanent removal from office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">The plaintiff claims that, because he is an elected official, there is no \u201cappointing authority\u201d to which he is subject. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>cordingly, he claims that the Governor impermissibly suspended him under G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, a provision which authorizes an \u201cappointing authority\u201d to suspend without pay a county employee under indictment for misconduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants contend that, although G. L. c. 268A does not define the term \u201cappointing authority,\u201d this court, for the purposes of this action, should construe the term to include the official authorized to appoint a person to the office of sheriff on a vacancy in the office; that is, the Governor under G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 142.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Auc\">We disagree with the defendants\u2019 interpretation of G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25. The language of this section is clear in that it provides the \u201cappointing authority\u201d with the power to suspend a county official on the basis of a criminal indictment charging misconduct. Nothing in this section suggests that the provision for suspension applies to an official who is elected and not appointed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Where an individual is elected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the people, there is no \u201cappointing authority.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the Legislature intended to confer the authority to suspend an elected official on the office of Governor, it could have clearly identified the individual or office, as was the case in a related provision, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 59 (1992 ed.), which expressly allows the Governor to suspend any individual he appointed to office if such officer or employee of the Commonwealth is under indictment for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We note that, additionally, for certain elected county officials, including sheriffs, the Legislature has provided a distinct procedure for removing such an individual from office. General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides this court with broad authority to remove a sheriff, as well as other elected county officials, if sufficient cause is shown and the public good so requires. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>351 Mass. 321, 322 (1966) (holding, in an action seeking to remove a District Court clerk, that the court\u2019s scope of authority under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, is not limited by a provision which authorized the Governor to appoint District Court clerks); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>331 Mass. 413, 415, 428 (1954) (recognizing that G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, is couched in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>broadest terms with no qualifications or restrictions). Although this provision does not specifically enumerate the authority to suspend such an official, it is clear that the power to remove an official includes within it the authority to suspend that individual.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County, </em>377 Mass. 212, 214 (1979) (holding that the authority \u201cto remove a chief deputy sheriff or a court officer includes within it the authority to suspend the employment of such a person\u201d); <em>Multi-Line Ins. Rating Bureau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>357 Mass. 19, 22 (1970) (recognizing that, when \u201ca general power is given, all authority necessary to carry it out is inferred by implication\u201d). See also <em>Burnap </em>v. <em>United States, </em>252 U.S. 512, 515 (1920) (power of suspension an incident of power of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Thus, considering both the language of \u00a7 25 and the scope of power expressly granted to this court under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, we conclude that the Legislature did not intend to confer on the Governor or the Attorney General the power to suspend the sheriff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 577-578 (1942) (recognizing that the \u201cintent of [a] statute is to be ascertained from all its terms and parts and the subject matter to which it relates, and [the statute] should be so construed as to make it an effectual piece of legislation in harmony with common sense and sound reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We are mindful of the fact that the only matter presently before the court is the specific question reserved and reported by the single justice. We have not been asked in this action to decide whether this court may, solely on the basis of an indictment, suspend or remove the sheriff; whether a suspension under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, should be with or without com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>pensation; or whether, if the sheriff should be suspended by this court, the Governor has the authority to appoint his replacement on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The Governor has filed an action now pending before the full court seeking to invoke the court\u2019s authority to remove the plaintiff pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4. We anticipate that such other issues will be addressed in that context, and may need to be decided, in the Governor\u2019s separate action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqHA\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We answer the reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aui\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-28\">There appears to be no factual dispute between the parties at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-29\">On the same day, Special Sheriff Anthony Sasso informed the plaintiff that the Governor had appointed Robert C. Krekorian as \u201cTemporary Sheriff\u201d and that he was demanding access to the sheriff\u2019s private offices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Afki\">General Laws c. 268A, \u00a7 25 (1992 ed.), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAn officer or employee of a county, city, town or district, howsoever formed, including, but not limited to, regional school districts and regional planning districts, or of any department, board, commission or agency thereof may, during any period such officer or employee is under indictment for misconduct in such office or employment or for misconduct in any elective or appointive public office, trust or employment at any time held by him, be suspended by the appointing authority, whether or not such appointment was subject to approval in any manner. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AyI\">General Laws c. 54, \u00a7 142 (1992 ed.), provides, in relevant part: \u201cUpon a vacancy by removal or otherwise ... in the office of . . . sheriff, the governor with the advice and consent of the council may appoint some person thereto until a . . . sheriff is qualified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"A0A\">We reject the defendants\u2019 contention that, because G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1 (1992 ed.), includes within the definition of \u201ccounty employee\u201d any person holding an office by election, the provisions of \u00a7 25 apply to elected offici\u00e1is. In G. L. c. 268A (1992 ed.), the Legislature intended to regulate numerous aspects of the professional conduct of State, county, and municipal employees, whether elected or appointed. For example, provisions in this chapter provide standards for both elected and appointed officials as to soliciting or accepting gifts (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 3); reporting conflict of interests (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 6A); receiving compensation from an additional source (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 11), and disclosing financial interests (G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 13). In contrast to these other sections, in G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the Legislature explicitly limited the scope of the power to suspend to an \u201cappointing authority.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The defendants argue that the Governor is the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d relying in part on our decisions in <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Laffey, </em>388 Mass. 743 (1983), and <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Taunton, </em>343 Mass. 485 (1962). Both cases are inapposite; neither reaches the issue whether an elected official can be removed by one who might, in other circumstances, become an appointing authority. In <em>Laffey, </em>for example, the issue was whether a sucessor Governor could remove, pursuant to St. 1964,.c. 740, \u00a7 3, members of the Massachusetts Port Authority <em>appointed </em>by his predecessor. We held that he could because the power of appointment is in the office of the Governor, not the person. <em>Id. </em>at 747. In <em>Welch, supra </em>at 489, we held essentially the same as to the office of mayor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 62, provides, in relevant part: \u201cA majority of the justices ... if sufficient cause is shown therefor and it appears that the public good so requires, may, upon a complaint, upon a summary hearing or otherwise, remove a clerk of the superior court in Suffolk county, or of a district court, a county commissioner, a county treasurer, sheriff, register of probate or district attorney, or the recorder of the land court. \u201c</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In <em>Matter of Dugan, </em>416 Mass. 461, 462 (1993), this court, after hearing the parties, ordered the clerk suspended from all powers and duties as clerk-magistrate before removing her from office pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4. <em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">To our knowledge, the Attorney General does not have the authority to appoint a sheriff on a vacancy. Thus, his signature to the letter notifying the plaintiff of his suspension pursuant to G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 25, adds nothing to the defendants\u2019 claim. No argument is made that the Attorney General relies on other, or separate, powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b174-13\">The parties are advised that the court stands ready, on due notice, to commence hearings on the action brought under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4, whenever the parties are ready. We have not been asked to decide the consequences of concluding, as we have, that the Governor acted beyond his powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
