The defendant, College Pro Painters (U.S.) Ltd., is a Maryland corporation with its principal place of business in Cambridge. The defendant markets painting franchises throughout the United States. On August 3, 1992, the Brookline Division of the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>trict Court Department issued criminal complaints against the defendant. The complaints alleged that the defendant violated 454 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.03 (2) (d) and (3) (1993) for \u201cfailing to post a Massachusetts Rigging Registration Number\u201d and \u201cfailing to have a licensed painter\u2019s rigger on the work site.\u201d On May 12, 1993, a District Court judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaints. The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal dated May 17, 1993. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The principal question before us is whether \u00a7 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 (1988), preempts 454 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.03 (2) (b) and (3), thereby precluding prosecution under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 6 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 11.03 (2) (b) and (3) are preempted because the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has promulgated Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>standards addressing the same occupational health and safety issues as \u00a7 11.03 (2) (b) and (3). As a result, we affirm the judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The Commonwealth argues that 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 does not preempt 454 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.03 (2) (b) and (3) because OSHA has not promulgated any standards regarding the licensing of riggers or the posting of a rigger\u2019s license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Under the supremacy clause in art. 6 of the Constitution of the United States, we are obligated to declare invalid any State statute or regulation that purports to regulate a field that Congress has reserved exclusively to itself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>383 Mass. 485, 488-489 (1981). The touchstone of preemption is congressional intent. <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 208 (1985). See <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978). \u201cTo discern Congress\u2019 intent we examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 138 (1990). Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting the OSH Act was to ensure \u201csafe and healthful working conditions\u201d for all workers in the United States. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b) (1988). See <em>Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Ass\u2019n, </em>112 S. Ct. 2374, 2382 (1992). In addition, Congress intended to \u201cpromote occupational safety and health while at the same time avoiding duplicative, and possibly counterproductive, regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2385. As a result, the Supreme Court of the United States has concluded that \u201cthe OSH Act precludes any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a federal standard has been established, unless a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>state plan has been submitted and approved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667(a), (b). To avoid preemption of its occupational health and safety regulations, therefore, a State must either submit its plan to the United States Secretary of Labor for approval or regulate only those areas in which OSHA has remained silent. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 (b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Although the Commonwealth has not raised the issue on this appeal, it is clear that the OSH Act governs 454 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 11.00 et seq. (1993), the structural painting safety code (code), because it creates an \u201coccupational safety and health standard.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(8). \u201cThe OSH Act defines an \u2018occupational safety and health standard\u2019 as \u2018a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gade </em>v. <em>National Solid Wastes Management Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 2386, quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(8). The purpose of the code, meanwhile, \u201cis to establish reasonable requirements necessary to protect the safety and health of employees and others engaged in activities connected with structural painting operations.\u201d 454 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.01 (1). As a result, the Commonwealth must comply with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 to avoid the preemption of \u00a7 11.03 (2)(b) and (3). Section 667 provides that: \u201cNothing in this chapter shall prevent any State agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no standard is in effect under section-655 of this title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The Commonwealth has conceded that it did not submit the code to the Secretary of Labor for approval. The Commonwealth contends, however, that \u00a7 11.03 (2)(b) and \u00a7 11.03 (3) are not preempted because OSHA has not promulgated any regulations addressing either the licensing of riggers or the posting of a rigger\u2019s license at a work site. We conclude, however, that several sections of Title 29 of the United States Code apply directly to painting operations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>squarely address the safety and health issues articulated in \u00a7 11.03 (2) (b) and (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtZO\">Part 1926 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations is entitled, \u201cSafety and Health Regulations for Construction.\u201d Having defined \u201cconstruction work\u201d as \u201cincluding painting and decorating,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.12 (b) (1993), OSHA has expressly imposed its regulations on the painting industry. Painters, therefore, must comply with regulations requiring employers to train their employees in matters of general safety. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1926.20, 1926.21 (1993). In addition, employers must implement a training program to educate employees regarding, inter alla, the proper utilization of both ladders and \u201cfall protection systems.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.1060 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, OSHA has prohibited the erection or dismantling of scaffolding unless a trained su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>pervisor is present. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.451 (a)(3) (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, we hold that \u00a7 11.03 (2) (b) and \u00a7 11.03 (3) are preempted by the standards which OSHA has promulgated, thereby precluding prosecution under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 6. Accordingly, we affirm the judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Title 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 (1988), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\u201c(a) Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any State agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no standard is in effect under section 655 of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\u201c(b) Any State which, at any time, desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement therein of occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated under section 655 of this title shall submit a State plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Title 454 Code Mass.
