L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (1992 ed.), against the excess of a third-party judgment. We also address whether cost of living adjustments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B (1992 ed.), are subject to offset. Because we conclude that the insurer had no obligation under \u00a7 15 to obtain approval from the department prior to offsetting the injured employee\u2019s future compensation claims against the excess of the third-party judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ment, and agree that cost of living adjustments are subject to the insurer\u2019s offset rights, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">We summarize the relevant facts. On December 15, 1981, Stephen Percoco was seriously injured while in the course of his employment with the James Farina Corporation (Farina). Percoco then filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152 (1992 ed.) with his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Wausau Insurance Companies (Wausau). Wausau paid Percoco temporary total incapacity benefits under c. 152, \u00a7 34A. On July 22, 1982, Percoco brought a third-party tort action in the Superior Court against Morse Diesel, Inc. (Morse), the general contractor of the project where the accident occurred. In 1984, the department ordered total and permanent benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A, to be paid. Subsequently, Percoco received a cost of living adjustment to this compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B. In 1988, in the third-party action, a jury verdict was returned and judgment entered against Morse in the amount of $273,500 plus interest. Wausau claimed its lien and offset rights under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. After the parties were unable to agree on the amount of the lien, the Superior Court judge ordered that Wausau be paid $138,390.11 from the judgment. Percoco\u2019s legal costs and expenses for the action were $167,032.23 and $5,581, respectively. Wausau notified the department that it would recalculate Percoco\u2019s weekly benefit. Shortly thereafter, Wausau suspended all benefits to Percoco.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In July, 1989, Percoco brought a new action in Superior Court, this time requesting that Wausau be estopped from enforcing its \u00a7 15 lien because of its allegedly unfair and inequitable conduct in the third-party action. On October 20, 1989, Wausau was ordered to resume paying benefits, pending the outcome of the case. After a hearing on cross motions for summary judgment, the judge, on February 27, 1990, ordered that the preliminary injunction be dissolved, that Wausau\u2019s obligation to post bond be discharged, and that Wausau recoup all payments made to Percoco under the preliminary injunction in excess of Wausau\u2019s obligation to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>continued payments under the fee allocation provisions of <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Midwest Coast Transp., Inc., </em>400 Mass. 779 (1987), by adjusting its future compensation payments until the overpayment is recouped. The judge then granted Wausau\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Percoco\u2019s complaint. This decision was affirmed by the Appeals Court. See <em>Percoco </em>v. <em>Wausau Ins. Co., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Undaunted, Percoco then filed a claim with the department alleging that Wausau illegally discontinued his weekly benefits. The parties agreed to a statement of the issues. The first issue concerned the proper procedure, if any, that an insurer must follow in effectuating its offset rights under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, in the case of a third-party judgment. The second was whether cost of living adjustments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, are subject to offset. On the first issue, the administrative judge determined that Wausau was not obligated to obtain approval from the department to offset future benefits against the excess of the third-party jury verdict and, accordingly, had not illegally discontinued Percoco\u2019s benefits. On the second issue, the administrative judge decided that cost of living adjustments under \u00a7 34B are wage replacement benefits and, as such, are subject to offset. Percoco appealed to the board, which affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision on March 25, 1993. Percoco appealed the board\u2019s decision to a single justice of the Appeals Court, who reported the case to a panel of Justices of that court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. Because our review is limited to the board\u2019s decision, we disregard Percoco\u2019s arguments not relating to the two issues presented to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, grants an insurer the right to reimbursement for compensation paid where there is recovery against a third party for the employee\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>15 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhere the injury for which compensation is payable was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the insured to pay damages in respect thereof ... the employee . . . may proceed to enforce the liability of such person .... The sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the insurer, unless such sum is greater than that paid by it to the employee, in which event the excess shall be retained by or paid to the employee.\u201d Although the employee is entitled to retain the \u201cexcess,\u201d the insurer may offset the employee\u2019s future compensation claims against the excess. We established this right in order to give full effect to \u201cthe general policy against double recovery and the reimbursement provisions of \u00a7 15.\u201d <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Arsenault, </em>349 Mass. 521, 524-525 (1965)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the excess that the insurer can offset is not the statutory offset, that is, the amount of the third-party recovcry that exceeds compensation paid under c. 152. In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Midwest Coast Transp., Inc., </em>400 Mass. 779, 784 (1987), we decided that the insurer\u2019s offset should reflect the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the third-party action. In implementing this- decision, we required insurers to pay a percentage of each future claim equal to the ratio the total attorney\u2019s fee and costs bears to the total third-party recovcry. <em>Id. </em>at 784-785. In this way, the insurer pays for the fees and costs in proportion to the benefit it receives. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the total amount of these claims equals the statutory excess, the insurer\u2019s obligation to make full compensation payments resumes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"A7c\">1. <em>Offset procedure. </em>As noted above, the first issue that the board addressed was whether Wausau could properly offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Percoco\u2019s claims against the excess of the third-party judgment without first obtaining approval from the department. Section 15 requires approval in certain cases settled by the parties and distinguishes between settlements prior to trial and settlements during trial. If the third-party action is settled prior to trial, either \u201cthe board, the reviewing board, or the court in which the action has been commenced after a hearing in which both the employee and the insurer have an opportunity to be heard\u201d must approve the settlement agreement. If the action is settled during trial, \u201conly the justice presiding at the trial shall have and exercise, relative to the approval of such settlement by agreement.\u201d Section 15 contains no other procedural requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Percoco argues that, by not first obtaining approval from the department, Wausau improperly terminated benefits in violation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wausau argues \u00a7 8 does not apply because Percoco\u2019s benefits have not been terminated or modified but are being offset in accordance with a lien established by the Superior Court and the fee allocation provisions of <em>Hunter. </em>Noting that there are no statutory or regulatory provisions expressly mandating prior approval when there is a third-party judgment, Wausau argues that no prior approval should be required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The insurer can offset the excess of a third-party judgment against the employee\u2019s future compensation claims and is required only to pay the percentage of these claims in proportion to the ratio of the fees and costs to the third-party recovery until the total amount of the claims equals the statutory excess. In this case, the amount of the judgment against the third party, Morse, the amount of Wausau\u2019s \u00a7 15 lien, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the amount of Percoco\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs were ascertained on the entering of judgment in the third-party action. Wausau was thus able to proceed to offset Percoco\u2019s future compensation claims without any further guidance. In the absence of express provisions in c. 152 or in the department\u2019s regulations, there is no rational basis to require prior approval before an insurer can effectuate its offset rights in an excess judgment. Wausau legally discontinued Percoco\u2019s weekly benefits. The board correctly held that the discontinuance was not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">2. <em>Cost of living adjustments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B. </em>The second issue that the board addressed was whether cost of living adjustments under \u00a7 34B are subject to offset by the insurer under \u00a7 15. Section 15 provides, in part, that the injured employee is \u201centitled, without election, to the compensation <em>and other benefits </em>provided under [c. 152]\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Arsenault, supra </em>at 524-525, we held that an insurer can offset the future compensation claims of the injured employee against the excess of the third-party recovery. As we noted above, the underlying principle of \u00a7 15 is the prevention of double recovery \u2014 \u201conce by way of compensation and once by way of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, quoting <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Liab. Assurance Corp., </em>288 Mass. 170, 174 (1934). Interpreting \u00a7 15 consistently with this principle, we hold that the future compensation claims that are subject to the insurer\u2019s offset rights include claims for \u201cother benefits\u201d under c. 152 as well as claims for \u201ccompensation.\u201d See also <em>Armstrong\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 796, 803 (1994) (cost of living adjustment not \u201ccompensation\u201d under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 29). Section 34B<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides in part: \u201cAny person receiving or entitled to receive benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>under the provisions of . . . [\u00a7 34A] . . . <em>shall have his weekly benefit </em>adjusted\u201d (emphasis added). A cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B supplements the employee\u2019s weekly compensation and, as such, is a benefit under c. 152. Accordingly, we agree with the board that cost of living adjustments under \u00a7 34B are subject to the insurer\u2019s offset rights under \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the board upholding the decision of the administrative judge determining that Wausau legally discontinued Percoco\u2019s benefits under G. L. c. 152, and that cost of living adjustments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, are subject to an insurer\u2019s offset rights under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, effective on passage, December 23, 1991. The parties have not specified which version of this statute applies to this case. The administrative judge issued her decision on July 9, 1991, prior to the amendments. The board issued its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>decision on March 25, 1993, after the date of amendment, and made reference to the amended version in its written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"AzD\">Although the 1991 amendments make substantial changes to \u00a7 15, none of the changes would alter our decision in this case. Because neither of the parties contends that the board erred in applying the amended version, we will apply that version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AO2E\">The amended version of \u00a7 15 makes express reference to the insurer\u2019s right to oifset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 8, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 25, prohibits an insurer paying weekly compensation benefits from \u201cmodify [ing] and discontinuing] such payments except in\u201d certain delineated situations. The prior version of \u00a7 8 also concerned when an insurer can terminate or modify benefits. As with \u00a7 15, the parties have not specified which version should apply in this case. Because we agre.e with Wausau that it did not terminate or modify Percoco\u2019s benefits, we need not analyze the particular situations. We shall apply the amended version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Like \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 15, \u00a7 34B was amended in 1991. See St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 61. The parties also do not specify which version should apply to this case. The prior version referred to the benefit as a \u201csupplement to weekly compensation\u201d; the amended version refers to the employee\u2019s right to have his \u201cweekly benefit adjusted.\u201d However, the change in language does not affect our decision. As with our approach to the other sections, we apply the amended version.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
