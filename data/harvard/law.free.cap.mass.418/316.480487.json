Paul and his wife jointly own two other apartment buildings in Turners Falls which have a total of twenty-one residential units. In August, 1989, Paul, acting for himself and his brother, declined to consider leasing an apartment in the four-unit building to Mark Lattanzi and Cynthia Tarail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>an unmarried couple, because they would be cohabiting there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The defendants have a policy of not leasing an apartment to any person who intends to engage in conduct that violates their religious principles. The defendants\u2019 sole reason for declining even to consider Lattanzi and Tarail as tenants was that religion-based policy. The defendants, who are Roman Catholics, believe that they should not facilitate sinful conduct, including fornication. Since developing the policy at least a decade earlier, the defendants have applied it ten or more times to deny tenancies to unmarried couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), as in effect in August, 1989, provided, in part, that it shall be an unlawful practice for the owner of a multiple dwelling \u201cto refuse to rent or lease ... or otherwise to deny to or withhold from any person or group of persons such accommodations because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, sex, age, ancestry or <em>marital status </em>of such person or persons\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6) (1988 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall conclude that the defendants violated the provisions of this statute and that, therefore, we must consider the defendants\u2019 argument that enforcement of the statute against them violates their rights under the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In September, 1989, Lattanzi and Tarail filed a housing discrimination complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), claiming that because of their marital status they were denied available housing in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6). After the MCAD had found probable cause, Lattanzi and Tarail filed a notice seeking a judicial determination of the matter in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5 (1992 ed.). On October 4, 1990, the Attorney General, as was his obligation under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 5, commenced this action on behalf of the complainants in Superior Court in Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A judge of the Superior Court decided the case on cross motions for summary judgment. He allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the Attorney General\u2019s. The motion judge correctly ruled that the defendants had violated G. L. c. 15IB. He then ruled that, on the summary judgment record, application of the statute to the defendants in this case would be unconstitutional. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We conclude that, on the record before us, neither party was entitled to summary judgment and that the summary judgment for the defendants should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">1. The defendants argue that they are not discriminating on the basis of marital status but rather on the basis of conduct and that consequently they are not discriminating in a way forbidden by G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6). There is no merit to this argument. This court\u2019s opinion in <em>Worcester Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>406 Mass. 244 (1989), makes clear that the prohibition in G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6), against discrimination in leasing because of marital status applies to discrimination against an unmarried woman and an unmarried man seeking to rent an apartment for their joint occupancy. Moreover, analysis of the defendants\u2019 concerns shows that it is marital status and not sexual intercourse that lies at the heart of the defendants\u2019 objection. If married couple A wanted to cohabit in an apartment owned by the defendants, they would have no objection. If unmarried couple B wanted to cohabit in an apartment owned by the defendants, they would have great objection. The controlling and discriminating difference between the two situations is the difference in the marital status of the two couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">2. We consider first the protections provided by art. 46, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the State Constitution. Article 46, \u00a7 1 (\u201cNo law shall be passed prohibiting the free exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>else of religion\u201d) parallels the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . prohibiting the free exercise of religion\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nissenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 575, 578 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Despite the similarity of the two constitutional provisions, this court should reach its own conclusions on the scope of the protections of art. 46, \u00a7 1, and should not necessarily follow the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States under the First Amendment. Indeed, after the release of our <em>Nissenbaum </em>opinion, the Supreme Court substantially altered its standard for determining whether conduct was protected under the free exercise of religion clause by its decision in <em>Employment Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Resources of Or. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. 872 (1990), a much criticized opinion that weakened First Amendment protections for religious conduct. See The Supreme Court, 1992 Term \u2014 Comment, The Resurrection of Religious Freedom?, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 118 &amp; 118 n.3 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In interpreting art. 46, \u00a7 1, we prefer to adhere to the standards of earlier First Amendment jurisprudence, such as we applied in <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 74-75, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985), and <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 375, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>459 U.S. 970 (1982). In each opinion, we used the balancing test that the Supreme Court had established under the free exercise of religion clause in <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 215-229 (1972), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 388, 406-409 (1963), and subsequent opinions. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, supra </em>at 73-74; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 375. See also <em>Employment Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Resources of Or. </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 894-895 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). By applying the balancing test as we do, we extend protections to the defendants that are at least as great as those of the First Amendment. No further discussion of rights under the First Amendment is, therefore, necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Our tasks are to determine whether the defendants have shown that the prohibition against housing discrimination based on marital status substantially burdens their free exercise of religion, and, if it does, whether the Commonwealth has shown that it has an interest sufficiently compelling to justify that -burden. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, supra </em>at 73-74, citing <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 215-229, and <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, supra </em>at 403-409. See also L.H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 14-12, at 1242 (2d ed. 1988) (\u201cIn order to gain the exemption, the claimant must show (1) a sincerely held religious belief, which (2) conflicts with, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>is burdened by, the state requirement. Once the claimant has made that showing, the burden shifts to the state. The state can prevail only by demonstrating both that (3) the requirement pursues an unusually important governmental goal, and that (4) an exemption would substantially hinder the fulfillment of the goal\u201d [footnotes omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Because it is unchallenged on the summary judgment record, we must accept that the defendants sincerely believe that their behavior must in all respects conform to their religious beliefs and that, in their view, the operation of rental housing is not independent of those beliefs. Conduct motivated by sincerely held religious convictions will be recognized as the exercise of religion. Supreme Court free exercise of religion cases have accepted, either implicitly or without searching inquiry, claimants\u2019 assertions regarding what they sincerely believe to be the exercise of their religion, even when the conduct in dispute is not commonly viewed as a religious ritual. See, e.g., <em>Hobbie </em>v. <em>Unemployment AppealComm\u2019n of Fla., </em>480 U.S. 136, 137 (1987) (refusal to work Sabbath hours); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252, 257 (1982) (abstention from participating in government social security program); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Review Bd. of the Ind. Employment Sec. Div., </em>450 U.S. 707, 715 (1981) (refusal to work in weapons production). See also Tribe, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 14-12, at 1243-1244. Our opinions concerning the free exercise of religion have also recognized action based on religious beliefs as the exercise of religion. See, e.g., <em>Fedele </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, </em>412 Mass. 110, 116 (1992) (right to maintain religion includes \u201cfreedom to believe\u201d and \u201cfreedom to act on that belief\u2019); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>I.S.K.Con. of New England, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 842, 851, cert, denied, 502 U.S. 865 (1991) (\u201cBoth this court and the United States Supreme Court have recognized that the concept of free exercise of religion involves both belief and activity\u201d; teaching of religious beliefs is protected activity); <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 375-376 (threshold question satisfied because operation of school was activity \u201cmotivated by a sincerely held religious belief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The next question is whether the prohibition against discrimination based on marital status substantially burdens the defendants\u2019 exercise of their religion. The extent of any burden will become important if and when it comes time to balance any such burden against the interests of the Commonwealth in eliminating marital status discrimination in housing. We first consider whether there is any burden at all on the defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion. We have said that the government\u2019s failure to provide a child with subsidized transportation to a private sectarian school does not burden the child\u2019s free exercise of religion. <em>Fedele </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, supra </em>at 116.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, the situation differs because the government has placed a burden on the defendants that makes their exercise of religion more difficult and more costly. The statute affirmatively obliges the defendants to enter into a contract contrary to their religious beliefs and provides significant sanctions for its violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, both their nonconformity to the law and any related publicity may stigmatize the defendants in the eyes of many and thus burden the exercise of the defendants\u2019 religion. Four State appellate courts, on similar but not identical facts, have dealt recently with the question of a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion under their respective State Constitutions, and all four concluded that a marital status antidis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>crimination law imposed such a burden. See <em>Swanner </em>v. <em>Anchorage Equal Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>868 P.2d 301, 308, reh\u2019g granted, withdrawn from bound volume, modified, and reissued per curiam, 874 P.2d 274 (Alaska 1994); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commission of Fair Employment &amp; Hous., </em>25 Cal. App. 4th 251, modified, 39 Cal. App. 4th 877 (1994); <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Hous. Comm\u2019n, 2 </em>Cal. Rptr. 2d 32, 42 (Ct. App. 1991), review granted, 5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 781 (1992), review dismissed granted, 23 Cal. Rptr. 2d 591 (1993); <em>State by Cooper </em>v. <em>French, </em>460 N.W.2d 2, 10 (Minn. 1990); <em>id. </em>at 15 (Popovich, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The fact that the defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion claim arises in a commercial context, although relevant when engaging in a balancing of interests, does not mean that their constitutional rights are not substantially burdened. This is not a case in which a claimant is seeking a financial advantage by asserting religious beliefs. See cases cited in note 6 above. The defendants\u2019 right to free exercise of religion is substantially burdened by the operation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We must, therefore, consider whether the record establishes that the Commonwealth has or does not have an important governmental interest that is sufficiently compelling that the granting of an exemption to people in the position of the defendants would unduly hinder that goal. The general objective of eliminating discrimination of all kinds referred to in the relevant version of \u00a7 4 (6) (\u201crace, religious creed, color, national origin, sex, age, ancestry or marital status\u201d) cannot alone provide a compelling State interest that justifies the application of that section in disregard of the defendants\u2019 right to free exercise of their religion. The analysis must be more focused. At the least, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that it has a compelling interest in the elimination of discrimination in housing against an unmarried man and an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>unmarried woman who have a sexual relationship and wish to rent accommodations to which \u00a7 4 (6) applies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Earlier in this opinion we pointed out that four other appellate State courts had recognized, as we do in this opinion, that a marital status antidiscrimination law such as ours substantially burdens the free exercise of religion by a landlord who does not believe in leasing premises to unmarried cohabitants. Judicial unanimity disappeared, however, when the role of a compelling State interest in the balancing of interests was considered. None of these opinions, majority or dissenting, provides reasoning that is particularly instructive in deciding the issue that we are now discussing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>As the motion judge correctly ascertained, marital status discrimination is not as intense a State concern as is discrimination based on certain other classifications. Article 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, states that \u201c[e] quality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.\u201d Because there is no constitutionally based prohibition against discriminating on the basis of marital status, marital status discrimination is of a lower order than those discriminations to which art. 1 refers. Moreover, in various ways, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>statute<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and judicial decision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the law has not promoted cohabitation and has granted a married spouse rights not granted to a man or woman cohabiting with a member of the opposite sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The defendants argue further that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 18 (1992 ed.), presents a public policy consideration that weighs against the interest stated in G. L. c. 151B against discrimination based on marital status. Section 18 makes fornication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>a crime. This statute is of doubtful constitutionality, at least as applied to the private, consensual conduct of persons over the age of consent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 302 (1974). It remains, however, as a criminal statute of the Commonwealth, which suggests some diminution in the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in the elimination of housing discrimination based on marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Without supporting facts in the record or in legislative findings, we are unwilling to conclude that simple enactment of the prohibition against discrimination based on marital status establishes that the State has such a substantial interest in eliminating that form of housing discrimination that, on a balancing test, the substantial burden on the defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion must be disregarded. It is no doubt true that many men and women are cohabiting in the Commonwealth and that numbers have increased in the last twenty years. We have no sense, however, of the numbers of rental units that might be withheld from such people because of the religious beliefs of the owners of rental housing. Although the prohibition against discrimination based on marital status was enacted over twenty years ago (St. 1973, c. 187), this is the first case of this character that has come to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We have no indication, beyond the facts of this case, whether the rental housing policies of people such as the defendants can be accommodated, at least in the Turners Falls (Montague) area, without significantly impeding the availability of rental housing for people who are cohabiting or wish to cohabit. Market forces often tend to discourage owners from restricting the class of people to whom they would rent. On the other hand, discrimination of the sort challenged here may present a significant housing problem if a large percentage of units are unavailable to cohabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We reject any argument that a general rule must be applied because of problems in determining whether religious beliefs sincerely underlie a landlord\u2019s refusal to lease. The sincerity of such action assertedly founded on religious be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>liefs is open to challenge in a free exercise of religion case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 78 (1944). We would, moreover, not readily subscribe to a rule that justified the denial of constitutional rights simply because the protection of those rights required special effort. For similar reasons, in the absence of proof, we would not find a compelling State interest in this case simply because other individuals might assert the right to be exempt from this or some other law on religious grounds and in doing so would make enforcement of that law difficult. Yet the practical problems of administering a law with the exemption that the defendants seek may be shown to be such as to make the operation of such an exemption impractical. Finally, the compulsion of the State\u2019s interest appears somewhat weakened because the statute permits discrimination by a religious organization in certain respects (see note 8 above) if to do so promotes the principles for which the organization was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We are not persuaded on the record that the Commonwealth\u2019s interests in the availability of rental housing for cohabiting couples must always prevail over the religion-based practices that people such as the defendants wish to pursue. On the other hand, we cannot say that it is certain that the Commonwealth could not prove in this case that it has some specific compelling interest that justifies overriding the defendants\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The Commonwealth has the task of establishing that it has a compelling interest in eliminating housing discrimination against cohabiting couples that is strong enough to justify the burden placed on the defendants\u2019 exercise of their religion. A task of this sort has been carried out successfully in some cases and not in others. Compare <em>Bob Jones Univ. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 592-593, 604 (1983) (eradication of racial discrimination in education is compelling State interest, superseding any free exercise rights of petitioners); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252, 258-259 &amp; nn.7-9 (1982) (overriding interest in operation of national social security system is compelling) with <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Review Bd. of the Ind. Employment Sec. Div., </em>450 U.S. 707, 719 (1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>(no compelling State interest established); <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 224-229 (1972) (same); and <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 407 (1963) (same). Cf. <em>Guiney </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>411 Mass. 328, 332-334 (1991) (generalized sense that there is a drug problem does not alone justify random drug testing of police officers).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The summary judgment record does not establish that there is no disputed material fact bearing on the compelling State interest question. In that circumstance summary judgment is inappropriate. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>Doe </em>v. <em>New Bedford Hous. Auth., </em>417 Mass. 273, 279 (1994). <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 808-809 (1991). <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>395 Mass. 107, 115-116 (1985). There are factual circumstances that bear on the question, both as to the existence of a general State interest in the elimination of discrimination in housing based on marital status and as to the existence of a particularized State interest in the Turners Falls area. Uniformity of enforcement of the statute may be shown to be the least restrictive means for the practical and efficient operation of the antidiscrimination law. It should be remembered that the task is to balance the State\u2019s interests against the nature of the burden on the defendants and that we are concerned here with the business of leasing apartments, not with participation in a formal religious activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Now that we have defined the nature of the relevant State constitutional rights and the applicable standards, we should not announce that the Commonwealth cannot possibly make its case, but rather we should give it a chance to demonstrate its compelling interest in the application of the statute. In short, on the summary judgment record, we conclude that the uncontested material facts disclose no basis for ruling that the Commonwealth can or cannot meet its burden of establishing that it has a compelling interest that can be fulfilled only by denying the defendants an exemption from G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6). Therefore, summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>should not have been granted to the defendants, and neither side is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">3. We now turn to art. 2 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That article, unaltered since the people adopted it in 1780, has no precise parallel in the Constitution of the United States, although certain of art. 2\u2019s principles are reflected in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Article 2 is important to this case only if it grants greater protection to the defendants than do either the First Amendment or the cognate free exercise of religion provision appearing in art. 46, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u201cThe Constitution of the Commonwealth . . . guarantees to all our people absolute freedom as to religious belief and liberty unrestrained as to religious practices,\u201d provided that the public peace is not disturbed and others are not obstructed in their religious worship. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>214 Mass. 599, 601 (1913). Article 2 of the Declaration of Rights protects religious beliefs by providing that \u201cno subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty, or estate ... for his religious profession or sentiments.\u201d As a practical matter, this protection of religious beliefs is substantially absolute under art. 2 as well as under art. 46, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments and the First Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This aspect of art. 2 is not involved in this case because we are not dealing with any restraint on the defendants\u2019 religious professions or sentiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Article 2 also protects religious practices by providing that \u201cno subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained ... for worshipping GOD in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.\u201d This protection concerns conduct, the \u201cmanner and season\u201d of worshiping God. That conduct may invoke one or both of the exceptions in art. 2: that the conduct must \u201cnot disturb the public peace or obstruct others in their religious worship.\u201d Art. 2. If neither exception applies, by its terms, art. 2 gives absolute protection to the manner in which one worships God. No balancing of interests, the worshiper\u2019s, on the one hand, and the government\u2019s, on the other, is called for when neither exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Our cases concerning art. 2 have not defined the scope of the concept of worshiping God, that is, if neither art. 2 exception applies, that conduct which is constitutionally protected absolutely. They do, however, provide some guidance. See <em>Society of Jesus of New England </em>v. <em>Boston Landmarks Comm\u2019n, </em>409 Mass. 38, 42 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nissenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 575, 578-579 (1989).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The court need not pass on the application of art. 2 in this case because whatever protections it offers to the defendants are available to them under art. 46, \u00a7 1, which we have already discussed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The three Justices who join this opinion reach this conclusion because, even if the defendants\u2019 selective leasing of their commercial property involves \u201cworship-ping GOD in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of [their] own conscience,\u201d that conduct in violation of a State statute would disturb the peace (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nissenbaum, supra </em>at 582-583; <em>id: </em>at 592-593 [Liacos, J., dissenting]), and, therefore, there would have to be a balancing of competing interests to decide whether G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6), is properly enforceable against the defendants. This balancing process is similar to the task that the three Justices who join this opinion and the Chief Justice in partial concurrence agree must be conducted under art. 46, \u00a7 1, on remand on this case. No balancing of competing interests under art. 2 is required in this case because the competing interests standard under art. 2 is no more favorable to the defendants than the requirement under art. 46, \u00a7 1, that the Commonwealth demonstrate a compelling State interest in justification of the application of the statute to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">4. The judgment for the defendants is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further consideration of the question whether art. 46, \u00a7 1, bars application of G.

Thus, the court continues, if art. 2 is applicable at all, only the provision of art. 2 which protects \u201cworshipping\u201d is called into play in this case. I cannot agree. Contrary to the court\u2019s conclusion, which implicitly defines \u201creligious profession or sentiments,\u201d I believe that, in the circumstances of this case, the protection in art. 2 for \u201creligious profession or sentiments\u201d is relevant here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the defendants have ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>mitted that they in fact have refused in the past to rent to unmarried, cohabiting couples and would have refused to rent to Lattanzi and Tarail, assuming that they would have cohabited, the event immediately precipitating this action was one telephone call made by Tarail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The content of the conversation which took place was disputed, but the judge found that Paul Desilets imparted to Tarail that he would not rent to unmarried cohabiters because to do so violated his religion. The conversation then ended without Tarail pressing the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">As I see it, then, the action of the defendant on which this suit was founded was his profession of his religious belief that cohabitation of unmarried persons is a sin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the facts of this case also implicate the protection afforded to the defendants\u2019 \u201creligious profession or sentiments.\u201d I would not dispose of this issue, as the court does without analysis, <em>ante </em>at 332, by reciting that the protection in art. 2 for religious profession or sentiments is not involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In my opinion art. 2 covers the actions of the defendants. As a result, their conduct is deserving of art. 2 protection unless it disturbs the public peace. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734-735 (1977) (disturbance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>public peace occurs when conduct \u201ctends to annoy all good citizens and does in fact annoy anyone present not favoring it\u201d); <em>Nissenbaum, supra </em>at 592 (Liacos, J., dissenting) (conduct disturbs public peace when it is unreasonably disruptive, and second, did in fact infringe someone\u2019s right to be undisturbed). Although the judge found that there was no disturbance of the public peace, it does not seem to me that the issue was addressed completely by the parties below. I would remand this case for further proceedings and a determination whether the defendants\u2019 actions disturbed the public peace. See <em>Nissenbaum, supra </em>at 591-593 (Liacos, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the judge determines that the defendants\u2019 conduct did disturb the public peace,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the judge should then balance the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the public peace which was disturbed against the defendants\u2019 rights under art. 2. <em>Id. </em>at 581-583 (court notes that balancing of competing interests is required under art. 2 when disturbance of public peace is found, and court then notes that it performed such a balancing in that case).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The full text of art. 2 provides: \u201cIt is the right as well as the duty of all men in society, publicly, and at stated seasons to worship the SUPREME BEING, the great Creator and Preserver of the universe. And no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping GOD in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience, or for his religious profession or sentiments; provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The author of the court\u2019s opinion wrote separately in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nissenbaum, </em>404 Mass. 575, 584 n.l (1989) (Wilkins, J., concurring), that \u201cconduct protected by art. 2 must be conduct commonly regarded as religious conduct.\u201d I note that this statement in Justice Wilkins\u2019s concurrence in <em>Nissenbaum </em>was made despite his position that the constitutional issues in that case need not be addressed, <em>Nissenbaum, supra </em>at 588 n.l (Liacos, J., dissenting), and was made without citation of authority for that proposition. <em>Id. </em>at 584 n.l (Wilkins, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">I cannot agree that particular conduct will not be recognized as worship by this court merely because that conduct is not within the conception of worship espoused by a majority of the Justices of this court, past or present. Nor can I agree that conduct must be <em>\u201ccommonly </em>regarded as religious conduct\u201d for it to fall within the scope and protection of art. 2 (emphasis supplied). These propositions suggest that only those forms of worship that are acceptable in the opinion of the majority of society will receive consideration under art. 2. In my view, these propositions are contrary to the essence of art. 2, as shown in both the plain language of that provision and in our case law interpreting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I do not suggest that an individual may assert any conduct as worship and then be permitted to practice that conduct unchecked. Article 2 itself prohibits an individual from \u201cdisturbing] the public peace, or obstructing] others in their religious worship.\u201d Furthermore, an individual must believe sincerely that his conduct is worship, and a court permissibly may examine the sincerity of that belief. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 781 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The dictionary definition of \u201cworship\u201d lends to this argument. The verb \u201cworship\u201d means \u201cto honor or reverence as a divine being or supernatural power\u201d or \u201cto perform . . . worship.\u201d The noun \u201cworship\u201d means the \u201creverence or veneration tendered a divine being or supernatural power.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2637 (1993). Thus, an act of worship could be any act by which a person, in his belief, shows honor or reverence to the object of his worship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Furthermore, it is not relevant whether the belief is shared by an organized sect or church, or, for that matter, by any other person. See <em>Kolodziej </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>412 Mass. 215, 220 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Although the court in <em>Nicholls </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Sch. Comm. of Lynn, </em>297 Mass. 65, 70 (1937), noted that the State Constitution \u201cguarantees \u2018absolute freedom as to religious belief and liberty unrestrained as to religious practice,\u2019 \u201d it went on to conclude that requiring the plaintiff to recite the pledge of allegiance to the flag did not violate that plaintiff\u2019s religious freedom even though his religious beliefs required that he not salute the flag. <em>Id. </em>at 71-73. The court, in effect, interpreted the meaning of the plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs. I doubt whether the inquiry performed by the court in <em>Nicholls </em>would be permissible today, and in any event, I do not agree with the court\u2019s conclusion in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">This court has not had occasion to discuss the meaning of the terms \u201cprofession\u201d or \u201csentiment\u201d as used in art. 2. The common meanings of those words are instructive, however. \u201cProfession,\u201d in the sense it is used in art. 2, is \u201can act of openly declaring or publicly claiming a belief, faith, or opinion; an avowed statement or expression of intention or purpose.\u201d Web<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1811 (1993). A \u201csentiment\u201d is \u201can attitude, thought, or judgment permeated or prompted by feeling\u201d or \u201ca specific view or notion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2069. Under the plain meaning of these words, it is clear that, in the telephone conversation giving rise to this action, the defendant professed his religious sentiment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\">The record suggests that Lattanzi also may have contacted one of the defendants or the wife of one of the defendants to inquire about an apartment and was told of the policy against renting to unmarried, cohabiting couples.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\">It is unfortunate that the court unnecessarily reaches out in dictum, to describe G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 18 (1992 ed.), which makes fornication a crime, as being a statute of \u201cdoubtful constitutionality.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 328-329. Similar claims of unconstitutionality were made \u2014 and rejected \u2014 as to the crime of adultery (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 14). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>389 Mass. 171, 173 (1983). <em>Stowell </em>is an opinion in which the author of the court\u2019s opinion in the case at bar joined. One need not address the constitutional issue as to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 18, to conclude that the Legislature has expressed a public policy which the defendants, for religious reasons, share.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\">On this record, I could not conclude that the public peace was disturbed merely because a statute allegedly was violated. See <em>Nissenbaum, supra </em>at 591-593 (Liacos, J., dissenting). More importantly, the court\u2019s suggestion that the public peace was disturbed by virtue of a violation of a State statute is based on faulty logic. Our inquiry is whether the application of the statute in this case violates the religious rights of the defendants. If their rights would be violated unconstitutionally by application of the statute to their conduct, then the statute could not be applied to their conduct and, as a result, there would be no violation of the statute which could be the basis for finding a disturbance of the public peace. The underlying conduct, however, could be examined in the manner I outlined, <em>id. </em>at 592.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">There is nothing at all in the record which would suggest that the defendants\u2019 conduct interfered with someone else\u2019s worship.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b362-5\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOJ\">(dissenting, with whom Nolan and Lynch, JJ., join). In keeping with their sincerely held religious beliefs, the defendants consider an unmarried couple\u2019s living together in a sexual relationship to be an offense against God. Also in keeping with their sincerely held religious beliefs, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>defendants consider enabling or assisting another in the commission of an offense against God to be itself an offense against Him. Responding to those religious convictions, and out of respect for the will of God, the defendants refused to rent an apartment to an unmarried couple living in a sexual relationship (cohabiting couple). The court now concludes that an evidentiary hearing \u2014 a trial \u2014 is required before a determination can be made concerning whether the defendants may lawfully be forced to choose between violating their religiously informed consciences or withdrawing from their commercial endeavors. I disagree. No combination of facts that might be found after a trial would legally justify the imposition of such a choice. I would affirm the summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">I agree that,'as applied to this case, (1) art. 46, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the State Constitution provides at least as much protection to the free exercise of religion as does art. 2 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) the court should reach its own conclusions on the scope of the protections of art. 46, \u00a7 1; and (3) in interpreting art. 46, \u00a7 1, the court should use the balancing test that the Supreme Court established in <em>Wisconsin </em>v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215-229 (1972), <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 388, 406-409 (1963), and subsequent opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Because the defendants\u2019 right to the free exercise of their religion is substantially burdened by the operation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6), <em>ante </em>at 324, a matter about which none of the Justices seems to disagree, the Commonwealth would be required at trial to prove that \u201cit has an interest sufficiently compelling to justify that burden.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 322. In reviewing the entry of summary judgment for the defendants, then, the question before the court is whether the defendants have demonstrated \u201cby reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), unmet by countervailing materials, that the [Commonwealth, which will have the burden of proof at trial], has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of [its] case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). In my view, the defendants have succeeded in that regard. It is clear from the summary judgment materials that the Commonwealth can have no reasonable expectation of sustaining its burden of proving at trial an essential element of its case, which is that the Commonwealth has an interest in ensuring the availability of rental housing for unmarried couples with a sexual relationship \u2014 a relationship prohibited by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 18 (1992 ed.) \u2014 that outweighs the defendants\u2019 interest in conforming their conduct to the will of God without State-imposed penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u201c[Mjarital status discrimination is not as intense a State concern as is discrimination based on certain other classifications.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 327. In contrast, the right to free exercise of religion is- a fundamental right. Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in accommodating cohabitation cannot possibly outweigh the defendants\u2019 interest in conforming their conduct to their religious conviction without penalty, regardless of whether, after a trial, a fact finder might be satisfied that \u201cthe rental housing policies of people such as the defendants can [not] be accommodated, at least in the Turners Falls (Montague) area, without significantly impeding the availability of rental housing for people who are cohabiting or wish to cohabit.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 329. Even if \u201cdiscrimination of the sort challenged here [were to] present a significant housing problem if a large percentage of units [were to be] unavailable to cohabitants,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 329, that is, even if discrimination of the sort challenged here were to make it difficult or impossible for unmarried couples to cohabit in Turners Falls or elsewhere, neither the court nor the Legislature can constitutionally give preference or priority to a so-called \u201cright\u201d of cohabitation over the moral and other fundamental values recognized in, and promoted by, the Massachusetts Constitution\u2019s clearly articulated guarantees of the free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The court states that \u201c[t]here are factual circumstances that bear on the question [balancing of the State\u2019s and the defendants\u2019 interests], both as to the existence of a general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>State interest in the elimination of discrimination in housing based on marital status and as to the existence of a particularized State interest in the Turners Falls area. Uniformity of enforcement of the statute may be shown to be the least restrictive means for the practical and efficient operation of the antidiscrimination law.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 331. The court gives no hint of what circumstances could be shown that would permit a reasonable inference that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in eliminating discrimination in housing based on marital status can only be served by punishing landlords for holding fast to the commitments dictated by their religious beliefs. I can envision no such circumstances. This case is not even remotely similar to <em>Bob Jones Univ. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>461 U.S. 574 (1983) (eradication of racial discrimination in education is compelling State interest, superseding any free exercise right of petitioners) or <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252 (1982) (overriding interest in operation of national social security system is compelling) cited by Justice Wilkins. <em>Ante </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The court can safely say, and should hold, that it is clear from the submissions in this case that the Commonwealth has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of its case. The court should affirm summary judgment for the defendants. If the Massachusetts Constitution is to be effectively amended by giving rights of cohabitation preferred status over an individual\u2019s right to live according to his or her religiously-informed conscience, a result I do not recommend, that amendment should be achieved by lawful procedures for constitutional amendment, not by judicial fiat.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
