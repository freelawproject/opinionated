App. Ct. 800 (1994). The defendant Mangano argues that, as a coemployee of the plaintiff, he is immune from liability in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The plaintiff argues that the Appeals Court erred in applying the traditional workers\u2019 compensation \u201ccourse of employment\u201d standard in determining whether Mangano as a coemployee was immune from tort liability under the workers\u2019 compensation act. G. L. c. 152 (1992 ed.). We shall also consider whether the Appeals Court applied the proper rule of law in determining whether the defendant was acting in the course of his employment, where arguably he.was acting either for a job-related purpose or for a personal reason, or perhaps both, when the plaintiff was injured. We conclude that the Appeals Court properly reversed the summary judgment entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The Appeals Court opinion correctly summarizes the evidence presented on the summary judgment record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff [Mulford] and the defendant [Mangano] were employed at a Papa Gino\u2019s restaurant in Stoneham. On April 23, 1987, Mulford worked his regular shift as a dishwasher. Mangano, employed as a cook, was not scheduled to work that day but came to the restaurant around 9:00 p.m. for two reasons, according to his deposition testimony. He came to observe the cashing-out procedure followed by the managers at the end of the day, in the hope of learning skills to become in time a manager himself, and also to watch the end of a Boston Celtics playoff game, on a television that had been installed by employees, for the playoffs, in a back room of the restaurant. He had watched an earlier part of the telecast at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u201cMangano was to give Mulford a ride home; both left the restaurant around 11:00 p.m. and proceeded to the restaurant parking lot. There, in circumstances that are disputed, Mulford fell from the hood of Mangano\u2019s automobile as Mangano backed it from its space.\u201d <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 800-801.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Appeals Court assumed, and no party has objected, \u201cthat Mangano was not scheduled to work the evening of the accident, that he had not been encouraged by the employer to learn managers\u2019 skills, that cashing out was no part of his duties as a cook, that he did not punch the time clock on coming or leaving, and that he did not expect to be paid or otherwise credited for his presence that evening.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The plaintiff brought this action to recover for his injuries. Mangano moved for summary judgment on the ground that he was a coemployee entitled to immunity under the workers\u2019 compensation act. A Superior Court judge allowed summary judgment for the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we have said, we agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion that summary judgment was inappropriately entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">First we state that the coemployee immunity rule under G. L. c. 152 involves the same \u201ccourse of employment\u201d standard that determines whether an employee is acting in the course of employment and thus is entitled workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Compensation is available, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u00a7 26 (1992 ed.), to an employee (who has not preserved his common law rights) who receives a personal injury \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d If \u201ccompensation benefits are available under G. L. c. 152, an employee injured in the course of his employment by the negligence of a fellow employee may not recover from that fellow employee if he also was acting in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Saharceski </em>v. <em>Marcure, </em>373 Mass. 304, 306 (1977). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15 (next to last sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The plaintiff wants us to conclude that a defendant may rely on the coemployee immunity rule only when the defendant, as a fellow servant, was acting within the <em>scope </em>of his employment, a tort principle applied to determine whether a master is liable for the negligence of a servant. See <em>Wang Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 854, 859-860 (1986); L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 211, at 228 (2d ed. 1981). Our cases have implicitly rejected this rule of narrower range and have used the <em>course </em>of employment standard in dealing with coemployee immunity claims. See <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, </em>400 Mass. 131, 134-135 (1987); <em>Saharceski </em>v. <em>Marcure, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593, 597 (1934).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rule which we apply and which the Appeals Court applied is the majority rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>this country among States providing tort immunity for coemployees. See 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 72.23, at 14-171 \u2014 14-174 (1993) (\u201cThe more satisfactory test, unless expressly ruled out by statute, . . . simply use[s] the regular workmen\u2019s compensation course of employment standard\u201d); Annot., 21 A.L.R. 3d 845, 876-879 (1968 &amp; Supp. 1993). The use of a course of employment rule provides a ready source of law for deciding claims of coemployee immunity. It also protects a coemployee to the same degree as the employer from common law liability for the coemployee\u2019s negligence, thereby not leaving the coemployee standing alone to face a common law claim. This protection for the coemployee is part of the exchange for the employee\u2019s surrender of common law rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In what we have just said, we have expressed no disagreement with what the Appeals Court stated on the same subject (except for our emphasis that the phrase \u201ccourse of employment\u201d should be used and not \u201cscope of employment\u201d). In fact, we agree with the Appeals Court on a number of points: (1) the plaintiff, as a matter of law, was injured in the course of his employment in his employer\u2019s parking lot as he was leaving work, <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 801; (2) the question in this case is whether the defendant Mangano was acting in the course of his employment, <em>id. </em>at 801-802; (3) in deciding that question \u201c[i]t is enough if he is upon his employer\u2019s premises occupying himself consistently with his contract of hire in some manner pertaining to or incidental to his employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 802, quoting <em>Souza\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 332, 335 (1944); (4) if Mangano had gone to his place of employment solely to watch a basketball game and he did only that, he would not have qualified for coemployee immunity, <em>id.', </em>and (5) if he had been there solely with the bona fide and reasonable job-related purpose of upgrading his job skills and his employer knowing of it did not discourage such activity, he would have been acting within the course of his employment and entitled to coemployee immunity, <em>id. </em>at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The issue here is what to do when it appears that there may have been or were two purposes, one that would make the injury compensable and one that would not. \u201cWhile an employee may have more than one motive for performing an act, as long as one significant purpose is related to the employment the employee will be considered to be acting in the course of her employment.\u201d <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, supra </em>at 134-135. See Locke, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 247. The question then becomes what proof is required to demonstrate that the job-related purpose was a \u201csignificant\u201d one. The Appeals Court\u2019s opinion correctly did not say that, where an employee acts for two purposes, one that would make the injury compensable and another that would not, the employee\u2019s testimony is controlling as to whether a particular purpose was or was not a significant reason for his action. See <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 803-804. Such an exclusively subjective source for determining the presence or absence of a job-related purpose for an employee\u2019s action would be inappropriate. It would involve a difficult factual inquiry and might well be unreliable because circumstances may tend to lead the employee to opt for the answer, which, in an after-the-fact assessment, appears more likely to benefit him financially. We thus reject any test that looks solely to an employee\u2019s state of mind to see if the job-related purpose was so significant that he would have acted on that motive even if the private purpose had not existed. If we were to adopt such a test, summary judgment in this case would likely be inappropriate in any event because Mangano\u2019s motive, intent, or state of mind and his credibility would be the major issues. See <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 809 (1991), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We favor a more objective test which assesses what the employee did and other facts in order to determine whether he acted at least in part for a job-related purpose. See <em>Mandell\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 328, 330 (1948). An employee\u2019s state of mind at the time he acted is relevant, but, as we have said, it is not controlling. In determining whether Mangano was acting in the course of his employment, evidence of what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>did at the restaurant that night and at any other time concerning the learning of the cashing-out process would be relevant. We agree with the Appeals Court that the employer\u2019s encouragement or discouragement, if any, of employees\u2019 attempts to learn the cashing-out process and other similar job skills bears on the question whether the defendant was acting in the course of his employment. <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, supra </em>at 803. What employees knew about management\u2019s attitude toward such training would also be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The absence of any evidence of what Mangano actually did that night and had done previously concerning the cashing-out process and the absence of evidence of his employer\u2019s attitude toward such job-skills training make the award of summary judgment inappropriate. Mangano\u2019s uncontroverted testimony that one of his reasons for going to the restaurant that evening was job related, although relevant to the question, does not establish for summary judgment purposes that his job-related purpose was a significant reason for his presence at the restaurant. Objective evidence might warrant a contrary finding, and the summary judgment record does not foreclose the possibility that objective evidence would do so. Hence, because there is a genuine issue of material fact on the question whether he was acting within the course of his employment, Mangano was not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\">In fairness to the motion judge, we should note that the distinction between \u201cscope of employment\u201d and \u201ccourse of employment\u201d asserted by the plaintiff on appeal was not advanced in the memoranda submitted to her on the summary judgment question. Mangano\u2019s deposition which provides the facts on which, by assent of both parties, the issues on appeal are argued apparently was not presented to the judge until the plaintiff moved for reconsideration of the order allowing summary judgment for the defendant. The defendant did not argue, and does not now argue, that issues of mixed purpose coemployee activity were not properly before the Appeals Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The plaintiff strenuously argues to the contrary in his supplemental brief to this court filed after we allowed further appellate review in this case. The point was presented less clearly in the plaintiffs original appellate brief. The Appeals Court opinion does not analyze the point but cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>rectly applies the rule we now expressly recognize. See <em>Mulford </em>v. <em>Mangano, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 800, 801-802 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\">It is true that from time to time opinions (as did the Appeals Court opinion in this case) have used the phrases \u201cscope of employment\u201d and \u201ccourse of employment\u201d interchangeably, but never with any suggestion that the correct test for purposes of the coemployee immunity rule, \u201ccourse of employment\u201d meant anything different from \u201ccourse of employment\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation coverage purposes. See, e.g., <em>O'Connell </em>v. <em>Chasdi, </em>400 Mass. 686, 690-691 (1987); <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Tin Kee Ng, </em>400 Mass. 131, 134-135 (1987); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Miettinen, </em>317 Mass. 633, 635 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The very name of the analogous common law \u201cfellow servant rule\u201d suggests that the tort law \u201cscope of employment\u201d principle applies because it applies only to those agents who were servants acting in the scope of their employment. This case does not involve the common law fellow servant rule. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 15, refers to the \u201cinsured person\u2019s employees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b435-7\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbA\">(concurring). The plaintiff and the defendant were employed at a Papa Gino\u2019s restaurant. The defendant was employed as a cook. When the plaintiff was injured in the restaurant parking lot, the defendant was also in the lot. However, the defendant had not been scheduled to work and had not worked that day. Instead, according to his deposition testimony, his reasons for being at the restaurant were to watch television and to observe the cashing-out procedure followed by the restaurant managers. His purpose in observ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ing the cashing-out procedure was to gain knowledge that might help him to become a manager some day.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">I agree with the court that the defendant is not entitled to summary judgment and that the judgment must be reversed. The defendant\u2019s purpose for being at the restaurant when the plaintiff was injured is an essential component of his coemployee immunity defense, and the plaintiff cannot properly be foreclosed from litigating that matter. As the Appeals Court said, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 800, 804 (1994), \u201cWhere a party\u2019s motive or state of mind is at issue, summary judgment is rarely appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">I write separately only to express my disagreement with the court in one important respect. The court states its agreement with the Appeals Court that, if the defendant had been on the restaurant property \u201csolely with the bona fide and reasonable job-related purpose of upgrading his job skills and his .employer knowing of it did not discourage such activity, he would have been acting within the course of his employment and entitled to coemployee immunity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 411. It is obvious from the context that the \u201cjob-related purpose of upgrading his job skills\u201d to which the court refers is the defendant\u2019s objective of acquiring familiarity with a managerial job, a job other than the one he was employed to do. There is, of course, no suggestion by anyone that the defendant\u2019s objective also was to upgrade his cooking skills. It is clear, then, that the court is of the view that an employee, who goes onto his employer\u2019s property for the sole purpose of preparing himself for a job which he has not been employed to do, is acting in the course of his employment for workers\u2019 compensation benefit purposes, in addition to coemployee immunity purposes, if his employer failed to discourage the practice after learning of it. The result is that an employee who is injured in such circumstances may be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits despite the fact that the employee was serving his own interests and none of his employer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">I would agree that an employee, who goes onto his employer\u2019s property with his employer\u2019s permission to make observations for the purpose of improving his performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the job he was employed to do, would be acting in the course of his employment. I would agree, too, that an employee, who acts in response to his employer\u2019s express or implicit encouragement to go onto the property to acquire information about other jobs, would be acting in the course of his employment. It is a very different proposition, however, and one with which I do not agree, to say that an employee acts in the course of his employment if he goes onto his employer\u2019s property to serve an interest of the employee alone and the employer, aware of the employee\u2019s interest but not sharing it, fails to discourage that conduct. The court cites no case, and I am aware of none, that supports such an unfair proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The defendant\u2019s deposition testimony establishes, favorably to the plaintiff, that neither of the defendant\u2019s purposes for being on his employer\u2019s property was related to cooking, which was the job he was employed to do. Furthermore, the defendant has not established for summary judgment purposes that he was explicitly or implicitly encouraged by his employer to be on the employer\u2019s premises to observe cashing-out procedures. In my view, that is a second reason why the summary judgment for the defendant that was entered in the Superior Court should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
