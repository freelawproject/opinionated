On American\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the Superior Court judge ordered Imperial to defend Ayer. After Imperial failed to do so, American and Ayer filed motions for summary judgment seeking reimbursement for fees and costs incurred by American in defending and settling the litigation. The Superior Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and Imperial filed a notice of appeal as to both the partial summary judgment and the summary judgment orders. We granted the parties\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">1. <em>The facts. </em>On March 2, 1985, Ayer police officer Bradley Madge engaged in a high speed pursuit of a motor vehicle operated by Andrew C. Davis. During this pursuit, the automobile driven by Davis collided with a motor vehicle operated by Joseph Crowley, Jr., causing injuries to Crowley, Jared Crowley (Crowley\u2019s son), and Christopher Deforge, a passenger in the Davis vehicle. Following the accident, both the Crowleys and Deforge initiated legal actions against Ayer alleging, among other things, that Ayer was negligent in its failure to develop policies and procedures with respect to high speed pursuits and in its failure adequately to train and supervise its police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">2. <em>The duty to defend. </em>The law enforcement professional liability insurance policy which Imperial issued to Ayer states that Imperial \u201cwill pay on behalf of [Ayer] all sums [up to $1,000,000] which [Ayer] shall become legally obliged to pay as damages because of wrongful acts arising out of Law Enforcement activities.\u201d The policy further provides that Imperial \u201cshall have the right and duty to defend any claim or suit against [Ayer] seeking damages on account of such wrongful acts, even if the allegations of the claim or suit are groundless, false or fraudulent . . . .\u201d However, exclusion D of this policy specifies that the policy does not apply \u201c[t]o acts or occurrences arising out of the ownership, operation, use, loading or unloading of any land motor vehicle . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201c[I]f the allegations of the [underlying] complaint are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\u201d <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 146 (1984). Imperial points out that the occurrence which is the subject of the underlying claims in this case arose from the use of a \u201cland motor vehicle.\u201d Therefore, Imperial contends, the automobile exclusion provision of the law enforcement professional liability insurance policy operates to deny coverage under these facts. We agree that the automobile exclusion provision applies to Ayer\u2019s claim for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Citing <em>Worcester Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>398 Mass. 240 (1986), Ayer and American argue that our determination concerning the applicability of the automobile exclusion is not dispositive of this action. In <em>Marnell, supra </em>at 244, we held that the applicability of the automobile exclusion provi-. sion in a homeowner\u2019s policy did not relieve the insurer of its duty to indemnify and defend its insureds against a lawsuit alleging that the insureds\u2019 negligent supervision of their minor son in their home resulted in the son operating <em>his </em>motor vehicle in an intoxicated state and, thereby, precipitated a fatal automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u201c[T]he favored interpretation of an insurance policy is one which \u2018best effectuates the main manifested design of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marnell, supra </em>at 245, quoting <em>King </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 46, 50 (1971), and <em>Joseph E. Bennett Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>344 Mass. 99, 103-104 (1962). The purpose behind the automobile exclusion at issue in <em>Marnell, supra, </em>was to \u201cprevent [ ] the homeowners\u2019 policy from providing additional insurance, without a premium, to an insured when a motor vehicle owned or operated by that person is involved in an accident causing bodily injuries or property damage.\u201d <em>Marnell, supra </em>at 245. As the Appeals Court noted in <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 353, 358 (1990), \u201c[t]he homeowner who owns and operates an automobile ordinarily procures automobile insurance and also determines the amount of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>coverage. The homeowner can reasonably be expected to rely on that coverage for activities related to the ownership and operation of a motor vehicle unless ... a premium is paid for supplemental automobile insurance under the homeowner\u2019s policy. In contrast, when the homeowner is subjected to claims as a social host or negligent supervisor for actions of persons operating vehicles owned by others, the homeowner does not usually control the amount of automobile insurance covering the operator or owner of such vehicles.\u201d Therefore, \u201cthe owner or operator of a motor vehicle involved in an automobile accident causing bodily injuries or property damage is not entitled to be defended against claims of negligent supervision in the home or against analogous claims, such as social host liability. In contrast, however, the insureds under the homeowners\u2019 policy who are <em>not </em>the owners or operators of the vehicle involved and against whom such claims are brought do not lose coverage by reason of the automobile exclusion.\u201d <em>Sampson, supra </em>at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s reasoning. The question whether the liability associated with an automobile accident should be covered by a law enforcement professional liability insurance policy is analogous to the question whether such liability should be covered by a homeowner\u2019s policy. We must, therefore, apply the same analysis. We conclude that, because Ayer owned the police cruiser involved in the motor vehicle accident, the automobile exclusion provision in the law enforcement policy relieves Imperial of any duty to indemnify and defend Ayer with respect to claims arising from that accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The partial summary judgment order issued below requiring Imperial to defend Ayer and the summary judgment order requiring Imperial to contribute to the settlement and the attorney\u2019s fees are both vacated and this case is remanded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the Superior Court for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\"> Because we vacate the entry of summary judgment against Imperial on the ground that it had no duty to indemnify or defend Ayer, we need not consider the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
