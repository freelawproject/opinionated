GLIB is a social organization consisting of individuals who are homosexual or bisexual and their supporters. GLIB was formed to march in the annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day-Evacuation Day Parade<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> held in South Boston. GLIB\u2019s purposes are to express its members\u2019 pride in their dual identities as Irish or Irish-American persons who are also homosexual or bisexual, to demonstrate to the Irish-American community and to the gay, lesbian, and bisexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>community the diversity within those respective communities, and to show support for the Irish-American homosexual and bisexual men and women in New York City who were seeking to participate in that city\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">GLIB submitted an application to the council to march in the 1992 parade. The council denied the application, citing \u201csafety reasons \u00e1nd insufficient information regarding [the] social club.\u201d Ultimately, GLIB was allowed to march in the 1992 parade under court order, with several restrictions placed on its participation that were not applied to other participants in the parade.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The following year, GLIB sought permission to participate in the 1993 parade. The council refused to admit the group, asserting that the \u201cdecision to exclude groups with sexual themes merely formalized that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values.\u201d The judge found that excluding groups with sexual themes was itself a form of discrimination in violation of the public accommodation law\u2019s prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">At trial, Hurley \u201cequivocated about his reasons for excluding GLIB\u201d but ultimately testified that he would never allow them to march in the parade.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the inconsistent and changing explanations for excluding GLIB demonstrated the \u201cpretextual nature\u201d of those explanations. The judge found that GLIB was excluded from the parade because of the sexual orientation of its members. Based on our review of the record before us, we cannot say that this finding of the judge was clearly erroneous. Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 384 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The judge concluded also that the parade constitutes a public accommodation under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A (quoted, <em>infra </em>at 246). In arriving at that conclusion, the judge relied on the lack of selectivity exerted by the veterans over the parade\u2019s participants and sponsors and the parade\u2019s historical roots. The judge found that \u201c[djuring the first half of this century, the South Boston Citizens Association and the City of Boston organized the various Evacuation Day activities. In 1901, the City celebrated the 125th anniversary of Evacuation Day by a parade, artillery salute, concert, and fireworks display, among other events. In 1947 Mayor James Michael Curley granted the [council] authority to organize and conduct the Parade. Since that time, the City has annually granted the [council] a parade permit. No other applicant has applied for the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u201cOver the years, the Parade has featured as many as 20.000 participants and as many as 1,000,000 spectators. In 1992, the Parade featured about 10,000 participants and 750.000 spectators. The 1993 Parade, postponed due to inclement weather, had fewer than 10,000 participants, about 400.000 spectators, and was aired live by Boston\u2019s community access cable television channel. The Parade is one of the six largest parades held in Boston annually, and the largest New England event for Irish-Americans, their friends, and well-wishers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The Parade has followed substantially the same route in South Boston for at least forty-seven years, \u201cproviding entertainment, amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike.\u201d The council has demonstrated a lack of selectivity in admitting participants and sponsors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>characterized the parade by noting that \u201cthe interests and viewpoints represented are truly catholic: commercial . . . , religious . . . , political. . . , eleemosynary . . . , patriotic . . . , moral. . . , theatrical. . . , athletic . . . , public service . . . , trade union . . . , and so on. Indeed, since 1947 the only groups that have been excluded from the Parade besides GLIB have been the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (Restore our Alienated Rights). Neither of these groups, however, is protected by M. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATFa\">Additionally, the judge found that there are no written procedures, criteria, or standards for selecting participants or sponsors of the parade. Participants from previous parades are sent an application for the upcoming parade. Those who have not previously participated and who inquire about participation in the upcoming parade are sent applications. Some groups receive reimbursement for their parade-related expenses. The council votes on applications for participation in \u201cbatches,\u201d and the council generally does not inquire into the message or views of each applicant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Certain groups or individuals have been allowed to participate in the parade even if they have not submitted an application prior to the parade. In 1993, members of the Boston Bruins hockey club merely showed up at the start of the parade and were permitted to march, without having filed an application. Others, such as the Massachusetts Water Pollution Control Association and several mayoral candidates, gained entrance by making a contribution to the parade without filling out an application. The judge concluded that the procedures for admittance into the parade were not uniformly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Based on the foregoing, the judge concluded that \u201cit is impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the First Amendment. . . . [T]he [council\u2019s] Parade is not an exercise of their constitutionally protected right of expressive association. It is an open recreational event that is subject to the public accommodation law. . . . [T]he [council\u2019s] exclusion of GLIB from the . . . Parade violates M. G. L. C. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98, the public accommodations law; absent state action, the exclusion does not violate GLIB\u2019s rights under the Federal Constitution; the broadly inclusive Parade is not constitutionally protected expressive association; the [council\u2019s] cross-claims that the City has violated their constitutional and statutory rights are meritless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The judge dismissed GLIB\u2019s claims against the city and entered judgment for the city on those claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge dismissed the council\u2019s cross claims against the city and entered judgment for the city on those claims. Finally, the judge issued the following order: \u201cThe defendants South Bos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ton Allied War Veterans Council, John J. \u201cWacko\u201d Hurley, their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and all other persons in active concert or participation with them who have actual notice of this Order: (a) are permanently enjoined from discriminating against the plaintiff on the basis of sexual orientation with respect to participation in the defendant\u2019s annual St. Patrick\u2019s/Evacuation Day Parade; (b) shall accommodate in the Parade in all respects representatives of the plaintiff on the terms and conditions generally applicable to all other Parade participants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The plaintiffs invoked and the judge essentially relied on the public accommodation law, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98. Among the prohibitions in those sections is the prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation in the admission to or treatment in any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98. \u201cA place of public accommodation, resort or amusement\u201d is \u201cdefined as and shall be deemed to include any place, whether licensed or unlicensed, which is open to and accepts or solicits the patronage of the general public and, without limiting the generality of this definition, whether or not it be (1) an inn, tavern, hotel, shelter, roadhouse, motel, trailer camp or resort for transient or permanent guests or patrons seeking housing or lodging, food, drink, entertainment, health, recreation or rest; (2) a carrier, conveyance or elevator for the transportation of persons, whether operated on land, water or in the air, and the stations, terminals and facilities appurtenant thereto; (3) a gas station, garage, retail store or establishment, including those dispensing personal services; (4) a restaurant, bar or eating place, where food, beverages, confections or their derivatives are sold for consumption on or off the premises; (5) a rest room, barber shop, beauty parlor, bathhouse, seashore facilities or swimming pool, except such rest room, bathhouse or seashore facility as may be segregated on the basis of sex; (6) <em>a boardwalk or other public highway, </em>(7) an auditorium, theatre, music hall, meeting place or hall, including the commons halls of buildings; (8) <em>a place of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment-, </em>(9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>a public library, museum or planetarium; or (10) a hospital, dispensary or clinic operating for profit . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A.</p>\n<p id=\"A_n\">The judge ruled that the parade was a place of public accommodation within the ambit of \u00a7 92A. The language of \u00a7 92A itself and our case law require that the statute be given a broad and inclusive interpretation. <em>Concord Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>402 Mass. 716, 720 (1988). <em>Local Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>355 Mass. 10, 14 (1968). Section 92A itself specifically includes \u201ca boardwalk or other public highway,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A (6), and also includes \u201ca place of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A (8). The plain language of the statute shows that the St. Patrick\u2019s Day-Evacuation Day Parade falls within the scope of the public accommodation law. The parade occurs on the public streets of South Boston. Nothing in \u00a7 92A or any other statute suggests that a boardwalk or other public highway loses its character as a place of public accommodation, resort, or amusement, which it gains by operation of that statute, merely because a parade is conducted there. Given that the statute is remedial and was intended to be interpreted broadly and in-elusively, <em>Concord Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc., supra, </em>such a narrowing interpretation would be contrary to the intent of the Legislature which we have heretofore perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"AvO\">In addition, the judge found that the parade provides entertainment, recreation, and amusement to the participants as well as to the spectators, and that, in essence, almost any individual or group would be admitted to the parade if they either apply or show up at the start of the parade and offer to make a contribution to the council.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We cannot say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>based on the evidence in the record before us, that these findings by the trial judge were clearly erroneous. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 384 (1993). Thus, the parade additionally falls within the public accommodation law under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A (8).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The defendants assert that the public accommodation law, as applied to the parade, violates their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In discuss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ing the First Amendment rights of the defendants, the judge referred to their right of expressive association. See generally <em>Directors of Rotary Int\u2019l </em>v. <em>Rotary Club of Duarte, </em>481 U.S. 537, 544-549 (1987). On appeal, the defendants argue that their right to freedom of speech was implicated and that this right, see generally <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 152 (1969), not their right of expressive association, was the operative right in this case. For the purposes of this case, however, we need not decide whether the free speech rights or the expressive association right, or both, might be implicated by the factual situation asserted by the defendants. This is so because, as the judge found, it is \u201cimpossible to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade to protection under the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">The defendants assert that a parade is a \u201cpristine form of speech,\u201d and refer us to <em>New York County Bd. of Ancient Order of Hibernians </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>814 F. Supp. 358 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (Hibernians), among other cases. That case involved a group of homosexuals and bisexuals who wanted to march in the New York City St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. <em>Id. </em>at 360-361. At the outset, we note that <em>Hibernians </em>is distinguishable from the facts of this case because in <em>Hibernians, </em>the judge found that the Ancient Order of Hibernians in fact had used the parade as a means of expression, that the admission process was selective, and that it had adopted rules to prevent parade participants from using that parade as a forum to express views inconsistent with the views of the Ancient Order of Hibernians or the Roman Catholic Church. <em>Hibernians, supra </em>at 361-362, 367.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such is not the case here. Furthermore, contrary to the assumption of the defendants, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>every parade is per se an exercise of those rights protected by the First Amendment. <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, supra </em>(\u201cparading <em>may </em>nonetheless <em>constitute </em>[a] method [ ] of expression entitled to First Amendment protection\u201d [emphasis supplied]).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In order to rely on the protections of the First Amendment for speech or expressive association, the defendants initially had to demonstrate that the parade truly was an exercise of those First Amendment rights. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293 n.5 (1984). This, the judge found, they did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In arguing for reversal, the defendants point to evidence in the record suggesting that the parade did have an intended message (i.e., that the parade was intended as an expressive vehicle). This evidence and other extensive evidence, including a videotape of the 1993 parade, however, were before the judge when he made his decision, and we assume that he considered all the evidence. It was for the judge to assign the appropriate weight and credibility to the evidence presented to him. The defendants failed to demonstrate and, on our own review of the record, we could not conclude that the findings of the judge were clearly erroneous. Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a). <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>supra.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ao-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the judge committed no error when he found that the defendants discriminated against the plaintiffs because of the plaintiffs\u2019 sexual orientation in refusing to admit them into the parade, which is a place of public accommodation. Likewise, there was no error in his finding that the parade was not used by the council for expressive purposes, and that, as a result, the defendants could not cloak their discriminatory acts in the mantle of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"ATj\">The defendants argue that the public accommodation law, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98, is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. It does not appear from the record, submitted by the defendants, that they raised these issues below. We shall address them nevertheless because the claim is of possible public significance and because we can dispose of them briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"AMd\">The defendants argue that the public accommodation law is overbroad because it reaches constitutionally protected speech in that it allows the court to examine the content of speech with standardless discretion. This is not so. By their terms, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A and 98, facially do not reach speech or expression or association protected by the First Amendment. They do not allow a judge, or any public official, to examine the content of speech.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nor would we inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>pret those sections so that they could reach and unconstitutionally infringe on speech. Cf. <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, Minn., </em>505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992); <em>Forsyth County, Ga. </em>v. <em>Nationalist Movement, </em>505 U.S. 123, 130-131 (1992); <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613 (1973).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We already have concluded that, in this case, the public accommodation law did not infringe on the defendants\u2019 First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The defendants\u2019 vagueness argument is that \u201c \u2018men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the] meaning [of the public accommodation law].\u2019 <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., 269 </em>U.S. 385, 391 (1926).\u201d The defendants argue this is true, because three State judges (two in the Superior Court and one in the Appeals Court) have interpreted the statutes as reaching parades and one Federal judge has suggested that the statute was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We note that the judges mentioned by the defendants did not find that the statute applied to parades in general, but rather to the St. Patrick\u2019s Day-Evacuation Day Parade in particular, because of the unique characteristics of the parade. The defendants\u2019 argument rests on the assumption that the statute reaches their speech. The judge below found and we have affirmed, however, that the defendants did not prove that they truly were exercising First Amendment rights. Thus, their vagueness argument fails because it rests on a faulty assumption. Furthermore, the public accommodation law gives persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, provides standards to those who must enforce those laws, and does not inhibit the valid exercise of First Amendment rights. See <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Because the defendants had no right to discriminate against members of GLIB, by operation of logic the city could not possibly have interfered with or infringed on any of their rights as asserted by the defendants. Thus, the judge properly dismissed the defendants\u2019 cross claims against the city.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-15\">The council is an unincorporated association consisting of members elected from various South Boston veterans\u2019 groups.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b261-16\">Unless otherwise indicated, we use the term \u201cdefendants\u201d to refer to the council and to Hurley, collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-17\">We acknowledge the assistance provided to us by the briefs of the amici, Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-18\">We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.

Under the defendants\u2019 reasoning, a restaurant which admits only diners who have made reservations or those who generously tip the maitre d\u2019 would be exempt from the public accommodation laws.

See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1727 (1961). In light of the remedial nature of this statute, and the Legislature\u2019s intention that it be interpreted broadly and with an eye toward inclusiveness, we cannot adopt the restrictive definition of \u201cplace\u201d advanced by the defendants. <em>Concord Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>402 Mass. 716, 720 (1988). <em>Local Fin.

This assertion is especially puzzling in light of the detailed and exhaustive discussion by the judge of the evidence which led him to conclude that the parade was a civic, nonexpressive celebration.

Today will be regarded as a sad and frustrating day in the history of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Today, a majority of this court upholds, and thereby endorses, a trial judge\u2019s flagrant violation of the free speech rights, of citizens of this Commonwealth. The majority acquiesces in a judge\u2019s order instructing a private group that if it wishes to express itself at all, it must include in its expression a particular idea, one with which the group does not agree. One must strain to recall or even to imagine such an obvious violation of the revered right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The majority upholds a Superior Court judge\u2019s decision that the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council\u2019s (Veterans Council) exclusion of the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston (GLIB) from the St. Patrick\u2019s Day-Evacuation Day Parade violates GLIB\u2019s members\u2019 statutory right to be free from discrimination on the basis of their sexual preference in places of public accommodation, and that the application of the statute to the facts of this case does not violate the Veterans Council\u2019s rights under the First Amendment. It is because I conclude that the Veterans Council\u2019s rights were violated by the judge\u2019s decision and order compelling it to allow GLIB to march and express its message in the Veterans Council\u2019s parade that I dissent from the decision of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">1. <em>G.

I reserve extended discussion on these matters, however, and proceed to issues concerning rights under the First Amendment. I shall assume for the purpose of the following discussion that the statute applies to the conduct of the Veterans Council.</p>\n<p id=\"A-P\">2. <em>First Amendment. </em>The judge limited his discussion of the First Amendment to the freedom of expressive associatian. He ruled that the freedom of speech was not at issue. This determination is erroneous. The defendants\u2019 freedom of speech is certainly at issue in this case \u2014 and was properly raised and argued<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 and is violated by the judge\u2019s application of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 92A, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">a. <em>Freedom of speech. </em>The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads, in part: \u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d Through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the First Amendment limitation on Congress\u2019s power to legislate is applied to the legislative power of the States. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Jaffree, </em>472 U.S. 38, 48-49 (1985). Further, \u201c[tjhat the action of state courts and judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, is a proposition which has long been established.\u201d <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer, </em>334 U.S. 1, 14 (1948). Thus, it is as constitutionally objectionable for a judge sitting in a court of this Commonwealth to issue an order improperly \u201cabridging the freedom of speech,\u201d as it is for Congress to enact a law doing the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">As a general proposition, the State acts within its power when it enacts reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>tians which affect speech or expression. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>312 U.S. 569, 576 (1941) (\u201cIf a municipality has authority to control the use of its public streets for parades or processions, as it undoubtedly has, it cannot be denied authority to give consideration, without unfair discrimination, to time, place and manner in relation to the other proper uses of the streets\u201d). Conversely, restrictions on the content of speech are generally improper. See <em>Riley </em>v. <em>National Fed\u2019n of the Blind of N.C., </em>487 U.S. 781, 798 (1988) (\u201c[The State\u2019s] content-based regulation is subject to exacting First Amendment scrutiny\u201d); <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 558 (1975), quoting <em>Bantam Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 70 (1963) (\u201cAny system of prior restraint . . . \u2018comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity\u2019 \u201d); <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972) (\u201cgovernment may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views\u201d). The freedom of speech comprises both the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking. <em>Riley, supra </em>at 795. <em>Wooley </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>430 U.S. 705, 715 (1977). Thus, \u201c[t]he First Amendment protects the right of individuals ... to refuse to foster ... an idea they find morally objectionable.\u201d <em>Wooley, supra. </em>\u201cMandating speech that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the content of the speech.\u201d <em>Riley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In the present case, the judge\u2019s decision and order requires the Veterans Council to allow the members of GLIB to march in the parade as an identifiable group.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted by the judge and the majority, GLIB\u2019s organizational purposes are expressive in nature: to express its members\u2019 pride in their sexual preference; to demonstrate to the community the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>diversity which exists therein; and to show support for homosexuals and bisexuals in New York who sought to march in a St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade in New York City. The Veterans Council, as license holder of the St. Patrick\u2019s Day-Evacuatian Day Parade, determines who marches in the parade. Except for GLIB, there would be no group marching in the parade whose message supports homosexuality or bisexuality. Therefore, the judge\u2019s decision and order permitting GLIB to march as an identifiable group results in GLIB\u2019s message being added to the parade. This is \u201c[mjandating speech that [the Veterans Council] would not otherwise make,\u201d and is thus content-based regulation. <em>Riley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Supreme Court cases concerning content-based regulation of speech examine such regulation with a strict scrutiny, or \u201cexacting\u201d scrutiny standard. See, e.g., <em>Riley, supra </em>at 798; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n of Cal., </em>475 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1986); <em>Wooley, supra </em>at 716. If we assume that evisceration of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference is a compelling State interest, the judge\u2019s action in this case is not narrowly tailored to attaining that end: \u201c[T]he State can serve that interest through means that would not violate [defendants\u2019] First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., supra </em>at 19. To compel the Veterans Council to express GLIB\u2019s message is not narrowly tailored to the State\u2019s interest. It unnecessarily hampers the free speech of the Veterans Council. It goes beyond merely regulating discriminatory conduct, and requires a private group, the Veterans Council, to promote GLIB\u2019s ideals. This is unconstitutional: \u201c[Wjhere the State\u2019s interest is to disseminate an ideology, no matter how acceptable to some, such interest cannot outweigh an individual\u2019s First Amendment right to avoid becoming the courier for such message.\u201d <em>Wooley, supra </em>at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is important to note that the Veterans Council does not need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade for it to be protected under the First Amendment. Both the judge and the majority try to illustrate that the parade is a public celebration with no distinct, unified theme; the impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>cation is that it is not expressive activity, and is therefore not worthy of First Amendment protection. This analysis is erroneous for two reasons. First, regardless of whether the parade has one message, ten messages, or no message at all, if GLIB\u2019s particular message is not in the parade, it cannot constitutionally be forced on the Veterans Council. Thus, although an individual who drives his automobile may have no expressive purpose for doing so, the State cannot require him to foster a message while driving that he otherwise would not. <em>Wooley, supra </em>at 717 (violation of the First Amendment to require defendants to display \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d on their license plates). Second, the finding that the parade lacks an expressive purpose is clearly erroneous. The Veterans Council obtains a license, collects funds, and privately organizes the St. Patrick\u2019s Day-Evacuation Day Parade each year. They do so knowing that their efforts will provide entertainment to the hundreds of thousands of spectators who line the streets of the South Boston section of Boston to watch in celebration of St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Evacuation Day. The judge would have us believe that the Veterans Council and all the parade participants show up solely for their own entertainment, and that any entertainment of the viewing public is merely incidental.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This defies logic, yet is just one of many gaps in reason created by the trial judge\u2019s flagrant efforts to forgo extending to the Veterans Council their deserved First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The judge\u2019s order clearly violates the Veterans Council\u2019s freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">b. <em>Freedom of association. </em>The judge determined, and the majority agreed, that the Veterans Council\u2019s First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ment freedom of expressive association is not unconstitutionally infringed by requiring GLIB to march as a group in the parade. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AUF\">The freedom of expressive association is the \u201cright to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment \u2014 speech, [among others].\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984). Much like the related, broader freedom of speech, \u201c[freedom of association . . . plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, citing <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209, 234-235 (1977). Infringements on the right not to associate are examined under strict scrutiny: \u201cInfringements on that right may be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, supra, </em>and cases cited. It is established, however, that, \u201c[i]f a club seeks to exclude individuals who do not share the views that the club\u2019s members wish to promote,\u201d the law may not require association. <em>New York State Club Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>487 U.S. 1,13 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-17\">As discussed above, the Veterans Council organizes the parade for expressive purposes: to entertain the hundreds of thousands of spectators who view the parade each year in celebration of St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Evacuation Day. Again assuming, without deciding, that evisceration of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference is a compelling State interest, State regulation in furtherance of this end must be narrowly tailored to attaining it. Thus, requiring the Veterans Council not to exclude the members of GLIB on the basis of their sexual preference may be a constitutionally valid infringement on the Veterans Council\u2019s rights; however, preeluding the Veterans Council from disallowing the members of GLIB from expressing themselves as a group is not related to the State\u2019s interest, and is therefore unconstitutional. In other words, because the judge\u2019s decision and order require the Veterans Council to allow GLIB to express itself, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>violate the rule that, \u201c[where] a club seeks to exclude individuals who do not share the views that the club\u2019s members wish to promote, the Law [may] erect [ ] no obstacle to this end.\u201d <em>New York State Club Ass\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It is important to note that this case is distinguishable from those that involve exclusion of individuals whose message and protected status may be inseparable. For example, in <em>Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan </em>v. <em>Mayor, Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, &amp; Chief of Police of Thurmont, </em>700 F. Supp. 281 (D. Md. 1988), a private group comprising numerous African Americans sought to enforce against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) an antidiscrimination statute in an effort to participate in the KKK\u2019s planned parade. The Federal District Court determined that permitting the group to participate would be unconstitutional, as the mere presence of African Americans in the KKK\u2019s parade would frustrate the KKK\u2019s message of white separatism. <em>Id. </em>at 289. This is distinguishable from the present case: the mere presence of homosexuals or bisexuals in the parade likely would not frustrate any message of the Veterans Council. This is so because GLIB\u2019s message is separable from its members\u2019 status as homosexuals or bisexuals. Thus, the presence of homosexuals or bisexuals, not outwardly identifiable as such, in the parade would likely not affect any message of the Veterans Council, while the presence of those same individuals marching as an identifiable group \u2014 the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston \u2014 would.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As discussed above, mandating mere association in this case may be constitutional; mandating a message is not. At the very least, the judge\u2019s decision and order, insofar as it compels the Veterans Council to allow the members of GLIB to march and express themselves as a group in the Veterans Council\u2019s parade violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">3. <em>Other matters. </em>Aside from the judge\u2019s improper refusal to address the issue of freedom of speech and his erroneous analysis of the issue of freedom of association, his decision and order includes other serious errors of law, reason, and fact which warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>In his decision, the judge equates excluding a group on the basis of its message or values with exclusion on the basis of its members\u2019 sexual preference: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s final positian was GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message, <em>i.e., its members\u2019 sexual </em>orientation\u201d (emphasis added). This is clear error, and may have led to a baseless finding that the Veterans Council discriminated on the basis of GLIB\u2019s members\u2019 sexual preference. If the Veterans Council excluded GLIB because of its message, and not specifically because of its members\u2019 sexual preference, then the statute was not violated. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 92A. Indeed, overwhelming evidence exists throughout the record which indicates that GLIB was excluded because of its message, and not because of its members\u2019 sexual preference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conversely, the only evidence which supports a finding of discrimination was that many of GLIB\u2019s members are homosexual and GLIB was excluded, and that the Veterans Council had, in the past, proffered different reasons for its decision to exclude GLIB.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">Belatedly, the judge stated that, even if the Veterans Council\u2019s assertion that it excluded GLIB under a policy of excluding all sexual themes was true, \u201c[ejxcluding all sexual themes . . . contravenes the First Amendment\u2019s prohibition on content-based restrictions.\u201d This is a flagrantly erroneous statement of law. The judge found that there was no State action here; certainly private parties may exclude any topic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>or theme they want from their expression. This statement is an example of quintessential content-based regulation of speech which is plainly prohibited by the First Amendment, and it illustrates the confused understanding of the First Amendment by the judge and by this court, through its acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>That the judge\u2019s decision and order requiring the Veterans Council to allow GLIB to march and to express itself as a group is a flagrant violation of the Veterans Council\u2019s First Amendment rights is an unavoidable conclusion. The judge\u2019s crude regulation of the content of the Veterans Council\u2019s speech is epitomized by the last sentence of his decision: \u201cInclusiveness should be the hallmark of [the Veterans Council\u2019s] parade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We have never been in the business of protecting only internally consistent, narrowly focused, politically sensitive speech. It is a travesty that we today vacate this precedent. Our holding today, while, to some, seemingly pushes us forward, really pushes us back over 200 years, to an era that lacked the protection guaranteed by the First Amendment. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-15\">The Veterans Council presented argument on the freedom of speech throughout the proceedings in this case. In particular, argument on the issue was presented at trial, in the defendants\u2019 memorandum in support of proposed findings of facts and proposed conclusions of law, and in the defendants\u2019 briefs on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The judgment states in part: \u201c[The defendants] shall accommodate in the Parade in all respects representatives of [GLIB] on the terms and conditions generally applicable to all other Parade participants.\u201d His decision makes clear that this entails allowing the members of GLIB to march in a group, identifying themselves as members of the group, and identifying the group through a banner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The judge relies on the Supreme Court case of <em>Dallas </em>v. <em>Stanglin, </em>490 U.S. 19, 25 (1989), wherein the Court ruled: \u201cthe activity of . . . dance-hall patrons \u2014 coming together to engage in recreational dancing \u2014 is not protected by the First Amendment.\u201d The case is inapposite. Unlike the participants in the Veterans Council\u2019s parade, patrons in the dance hall did not gather to dance for the purpose of entertaining others in celebration of a holiday. The parade is conducted for the entertainment of hundreds of thousands of people; the dance-hall patrons whose conduct was at issue in <em>Dallas, </em>did not gather for the purpose of entertaining others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b282-18\">There is no evidence in the record that the Veterans Council ever inquired into the sexual preference of any person intending to march in the parade, including the members of GLIB;'there is no evidence that the Veterans Council ever excluded any homosexual or bisexual not a member of GLIB; the judge found that not all members of GLIB are homosexual or bisexual; there is evidence in the record that the Veterans Council would let the members of GLIB march without a banner identifying the group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b282-19\">It is important to note that each of the reasons for excluding GLIB proffered by the Veterans Council is not discriminatory. At various times throughout the past years, the Veterans Council proffered the following reasons for excluding GLIB: the Veterans Council was not provided with enough information about GLIB on its application; it was concerned with the safety of the group\u2019s members and the members of the public; and it excluded all sexual themes from the parade.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
