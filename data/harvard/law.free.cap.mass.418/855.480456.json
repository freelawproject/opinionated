We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">A department review examiner concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s employer had discharged the plaintiff for deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The department\u2019s board of review (board) adopted the review examiner\u2019s findings and affirmed her decision. On appeal, the District Court judge affirmed the decision of the board. The plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">We summarize the findings of the review examiner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Louis Berkman Company (Berkman) manufactures painted barrels. Berkman employed the plaintiff as a storage manager from June 8, 1978, until March 13, 1992. On March 9, 1992, Berkman employees placed approximately sixty painted, barrels, which Berkman had manufactured, on a truck for shipment. Later in the day, a Berkman warehouse manager telephoned the trucking company\u2019s warehouse and advised a manager that the barrels had been placed on the truck by mistake. After the work day had ended, the plaintiff drove to the warehouse and loaded the barrels into a private van, removing the barrels from those premises. Berkman, however, has no record that the. plaintiff ever returned the barrels to its warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Prior to the disappearance of the barrels, Berkman\u2019s general manager had become suspicious about the shipment because the barrels were relatively expensive and Berkman rarely sold such a large quantity of that particular type. After investigating the shipment, the general manager suspended the warehouse manager from employment because the warehouse manager had been unable to produce the proper paperwork for the shipment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 13, 1992, the plaintiff, who- was accompanied by a union representative, met with the general manager of Berkman. Although the union representative acknowledged that the plaintiff had removed the barrels from the warehouse, the plaintiff refused to state what had become of the barrels. As a result, the general manager discharged the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The review examiner found that, \u201c[t]he employer reasonably expected an explanation from the [plaintiff] as to what he did with the barrels, which were company property. The [plaintiff] could have met this reasonable expectation by simply telling the employer what he had done with the barrels after he [had] picked them up at a warehouse. The [plaintiff\u2019s] failure to supply the employer with this information was in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, and was deliberate misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The review examiner determined that \u201c[t]he [plaintiff\u2019s] contention that he would have been discharged regardless of the explanation he offered the manager because he noted his discharge papers before he was queried, is rejected. It is not credible that the employer would have discharged the [plaintiff] if he could exonerate himself with an explanation.\u201d As a result, the review examiner concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge \u201cwas attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, within the meaning of Section 25(e)(2) of the Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The plaintiff argues that the review examiner erred when she denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim for unemployment compensation benefits based on the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to state what he had done with the barrels. We disagree and conclude that the review examiner properly applied G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2), in denying the plaintiff\u2019s claim for unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The board is the sole finder of the facts. <em>Guarino </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 89, 92 (1984). Judicial review of the findings and decisions of the board \u201cshall be reviewed in accordance with the standards for review provided in paragraph (7) of section fourteen of chapter thirty A.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our function, therefore, is to determine whether the review examiner applied the correct legal principles in denying unemployment compensation benefits to the plaintiff. <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 626-627 (1984). In addition, we must consider whether the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>view examiner\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">An individual is not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits if his discharge is attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2). In addition, the employer has the burden of proving that an employee should be disqualified for wilful misconduct. <em>Cantres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>396 Mass. 226, 232 (1985). In the present case, the review examiner found that Berkman had discharged the plaintiff for theft of company property. In considering whether the plaintiff was entitled to unemployment benefits, however, the review examiner focused on the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to tell Berkman what had become of the barrels. The plaintiff claims that the review examiner erred as a matter of law in disqualifying the plaintiff from unemployment compensation benefits on the basis of conduct that was not the reason for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">We disagree because Berkman\u2019s decision to discharge the plaintiff and the department\u2019s denial of unemployment benefits arose out of the same basic facts: the plaintiff\u2019s removal of the barrels from the warehouse and his subsequent refusal to state what had become of the barrels. Although the plaintiff\u2019s refusal could have directly supported a finding that he had participated in the theft of the barrels, Berkman did not have to prove that the plaintiff had stolen the barrels to ensure that the review examiner denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Rather, we are content with the review examiner\u2019s finding that Berkman had satisfied its burden of proof once the plaintiff acknowledged that he had removed the barrels from the warehouse and then refused to state what had become of the barrels. Berkman, therefore, satisfied its burden of proof that the plaintiff had acted in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest without having to prove that the plaintiff had participated in the theft of company property. As a result, we hold that the review examiner committed no error in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to tell Berkman what had become of the barrels after they were removed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>warehouse constituted deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of Berkman\u2019s interest within the meaning of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 0) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the review examiner failed to make the necessary subsidiary findings to support the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s behavior constituted deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest. We disagree. The \u201ccritical factual issue in determining whether an employee\u2019s discharge resulted from his wilful or intentional misconduct is the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of his misconduct.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Em</em>p<em>loyment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 779 (1982). In addition, the review examiner\u2019s findings must be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 627-628, citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>376 Mass. 563, 564 (1978). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u2019 taking \u2018into account whatever in the record detracts from its weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., supra </em>at 627-628, quoting <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In the present case, the review examiner focused on the conduct of the plaintiff at the time of the hearing and the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to tell Berkman what he had done with the barrels. In light of the fact that the plaintiff admitted that he had removed the barrels from the warehouse, it is reasonable to conclude that the plaintiff knew where the barrels were located. In addition, because the barrels were Berkman\u2019s property, the plaintiff reasonably should have expected that Berkman would demand the return of the barrels. Absent the return of the barrels, the plaintiff reasonably should have known that Berkman was entitled to an explanation regarding their location. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs refusal was deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of Berkman\u2019s interest. As a result, we are content that the review examiner\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>The plaintiff also contends that the department violated his right against self-incrimination, guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Massachusetts, when the department found that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal constituted \u201cdeliberate misconduct.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">\u201cIn a civil action, a reasonable inference adverse to a party may be drawn from the refusal of that party to testify on the grounds of self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Fall River Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>382 Mass. 465, 471 (1981). See <em>Baxter </em>v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976). Nevertheless, the adverse inference drawn from the silence of a party is insufficient, \u201cby itself, to meet an opponent\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 616 (1986). See <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Palmigiano, supra </em>at 317. Instead, \u201ca case adverse to the interests of the party affected [must be] presented\u201d before an adverse inference may be drawn. <em>Custody of Two Minors, supra </em>at 616, citing <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Silverstein, </em>323 Mass. 239, 240 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In the present case, the plaintiff, who was accompanied by a union representative, attended a meeting with Berkman\u2019s general manager concerning the missing barrels. At the meeting, the union representative acknowledged that the plaintiff had removed the barrels from the warehouse. The plaintiff, however, refused to respond to Berkman\u2019s question concerning what had become of the barrels after they were removed from the warehouse. It was, therefore, permissible for the review examiner to draw an adverse - inference from the plaintiffs silence because other evidence had been presented against the plaintiff. Furthermore, the review examiner did not conclude from the plaintiffs silence that he had participated in the theft of the barrels. Rather, the review examiner viewed the plaintiffs decision to remain silent as wilful disregard of Berkman\u2019s economic interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">General Laws c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) (1990 ed.) states: \u201cNo . . . benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">' \u201c(e) For the period of unemployment next ensuing and until the individual has had at least four weeks of work and in each of said weeks has earned an amount equivalent to or in excess of his weekly benefit amount after he has left work ...

Thus, we must apply the earlier version of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2), because Berkman discharged the plaintiff on March 13, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Since the board adopted the findings of the review examiner, we consider the review examiner\u2019s findings to be the findings of the board. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 1004, 1004 n.2 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The general manager had requested the warehouse manager to produce the proper paperwork for the shipment.
