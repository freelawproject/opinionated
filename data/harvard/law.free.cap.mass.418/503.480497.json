We hold that Part 5 provides coverage in excess of the liability coverage of the vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s policy and that an - insurer\u2019s obligation to pay underinsured motorist benefits is unaffected by its insured\u2019s release of someone legally responsible for the insured\u2019s injuries. Because of our holding, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court judge ordering the defendant, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), to pay the plaintiff, William Gleed, III, underinsured motorist benefits in the amount awarded by an arbitrator and remand this case for a declaration that Aetna has no obligation to pay Gleed underinsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">On October 4, 1984, Gleed was a passenger in an automobile owned by William Bocuzzo and operated by Christopher Daly when it was involved in a single-vehicle accident. Gleed sustained personal injuries as a result. At the time of the accident, Gleed, being a member of his father\u2019s household, was an insured under his father\u2019s personal automobile policy with Aetna. This policy contained underinsured motorist coverage limits of $250,000 per person. With Aetna\u2019s written consent, Gleed settled his claim with Hanover Insurance Company (Hanover), which insured Bocuzzo, for $25,000, the full amount of Bocuzzo\u2019s policy. Subsequently, Gleed released Bocuzzo and Daly from all claims resulting from the accident in consideration for Bocuzzo\u2019s $25,000 policy limit. There is no evidence that Aetna consented to Gleed\u2019s release of Daly. At the time of the accident, Daly, being a member of his father\u2019s household, was an insured under his father\u2019s personal automobile policy with Commercial Union Insurance Company (Commercial Union). This policy contained optional bodily injury coverage in the amount of $100,000 per person.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>On October 4, 1989, Gleed filed a demand for arbitration against Aetna, claiming his entitlement to underinsured motorist benefits pursuant to the policy issued to his father. Aetna refused to arbitrate, claiming that Gleed\u2019s damages must first exhaust the $100,000 limit of Daly\u2019s policy with Commercial Union in addition to the $25,000 limit of the Hanover policy before being liable to Gleed. Gleed then brought an action for declaratory relief in the Superior Court to determine the existing rights between Aetna and himself. Gleed claimed that, upon his settlement with Daly and Bocuzzo, Aetna became liable for underinsured motorist benefits for his damages exceeding $25,000. He sought a declaration that Aetna must proceed to arbitration to decide the amount of his excess damages. Aetna sought a declaration that it is only liable to pay Gleed for his damages in excess of the combined limits of Bocuzzo\u2019s and Daly\u2019s policies. The parties submitted a statement of agreed facts. After a hearing and on cross motions for summary judgment, on June 1, 1992, the judge ruled in favor of Gleed and ordered Aetna to proceed to arbitration and to pay the amount of damages awarded by the arbitrator. The judge declined to address Aetna\u2019s request, stating that Aetna had agreed to submit liability issues to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">On June 3, 1992, the parties proceeded to arbitration. At the time, neither party had notice of the judge\u2019s ruling in the declaratory judgment action. Aetna submitted to arbitration with the proviso that any determination as to damages would only be paid in accordance with the judge\u2019s ruling. Both parties stipulated that the arbitrator was only to decide the amount of Gleed\u2019s damages and not any liability issues. On June 11, 1992, the arbitrator decided that Gleed\u2019s damages totaled $77,000 and ordered Aetna to pay Gleed $50,000, the difference between this amount and what Gleed had already been paid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Aetna timely appealed from the judge\u2019s order. The Appeals Court, in an unpublished memorandum and order under Appeals Court Rule 1:28, affirmed. <em>Gleed </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (1993). In upholding the judge\u2019s failure to declare that Aetna\u2019s liability is only for deed\u2019s damages in excess of the combined limits of Bocuzzo\u2019s and Daly\u2019s policies, the court reasoned that, because the vehicle involved in the accident was not listed on Daly\u2019s policy, there was no coverage under that policy. We granted Aetna\u2019s application for further appellate review. We reverse the judgment of the Superior Court for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">As noted above, the judge ruled on the parties\u2019 cross-motians for summary judgment based on a statement of agreed facts. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when . . . there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). <em>Community Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 553 (1976).\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bearce, </em>412 Mass. 442, 446 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In declining to decide whether deed\u2019s damages would have to exhaust Daly\u2019s policy limit of $100,000 in addition to Bocuzzo\u2019s policy limit of $25,000 before Aetna becomes liable to deed for underinsured motorist benefits, the judge, noting that the parties had agreed to resolve liability issues in arbitration, reasoned that the question required him to decide the liability issue whether Daly was legally responsible for deed\u2019s injuries. Although the judge was correct in noting that the parties had agreed to submit the issue of Daly\u2019s legal responsibility to an arbitrator,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he erred in concluding that this precluded him from deciding whether deed\u2019s damages needed first to exhaust Daly\u2019s policy before Aetna is liable to pay underinsured motorist benefits. This is because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Aetna could only be liable for underinsured motorist benefits if Daly was legally responsible for Gleed\u2019s injuries<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, if Daly was legally responsible, Aetna\u2019s liability could be resolved by addressing the two coverage issues submitted to the judge. These two issues were: whether Daly\u2019s policy provided liability coverage for Daly even though he was the permissive operator of a vehicle not listed on his policy and, if so, whether Aetna is nevertheless obligated to pay Gleed under-insured motorist benefits prior to the exhaustion of Daly\u2019s policy limit because Gleed released Daly from liability. The judge should have addressed these issues. These issues merely required an interpretation of the applicable language of the polices in question. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Poirier, </em>371 Mass. 257, 259-260 (1976). The judge\u2019s failure to address these issues, in practical effect, decided these issues against Aetna. We address both questions and conclude that, assuming Daly was legally responsible for Gleed\u2019s injuries, Aetna is only obligated to pay Gleed his damages in excess of the combined limits of Bocuzzo\u2019s and Daly\u2019s policies. Since this amount is $125,000 and since an arbitrator has found that Gleed\u2019s damages total only $77,000, Aetna therefore would have no liability. Thus, regardless of Daly\u2019s legal responsibility for Gleed\u2019s injuries, Aetna has no liability to pay Gleed underinsured motorist benefits. Before addressing the two coverage issues, we briefly review the relevant policy language and legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>\u201c[UJnderinsured motorist coverage entitles the policyholder to recover from <em>two </em>sources, the tortfeasor <em>and </em>the provider of underinsured motorist coverage\u201d (emphasis supplied). Mac<em>Innis </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>403 Mass. 220, 225 (1988). As a member of his father\u2019s household, Gleed was an insured under Aetna\u2019s policy. <em>Vaiarella </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>409 Mass. 523, 526 (1991). Part 3 of this policy provided coverage for personal injuries caused by uninsured and underinsured vehicles: \u201cIf the legally responsible person is insured, [Aetna] will pay only if the limits of the responsible person\u2019s auto insurance policies ... are less than the amount of damages due the injured person. In that case, we will pay the balance of the damages up to [$250,000].\u201d This policy comports with the requirements of G. L. c\u00a1 175, \u00a7 113L, as amended through St. 1980, c. 532. Section 113L was \u201cenacted with the broad objective of ensuring that victims of automobile accidents would be adequately compensated for their injuries when the accidents are caused by the negligence of unidentified motorists or motorists with insufficient or no liability coverage.\u201d <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. 279, 285 (1991). Section 113L required all automobile policies issued in this Commonwealth to provide \u201ccoverage for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of insured motor vehicles . . . whose policies . . . are insufficient in limits of liability to satisfy said damages, <em>to the extent that said damages exceed said limits of liability </em>subject to the terms of the policy (emphasis added).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, by the policy\u2019s plain terms, Aetna agreed to pay Gleed underinsured motorist benefits for Gleed\u2019s damages that exceed \u201cthe limits of the responsible persons\u2019 auto insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">1. <em>Whether the fact that Daly was operating vehicle not listed on his policy bars coverage under Part 5 of his policy. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Part 5 of Daly\u2019s policy provides that \u201c[u]nder this Part, we will pay damages to people injured ... in accidents <em>if </em>you or <em>a household member is legally responsible for the accident. . . . </em>This Part is similar to Compulsory Bodily Injury To Others (Part 1). Like the Compulsory Part, this Part pays for accidents involving <em>your auto </em>in Massachusetts. Also like the Compulsory Part, this Part does not pay for the benefit of anyone using an auto without the consent of the owner.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In reviewing the judge\u2019s order, the Appeals Court interpreted the above policy language as eliminating liability coverage because Daly was operating Bocuzzo\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident and not a vehicle listed on the policy. However, in so concluding, the Appeals Court overlooked other pertinent language in Part 5. Part 5 also provides that- \u201c[i]f someone covered under this Part is using an auto he or she does not own at the time of the accident, the owner\u2019s auto insurance must pay its limits before we pay. Then, we will pay, up to [$100,000], for any damages not covered by that insurance.\u201d We do not read these provisions as eliminating coverage because the insured, at the time of the accident, was operating a vehicle not listed on the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, we hold that, assuming Daly was legally responsible for deed\u2019s injuries, Part 5 of Daly\u2019s policy provides coverage for deed\u2019s injuries in excess of Bocuzzo\u2019s policy limit of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">2. <em>Whether Gleed\u2019s release of Daly obligates Aetna to pay Gleed underinsured motorist benefits prior to exhaustion of Daly\u2019s policy limit. </em>As noted above, deed released Daly from all liability prior to receiving any proceeds under Daly\u2019s policy. In declining to address whether deed needed first to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>exhaust the limit of Daly\u2019s policy before obligating Aetna to pay underinsured motorist benefits, the judge noted that he would have to determine whether Aetna\u2019s consent to Bocuzzo\u2019s release was also consent to Daly\u2019s release. This was error. Whether an underinsured motorist insurer consents to its insured\u2019s release of someone legally responsible for his injuries is irrelevant in determining at what amount of damages the insured becomes entitled to underinsured motorist benefits. Under Part 3 of Gleed\u2019s policy, Aetna agreed to provide underinsured motorist coverage \u201cto the extent that said damages exceed said limits of liability.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L. As we stated in <em>MacInnis, supra </em>at 227 n.13, quoting <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Clothier, </em>338 N.W.2d 256, 261 (Minn. 1983), \u201cThe [under]insurer is required to pay only for damages in excess of the tortfeasor\u2019s total liability coverage, and not for \u2018damages [which go] uncompensated because the insured has chosen to settle with the tortfeasor for less than the liability limits.\u2019 \u201d Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of whether an insured has released from liability someone legally responsible for his injuries, an insurer is not obligated to pay its insured underinsured motorist benefits until the amount of the insured\u2019s damages exceeds the automobile insurance policy limits of those legally responsible for the insured\u2019s injuries. Thus, even though Gleed released Daly from liability, Gleed\u2019s damages would still have to exhaust Daly\u2019s policy limit in addition to Bocuzzo\u2019s policy limit before Gleed would become entitled to underinsured motorist benefits. Accordingly, even if Daly was legally responsible, Aetna is not liable to Gleed for any of $77,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Because of the foregoing, we vacate the judge\u2019s allowance of Gleed\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the denial of Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This case is to be remanded to the Superior Court for a declaration that Aetna is not liable to Gleed for underinsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">It appears from the record that Gleed received $2,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) benefits from one of the insurers. The record is unclear as to which insurer paid these benefits. In the declaratory judgment action, Aetna did not request the judge to take the payment of PIP bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>fits into account, although it did request the arbitrator to do so. The arbitrator complied, and reduced Aetna\u2019s liability by $27,000 ($25,000 limit of Bocuzzo\u2019s policy plus the $2,000 paid in PIP payments).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">By the terms of deed\u2019s policy with Aetna, the parties agreed to submit liability issues to arbitration if they were unable to reach an agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-5\">As noted above, Gleed\u2019s claim against Hanover, Bocuzzo\u2019s insurer, was settled for the full policy limit of $25,000. The basis of this claim was Daly\u2019s alleged negligence in operating Bocuzzo\u2019s vehicle. The basis of Gleed\u2019s claim against Commercial Union, Daly\u2019s insurer, was also Daly\u2019s alleged negligence. By the terms of Aetna\u2019s policy with Gleed, Aetna agreed to pay Gleed underinsured motorist benefits \u201conly if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the . . . underinsured . . . auto.\u201d Thus, since Daly\u2019s alleged negligence was the only basis of Gleed\u2019s respective claims against Hanover and Commercial Union and since Aetna agreed to pay underinsured motorist benefits only if Gleed is legally entitled to recover from either Bocuzzo or Daly, then, if Daly was not negligent, Aetna would have no obligation to pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Statute 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46, amended G.

By the statement of agreed facts, it is clear that this exclusion does not apply in this case.
