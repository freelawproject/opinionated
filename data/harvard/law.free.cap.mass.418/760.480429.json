On January 4, 1992, a judge of the Hingham District Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The case proceeded to a trial before a jury two days later. At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved for required findings of not guilty on both complaints. Mass. R. Crim. P. 25, 378 Mass. 896 (1979). The judge allowed the motion as to so much of the complaint as alleged an assault and battery on a court officer, leaving an assault and battery charge. The judge denied the motion as to the assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On January 10, 1992, the jury convicted the defendant of assault and battery and acquitted him of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. The judge imposed a sentence requiring the defendant (1) to complete an eighteen-month unsupervised probation period; (2) to avoid contact with Dineen and the Plymouth District Court; and (3) to pay a $500 fine. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On appeal, the defendant asserts three errors. First, the defendant contends that the judge erred by declining to give the jury instructions that the defendant\u2019s acts could be justified because he acted in self-defense to repel the efforts of Dineen, a court officer, to bring him before Judge James O\u2019Neill. Second, the defendant argues that the judge erred by declining to instruct the jury that his acts were justified because at the time he was executing his lawful public duties as clerk-magistrate of the Plymouth District Court, and as such, was entitled to judicial immunity for his acts. Third, the defendant asserts that the judge erred by denying his motion to dismiss the complaint because he was entitled to judicial immunity for his acts. We conclude that there was no error, and affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>On the evidence presented, the jury could have found the following facts. On Friday, January 11, 1991, the defendant was the clerk-magistrate of the Plymouth District Court. Judge James O\u2019Neill, a visiting District Court judge, was sitting in the second session courtroom which was located in a separate building behind the main courthouse. Judge O\u2019Neill asked his court officer, Demetrius Gonsalves, to go to the defendant\u2019s office and ask him to start the proceedings in the second session or to assign a member of his staff to do so. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 12 (1992 ed.). Gonsalves located the defendant who was conducting clerk\u2019s hearings in his office. Informed by Gonsalves of the request of Judge O\u2019Neill, the defendant responded that he would not serve as clerk for the second session because he had sixty-nine hearings to conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Gonsalves relayed the defendant\u2019s message to Judge O\u2019Neill. The judge told Gonsalves to return to the defendant and request that either the defendant or an assistant clerk staff the second session. Judge O\u2019Neill also indicated that if the defendant did not himself come to court or send someone else to perform these duties, the judge would order that the defendant be brought forcibly before him. Gonsalves delivered this second message to the defendant, but again he refused to report to the second session. He also refused to send a member of his staff because \u201cthey had too much work to do.\u201d Gonsalves asked the defendant to accompany him to the second session to explain the situation to Judge O\u2019Neill, but the defendant told Gonsalves to deliver the message himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">After Gonsalves advised him of the defendant\u2019s second refusal, Judge O\u2019Neill ordered Gonsalves to bring the defendant to the courtroom and \u201cto get whatever help he needed to do so.\u201d Gonsalves then went to the first session courtroom to explain the situation to Judge Dennis Collari, the presiding judge of the Plymouth District Court. Judge Collari told Gonsalves to carry out Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s order, and to \u201cget whoever [he] needed ... to assist\u201d him. Gonsalves then requested assistance from another court officer, William Dineen, and a Kingston police officer, Dennis O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>The three officers stopped the defendant in the corridor outside his office. Gonsalves told the defendant that Judge O\u2019Neill had ordered him to bring the defendant to the second session. The defendant again refused. Dineen then gestured with his left hand within four or five inches of the defendant\u2019s person. After an exchange of words, the defendant grabbed Dineen, knocked him to the ground, climbed on top of him, pulled out some of his hair, and punched him in the face. During the struggle, the defendant kicked Dineen in the ribs as Gonsalves and O\u2019Brien attempted to pull him off Dineen. After separating the two men, Gonsalves and O\u2019Brien forcibly escorted the defendant to the second session courtroom. Judge O\u2019Neill thereupon ordered the defendant to \u201cstaff the court,\u201d which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">1. <em>Claim of self-defense. </em>The defendant first asserts that Court Officer Dineen did not have authority to compel him to go to the second session, and that, therefore, the defendant was justified in acting in self-defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject this argument, both because Dineen did act with authority and because regardless of whether Dineen did have such authority, the defendant\u2019s use of force was not lawful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">We have recognized that every judge has certain inherent powers. Implicit in the constitutional grant of judicial power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>is authority necessary to exercise that power. <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507, 510 (1972). These inherent powers are essential if the courts are to carry out their constitutional mandate. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Although they may be recognized by statute, [these powers] . . . exist without a statute, for they \u2018directly affect the capacity of the judicial department to function.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 921-922 (1976). Every judge \u201cmust exercise his inherent powers as necessary to secure the full and effective administration of justice.\u201d <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc., supra </em>at 514. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>314 Mass. 767, 776 (1943) (judge has inherent power to use contempt proceedings to ensure orderly administration of justice); <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162, 180 (1911) (judge has inherent power to grant change of venue in order to secure impartial trial). See also <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 664 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Of necessity, a judge\u2019s inherent powers must encompass the authority to exercise \u201cphysical control over his courtroom.\u201d <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 53, 57 (1989). As we noted in <em>Chief Admin. Justice of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>\u201c[t]he power of the judiciary to control its own proceedings, the conduct of participants, the actions of officers of the court and the environment of the court is a power absolutely necessary for a court to function effectively and do its job of administering justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>LaFrance, </em>124 N.H. 171, 179-180 (1983). This power includes a judge\u2019s power \u201cto protect his court from impairment resulting from inadequate facilities or a lack of supplies or supporting personnel.\u201d <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc., supra </em>at 510. \u201cA judge\u2019s direction to court officers to bring a person who is in the courthouse before him is a function normally performed by a judge.\u201d <em>Mireles </em>v. <em>Waco, </em>112 S. Ct. 286, 288 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s steadfast refusal to report to the second session or to send another clerk created a sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tian wherein the judge was justified in resorting to his inherent powers. Judge O\u2019Neill had twice requested a clerk\u2019s assistance so that the session\u2019s daily proceedings could begin. The defendant\u2019s failure to respond to Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s requests delayed the court\u2019s business and interfered with its ability to perform its judicial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Furthermore, by refusing to accede to Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s order, the defendant shirked his responsibilities as clerk-magistrate. \u201cThe clerk, however, \u2018is a ministerial officer of the courts and is subject to the direction of the courts in the performance of his duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Santosuosso, </em>308 Mass. 202, 206 (1941). <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>294 Mass. 101, 104 (1936). On January 11, 1991, the defendant\u2019s duties were to respond to Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s requests to staff the second session. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 12 (1992 ed.) (\u201c[the district court clerks] or one of them shall attend all sessions of the court and shall keep a record of all its proceedings\u201d). In the circumstances, Judge O\u2019Neill had the inherent authority to compel the defendant to do his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Court Officer Dineen acted within his authority in executing Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s lawful order. Judges typically, if not exclusively, carry out their orders through the office of another person, whether it be the parties to a case, the court officer, the court clerk, or another person. Because Dineen acted at Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s direction, and because Judge O\u2019Neill had the inherent authority to control his courtroom by ensuring that the defendant or another clerk staff the second session, the defendant\u2019s first claim of error must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Even if we were to accept, for the sake of argument, the claim that Dineen did not have authority to compel the defendant to go to the second session, the defendant was not justified in resorting to violence. The law is well settled that a person may use reasonable force to protect himself from harm. The right of self-defense, however, \u201cordinarily cannot be claimed by a person who provokes or initiates an assault unless that person withdraws in good faith from the conflict and announces his intention to retire.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>375 Mass. 768, 772 (1978), citing Annot., With<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>drawal, After Provocation of Conflict, as Reviving Right of Self-Defense, 55 A.L.R.3d 1000, 1003 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Naylor, </em>407 Mass. 333, 335 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>404 Mass. 256, 265 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>379 Mass. 177, 180-181 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The jury would have been warranted in finding that it was the defendant who provoked the altercation, did not withdraw from the conflict, and never indicated any desire to withdraw from the conflict. Further, there is no evidence that Dineen approached the defendant in any way that would make him reasonably believe that he was in imminent danger of physical harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regardless of Dineen\u2019s authority to compel him to go to the second session courtroom, therefore, the defendant\u2019s resort to force was both inappropriate and unjustified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">2. <em>Claim of judicial immunity. </em>The defendant next asserts that the doctrine of judicial immunity should shield him from criminal liability for his assault and battery on Dineen in the hallway of the Plymouth District Court. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">It is a basic principle of our common law, \u201ctoo well settled to require discussion, that every judge, whether of a higher or lower court, is exempt from liability to an action for any judgment or decision rendered in the exercise of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>vested in him by law.\u201d <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Estes, </em>292 Mass. 187, 189-190 (1935). See <em>LaLonde </em>v. <em>Eissner, </em>405 Mass. 207, 210 (1989); <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 811 (1973). \u201cThis immunity is founded upon considerations of public policy to the end that the administration of justice may be independent, based upon free and unbiased convictions and not influenced by apprehension of personal consequences.\u201d <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>337 Mass. 118, 121 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Courts have expanded the doctrine of judicial immunity to include certain \u201cquasi judicial\u201d officers who are involved in an integral part of the judicial process and thus must be able to act freely without the threat of a law suit. <em>LaLonde, supra </em>at 211. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 212 (court-appointed psychiatrist, who performs an essential function by rendering services to the court, is entitled to immunity in the performance of those services); <em>Chicopee Lions Club </em>v. <em>District Att\u2019y for the Hampden Dist., </em>396 Mass. 244, 251-252 (1985) (prosecutor immune from suit involving conduct \u201cin discharge of [his] official duties\u201d); <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Marlborough Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>395 Mass. 117, 133 (1985) (court clerks acting at judge\u2019s direction entitled to immunity in suit alleging unlawful commitment).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Although judicial immunity may in some circumstances extend to court clerks, it surely does not extend to the situation at hand. Cf. <em>Temple, supra </em>at 133 (plaintiff failed to allege any facts indicating that court clerks behaved wrongfully). The defendant was not engaged in any judicial or ministerial duty when he assaulted Dineen. He was not conducting any hearing or performing any other judicial function. Instead, the altercation began in the corridor of the courthouse, when the defendant was walking to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Although court clerks may be entitled to absolute immunity for their conduct when acting at a judge\u2019s direction, <em>Temple, supra </em>at 133, in this case the defendant acted directly against Judge O\u2019Neill\u2019s order. The defendant\u2019s forcible resistance to the execution of a judge\u2019s order to perform duties imposed on the defendant by statute cannot be deemed a judicial act within his jurisdiction that would give rise to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>munity. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s behavior was the very antithesis of judicial conduct, and was \u201cclearly prejudicial to the administration of justice, and [was] misconduct unbecoming a clerk-magistrate that brings that office into disrepute.\u201d <em>Matter of Dugan, </em>416 Mass. 461, 467 (1993). We decline to extend the doctrine of judicial immunity to allow clerk-magistrates to assault court officers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">3. <em>Motion to dismiss. </em>The defendant\u2019s final assertion of error is that the judge erred by denying his motion to dismiss the complaint because the defendant was entitled to judicial immunity for his acts. As we noted above, the doctrine of judicial immunity will not protect the defendant from criminal liability for his assault and battery upon Dineen.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The trial judge stayed the payment of the fine pending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">On appeal, the defendant has expanded his self-defense argument. The defendant maintains that, because Dineen lacked authority to compel him to go to the second session, his conduct was justified to \u201crepel a felonious kidnapping and false imprisonment.\u201d We will not ordinarily consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>412 Mass. 745, 752 n.ll (1992). While we do have the power to consider issues not fairly raised before the trial judge, we exercise that power only in the instance of a serious error which creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>409 Mass. 675, 678-679 (1991). This is not such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">We note also that the issue pertaining to an assault and battery on a court officer \u201cengaged in the performance of his duties at the time of such assault and battery,\u201d see G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D (1992 ed.), was removed from the case when the judge allowed as much of the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding as related to assault and battery on a court officer. Thus, this issue did not go to the jury. Nevertheless, we comment on the question of a judge\u2019s authority because of its public import.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The defendant' testified that Dineen \u201cstepped into\u201d the defendant and grabbed his right arm. Even if we accept the defendant\u2019s contention that Dineen did touch him, we cannot accept that assaulting Dineen was an appropriate response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b788-9\">The defendant makes no claim that the judge\u2019s charge on the elements of self-defense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>390 Mass. 144, 154 n.2 (1983), and on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof on that issue was flawed in any respect. Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s use of force was not justified under our traditional self-defense doctrine, we need not reach the issue of whether the rule announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. 596, 602 (1983), should apply to the conduct of court officers. See <em>id. </em>at 601 (\u201cin the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, a person may not use force to resist an arrest by one who he knows or has good reason to believe is an authorized police officer, engaged in the performance of his duties, regardless of whether the arrest was unlawful in the circumstances\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">It should be noted further that we have never held that judicial immunity, absolute or qualified, extends to criminal conduct. See also <em>Mireles </em>v. <em>Waco, </em>112 S. Ct. 286, 287 n.1 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
