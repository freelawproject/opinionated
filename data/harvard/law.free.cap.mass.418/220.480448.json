The plaintiff, Victoria Dalis, claims that she was discharged from her employment because she was pregnant. She filed a complaint against her employer, Buyer Advertising, Inc. (defendant), alleging violations of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102 (1992 ed.) (equal rights act); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 105A-105C (1992 ed.) (wage discrimination based on gender); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 105D (1992- ed.) (maternity leave act); and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1) (1992 ed.) (gender discrimination in employment). In her complaint, the plaintiff moved for a jury trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The defendant moved to strike the jury demand, claiming that Dalis was not entitled to a trial by jury under any of the cited statutes. A judge in the Superior Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant appealed to a single justice of the Appeals Court. Citing inconsistent decisions in the Superior Court, the single justice reported the matter to a panel of the Appeals Court. We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to a trial by jury on most of her claims under art. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Therefore, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\"><em>The plaintiff\u2019s claim under art. 15 of the Declaration of Rights.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Article 15 \u201cpreserves the \u2018common law trial by jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>in its indispensable characteristics as established and known at the time the Constitution was adopted\u2019 in 1780.\u201d <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Jarvenpaa, </em>404 Mass. 177, 185-186 (1989). Article 15 does not preserve \u201cthe minor details or unessential formalities of the trial by jury as it then existed .either in England or here.\u201d <em>Bothwell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>215 Mass. 467, 473 (1913). The article must be construed with \u201cflexibility in its adaptation of details to the changing needs of society without in any degree impairing its essential character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag_\">The language of art. 15 sweeps broadly: \u201cIn <em>all </em>controversics concerning property, and in <em>all </em>suits between two or more persons, ... the parties have a right to a trial by jury . . .\u201d (emphasis added). The exception is narrowly defined: \u201c[Ejxcept in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practised.\u201d Thus, according to the language of art. 15, the \u201csacred\u201d method for resolving all manner of cases and controversies was trial by jury unless the case was one in which a court of equity in either England or Massachusetts would have exercised jurisdiction in 1780. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>180 Mass. 334, 355 (1902); <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>215 Mass. 415, 418 (1913); <em>In re Acushnet River &amp; New Bedford Harbor, </em>712 F. Supp. 994, 1009-1010 (D. Mass. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">The jury system, as the \u201csacred\u201d method for resolving factual disputes, is the most important means by which laypersons can participate in and understand the legal system. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canon, </em>373 Mass. 494, 516 (1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 933 (1978). It brings the \u201crules of law to the touchstone of contemporary common sense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 1 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 348-349 (3d ed. 1922). \u201cJurors bring to a case their common sense and community values; their \u2018very inexperience is an asset because it secures a fresh perception of each trial, avoiding the stereotypes said to infect the judicial eye.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 355 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), quoting H. Kalven &amp; H. Zeisel, The American Jury 8 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The plaintiffs sex discrimination claim falls squarely within the language of art. 15. It is a suit between two persons which clearly sets forth a controversy concerning property. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, supra </em>at 345. Next, we must determine whether the exception in art. 15 is applicable. We examine whether the plaintiffs claim is analogous, in either subject matter or remedy sought, to cases within the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction, as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, supra </em>at 355. See also <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>137 Mass. 483, 485-486 (1884); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mongardi, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 5, 8 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The plaintiff does not seek primarily equitable relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor is the nature of her claim analogous to any case which was traditionally heard in a court of equity. Thus, the plaintiff has a right to a jury trial. See <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Wilton Enters., Inc., </em>962 F.2d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 1992). Compare <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Jarvenpaa, supra </em>at 185-186 (plaintiffs not entitled to a jury trial because traditionally paternity and child support claims were not tried before a jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The plaintiffs sex discrimination claim is analogous to common law actions sounding in both tort and contract. See <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 388 (1988); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Wilton Enters., Inc., supra </em>at 122-123 (\u201cCourts have routinely held that discrimination suits in general, and employment discrimination suits in particular, are analogous to either of two common law causes of action [tort and contract]\u201d). See also <em>Beesley </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 717 </em>F. Supp. 781, <em>S.C., </em>723 F. Supp. 635, 652 (N.D. Ala. 1989) (Seventh Amendment guarantees a jury trial for plaintiffs in Title VII sex discrimination suits for lost wages).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>United States Supreme Court has commented that \u201c[a]n action to redress racial [or gender] discrimination may also be likened to an action for defamation or intentional infliction of mental distress.\u201d <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 195-196 n.10 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9 (1992 ed.), the plaintiff may seek both legal and equitable remedies for violations of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the plaintiff prevails, she may recover monetary damages for her economic losses as well as for mental anguish. See <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 169 (1987). In egregious cases, the statute also provides the legal remedy of punitive damages. See G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9. The statute clearly affords the plaintiff the \u201clegal remedy of compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Electro Switch Corp., </em>402 Mass. 385, 387 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The defendant concedes that the plaintiff\u2019s sex discrimination claim is analogous to actions at common law, but argues that, absent clear legislative direction, the court should not imply a right to a jury trial. The issue is not whether we should imply a right to a jury trial but whether art. 15 preserves and protects the right to a jury trial on the plaintiff\u2019s claims. Our long-standing rule is that the boundaries of equity jurisdiction \u201cought not to be widened by judicial decision . . . [because] the constitutional right of trial by jury would thereby become correspondingly narrowed.\u201d <em>Parkway, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>314 Mass. 647, 651 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The defendant relies on <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307 (1983), to support its position that there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury on the plaintiff\u2019s claims. We do not agree. In <em>Nei, </em>we said that the court should be \u201chesitant to imply a right to a jury trial for the sui generis causes of action for unfair or deceptive practices in the absence of legislative direction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314. General Laws c. 93A (consumer protection statute) entitles plaintiffs to relief where traditional legal remedies were considered inadequate by the Legislature. Unlike a traditional common law action for fraud, consumers suing under c. 93A need not prove actual reliance on a false representation, or that the defendant knew that the representation was false. <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 703 (1975). An \u201c \u2018unfair or deceptive act or practice\u2019 goes far beyond the scope of the common law action for fraud and deceit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We determined that any analogies between \u201cunfair and deceptive practices\u201d and common law claims for fraud and deceit were inappropriate. <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, supra </em>at 313. Thus, we concluded that a plaintiff alleging a violation of G. L. c. 93A is not constitutionally entitled to a trial by jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The outcome in <em>Nei </em>turned on the \u201cequitable nature of the relief\u2019 sought under c. 93A. <em>Nei, supra </em>at 315. By contrast, the nature of the plaintiffs claim is more analogous to actions at common law, and the relief sought by the plaintiff is predominantly legal. <em>Nei </em>is distinguishable on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Under the broad language of art. 15, the plaintiffs right to a jury trial is protected. The exception set forth in art. 15 does not apply because the plaintiffs rights and remedies are similar to those traditionally treated as actions at law. Under art. 15, the plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to a trial by jury for her claim of employment discrimination based on sex. The judge correctly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs demand for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\"><em>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 105A-105C</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our analysis of the plaintiffs right to a jury trial under this statute is the same as under G. L. c. 15IB. The relevant inquiry is whether a claim of wage discrimination based on gender is analogous to cases which were traditionally treated as legal actions. Wage discrimination based on gender, like employment discrimination based on gender, has historical connections to common law tort and contract claims. See <em>ante </em>at 223. The statute permits plaintiffs to recover unpaid wages, and an additional equal amount of liquidated damages. Compensatory and punitive damages are legal remedies. Thus, both the nature of the action and the relief sought are legal. See <em>Santiago-Negron </em>v. <em>Castro-Davila, </em>865 F.2d 431, 437, 441 (1st Cir. 1989) (back pay considered factor of compensatory damages which involves common law right to trial by jury). For the same reasons as stated <em>ante </em>at 223, we conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial on her claim of wage discrimination based on gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 </em>105D.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Again, we begin the analysis by exploring whether the rights afforded by this statute have an analogue in the class of cases which are essentially legal in nature, with roots in both tort and contracts. See <em>supra </em>at 223. An employee seeking relief under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 105D, is entitled to both injunctive relief and money damages. The fact that the plaintiff is entitled to both legal and equitable relief may not compromise her constitutional right to a trial by jury. <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>215 Mass. 415, 418 (1913). We agree with the Supreme Court that where there are legal and equitable claims present in the same case, the trial court will \u201chave to use its discretion in deciding whether the legal or equitable cause should be tried first. Because the right to jury trial is a constitutional one, however, while no similar requirement protects trials by the court, that discretion is very narrowly limited and must, wherever possible, be exercised to preserve jury trial\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Beacon Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 510 (1959). Under State law, as in the Federal system, \u201conly [in] the most imperative circumstances . . . can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><em>General Laws c. 93, \u00a7 102.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant contends that the only remedy available under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, is \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>junctive and other appropriate equitable relief.\u201d Relying on our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guilfoyle, </em>402 Mass. 130, 135-136 (1988), the defendant argues that the plaintiff is not entitled to a jury trial. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In <em>Guilfoyle, </em>we concluded that there was no constitutional right to a jury trial for claims brought under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. <em>Guilfoyle, supra </em>at 135-136. <em>Guilfoyle </em>does not stand for the broad proposition that a jury trial does not attach to new causes of action. Our decision in <em>Guilfoyle </em>is grounded on the reasoning that art. 15 does not guarantee a right to a trial by jury in the class of cases traditionally reserved for the courts of equity. <em>Guilfoyle, supra </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">General Laws c. 93, \u00a7 102, guarantees equality in the making and enforcing of contracts. Article 15 preserves the right to a jury trial for traditional contract claims. Because a claim under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 102, does not fall within the narrow class of cases reserved for courts of equity, the plaintiff is entitled to a trial by jury. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>180 Mass. 334, 355 (1902). As in the Federal system, to the extent that there are some equitable claims in addition to the legal claims, the judge has discretion to determine the order of trial between the legal claims and the request for some equitable relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However the judge must recognize that judicial discretion is \u201cnarrowly limited\u201d by the plaintiff\u2019s State constitutional right to a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The order of the Superior Court judge denying the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s demand for trial by jury is affirmed. This matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by Barbara C.

See <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Welsh Mfg. Co., </em>382 Mass. 340, 345 (1981). However, the court\u2019s analysis of Title VII claims under the Seventh Amendment is similar to our analysis under art. 15. The Federal equal rights statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, also has been interpreted to confer a right to a jury trial. See <em>Laskaris </em>v. <em>Thornburgh, </em>733 F.2d 260, 263 (3d Cir.), cert, denied, 469 U.S. 886 (1984) (\u201cA party seeking com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>pensatory and punitive damages or other legal relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 has a right to a jury trial\u201d).

Because the result we reach is consistent with the result reached in Federal courts, the right to a jury trial is not affected by the forum selected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In analyzing claims for a trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment, the Supreme Court has said that the Seventh Amendment requires a trial by jury if the complaint invokes rights and remedies traditionally resolved in an action at law rather than equity or admiralty. See <em>Pernell </em>v. <em>Southall Realty, </em>416 U.S. 363, 375 (1974).
