Fox\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants (1) had violated a written agreement to sell the land to Fox\u2019s predecessor in interest, (2) were in breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) had violated G. L. c. 93A (1992 ed.), and (4) had misrepresented their intention to sell the land at the agreed-upon price. Fox acquired the claims of the intended developer of a project on Boylston Street from the developer\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that Fox had not commenced this action before the applicable statute of limitations applied to bar recovery. We transferred Fox\u2019s appeal here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Under the will of George Robert White, who died in 1922, the city of Boston acquired real estate, including 146 Boylston Street, to be held for the benefit of the inhabitants of Boston and to be managed by a board of trustees. In 1987, the city, purporting to act through the trustees, entered into an agreement to sell 146 Boylston Street to Fox\u2019s predecessor in interest. The agreement stated no closing date. The parcel was the middle one in a proposed three-parcel project, which could not be completed because the developer could not acquire 146 Boylston Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">1. The judge properly concluded that the period of limitations stated in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 11 (1992 ed.), applied to Fox\u2019s claims in this case. Section 11 provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that \u201c[a]n action founded on any contract made or act done, ... if made or done by any person acting as trustee, guardian or conservator, shall be brought within two years, after the right of action accrues.\u201d Literally, \u00a7 11 applies to the trustee of the George Robert White Fund, which was created as a testamentary public trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Fox argues, however, that \u00a7 11 should not be read to apply to a trustee not required to file periodic accounts for court approval. Fox points to <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Tong, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 713 (1982), in which the Appeals Court stated that testamentary trustees under \u00a7 11 \u201care the persons who are specifically required by G. L. c. 206, \u00a7 1, to file periodic ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>counts to be allowed by a Probate Court judge.\u201d Cf. <em>First E. Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>413 Mass. 654, 661 (1992) (G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A [1992 ed.], limiting personal liability of trustees, does not apply to the trustees of a Massachusetts business trust); <em>Apahouser Lock &amp; Sec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Carvelli, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 388 (1988) (trustee of nominee realty trust not within G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 14A). The Appeals Court held, however, only that \u00a7 11 did not apply to a business trust, and expressly left open the question whether \u00a7 11 \u201chas any application to a trustee under a trust instrument (other than one creating a business trust) who is not appointed by or required to account to a Probate Court.\u201d <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Tong, supra </em>at 713 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We reject the distinction that Fox asks us to identify in the application of \u00a7 11. The city is a trustee under a will, obliged to follow the testator\u2019s intention. The fact that a testamentary trust is public and charitable does not eliminate the fiduciary duty of a trustee or the trustee\u2019s accountability to courts for its conduct. The Legislature did not expressly make the distinction for which Fox argues, and the argument that we should imply such a distinction is not persuasive. Section 11 should be read as applicable to all testamentary trustees, including a trustee of a public charitable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">2. Fox\u2019s claims accrued more than two years before June 19, 1991, the date on which this action was commenced. Fox alleged in its verified complaint that \u201cto finalize the purchase of 146 Boylston from the White Fund,\u201d it \u201cinformed the White Fund that it was ready to complete the purchase, and that the closing would be scheduled for June 1, 1989, at the Suffolk County Registry of Deeds.\u201d The complaint further alleged that Fox appeared at the registry on that date, \u201cready, willing and able to complete the conveyance of the property for the agreed upon purchase price,\u201d but the White Fund failed to appear and \u201cfailed and refused to complete the conveyance of 146 Boylston, in violation of their prior agreement to do so.\u201d Fox\u2019s July 28, 1989, demand letter under G. L. c. 93A stated that the failure of the city to perform on June 1, 1989, constituted a breach of contract and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>violation of G. L. c. 93A. All Fox\u2019s causes of action accrued on or before June 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">3. More than six months after the entry of final judgment, Fox moved to vacate that judgment on the ground, not previously advanced, that the action was timely commenced as a result of the application of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108 (a) (1988). Section 108 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act grants additional time to a trustee in bankruptcy to commence an action in certain circumstances. Fox alleged that in bringing this action it acted as an agent of the bankruptcy trustee from whom Fox acquired the claims against the city. The trial judge rejected this argument and further ruled that no aspect of Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), authorized the granting of relief from the judgment already entered. The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying relief from judgment. See <em>Scannell </em>v. <em>Ed. Ferreirinna &amp; Irmao, Lda., </em>401 Mass. 155, 157-158 (1987). We need not, therefore, reach the doubtful proposition that Fox brought suit as the agent of the bankruptcy trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">4. Because we affirm the dismissal of the action, it is not important whether the judge erred in dismissing the Attorney General as a party (see G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 8G [1992 ed.]) on the Attorney General\u2019s representation that he had no present interest in the action. The question certainly does not involve the jurisdiction of the court to enter the final judgment that was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We also need not decide whether, after allowing the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the judge erred in denying as moot Fox\u2019s motion to amend the complaint to add the city of Boston as a party defendant. Fox was not prejudiced by the denial of that motion. The defendants rightly state that the proper defendant would be the city in its capacity as trustee of the George Robert White Fund. General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 11, bars the action, however, whether the city was the defendant as trustee or the five members of the board of trustees of the fund were the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>fendants, as agents for the city (see <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>298 Mass. 346, 349-350 [1937]).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
