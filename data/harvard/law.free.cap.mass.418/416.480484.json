L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment was denied. At the close of his jury-waived trial, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty was also denied, and he was found guilty and sentenced to a ten-year suspended prison term and five years probation with certain restrictions on his activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant argues that his conduct did not violate G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29A (a). He also argues that \u00a7 29A <em>(a) </em>and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31 (1992 ed.), are constitutionally infirm in that they criminalize the depiction of nudity per se and because they criminalize intent without attendant conduct. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The evidence would warrant the following findings. The defendant is a Roman Catholic priest who organized outings for the children in his parish. On January 11, 1992, the defendant took ten year old John Doe (an alias) and four or five other children to \u201cswim night\u201d at a recreational facility in a neighboring town. The defendant took photographs of the children as they frolicked in the pool. Afterward John delayed changing until the others were almost through and then asked the defendant to hold up a towel so that he could change without being seen. John and the defendant were in a. portion of the locker room that was separated from others by a row of lockers.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>As John was changing, the defendant took his camera out of his bag and began to photograph John. John testified that he automatically struck different poses without any instruction from the defendant. John\u2019s partially covered scrotal area is visible in two of the photographs. Several of the photographs depict John displaying his bare buttocks (\u201cmooning\u201d the defendant), extending his middle finger in the air, extending his middle finger from his underwear, and flexing his muscles.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">A patron of the facility entered the men\u2019s locker room and saw the defendant with the camera strapped around his neck. He twice asked the defendant whether he was taking photographs of the children in the nude. The defendant responded, \u201cHe\u2019s got his clothes on.\u201d The patron reported the incident to a lifeguard but when the patron returned to the locker room, the defendant and John were gone. The defendant told John that he would destroy the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">When subsequently interviewed by the police, the defendant gave a signed statement stating that he has \u201ctaken pictures of kids in the nude, mooning. When I look at these pictures I have sexual tendencies. I have [fantasies] of having sex with the boys. I sometimes masturbate while looking at these pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\"><em>The statute. </em>The defendant claims that his activities did not fall within the ambit of \u00a7 29A (a). He first contends that the photographs do not depict a minor in a state of nudity within the meaning of \u00a7 31, which defines \u201cnudity\u201d as: \u201cuncovered or less than opaquely covered human genitals, pubic areas, ... or the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.\u201d Although John had his underwear on, in two of the photographs portions of his pubic and genital area are clearly visible. The statute does not require that the areas be completely uncovered. It is enough that a portion of the nude genital area is visible. The defendant next argues that the evidence did not warrant the finding that the defendant hired, coerced, solicited, enticed, employed, procured, used, caused, encouraged, or knowingly permitted John to be exhibited in a state of nudity for the purpose of reproduction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>a photograph as proscribed by \u00a7 29A <em>(a). </em>He asserts that the depiction of John\u2019s pubic area was unintentional and that, since John voluntarily struck the various poses without instruction, he did not \u201cknowingly permit\u201d him to pose in a state of nudity.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Whether the defendant \u201cknowingly permitted\u201d John to pose in a state of nudity is a question of fact. \u201cThe question of a defendant\u2019s knowledge is exclusively within the province of the [fact finder], and [the fact finder is] \u2018free to draw an inference of guilty knowledge . . . \u201cif the inferences drawn from the circumstances [are] reasonable and possible.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sama, </em>411 Mass. 293, 298 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977). The photographs themselves suggest that the defendant knowingly permitted John to pose with a portion of his pubic region and genitals exposed. He took a series of well-focused photographs at various points in the process of John\u2019s dressing. John\u2019s genital area is prominent in many of the photographs. The defendant admitted that he sometimes took photographs of nude boys for sexual gratification. There was sufficient evidence, therefore, for the judge to conclude that the defendant knowingly permitted John to pose in a state of nudity. Furthermore, the fact that the defendant continued to take the photographs as John struck different poses certainly supports the inference that he \u201cencouraged\u201d John to pose in a state of nudity.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Constitutionality of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 29A and 31. </em>We have had occasion to examine G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 29A, and 31 (1986 ed.), in two previous decisions. In the first,\" <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>401 Mass. 602, 604-605 (1988) <em>(Oakes I), </em>vacated and remanded, 491 U.S. 576, 581 (1989), the defendant was prosecuted for taking photographs of his minor stepdaughter while she was nude from the waist up. The court held that \u00a7 29A, as then written, was constitutionally overbroad in its reach because, for example, it made it a criminal act for a parent to photograph \u201chis or her naked one-year-old running <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>on a beach or romping in a wading pool.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. Accordingly, the court struck down the statute. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Subsequently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92 (1990) <em>(Oakes II), </em>the court upheld the same defendant\u2019s conviction under the original statute in the face of his constitutional challenge that the statute violated his right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s activity of photographing his nude stepdaughter was \u201cmixed speech and conduct, or expressive conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95-96. \u201cUnder current First Amendment analysis, \u2018[t]he Government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>duct than it has in restricting the written or spoken word.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, quoting <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 406 (1989). \u201cWhen <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201cnonspeech\u201d elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968). The court noted that the Commonwealth\u2019s important interest must be unrelated to the suppression of expression. <em>Oakes II, supra. </em>See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 407. The court concluded further that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in protecting minors from exploitation was both unrelated to the suppression of expression and sufficiently compelling to meet the standard in <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra. Oakes II, supra </em>at 96-97. \u201c[T]he fact that the pictures are not child pornography under <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747 (1982), is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97-98. Finally, it was determined that, \u201cunder Federal constitutional law, the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in protecting children permits the application of \u00a7 29A to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. See <em>id. </em>at 99 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Assuming that the defendant\u2019s activity in this case was mixed speech and conduct, under the amended versions of \u00a7\u00a7 29A and 31, the same rationale applies. The taking of photographs of a partially nude child with lascivious intent is conduct that \u00a7 29A is designed to prevent. See <em>Oakes II, supra </em>at 96-97. The governmental interest in suppressing this type of conduct is unrelated to expression. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 407. The Commonwealth\u2019s compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding the physical and psychological well being of John in this case, therefore, allows the application of \u00a7\u00a7 29A and 31 to the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The defendant essentially argues, however, that \u00a7 29A imposes more than \u201cincidental\u201d restrictions on his speech and for that reason fails the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>test. We do not agree. Assuming for the purpose of argument that speech is involved, the Commonwealth has a compelling interest in protecting children from exploitation. The defendant makes no argument that \u00a7 29A suppresses more speech than is essential to further the Commonwealth\u2019s interest. See <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">To the extent that the defendant claims that the statute is void under the overbreadth doctrine, his argument must fail.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201cIn <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610 (1973), the Court acknowledged that the general rule is that a person to whom a statute may be applied constitutionally will not be allowed to challenge the statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court. The Court explained that since \u2018the First Amendment needs breathing space . . . [1] itigants . . . are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 611-612. The Court admonished, however, that because the overbreadth standing doctrine is \u2018manifestly, strong medicine,\u2019 the Court has employed it sparingly. <em>Id. </em>at 613. In <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theatres, Inc., </em>427 U.S. 50, 60 (1976), quoting <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 216 (1975), the Court further explained that, if a statute\u2019s deterrent effect on protected expression is not \u2018both real and substantial\u2019 and if the statute is \u2018readily subject to a narrowing construction,\u2019 the doctrine of overbreadth may not be em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ployed.\u201d <em>Marshfield Family Skateland, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>389 Mass. 436, 444, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 987 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The defendant has failed to demonstrate either substantial overbreadth or substantial deterrent effect. \u201cFacial over-breadth has not been invoked when a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the challenged statute.\u201d <em>Broadrick, supra </em>at 613. The defendant\u2019s sole overbreadth argument is that the statute impermissibly criminalizes the depiction of nudity per se in contravention of <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The defendant asserts that, because the term \u201cnudity\u201d is not sufficiently limited, \u00a7 29A <em>(a) </em>unconstitutionally criminalizes the depiction of nudity per se. Section 31, which defines the terms utilized in \u00a7 29A clearly defines \u201cnudity\u201d and gives adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, \u00a7 29A <em>(a) </em>and \u00a7 31 together do not prohibit the mere visual depiction of nudity. Rather, the statute prohibits a person who, <em>with lascivious intent, </em>depicts a child\u2019s \u201cuncovered or less than opaquely covered human genitals, pubic areas, the human female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola, or the covered male genitals in a discernibly turgid state,\u201d in a visual medium. Thus the defendant\u2019s contention that the statute criminalizes photographing nudity, without more, is erroneous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So construed we believe the statute avoids any over-breadth problems, and \u201cwhatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.\u201d <em>Broadrick, supra </em>at 615-616.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The defendant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 29A criminalizes intent without attendant conduct also fails. The defendant erroneously segregates the \u201clascivious intent\u201d component of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>statute from the conduct component which includes hiring, coercing, soliciting or enticing, employing, procuring, using, causing, encouraging, or knowingly permitting a \u201cchild to pose or be exhibited in a state of nudity, for the purpose of representation or reproduction in any visual material.\u201d See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The statute does not criminalize a defendant\u2019s lascivious intent alone. It is only the defendant\u2019s lascivious intent combined with the enumerated acts that gives rise to criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 29A (1992 ed.), provides in pertinent part: <em>\u201c(a) </em>Whoever, either with knowledge that a person is a child under eighteen years of age or while in possession of such facts that he should have reason to know that such person is a child under eighteen years of age, and with lascivious intent, hires, coerces, solicits or entices, employs, procures, uses, causes, encourages, or knowingly permits such child to pose or be exhibited in a state of nudity, for the purpose of representation or reproduction in any visual material, shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The restrictions include: \u201c1) stay away from [John Doe]; 2) no contact with children under age 16; 3) [a] 11 employment to be approved by the [probation [department; 4) [a]void involvement with youth programs; 5) [c]ontinue treatment at St. Luke\u2019s Institute; 6) [a]fter care as directed by the [probation [d]epartment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Following our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>401 Mass. 602 (1988) <em>(Oakes I), </em>the Legislature amended \u00a7 29A to provide that \u201c[wjhoever . . . <em>with lascivious intent, </em>hires, coerces, solicits or entices, employs, procures, uses, causes, encourages, or knowingly permits such child to pose or be exhibited in a state of nudity . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).
