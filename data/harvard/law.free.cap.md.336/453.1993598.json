The couple had one child: Edgar Jacob Petrini, III (Eddie) who was born on July 23, 1987. The Petrinis separated several times during their almost eight year marriage. On July 9, 1989, Debra left the marital home for good and on July 25, 1990, she filed a Complaint for Divorce in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County; she sought custody of Eddie along with child support and attorney\u2019s fees. John filed a Counter-Complaint for Divorce in which he too prayed for custody of Eddie and for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">After a four day trial, the court (Wolff, J.) granted Debra a divorce. It awarded sole custody of Eddie to Debra, allowing John liberal visitation with his son. While the parties initially petitioned for joint custody of their son, the court concluded that joint custody would not be in Eddie\u2019s best interest. The court also awarded child support in the amount of $81.31 per week to Debra. Although the court found John\u2019s take-home income to be only $14,063.00 in 1991, it found that his mother allowed her son to reside in one of her homes rent-free, that she paid the expenses relating to his illeostomy bag, and that she paid Eddie\u2019s health insurance premiums.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respectively, these items had a value of $688.00 per month, $600.00 per year, and $1,392.00 per year. The court determined that these items constituted \u201cactual income\u201d to John, as that term is defined in \u00a7 12\u2014201(c)(4)(iii). The court, therefore, increased the amount of actual income received by John by $10,248.00 to reflect these \u201cgifts\u201d and thereby calculated John\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d to be $24,311.00 for purposes of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>puting the amount of his child support obligation under the statutory guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The court also ordered John to contribute $3,000.00 toward the cost of Debra\u2019s legal expenses. It explained the basis for its rulings on support, attorney\u2019s fees, and custody in a detailed oral opinion on May 13, 1992. Thereafter, John noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, seeking a reversal of the court\u2019s judgment as to the award of child support, attorney\u2019s fees, and child custody. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the lower court. We granted certiorari to consider the important issues raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We first consider whether the trial court properly determined the amount of child support to which Debra was entitled when it increased John\u2019s annual take-home income to account for the \u201cgifts\u201d received from his mother. We next determine whether the trial court abused its discretion by requiring John to contribute $3,000.00 to the cost of his former wife\u2019s legal expenses. And, finally, we decide whether the trial court properly applied the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child standard in awarding sole custody of Eddie to his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">\n<em>Child Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\"> That both parents have a legal as well as a moral obligation to support and care for their children is well-settled in Maryland. This legal duty is based on both common law and statutory authority. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5\u2014203(b)(1). <em>See also Middle</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>ton v. Middleton, </em>329 Md. 627, 631-33, 620 A.2d 1363 (1993). In making an award of child support, it is for the trial judge to set an amount reasonably calculated to maintain as nearly as possible the standard of living enjoyed by the child prior to the parents\u2019 divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In February of 1989, the General Assembly put into effect statutory Child Support Guidelines (the guidelines), which were adopted by adding Subtitle 2 to Title 12 of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The purpose of the guidelines was to limit the role of trial courts in deciding the specific amount of child support to be awarded in different cases by limiting the necessity for factual findings that had been required under pre-guidelines case law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The legislature also intended the guidelines to remedy the unconscionably low levels of many child support awards when compared with the actual cost of raising children, to improve the consistency and equity of child support awards, and to increase the efficiency in the adjudication of child support awards. <em>Voishan, supra, </em>327 Md. at 322, 609 A.2d 319. <em>See also Tannehill v. Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App. 4, 11, 591 A.2d 888 (1991). To accomplish these goals, the legislature promulgated certain uniform calculations that must be made in making any child support determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">While the Child Support Guidelines were merely advisory when they were first adopted, their use became mandatory when ch. 58 of the Acts of 1990 was enacted. A rebuttable presumption was thereby created that an award reached by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>applying the guidelines is the proper amount of child support to be awarded. <em>Voishan, supra, </em>327 Md. at 323-24, 609 A.2d 319. This presumption can be rebutted by showing evidence that applying the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case. The legislature set forth certain criteria that should be considered in determining whether the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-202(a)(2). If the court does conclude that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate, it must make a written or oral finding on the record explaining its departure from the established guidelines. <em>Walsh v. Walsh, </em>333 Md. 492, 501-502, 635 A.2d 1340 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">A basic child support obligation is determined using the schedule for that purpose set forth in \u00a7 12-204(e); it is divided proportionately between the parents in relation to their \u201cadjusted actual incomes.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to \u00a7 12-201(c), \u201cactual income\u201d is defined as \u201cincome from any source.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition to the categories of actual income mentioned in \u00a7 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>201(c)(3), \u00a7 12-201(c)(4) provides that <em>\u201c[b]ased on the circumstances of the case, </em>the court may [also] consider the following items as' actual income: (i) severance pay; (ii) capital gains; (iii) <em>gifts; </em>or (iv) prizes\u201d for the purpose of determining a party\u2019s child support obligation. (Emphasis supplied) The types of \u201cgifts\u201d that may be includable as part of a parent\u2019s actual income in a particular case is within the court\u2019s discretion, and should only be reversed if it acted arbitrarily in exercising its discretion or if the judgment on the matter was clearly wrong. <em>Gates v. Gates, </em>83 Md.App. 661, 663, 577 A.2d 382 (1990). <em>See also Kramer v. Kramer, </em>26 Md.App. 620, 636, 339 A.2d 328 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The General Assembly intentionally designed the guidelines to place decisions concerning whether \u201cgifts\u201d to a parent should be considered part of that person\u2019s \u201cactual income,\u201d and the items properly to be considered \u201cgifts,\u201d within the sound discretion of the trial court. This intent is clear upon review of the legislative history of the guidelines. Initially, the legislature included \u201cgifts\u201d as part of \u00a7 12-201(c)(2), which enumerates an extensive list of categories of things that must be considered in calculating a parent\u2019s \u201cactual income.\u201d Before the guidelines reached their final form, however, \u00a7 12-201 was revised and the category of \u201cgifts\u201d was taken out of \u00a7 12-201(c)(2) and put into \u00a7 12-201(c)(4), which specifically leaves the decision concerning whether certain contributions to a person\u2019s well being should be considered part of that party\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d within the sound discretion of the trial court, taking into account the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">John argues that the court abused its discretion when it increased his take-home income to reflect the \u201cgifts\u201d that he received from his mother. These \u201cgifts,\u201d as we earlier discussed, included rent-free housing valued at $688.00 per month, the expenses surrounding John\u2019s illeostomy valued at $600.00 per year, and the cost of Eddie\u2019s health insurance premiums valued at $1,392.00 per year. John maintains that these items do not amount to \u201cgifts\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-201(c)(4). His primary argument is that he receives no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tangible funds from these non-liquid and non-marketable assets from which he can pay an increased level of child support. John further argues that even if the contributions made to him do constitute \u201cgifts\u201d under the guidelines, they should not have been considered part of his actual income under the circumstances of his case. He attempts to illustrate the inequity of attributing what he calls \u201cphantom income\u201d to him by asserting that doing so leaves him with a negative after-tax income.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Neither the legislature in the statute, nor the courts in existing case law, have specifically defined what the word \u201cgifts\u201d means in the context of the guidelines. Thus, we must undertake to extrapolate its meaning from its general usage. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 956 (1981) defines a \u201cgift\u201d as \u201csomething that is voluntarily transferred by one to another without compensation.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 688 (6th ed. 1990) defines a \u201cgift\u201d as \u201ca voluntary transfer of property to another made gratuitously or without consideration.\u201d The benefits conferred upon John by his mother fit within both of these definitions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">As we see it, the General Assembly purposely did not define with pin-point precision what it intended the term \u201cgifts\u201d to encompass under the guidelines; rather it afforded trial courts the latitude to consider all the relevant circumstances in a particular case before making any determination about what should be considered in calculating a parent\u2019s support obligation. Some of the considerations that might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>made by a trial judge include: a parent\u2019s actual ability to pay the specified child support award, any lack of liquidity or marketability of a party\u2019s assets, the fact that a parent\u2019s take-home income is not an accurate reflection of his or her actual standard of living, and whether either party is voluntarily impoverished. All of these factors came into play in this case and were considered by the trial court in making its award.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Our limited task is to determine whether, the trial court abused its discretion in deciding that the gifts conferred upon John constitute actual income under \u00a7 12\u2014201(c)(4). The trial court, in its opinion, stated that \u201cthe guidelines tell us, that if you get [gifts], they\u2019re to be considered as income, cause it\u2019s something you don\u2019t have to spend for.\u201d We agree that when the Child Support Guidelines were formulated the drafters took into consideration the fact that everyone has certain basic living expenses, such as room and board, which must be paid out of their take-home income. Thus, if a parent is relieved of some of these expenses through outside contributions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to increase the parent\u2019s actual income to account for such contributions. Manifestly, these benefits may have the effect of freeing up other income that may not have otherwise been available to pay a child support award. In considering the circumstances surrounding John\u2019s financial situation, the court decided that the most equitable resolution required inclusion of the subject benefits conferred upon John as part of his actual income. The evidence presented at trial supported this conclusion by the court. It established that John has never needed to engage in full-time employment because his mother in addition to providing him with rent-free lodging, paying health insurance premiums, and covering the cost of his illeostomy bag, also paid some of his daily living expenses\u2014such as food, gas, and clothing\u2014as well as giving him large cash payments to do with as he wished. Essentially, John\u2019s mother paid for things that he would otherwise have been responsible for paying for himself out of his take-home salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The trial court also found that because John always seemed to have resources available to buy whatever he needed or wanted, he could afford to work only when he felt like it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> John admitted that he has received regular subsidies of approximately $500.00 per week from his mother over a long period of time to supplement his income as a part-time boatyard mechanic.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He accounted for these subsidies as \u201cadditional income\u201d on his financial affidavit submitted to the court in this case. Therefore, the trial court found that John\u2019s take-home income was not an accurate measure of his ability to pay child support for Eddie.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The Court of Special Appeals dealt with a somewhat similar situation in <em>Goldberger v. Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. 313, 624 A.2d 1328 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 453, 632 A.2d 150 (1993). In that case, Aron Goldberger, an Orthodox Jew, purportedly had devoted his entire life to the study of the Torah/Talmud. As a consequence, he had never been employed at an income-producing vocation, even before he got married and had children. He had been supported by others\u2014his parents, his father-in-law, and friends in the Orthodox community\u2014throughout his entire life, and thus had consistently relied upon the charity of others to provide his family with the necessities of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Based on these circumstances, the trial court found that Goldberger was \u201cvoluntarily impoverished.\u201d Because he had no \u201cactual income\u201d as defined by the guidelines, the court imputed what it found to be his \u201cpotential income\u201d based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>various delineated factors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 12\u2014201(b). In finding Goldberger to be voluntarily impoverished, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoN\">[a] parent who chooses a life of poverty before having children and makes a deliberate choice not to alter that status after having children is also \u201cvoluntarily impoverished.\u201d Whether the voluntary impoverishment is for the purpose of avoiding child support or because the parent simply has chosen a frugal lifestyle for another reason, . doesn\u2019t affect that parent\u2019s obligation to the child. Although the parent can choose to live in poverty, that parent cannot obligate the child to go without the necessities of life. A parent who .brings a child into this world must support that child, if he has or reasonably could obtain, the means to do so. The law requires that parent to alter his or her previously chosen lifestyle if necessary to enable the parent to meet his or her support obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\"><em>Goldberger, supra, </em>96 Md.App. at 326-27, 624 A.2d 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">According to this analysis, John might have been considered \u201cvoluntarily impoverished,\u201d but the court did not so find. Instead it determined that because John did not work full-time on a regular basis, and because he did not stop working up to his potential just to avoid paying child support to his son, he was not voluntarily impoverished as defined by the case law. Rather, as we have said, the court, exercising its discretion, considered the \u201cgifts\u201d from his mother as part of John\u2019s actual income in calculating his support obligation. Supportive of this determination is the case of <em>Walsh, supra, </em>333 Md. at 502, 635 A.2d 1340, holding that a husband\u2019s obligation to pay part of the mortgage payment on a family home in which his former wife and children lived under a use and possession order was to be considered income to the wife, resulting in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>reduction of the husband\u2019s income for the purpose of calculating his support obligation under the guidelines. Here, as in <em>Walsh, </em>money is made available to the party benefitting from the contribution that would not have otherwise been available to pay this ordinary living expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">John\u2019s final argument is that his mother\u2019s contributions may not continue indefinitely, and that no account was taken of this likely eventuality. Of course, should John\u2019s mother become unable or unwilling to continue supporting her son in the fashion that she has maintained over the past several years, John may petition the court for a modification of his child support obligation based upon a showing of a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We thus conclude that the trial court, in the circumstances of this case, properly considered the subject gifts supplied to John by his mother on a regular basis, thereby justifying the increase in John\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d by approximately $10,000.00 in calculating his child support obligation under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">According to \u00a7 12-103, a trial court may award to either party \u201cthe costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in any case in which a person applies for a decree . .. concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties.\u201d Section 12-103 goes on to state that before a court can award such costs and fees, it must consider \u201cthe financial status of each party; the needs of each party; and whether there was substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding.\u201d When the case permits attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded, they must be reasonable, taking into account such factors as labor, skill, time, and benefit afforded to the client, as well as the financial resources and needs of each party. <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>204 Md. 197, 213, 103 A.2d 856 (1954). <em>See also Waters v. Waters, </em>191 Md. 436, 441, 62 A.2d 250 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Decisions concerning the award of counsel fees rest solely in the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>272 Md. 107, 111-12, 321 A.2d 162 (1974). The proper exercise of such discretion is determined by evaluating the judge\u2019s application of the statutory criteria set forth above as well as the consideration of the facts of the particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 321 A.2d 162. Consideration of the statutory criteria is mandatory in making the award and failure to do so constitutes legal error. <em>Carroll County v. Edelmann, </em>320 Md. 150, 177, 577 A.2d 14 (1990). An award of attorney\u2019s fees will not be reversed unless a court\u2019s discretion was exercised arbitrarily or the judgment was clearly wrong. <em>Danzinger v. Danzinger, </em>208 Md. 469, 475, 118 A.2d 653 (1955). <em>See also Broseus v. Broseus, </em>82 Md.App. 183, 200, 570 A.2d 874 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Consistent with these decisions, the court looked to the parties\u2019 needs and resources; their financial status; the labor, skill, and time expended by each party\u2019s attorney; and the benefit to the child of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the mother. In addition, the court allowed John to pay the $3,000.00 award in twelve monthly installments. We find no error in the counsel fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Child Custody</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Child custody awards have traditionally been predicated on the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child involved. <em>See e.g. Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 769, 621 A.2d 898 (1993); <em>McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 481, 593 A.2d 1128 (1991); <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 303, 508 A.2d 964 (1986); <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 174-75, 372 A.2d 582 (1977); <em>Hild v. Hild, </em>221 Md. 349, 357, 157 A.2d 442 (1960). That which is in a child\u2019s best interest is not always easy to determine. As we pointed out in <em>Taylor, supra, </em>306 Md. at 303, 508 A.2d 964:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">[f]ormula or computer solutions in child custody matters are impossible because of the unique character of each case, and the subjective nature of the evaluations and decisions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>must be made. At best we can discuss the major factors that should be considered in determining [which parent should be given custody], but in doing so we recognize that none has talismanic qualities, and that no single list of criteria will satisfy the demands of every case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Therefore, over the years, Maryland courts have set forth a variety of objective criteria to be considered in determining which parent should be awarded custody of their minor children. While custody determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis due to the uniqueness of the fact patterns in such disputes, factors relied upon in past cases can be used to guide the trial court\u2019s decisionmaking process. <em>Ross, supra, </em>280 Md. at 187-88, 372 A.2d 582. In this regard, trial courts are endowed with great discretion in making decisions concerning the best interest of the child.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">In <em>Hild, supra, </em>221 Md. at 349, 157 A.2d 442, we observed: [f]or the purpose of ascertaining what is likely to be in the best interests and welfare of the child a court may properly consider, among other things, the fitness of the persons seeking custody, the adaptability of the prospective custodian to the task, the age, sex, and health of the child, the physical, spiritual and moral well-being of the child, the environment and surroundings in which the child will be reared, the influences likely to be exerted on the child, and, if he or she is old enough to make a rational choice, the preference of the child. It stands to reason that the fitness of a person to have custody is of vital importance. The paramount consideration, however, is the general overall well-being of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">An even more comprehensive list of factors to be considered in making custody determinations is contained in <em>Montgomery County v. Sanders, </em>38 Md.App. 406, 381 A.2d 1154 (1978), which distills the holdings in numerous cases of this Court delineating the governing criteria. Of course, the controlling factor, or guiding principle, in both custody and adoption cases is not the natural parents\u2019 interest in raising the child, but rather what best serves the interest of the child; the para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>mount consideration is what will best promote the child\u2019s welfare, a consideration that is of \u201ctranscendent importance.\u201d' <em>In Re Adoption No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 113, 642 A.2d 201 (1994); <em>In Re Adoption No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 561, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The standard of review in custody cases is whether the trial court abused its discretion in making its custody determination. <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 125, 372 A.2d 231 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977), <em>reh. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 754, 54 L.Ed.2d 774 (1978). In setting forth this standard, we concluded that \u201cwhen the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the chancellor founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the chancellor\u2019s decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>280 Md. at 126, 372 A.2d 231. <em>See also Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513-14, 615 A.2d 1190 (1992); <em>Domingues v. Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 491-92, 593 A.2d 1133 (1991); <em>Ross, supra, </em>280 Md. at 186, 372 A.2d 582. Particularly important in custody cases is the trial court\u2019s opportunity to observe the demeanor and the credibility of the parties and witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">John argues that the court\u2019s decision was not supported, and was in fact contradicted, by its factual findings. He maintains that the court\u2019s custody award to Debra was based upon a \u201cgut feeling,\u201d and not as a result of factual findings made pursuant to the legally governing criteria. John suggests that because the court found that all but one of the factors considered favored neither party and because the remaining factor appeared to favor him, the award of custody should have been to him. We disagree. The court\u2019s decision was based on detailed factual findings and extensive deliberation concerning Eddie\u2019s best interest and we find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In applying the controlling criteria, the trial court found that, while both parties had suffered from addiction problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>in the past, at the present time they both appear to be \u201cequally fit\u201d to raise their son. Next, it stated that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing as to the character or reputation of either that would play a factor in deciding custody.\u201d With regard to the potentiality of maintaining natural family relations, the court found that the evidence cut both ways. While it recognized that John has a large extended family in the area which can be considered a positive factor, and that Debra does not, it stated that, even though John\u2019s family helps him, they \u201cprobably help him too much, and probably to the child\u2019s detriment\u201d and that such interference was probably one of the causes of the marriage\u2019s break-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Next, the court found that Eddie was too young to make a meaningful or rational choice as to the parent with whom he would prefer to live. As to opportunities affecting the future life of the child, the court concluded that neither parent had anything more to offer to the child by way of material advantages than the other parent. It found that the \u201cgifts\u201d from John\u2019s mother were not a factor in determining whether John can offer Eddie any material advantages, especially because John has no control over the extent or duration of these contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The court found that the age, sex, and health of Eddie had no bearing on which parent should be awarded custody. Both parents\u2019 residences were determined to be suitable for raising a minor child. In addition, the court found that Eddie had never been completely separated from either parent; rather he had spent a substantial amount of time with both his parents since Debra left the marital home in July of 1989. Nor did the court find an abandonment or surrender of custody of Eddie by either party at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">John urges that the court\u2019s custody award was inappropriately based on what it called a \u201cgut feeling.\u201d When taken in context, and the court\u2019s decision is considered in its entirety, it is clear that its determination was grounded on far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>more than an unsupported whim as John posits. As the court carefully explained, it weighed all the appropriate factors; it considered all the documentary evidence, as well as all the witnesses\u2019 testimony; and it took into account its personal observations and impressions of the parties and witnesses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">As we said in <em>Domingues, supra, </em>323 Md. at 492, 593 A.2d 1133:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">The evidence in a given case may be sufficient to support an award of custody to either parent.... [I]t is quite often the case that both parents are entirely \u201cfit\u201d to have legal and/or physical custody of a child, but joint custody is not feasible. In such cases, the chancellor must exercise his or her independent discretion to make the decision.... [I]n the final analysis, the decision must be made by the chancellor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Based on its factual findings, the court\u2019s award was not clearly erroneous; instead it constituted a lawful exercise of the sound discretion vested in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

New York's child support guidelines include a similar provision to Maryland\u2019s \u00a7 12-201(c)(4). According to art. 13, \u00a7 240 l-b(b)(5)(iv) of the New York Consolidated Laws Service, \"at the discretion of the court, the court may attribute or impute income from, such other resources as may be available to the parent, including, but not limited to: (A) non-income producing assets, ... and (D) money, goods, or services provided by relatives or friends.\u201d These categories seem to encompass the same sort of contributions to a parent's income as the General Assembly might have intended to include when it used the term \"gifts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">.

John reported a gross income of only $15,389.00 in 1991, a figure far less than this purported potential earning capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">. Even though John admitted in court that he received approximately $500.00 per week in gift subsidies from his mother, the trial court only added the equivalent of $200.00 per week to his take-home salary to arrive at the actual income which was to be used in calculating his support obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. These factors include a person\u2019s age; mental and physical condition; assets; educational background, special training, or skills; prior earnings; efforts to find and retain employment; the status of the job market in the area where the parent lives; actual income from any source; and any other factor bearing on the parent\u2019s ability to obtain funds for child support. <em>Goldberger, supra, </em>96 Md.App. at 327-28, 624 A.2d 1328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">.
