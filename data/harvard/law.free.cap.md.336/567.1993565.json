We agree with that recommendation and, finding merit in the petition, we shall vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and remand the matter to that court for the purpose of permitting the Petitioner to exercise his right to a jury trial if that continues to be his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">\n<em>JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION COSTS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
