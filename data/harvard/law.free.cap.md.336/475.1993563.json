Albrecht was found guilty of one count of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of reckless endangerment following a bench trial before Judge Peter J. Messitte in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>brecht appealed, contending that the evidence presented to the trial court was legally insufficient to sustain those convictions. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Albrecht\u2019s contention and reversed. <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 630, 632 A.2d 163 (1993). We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the intermediate appellate court. Upon our review of the record evidence, we conclude that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to support each of Albrecht\u2019s convictions. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">At the outset, we emphasize that when an appellate court is called upon to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to sustain a criminal conviction, it is not the function or duty of the appellate court to undertake a review of the record that would amount to, in essence, a retrial of the case. Rather, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 182-83, 502 A.2d 496, 498 (1986), giving due regard to the trial court\u2019s finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>See, e.g., State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 589, 606 A.2d 265, 268 (1992); Maryland Rule 8-131(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fundamentally, our concern is not with whether the trial court\u2019s verdict is in accord with what appears to us to be the weight of the evidence, <em>see Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d at 573; <em>Allison v. State, </em>203 Md. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>5, 98 A.2d 273, 275 (1953), but rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence\u2014that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In other words, when a sufficiency challenge is made, the reviewing court is not to \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; rather, the duty of the appellate court is only to determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d at 573 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 661, 612 A.2d 258, 274 (1992); <em>Raines, </em>326 Md. at 588-89, 606 A.2d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The basic facts of this case are undisputed. On the afternoon of May 23, 1991, Montgomery County Police Officers Christopher Albrecht and Marvin Thomas were dispatched to Fairhaven Drive in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to investigate a reported stabbing. Upon arriving at the scene, the officers were informed that a fight had broken out between Timothy Fair and three young men and that Fair had been stabbed in the back with a broken bottle by Darnell Budd, whom Albrecht knew by name. Witnesses at the scene also told the officers that the three men involved in the fight were known to be drug dealers and that the three might have been involved in a robbery. The officers were told that Budd had left the Fairhaven Drive area in a green Chevrolet driven by Rebecca Garnett. One witness warned the officers that there might be a gun in the Chevrolet, although no one at the scene reported seeing any of the individuals involved with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">While the officers were still at the scene, a witness saw the green Chevrolet pass by and shouted \u201cThere goes the car.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Albrecht saw three people in the car as it passed: a female, who was driving, and two black male passengers. Thomas and Albrecht both got into their cruisers and set off in pursuit. Although the officers initially lost sight of the Chevrolet, after a brief search of the surrounding neighborhood Albrecht spotted the car in a parking lot at Larchmont Terrace, a townhouse complex in Montgomery County. The car was parked perpendicular to the curb with the front end facing the street. The driver, Rebecca Garnett, and one of the male passengers, whom Albrecht recognized as Darnell Budd, had exited the car and were standing in the parking lot. The other- male passenger, James Littlejohn, remained in the back seat of the car. The car was parked directly in front of a neighborhood playground. The documentary evidence presented at trial showed that Garnett stood no more than six feet from the sidewalk that ran in front of the playground area. In photographs from the scene, some playground equip- \u25a0 ment, including a slide, is visible directly behind the spot where Rebecca Garnett stood. A swingset is visible to the rear and the right of where Garnett stood. Both the slide and swingset appear to be set approximately ten to fifteen feet behind the sidewalk. At the time that Albrecht spotted the Chevrolet\u2014which was approximately 7 p.m.\u2014it was still daylight and there were several children and adults both in the playground area, on the sidewalk running behind the Chevrolet and in front of the playground, and on the surrounding street.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Albrecht brought his police cruiser to a stop in front of and to the right of the driver\u2019s door of the Chevrolet. At that time, Garnett was standing next to the closed driver\u2019s side door, holding a bag of Fritos in one hand. Her other hand was empty. Budd stood by the passenger side door. Little-john, still in the car, appeared to be either sitting on the back seat or kneeling down on the floorboards of the car\u2019s rear passenger compartment. As Albrecht was parking his cruiser, he saw Garnett and Budd exchange words and begin to move towards the Chevrolet, appearing to him as if they were going to try to leave the scene. Exiting his cruiser, Albrecht <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>yelled, \u201cStop! Freeze!\u201d and, at the same time, removed his shotgun from its rack inside his vehicle. Witnesses at the scene reported also hearing a command to \u201cPut your hands in the air.\u201d Albrecht, standing behind the open door of his cruiser, then immediately placed a shotgun shell in the chamber of the shotgun and \u201cracked\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the shotgun into its final stage of firing capability. He then leveled his shotgun at Garnett, who stood approximately thirty-seven feet away from him. Witnesses at the scene testified that Albrecht, looking down the barrel of the gun, aimed his shotgun directly at Garnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Officer Thomas arrived at Larchmont Terrace a matter of seconds after Albrecht. Thomas moved his police cruiser into a position in front of and to the left of the Chevrolet. The manner in which Albrecht and Thomas parked their cruisers was in accordance with standard police procedure by which officers use their vehicles for cover while attempting to effectuate an arrest. When Thomas first exited his cruiser, he did not remove his shotgun from its rack inside his vehicle. Upon hearing the racking of Albrecht\u2019s shotgun, however, Thomas reached back into his cruiser and removed his own. Both Thomas and Albrecht were using Remington Wingmaster Model 870 shotguns, the standard model shotgun issued to Montgomery County police officers. As manufactured, the shotgun holds four rounds of ammunition. Albrecht, however, had customized his weapon by fitting it with a bandolier, or sling, that held fifteen extra rounds of ammunition and added 2.39 pounds to the weight of his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Albrecht testified that he kept his shotgun pointed at Gar-nett until he decided that she did not pose any danger to him or to any other person. After \u201cchecking off\u2019 Garnett as a threat, Albrecht testified that he intended to swing the shotgun to the left in order to bring it to bear on Littlejohn and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Budd. The shotgun, however, discharged and struck Garnett in the chest. Garnett died almost immediately. Witnesses at the scene testified that Albrecht was steadily holding the shotgun and directly aiming it at Garnett at the time that the weapon discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Although Albrecht saw Garnett sink to the ground after his gun had fired, he testified that he thought that she was simply sitting down so as to comply with his orders to \u201cstop\u201d and \u201cfreeze\u201d and that he did not realize that she had been shot. Shouting \u201cI told you not to move,\u201d Albrecht immediately racked a second round into the shotgun\u2019s chamber as a result, Albrecht testified, of \u201crealizing my gun went off.\u201d He and Thomas then approached the Chevrolet and placed Budd and Littlejohn under arrest. After Budd and Littlejohn had been arrested, Albrecht turned his attention to Garnett. Several witnesses at the scene testified that approximately ten minutes had elapsed since the shotgun had discharged before Albrecht approached Garnett. Witnesses at the scene also testified that Albrecht first \u201cfrisked\u201d Garnett, patting down her pockets in an apparent search, before he attempted, without success, to administer CPR. On July 30, 1991, Albrecht was indicted in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on one count of manslaughter, one count of recklessly endangering Rebecca Garnett, and one count of recklessly endangering various other individuals who were in the playground area of Larchmont Terrace at the time of the shooting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A bench trial commenced on March 9, 1992, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County before Judge Peter J. Messitte.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>After all evidence had been received, Judge Messitte commented at length on the evidence presented and the elements of the crimes charged. With respect to the charge of voluntary manslaughter, Judge Messitte stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">There has been a welter of evidence in this case, and there is no need to recount it all. One fact is clear beyond dispute\u2014the Defendant fired a shot that caused the death of Rebecca Garnett. Was it an intended or unintended act? At a minimum, in order for the State to proceed with the charge of voluntary manslaughter, the State would have to convince that the act was intended, and I may say that as to the matter of voluntariness, I have sufficient doubt that I cannot find the Defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter and I do not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Having found non-proof of voluntariness, the trial court then turned to the charges of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">The question in this case, the overriding question in this case, both in terms of the manslaughter and reckless endangerment charges, is whether the conduct overall of the Defendant was reckless, and I will assume that the same measure of recklessness, that it be a gross and wanton deviation from reasonable conduct, would apply to both the manslaughter and the reckless endangerment charges, although we did not discuss that I will assume that they are equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The trial court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">We are thus brought to the inquiry whether, under all the circumstances, Christopher Albrecht, conscious of the risk, acted in a grossly negligent manner, creating a high degree of risk to human life in the one case resulting in death and in the other resulting in endangerment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">I have no doubt that Christopher Albrecht was attempting to do right on the occasion in question and that he acted at all times without malice in his heart. But again, the standard is one of a reasonable officer similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Much has been said about the high crime incidence in the Larchmont Terrace vicinity and the excited reports of people on the playground where the bottle stabbing occurred. Much has been said about the use of a shotgun in the course of police work; that it is an awesome weapon, effective often by its appearance alone, more so, of course, when actually put to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">I will not recite all the facts that bring me to my conclusion, but I have thought much about it over the last two weeks and reach it with great pain and compassion for everyone involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">It comes then to this. In my view, Christopher Albrecht, on the evening in question, particularly given the numerous innocent persons perceived and unperceived, including Rebecca Garnett, misjudged the situation before him very badly. He relied upon a weapon customized by him in a highly questionable and potentially dangerous fashion. Heedless of a situation where innocent bystanders stood at great risk of serious injury or death, he sought to capture a felon, not the most fiercesome type it must be said, by causing the innocent loss of life of Rebecca Garnett and by imperiling the lives of James Littlejohn, Tequila Frazier, Travell Dumar and Carroll Walker. He did not need to do so, given the relative lack of severity of the crime, given the lack of threats posed by the suspects, given their essential compliance with his shouted commands, particularly within the brief window of time between the time he gave the commands and the time he fired, and perhaps additionally, given the fact that he knew personally, as well as by name, the prime suspect and could take him down, as the police say, in good time without endangering the members of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">It is my belief that the Defendant\u2019s shotgun was aimed at Becky Garnett, as well as the others in the immediate vicinity of the green automobile, that Ms. Garnett\u2019s confused reaction to Defendant\u2019s commands startled him into pulling the trigger. He, I know, would wish it differently. But it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>was his own unfortunate misguided act that put him in the way of that happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">Regrettably, I conclude that Christopher Albrecht\u2019s conduct was not that of a reasonable officer similarly situated. It was conduct that was not only negligent, but grossly so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">Ultimately, it rises in my view to the level of negligence sufficient to convict the Defendant of involuntary manslaughter, and I find him guilty of that count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">He is also guilty of the charge of reckless endangerment against Rebecca Garnett which will merge into the first count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">And he is guilty of the charge of reckless endangerment with regard to the persons of James Littlejohn, Tequila Frazier, Travell Dumar and Carroll Walker; but not guilty as to the others, Darnell Budd among them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">Judge Messitte then concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">The range of my decision must not be misapprehended. I respect and admire our police and I support them as we all should. Felons should take no comfort in this decision. There will be many occasions where displaying, chambering, pointing, and even firing of a shotgun by police will be the appropriate response. May 28rd, 1991, on Larchmont Terrace in Gaithersburg, I am deeply sad to say, was not one of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">Albrecht noted on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on July 20, 1992, contending that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to support the involuntary manslaughter conviction and the two reckless endangerment convictions and, hence, that the verdicts were clearly erroneous. In reversing the judgments of the trial court, the intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">We hold that, given the factual finding that Officer Albrecht did not fire the shotgun intentionally, the remaining evidence was not legally sufficient to support a finding of gross criminal negligence, to wit, evidence that he was acting without justification and in such a way as to exhibit a reckless and wanton disregard for human life. Neither was the remaining evidence, once any fact finding that the gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>had been fired intentionally was rejected, legally sufficient to support a verdict that Officer Albrecht was guilty of misconduct so reckless as to constitute a gross departure \u25a0 from the standard of conduct that a reasonable police officer would observe. We hold, therefore, that the verdicts of guilty of involuntary manslaughter and of reckless endangerment, necessarily predicated on such states of mind, were clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><em>Albrecht, </em>97 Md.App. at 688, 632 A.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the intermediate appellate court. Upon our own review of the extensive record in this case, including over 1,750 pages of trial testimony, we conclude that the Court of Special Appeals erred in its determination that there was insufficient evidence to support Albrecht\u2019s convictions. Specifically, we find that there was sufficient evidence presented from which the trial court could have concluded that Albrecht was both grossly negligent and reckless in failing to exercise the extreme caution that he was required to exercise in the handling and the use of his shotgun. We find that sufficient evidence was presented from which the trial court could have found that the use of deadly force against Rebecca Garnett would have been unjustified under the circumstances. We find that the evidence was sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the fact that Rebecca Garnett did not pose any danger to either Albrecht himself or to third parties, Albrecht took substantial steps to use deadly force against her\u2014to wit, racking his shotgun and aiming it, with his finger on the trigger, at Garnett. Ultimately, deadly force was used, without justification, and Rebecca Garnett was killed. We conclude that sufficient evidence was presented from which a rational trier of fact could have found that Albrecht\u2019s actions on May 23, 1991, in their totality, were both grossly negligent and reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">As Judge Messitte noted, the \u201coverriding question\u201d in this case was whether Albrecht\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201cgross and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>wanton deviation from reasonable conduct\u201d such as would support convictions of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment. As such, the evidence presented at trial, both in the form of documentary and testimonial evidence, focused upon the issue of whether Albrecht had acted as a reasonable police officer under the circumstances. We shall now review that evidence. Once again, however, we note that in our review of Albrecht\u2019s convictions, it is neither our duty nor our role to assess the credibility of the witnesses who testified nor to weigh the evidence presented. Rather, we shall only review that evidence which supported the State\u2019s case in order to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have convicted the defendant of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">At trial, both sides presented extensive evidence regarding the policies and procedures of the Montgomery County Police Department with respect to the use of deadly force and with respect to the display and use of shotguns during felony stops. The State introduced into the record portions of the Montgomery County Police Department\u2019s Field Operations Manual, referred to as Departmental Directive DD 83-15, which contains various directives on the use of deadly force and the use of firearms by Montgomery County police officers. The purpose of DD 83-15 is identified on the face of the document: \u201c[t]o provide guidelines and detail restrictions concerning the utilization of deadly force in any form by officers of the Department.\u201d With respect to the use of deadly force in defense of self or others, Departmental Directive DD 83-15, entered as State\u2019s Exhibit 13A, provides that officers may only use deadly force \u201cto defend themselves, or another person from what they have reasonable cause to perceive as an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Pursuant to DD 83-15, officers may use deadly force to apprehend fleeing felons only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">(a) when they have probable cause to believe the crime committed was murder, first degree rape, first degree sexual offense, armed robbery, or assault with intent to commit any of the foregoing, <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>(b) they have probable cause to believe the person fleeing committed the crime or the person fleeing escaped while being held in legal custody as a suspect in one of the above listed crimes, <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">(c) that failure to immediately apprehend the person may place the officer, another law enforcement officer, or the public in danger of death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\"><em>Id. </em>DD 83-15 further provides that \u201c[t]he officer\u2019s decision to use deadly force against a fleeing felon will be judged by the reasonableness of his/her action given the facts and circumstances available to the officer at the time the force is employed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">With respect to the use of firearms, DD 83-15 provides that \u201c[fjirearms may be drawn whenever an officer has reason to fear for his safety or the safety of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. On the use of shotguns, in particular, DD 83-15 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAq\">The shotgun is particularly useful when police anticipate confronting an armed subject or group of subjects in a high-risk arrest situation. However, officers must exercise <em>extreme caution </em>when removing the shotgun from the vehicle when the shooting background presents a potential danger to innocent bystanders such as within a store, on a crowded street, or other similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). DD 83-15, however, does not specify when an officer should draw his service revolver rather than his shotgun. The Departmental Directive also does not specify the circumstances under which an officer may display <em>and </em>rack his shotgun, or the circumstances under which an officer may display, rack, <em>and </em>aim his shotgun at a suspect. With respect to the firing of the shotgun, however, DD 83-15 does provide that \u201c[ojfficers must exercise caution when discharging a firearm to avoid endangering the lives of bystanders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The State elicited testimony from Lieutenant John Meiklejohn, Director of Training for the Montgomery County Police Department, regarding the directives contained in DD 83-15. Lieutenant Meiklejohn noted that there are various levels of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>force that an officer may use when arresting suspects of a crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">Well, specifically in the defensive tactics area we try to teach [police candidates] that they have the right to use that force which is necessary to effect an arrest, to protect themselves, or control a situation. And in that they received training in the use of their voice to command people, their mere presence which is legal and authorized Government authority, to physical control which is placing their hands on an individual to physically attempt to control them, to the use of a protective instrument, which is a PR-24, a nightstick, or other types of things that you may, under certain circumstances, use to protect yourself or help control an individual, to the possibility of using deadly force with your firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Meiklejohn testified that an officer\u2019s decision to draw <em>any </em>firearm must be supported by a clear and present danger to the safety of the officer himself or to third parties. According to Meiklejohn\u2019s testimony, there is no directive on choice of weapon when the decision to draw a firearm is made, and the initial decision of whether to draw the shotgun as opposed to a handgun is left to the officer\u2019s individual discretion. Meiklejohn further testified that he did not provide any instruction to police candidates at the police training academy about the selection of a weapon to be displayed or used by an officer in any given situation. According to Meiklejohn, pursuant to Montgomery County\u2019s departmental directives, a shotgun may be used and is often the appropriate weapon to use when an officer must confront multiple suspects in a'high risk situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Meiklejohn also testified that once the decision to display the shotgun has been made, the officer must pay particular attention to his shooting background and to the presence of innocent bystanders because the shotgun is an \u201carea weapon\u201d and it \u201cis possible to hit more than one person\u201d with a single discharge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">[QUESTION]: Now, is there another segment of this policy, Lieutenant, that specifically addresses shotguns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>[MEIKLEJOHN]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">[QUESTION]: And can you tell the Judge about that please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">[MEIKLEJOHN]: You can find it on page 3, Your Honor, under Roman Numeral III(c), and it pretty much says that shotguns are useful when confronting armed subjects or groups of subjects, especially in high risk arrest situations, but that the weapon\u2014There should be some care and caution when using that weapon because not just that weapon, but anytime, you have to concern yourself with the possibility of the shooting background and the danger you pose to bystanders that may be in the area. [QUESTION]: Now, in fact, the phrase that\u2019s used there is \u201cextreme caution?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">[MEIKLEJOHN]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Testimony was also received from Sergeant Robert Muehlenhort, an instructor at the Montgomery County police training academy in 1987 when Albrecht was a police candidate. According to Muehlenhort, an officer\u2019s shotgun is considered the \u201cultimate weapon to utilize\u201d and constitutes the highest level of force that an officer may use to respond to a particular situation. Sergeant Muehlenhort testified that an officer may, in his discretion, make the determination of whether to use his shotgun, but that the officer must be able to articulate a clear and present danger to himself or others before the shotgun may be used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">[A]n officer has to make an independent decision of whether to use, and what level of force to use, and he must articulate as to the directive a clear and present danger to himself and others. And that means every officer that\u2019s involved in the situation. He must be able to articulate that phrase of being a clear and present danger to himself or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASW\">With respect to the training received by police candidates at Montgomery County training academy, the following testimony was elicited from Muehlenhort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">[QUESTION]: Do you teach the officers to rack a shotgun every time they take one out to display it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>[MUEHLENHORT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\">[QUESTION]: Do you teach them to put their finger on the trigger and aim it every time they take it out to display it? [MUEHLENHORT]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">According to Muehlenhort, police candidates are taught that the shotgun should not be racked unless the officer intends to shoot the weapon. Muehlenhort explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">[b]eeause once you chamber the weapon\u2014Let\u2019s say, like in a lot of cases some officers would, in a building search, when you have an alarm off or something and you\u2019re going through the building, and if you rack one in it is a potential any time you can trip and fall and you could have a round discharge from the weapon. And it takes such a short time to rack and fire a shotgun. We\u2019re talking seconds, really, when it comes down to it, and give that little bit of latitude in there. It is a dangerous weapon, by all means, and you can trip and fall doing things. That can actually happen. And we try to avoid racking it unless you\u2019re going to seriously use it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In that regard, Muehlenhort testified that there are situations which call only for the display of the shotgun, such as \u201chigh-density\u201d situations where \u201csomeone could seriously be hurt.\u201d Muehlenhort stated that he would not rack his own shotgun unless he found himself in a \u201csevere situation\u201d where he would have to defend his own or another person\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Muehlenhort further testified that, as an instructor at the training academy, he recommended to police candidates that the safety on the shotgun be kept engaged and that the shotgun should be racked and aimed only when an officer intends to fire the weapon and would be justified in doing so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0f\">if you\u2019re going to point it at someone you\u2019re going to have to articulate that you\u2019re in a clear and present danger. If you point it and it\u2019s already racked, you\u2019re going to shoot it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlS\">When confronted with a hypothetical question based upon the facts of Albrecht\u2019s shooting, Muehlenhort testified that it was within the departmental guidelines for an officer to display his shotgun under those circumstances and he himself would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>displayed the shotgun. He testified, however, that there was no reason, under those circumstances, for an officer to rack his shotgun and that he would not have racked his shotgun. Muehlenhort further stated that he would not have aimed the shotgun at Garnett with his finger on the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The State also elicited testimony from Officer Michael McNally, a firearms instructor at the Montgomery County police training academy. McNally testified that police candidates are taught that the display and racking of the shotgun can facilitate an arrest because of the distinct and intimidating sound that a shotgun makes when it is racked. McNally stated that the shotgun is \u201cmore of an offensive weapon\u201d than a handgun because the shotgun discharges \u201cmultiple projectiles,\u201d creating \u201ca better chance of [the officer] hitting whatever it is [he\u2019s] intending on shooting at.\u201d Although noting that Montgomery County has no official policy on whether the shotgun\u2019s safety mechanism should be engaged or disengaged when it is displayed, McNally testified that it is the custom and habit of Montgomery County police officers to keep the safety mechanisms on their shotguns disengaged. McNally further testified that police candidates were instructed that an officer\u2019s trigger finger should be kept on the trigger guard and away from the trigger when the shotgun\u2019s safety is disengaged, so as to prevent \u201cinadvertent[ ]\u201d discharges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7B\">[QUESTION]: In your opinion is the recommendation to officers that they always have the safety disengaged unsafe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A16v\">[MCNALLY]: No. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unsafe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akn\">[QUESTION]: Why don\u2019t you think it\u2019s unsafe, because it sounds to the layman like if you\u2019ve got a safety you should tell people to put it on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">.[MCNALLY]: Well, if you have it off I do tell everybody that you should have your finger off the trigger until you\u2019re on the target.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">s|s * * * * sH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">[MCNALLY]: Because if you\u2019re assuming that [the safety is] always off, you know it\u2019s ready to fire. But if you keep your finger off of the trigger and outside the trigger guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>until you\u2019re on the target, it\u2019s going to be safe. It\u2019s just not going to go off inadvertently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Several witnesses also testified regarding the addition of the bandolier and extra rounds of ammunition to Albrecht\u2019s shotgun. Although Montgomery County\u2019s departmental guidelines permit officers to attach slings or bandoliers to their shotguns, Officer McNally testified that the shotguns issued by Montgomery County do not come equipped with such slings. McNally also stated that of the five hundred shotguns carried by members of the police department, he knew only of two shotguns, in addition to Albrecht\u2019s, that had been fitted with bandoliers. McNally further testified that the addition of the bandolier and extra ammunition to Albrecht\u2019s weapon caused the \u201cbarrel to move somewhat.\u201d Lester Lemerick, Firearms Program Manager and Chief Gunsmith for the Federal Bureau of Investigations, testified that he had examined Albrecht\u2019s shotgun and had found that the balance point of Albrecht\u2019s shotgun was adversely affected by the addition of extra equipment. Lemerick testified that the added weight of the bandolier and extra shells tended to pull the barrel of the shotgun down and increased the likelihood of an accidental discharge. Lemerick concluded that removal of the bandolier and extra shells would make the shotgun a safer weapon and that, with the bandolier and extra ammunition attached, he would not have approved the shotgun for use by the regular agent. James Hennings, a research designer from the Remington Arms Company, testified that the added weight of the sling and extra rounds of ammunition made Albrecht\u2019s shotgun \u201cmore cumbersome\u201d to handle. Finally, Lieutenant Meiklejohn testified that very few officers in Montgomery County carry a sling holding extra ammunition because there is no need for it; the shotgun itself holds four rounds of ammunition and the average number of rounds expended by a police officer in a firefight ranges from only 2.5 to 2.8 rounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Former Sergeant Raymond Griffin, a former Commander of the In-Service Training Division at the Montgomery County police training academy, stated that the shotgun is a \u201cparticularly dangerous weapon\u201d which \u201ccreates a pattern of destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tion\u201d when used, and that an officer must exercise \u201cextreme caution\u201d in the use of that weapon. Griffin, who was called by the defense, testified that the determining criterion for when an officer should draw his shotgun during a felony stop is \u201cthe potential for some kind of attack,\u201d \u201cwhen the officer felt his life or another life\u2014another person\u2019s life\u2014was in danger.\u201d According to Griffin, an officer is entitled to rack the shotgun and to point it at a suspect if he feels his life or someone else\u2019s life is threatened; the decision to aim a loaded shotgun at a suspect should be predicated upon a reasonable perception that the person at whom it is being aimed poses a threat. In that regard, Griffin testified that officers are not permitted, trained, or encouraged to rack and aim their shotguns as a matter of course during all felony stops. Griffin testified that there are gradations in the threat of force that an officer should reasonably employ to take control of a situation, and that the level of force an officer uses must be reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">According to Griffin, when an officer has drawn, racked, and aimed his shotgun, the officer\u2019s finger is permitted to be within the shotgun\u2019s trigger guard. He testified that an officer should not place his finger on the shotgun\u2019s trigger unless and until the officer believes that he may have to shoot the suspect. According to Griffin\u2019s testimony, an officer approaching a suspect with a weapon employed for the purposes of making an arrest is responsible for the suspect\u2019s safety. Additionally, Griffin testified that when an officer uses any weapon, he must always use extreme caution because of the danger posed to bystanders in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defense also called various Montgomery County police officers to testify as to their training and understanding of the Montgomery County departmental directives governing the use of shotguns and of deadly force. Officer Joyce M. Barrow, a Montgomery County police officer who had been a classmate of Albrecht\u2019s at the training academy, testified that police candidates were instructed that they are to respond with force that is appropriate to the circumstances, and that the shotgun must be used with extreme caution. Officer' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Donna Howard, who was also a classmate of Albrecht\u2019s at the training academy, testified that the racking and aiming of a shotgun indicates that the officer has a reasonable belief that she may have to shoot the person at whom she is aiming. Deputy Sheriff John Kenworthy also testified that he was in Albrecht\u2019s training class, and that he and his fellow candidates were instructed that officers must use extreme caution when using a shotgun, paying particular attention to the shooting background, so as to avoid exposing innocent bystanders to unwarranted risk as much as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Officer Thomas provided his own account of the events which occurred on May 23. According to Thomas, when he arrived on the scene at Larchmont Terrace, he got out of his squad car without his shotgun. As he heard Albrecht racking his shotgun, however, Thomas reached back into his car for his own, concluding that Albrecht must have \u201cfelt something I didn\u2019t feel, he saw something I didn\u2019t see.\u201d Noting that a shotgun is \u201cvery high,\u201d if not the \u201chighest,\u201d in terms of the levels of force an officer may use in a given situation, Thomas testified that, at the time he exited his cruiser on May 23, he believed that the situation could be handled with a handgun. Thomas stated that Rebecca Garnett \u201chad done nothing\u201d which would have led him to believe it was appropriate to remove his shotgun and aim it at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Albrecht testified on his own behalf. Describing the initial moments after he arrived at Larchmont Terrace, Albrecht stated that he \u201cfelt fairly threatened, because I had two\u2014 two\u2014people who had just been involved in a serious incident and I was told there might be a gun in the car.\u201d Albrecht testified that he decided to draw his shotgun because he faced multiple suspects, and because he had been given information about the possibility that a gun was in the Chevrolet. Albrecht admitted, however, that he did not see any of the suspects with a gun or with any other weapon, and that he did not feel threatened by Rebecca Garnett:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">[QUESTION]: But you didn\u2019t think Becky Garnett was going to kill you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>[ALBRECHT]: Not at the point where I had looked at her and looked away from her. No. Not when I checked her off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">[QUESTION]: She had done nothing, had she, to indicate that she was going to kill you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">[ALBRECHT]: At that moment in time? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae4\">[QUESTION]: At any moment in any time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB9\">[ALBRECHT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">[QUESTION]: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">[ALBRECHT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">As he brought his racked shotgun towards Garnett, Albrecht testified that she had complied with his command to stop moving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">[A]s I was yelling, I started bringing the gun up to point it in the general direction of the car. I looked at her [Gar-nett]. She had stopped. She was holding a bag of chips in her left hand, in her right hand, and in my mind I checked her off. I looked at Mr. Budd. I said, \u201cHe\u2019s still a threat.\u201d I looked at Mr. Littlejohn, \u201cHe\u2019s still a threat.\u201d I looked at Ms. Garnett. I said, \u201cShe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t think to myself that she was a threat. She was standing in the open. She had a bag of chips in her hand. Her other hand was out. She was wearing a white blouse and beige\u2014orange\u2014shorts that were fairly tight fitting on her and I just didn\u2019t feel threatened by her at that point. And I was beginning to bring the gun up to put it in a position to bring it to bear on Darnell Budd, because he\u2019s still behind the car and he\u2019s making a lot of motions with his hands. He\u2019s still moving around a lot. And just as I was doing that I heard an explosion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">Albrecht repeatedly testified that he did not believe that Garnett was a threat, that he had \u201cchecked her off,\u201d and that \u201cshe was the least of [his] worries, as far as all three people in that vehicle were concerned\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-12\">[A]s I was getting out of the car with the shotgun, she was still eating chips out of the bag of Fritos, and even as I was yelling, \u201cStop! Freeze!\u201d she was still fairly casually doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>this. But as I started to turn towards her, and I started to bring the gun to bear on\u2014As I was bringing it up into a firing position, or shooting position, she stopped and that\u2019s where I checked her off in my mind. You know, I was thinking to myself, \u201cOkay. She has complied. Now you can concentrate on Mr. Budd.\u201d And as I started to bring the gun to bear over that way, that\u2019s where it went off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">When asked about the placement of his finger when he aimed the shotgun, Albrecht responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0X\">[QUESTION]: You\u2019ve testified that you were trained when you aimed the gun you had your finger on the trigger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYT\">[ALBRECHT]: Once you acquired a target. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac3\">[QUESTION]: All right. And you had acquired a target?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3x\">[ALBRECHT]: At which point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">[QUESTION]: At the time that you pulled out the shotgun. You intended to aim it, didn\u2019t you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">[ALBRECHT]: At that vehicle. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">[QUESTION]: And so your finger was on the trigger, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">[ALBRECHT]: Not\u2014No. I didn\u2019t put my finger on the trigger while I was holding it here, bringing it around. No. I mean, what you\u2019re trained to do is when you have the gun pointed, you have it locked in, and you know what you\u2019re aiming at and you know what you\u2019re going to be shooting, then to place your finger on the trigger. But I didn\u2019t have that finger on the trigger, to the best of my recollection as I was bringing it up and around. I think I was in the act of putting it from the trigger guard onto the trigger as I was bringing it to bear on Mr. Budd, and I think that was a factor in why it went off as it was coming around.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Albrecht further testified, however, that he was \u201cstartled\u201d into pulling the trigger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">[QUESTION]: And she [Garnett] turned, and that just very well may have caused you to pull the trigger? Isn\u2019t that a fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>[ALBRECHT]: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fact. I mean, you\u2019re just applying it very specifically. I could have been\u2014I don\u2019t know what set that shotgun off. I don\u2019t remember looking at her when the gun went off. I didn\u2019t have a foc\u00fas on her when the gun went off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">[QUESTION]: But that is a possibility, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">[ALBRECHT]: It\u2019s a possibility, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">[QUESTION]: That you intentionally pulled the trigger in response to a sudden movement by her, over-reacting to your perceived threat from her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">[ALBRECHT]: Well, now, see, now you\u2019re saying something totally different. You\u2019re saying it was intentional and it was something that I perceived, or something else. And that\u2019s not what happened. I think the possibility is there that there was some type of startle reaction. Whether it was her or Mr. Budd that caused those muscles to contract, or it might have been the weight of the gun coming down pulling against the finger. But as far as it being an intentional act, or a possibility of an intentional act? I think you\u2019ve gone way too far, there, and I can\u2019t agree with that. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Albrecht\u2019s statement that he was \u201cstartled\u201d into pulling the trigger reveals that his finger must have been placed on the shotgun\u2019s trigger, as it would have been impossible for Albrecht to pull the trigger if his finger had been placed inside the shotgun\u2019s trigger guard or, for that matter, on any other part of the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Having set forth, in some detail, the documentary and testimonial evidence which supported the State\u2019s case against Albrecht, we must now address the specific question we face: was this evidence legally sufficient to show, or to support a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a rational trier of fact of Albrecht\u2019s guilt of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment beyond a reasonable doubt? We answer that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In Maryland, involuntary manslaughter is a common law felony, generally defined as an unintentional killing done without malice, (1) by doing some unlawful act endangering life but which does not amount to a felony, or (2) in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, or (3) by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty. <em>Cox v. State, </em>311 Md. 326, 331-32, 534 A.2d 1338, 1335-36 (1988); <em>see also State v. Gibson, </em>4 Md.App. 236, 242, 242 A.2d 575, 578-79 (1968). It has long been stated that where the charge of involuntary manslaughter is predicated upon the allegation that the defendant committed a lawful act in a negligent manner, a conviction of manslaughter will not lie on a showing of simple negligence or misadventure or carelessness but must rather be predicated upon that degree of aggravated negligence which is termed \u201cgross\u201d negligence. <em>See Duley v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 275, 289, 467 A.2d 776, 796 (1983); <em>Mills v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 196, 200, 282 A.2d 147, 149 (1971), cert. <em>denied, </em>264 Md. 750 (1972); <em>Rolfes v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 204, 207, 268 A.2d 795, 796 (1970). As Chief Judge Murphy, then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, explained for the Court in <em>Mills v. State,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">It is well settled in this State that where a charge of involuntary manslaughter is predicated on negligently doing some act lawful in itself, the negligence necessary to support a conviction must be gross or criminal, <em>viz., </em>such as manifests a wanton or reckless disregard of human life. A causal connection between such gross negligence and death must exist to support a conviction, although it is not essential that the ultimate harm which resulted was foreseen or intended. On the other hand whether an accused\u2019s conduct constituted gross negligence must be determined by the conduct itself and not by the resultant harm. Nor can criminal liability be predicated on every careless act merely because its carelessness results in injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">13 Md.App. at 200, 282 A.2d at 149 (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Gibson, 4 </em>Md.App. at 242, 242 A.2d at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In determining whether a defendant\u2019s actions constituted gross negligence, we must ask whether the accused\u2019s conduct, \u201cunder the circumstances, amounted to a disregard of the consequences which might ensue and indifference to the rights of others, and so was a wanton and reckless disregard for human life.\u201d <em>Duren v. State, </em>203 Md. 584, 590, 102 A.2d 277, 280 (1954); <em>see also Johnson v. State, </em>213 Md. 527, 531, 132 A.2d 853, 855 (1957); <em>Allison v. State, </em>203 Md. at 5, 98 A.2d at 855; <em>Hughes v. State, </em>198 Md. 424, 432, 84 A.2d 419, 422 (1951). Stated otherwise, the accused must have committed \u201cacts so heedless and incautious as necessarily to be deemed unlawful and wanton,\u201d <em>Insurance Co. v. Prostic, </em>169 Md. 535, 539, 182 A. 421, 423 (1936) (citation omitted), manifesting such a gross departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinarily careful and prudent person under the same circumstances so as to furnish evidence of an indifference to consequences. <em>See Duren v. State, </em>203 Md. at 590, 102 A.2d at 280; <em>State of Maryland v. Chapman, </em>101 F.Supp. 335, 341 (1951). It is only conduct which rises to this degree of gross negligence upon which a conviction of involuntary manslaughter can be predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"> Although a conviction for involuntary manslaughter necessarily requires that an injury\u2014indeed, the ultimate injury, death\u2014was inflicted upon a third party, the crime of reckless endangerment does not require that the defendant actually cause harm to another individual. Maryland\u2019s reckless endangerment statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 120(a), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Any person who recklessly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person is guilty of the misdemeanor of reckless endangerment and on conviction is subject to a f\u00edne not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">As we explained in <em>Minor v. State, </em>326 Md. 436, 605 A.2d 138, 141 (1992), Maryland\u2019s reckless endangerment statute is aimed at deterring the commission of potentially harmful conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>before an injury or death occurs. As a consequence, a defendant may be guilty of reckless endangerment even where he has caused no injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">It is readily evident from the plain language of \u00a7 120(a) that it was enacted to punish, as criminal, reckless conduct which created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person. It is the reckless conduct and not the harm caused by the conduct, if any, which the statute was intended to criminalize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\"><em>Id,., </em>605 A.2d at 141. In <em>Minor, </em>we explained that in determining whether a defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">The test is whether the appellant\u2019s misconduct, viewed objectively, was so reckless as to constitute a gross departure from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe, and thereby create the substantial risk that the statute was designed to punish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 443, 605 A.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In determining whether an accused\u2019s actions were grossly negligent or criminally reckless, the standard against which a defendant\u2019s conduct must be assessed is typically the conduct of an ordinarily prudent citizen similarly situated. As the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted in its opinion, however, where the accused is a police officer, the reasonableness of the conduct must be evaluated not from the perspective of a reasonable civilian but rather from the perspective of a reasonable police officer similarly situated. <em>Albrecht, </em>97 Md.App. at 642, 632 A.2d at 169. As the intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">Under almost all circumstances, the gratuitous pointing of a deadly weapon at one civilian by another civilian would almost certainly be negligence <em>per se, </em>if not gross negligence <em>per se. </em>A police officer, on the other hand, is authorized and, indeed, frequently obligated to threaten deadly force on a regular basis. The standard of conduct demanded of a police officer on duty, therefore, is the standard of a reasonable police officer similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Id., </em>632 A.2d at 169; <em>see also Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443, 455 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence presented on the charges of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment, we emphasize that we are not sitting as the trier of fact and, therefore, we are not to ask ourselves whether <em>we </em>would convict based upon the evidence presented. Again, lest we have not been clear, we repeat that we are asked only to determine whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found Albrecht guilty of the crimes charged based upon the evidence presented at trial. For the reasons discussed herein, we find that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial from which the trial court could have concluded that Albrecht did not act as a reasonable police officer under the circumstances but rather acted in a grossly negligent and reckless manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Albrecht\u2019s position is that he acted reasonably. He contends that there was no evidence presented at trial from which the trial court could have concluded that his conduct on the afternoon of May 23, 1991, constituted a violation of a policy, practice, or directive of the Montgomery County Police Department. In the absence of such a finding, Albrecht argues, no rational trier of fact could have found that his conduct constituted gross negligence or a gross departure from what would have been the conduct of a reasonable police officer under the same circumstances. We disagree. In support of his argument, he presents and construes the evidence in the light most favorable \u25a0 to him, overlooking or ignoring the evidence presented which supports the verdict. This is not, as Albrecht suggests, a case in which a police officer has been held criminally liable for conduct that was without a doubt in compliance with standard police guidelines, procedures or practices. Rather, we find the record replete with evidence from which the trial court could have concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that Albrecht did not comply with Montgomery County departmental guidelines, procedures or practices.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">As discussed above, the Montgomery County police department\u2019s Field Operations Manual specifically provides that an officer may draw a firearm when the officer has \u201creason to fear for his safety or the safety of others,\u201d but that \u201cofficers must use caution when discharging a firearm to avoid endangering the lives of bystanders.\u201d With respect to the use of a shotgun, \u201cofficers must exercise <em>extreme caution </em>when removing the shotgun from the vehicle\u201d because of the danger that a discharge of the weapon may present to innocent bystanders. DD 83-15 at 3 (emphasis added). According to both DD 83-15 and the testimonial evidence presented, an officer may use deadly force only when the officer <em>reasonably </em>believes deadly force is necessary to avoid \u201cdeath or serious bodily injury\u201d from being caused to himself, another officer, or third parties. Although the trial court found that Albrecht\u2019s use of deadly force against Rebecca Garnett was not intentional, there was ample evidence from which the trial court could have concluded that Albrecht did not comply with standard police procedures when he took <em>substantial steps to use </em>deadly force under the circumstances. Thus, the trial court could have concluded that Albrecht not only failed to exercise \u201cextreme caution,\u201d but that he acted in a grossly negligent and reckless manner, thus failing to exercise even the most ordinary caution required by the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Montgomery County\u2019s departmental directives afford police officers much discretion with respect to an individual officer\u2019s decision to use a firearm. In the exercise of such authorized discretion, a police officer must act in a reasonable manner. Gross negligence in the exercise of discretion is grounds for criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>According to Albrecht\u2019s own testimony, he did not believe that Rebecca Garnett posed any danger to him or to any other person, she was \u201cthe least of [his]. worries,\u201d and he had \u201cchecked her off.\u201d Indeed, his position at trial was that he did not aim his shotgun at Rebecca Garnett. Officer Thomas testified that Rebecca Garnett had \u201cdone nothing\u201d to warrant having a shotgun racked and aimed at her. According to Muehlenhort\u2019s testimony, police officers should not rack and aim their shotguns unless they intend to fire them. According to the testimony of McNally, an officer should not place his finger on the shotgun\u2019s trigger until he is ready to fire the weapon. Officer McNally testified that police candidates are taught to keep their fingers on the trigger <em>guard </em>and away from the shotgun\u2019s trigger. Griffin testified that the decision to aim the shotgun should be predicated upon a reasonable perception that the person at whom it is being aimed poses a threat, and that, if aimed, the officer\u2019s finger is permitted to be within the shotgun\u2019s trigger guard. Officer Barrow also testified that Albrecht\u2019s finger should have been on his shotgun\u2019s trigger guard. The trial court could have found that Albrecht racked his shotgun, aimed it at Garnett, and placed his finger on the shotgun\u2019s trigger, notwithstanding the fact that he had no reason to believe that it would be necessary to shoot her. Additionally, according to the testimony of several trial witnesses, a number of adults and children were present on the playground area and in Albrecht\u2019s shooting background as he aimed his shotgun at Rebecca Garnett. From the documentary evidence at trial, contrary to Albrecht\u2019s assertion, the trial court could find that these individuals were not distant bystanders, but rather that they were in the playground area and on the sidewalk directly behind the Chevrolet, literally within feet of Rebecca Garnett. Certainly, as the trier of fact, Judge Messitte was entitled to accept and rely upon all of the above testimony in rendering his verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Chief Judge Murphy, in his dissent, suggests that \u201c[w]e must freeze in time the split second before the gun went off and inquire as to whether, at that instant, Officer Albrecht could have been found guilty of gross criminal negligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>reckless endangerment or not.\u201d The dissent goes on to state that \u201cit is not the discharge of the shotgun or the death of Rebecca ... that is being assessed; the focus is exclusively on the antecedent action of unlimbering, \u2018racking,\u2019 and aiming the shotgun.\u201d The dissent relies on the conclusion of the intermediate appellate court that \u201cthere is no evidence that Albrecht\u2019s conduct was even unjustified, let alone conduct evidencing a reckless and wanton disregard of human life.\u201d This conclusion ignores the testimony at trial that we have previously recounted, and particularly that on the day in question, considering the facts and circumstances facing Albrecht, he should not have had his finger on the trigger, but rather it should have been on the trigger guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In sum, we find that there was sufficient evidence presented to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that although \u201c[tjhere will be many occasions where displaying, chambering, pointing, and even firing of a shotgun will be the appropriate response ... May 23rd, 1991, on Larchmont Terrace in Gaithersburg ... was not one of them.\u201d The State adduced sufficient testimony from which the trial court could have concluded that a reasonable Montgomery County police officer would not have acted as Albrecht did on this occasion, in drawing and racking a shotgun fitted with a bandolier and bringing it to bear, <em>with his finger on the trigger, </em>on an unarmed individual who did not present a threat to the officer or to any third parties, in a situation where nearby bystanders were exposed to danger. In the final analysis, we cannot say that the trial court was clearly erroneous in determining that Albrecht\u2019s conduct, under the circumstances, manifested a wanton and reckless disregard for the safety of Rebecca Garnett and for the safety of those persons in the immediate vicinity. We therefore cannot, as a matter of law, find that trial judge erred in concluding that Albrecht\u2019s actions, in their totality, were both reckless and grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing Albrecht\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO CONSIDER ISSUES RAISED BUT NOT DECIDED.

At trial, it was explained that a Remington Wingmaster 870 is a \"pump-action\u201d shotgun. With pump-action shotguns, the user must manually load a live round of ammunition into the chamber area of the barrel.

The third count of the indictment charged Albrecht with recklessly endangering the lives of seven individuals: Officer Marvin Thomas, Darnel Budd, James Littlejohn, Iris Frazier, Carroll Walker, Travell Dumar, and Tequila Frazier. Carroll Walker and Iris Frazier, both adults, were standing on the sidewalk which abutted the playground area when the shooting occurred. Travell Dumar, age 4, was playing in the playground prior to the shooting. After the shotgun discharged, Travell Dumar ran into the street, directly into the firing zone.

Because we find that the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find that Albrecht did <em>not </em>act in accordance with police guidelines, policy, or practices, we need not, and do not, address Albrecht\u2019s contention that if an officer follows police directives, he is, as a matter of law, acting as a reasonable person.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b582-4\">CHASANOW, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAh\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">I concur with the result and join in the majority opinion. My reason for writing separately is merely to extend the majority analysis by literally a fraction of an inch. I also agree with Judge Murphy and the Court of Special Appeals up to a point. If we could freeze frame and keep \u201cexclusive focus not on the discharge of the shotgun and its deadly consequence but only on the act of loading and aiming that shotgun ...,\u201d 97 Md.App. 630, 644, 632 A.2d 163, 170 (1993), then as a matter of law, Officer Albrecht should not be guilty of manslaughter or reckless endangerment. But we should not freeze frame and stop our analysis before the trigger was pulled. We cannot assess Albrecht\u2019s culpability in taking Rebecca Garnett\u2019s life and, in doing so, exclude the ultimate act that took her life\u2014pulling the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The trial judge found that the act of pulling the trigger was unintentional; he did not find that it was reasonable. The intermediate appellate court assumes the unintentional shooting is a non-negligent shooting. Albrecht did not intentionally pull the trigger, but the trial judge was justified in finding he negligently, carelessly or even recklessly pulled the trigger. There was no external cause for the shotgun discharge, and the fact that Albrecht may have been \u201cstartled into pulling the trigger\u201d of a loaded, racked, and aimed shotgun need not, as a matter of law, excuse his carelessness in doing so. The pulling of the trigger could be found to be a careless act that, when considered along with all the antecedent acts, at least tips the scale to permit a finding of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Police officers do not have to act like heroes in old silent film westerns and always let the bad guys draw first. They are entitled to draw their weapons and be ready to use them when confronted with a tense, dangerous situation. But when a police officer intentionally places himself or herself a mere trigger pull away from taking the life of an innocent person, if the officer then carelessly pulls that trigger and kills an innocent person, a finding of manslaughter or reckless endangerment is not erroneous as a matter of law. \u201cAccidently\u201d pulling a trigger of a loaded, aimed shotgun can constitute involuntary manslaughter just as \u201caccidently\u201d swerving a truck into a group of school children standing by the side of the road at a bus stop can constitute involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b583-4\">MURPHY, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7o\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Taking into account all of the evidence before the trial judge most favorable to the State\u2019s case, I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the trial judge\u2019s factual findings did not, in light of the governing law, permit a guilty verdict of the offenses charged by the indictments. Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Moylan, with the concurrence of Judges Fischer and Motz, carefully analyzed the 1750 page transcript of trial testimony. The court identified the issue as whether Officer Albrecht\u2019s conduct in unlimbering the shotgun, in \u201cracking\u201d a shell into the chamber, and in pointing it at Rebecca Garnett in the first instance was in itself a criminal act. If it was, the court said that it would be equally blameworthy and reprehensible whether the gun went off and Rebecca was killed or not. The court then said if, on the other hand, the acts of unlimbering and pointing the weapon were not in and of themselves criminal, the unintended death of the victim will not make them so. <em>Albrecht v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 630, 643-644, 632 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In his opinion for the court, Judge Moylan deemed it essential to keep \u201cexclusive focus not on the discharge of the shotgun and its deadly consequence but only on the act of loading and aiming that shotgun in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>644, 632 A.2d 163. In this regard, the court said: \u201cWe must freeze in time the split second before the gun went off and inquire as to whether, at that instant, Officer Albrecht could have been found guilty of gross criminal negligence and reckless \u00e9ndangerment or not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The case law is well settled in Maryland that where a charge of involuntary manslaughter is predicated on negligently doing some act lawful in itself, the negligence necessary to support a conviction must be gross or criminal, namely such as manifests a wanton or reckless disregard of human life. The gross criminal negligence must add up to an extreme degree of indifference to the human consequence of one\u2019s actions that can only be described as wanton. \u201cAs with grossly negligent manslaughter, it is the allegedly reckless conduct itself that is in issue and not the harm that flows from it; ... it is not the discharge of the shotgun or the death of Rebecca ... that is being assessed; the focus is exclusively on the antecedent action of unlimbering, \u2018racking,\u2019 and aiming the shotgun.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647-648, 632 A.2d 163. .</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The intermediate appellate court points out quite accurately that the State seeks to establish such a gross departure from the standard of care exercised by a reasonable person by asserting that the very act of pointing a loaded weapon at another constitutes such a gross departure <em>per se </em>and establishes thereby the necessary recklessness. Cases relied upon by the State for this proposition are not, however, apposite since each presents a situation where a civilian without any occupational mandate pointed a loaded weapon at another civilian; the cases do not involve a police officer as a defendant\u2014an individual empowered to carry a weapon and, under many circumstances, to point and even use it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">The court next said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201c... [W]e see no evidence in this case from which a fact finder could have been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that there was on the part of the appellant such gross criminal negligence so as to demonstrate a wanton disregard for human life. Nor do we see any gross deviation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>gross departure from the standard of conduct that a reasonable police officer would employ in similar circumstances. Rebecca Garnett suffered a tragic death. The appellant was unquestionably the homicidal agent. For purposes of our review, however, it is a given that the discharge of the gun was accidental. The only issue before us is whether the pointing of the gun at Rebecca Garnett was, in and of itself, a criminal act. Given the demanding definition of gross criminal negligence, we see no evidence that could rationally satisfy that requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">\u201cUtilizing the standard of the reasonable police officer, we assess the circumstances from the point of view of a police officer who is looking for one or more culprits in a stabbing, who has been told that the two or three young men involved are drug pushers, who has been told that the subjects may be armed, who has just engaged in a high-speed chase, and who has just located the suspect car with three apparent occupants. The officer is trained to use his own police cruiser as a shield when he confronts a potentially dangerous situation and to make sure the target area is neutralized before proceeding to a calmer inspection. With respect to any reasonable officer in such a circumstance, we have to conclude that his adrenaline would be pumping, his heart would be pounding, and he would be fearful for his own life. When he orders suspects to \u2018freeze,\u2019 he is intensely sensitive to compliance with that order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cOfficer Thomas was watching Darnell Budd even as the appellant was watching Rebecca Garnett. Officer Thomas\u2019s description of his intense concentration on any hand movement or twitching by Darnell Budd illustrates the emotion that inevitable permeates such a confrontation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u2018He was facing in our direction. And it was like\u2014It\u2019s hard to\u2014When you\u2019re holding a gun on somebody and they\u2019re doing\u2014they\u2019re just not standing still, Your Hon- or\u2014its hard to explain, you can\u2019t say what they\u2019re doing with their hands, but their hands, they\u2019re not in their pockets, but they\u2019re not staying within clear sight. They\u2019re not to the point where he\u2019s standing there like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>this, so that you can see that he\u2019s not doing anything with them. But he\u2019s just like standing around doing this. And that\u2019s the scary part because very quickly we had scenarios in the Academy where one of the instructors stood there, turned around like this, came out with a gun and fired so quickly that I didn\u2019t even have a chance to put my hand on my gun to take it out. And that\u2019s where you realize that so quick someone can come out with a weapon if you don\u2019t get them under control or get them to stop moving so that you can watch what they\u2019re doing. You can be killed, or you can be shot. And that\u2019s the part where I mean it was real scary because he wouldn\u2019t stop moving.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\u201cThat was the reaction of a reasonable officer who, presumably, acted appropriately throughout the entire encounter: You can be killed or you can be shot ... [I]t was real scary because he wouldn\u2019t stop moving.\u2019 Police officers are thrown into combat-like situations where incredible coolness is called for. It is one thing to say that occasionally a nervous instinct falls short of the ideal. It is quite another thing to say that such a lapse is criminal, calling for imprisonment in a penitentiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650-652, 632 A.2d 163.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">The court further explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cBut for the fact that the gun went off (and that was found to have been an unintended accident), there was nothing unusual in the conduct of Officer Albrecht in making this felony stop involving a vehicle and multiple suspects. There is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest any deviation or departure, let alone a gross deviation or gross departure, from the standard of conduct regularly employed by the Montgomery County Police Department in making felony stops involving vehicles and/or multiple suspects. In terms of involuntary manslaughter of the gross criminal negligence variety, there is no evidence that Officer Albrecht\u2019s conduct was even unjustified, let alone conduct evidencing a reckless and wanton- disregard of human life. There was no evidence to suggest that it was that which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Judge Orth stated, in <em>State v. Kramer, </em>318 Md. 576, 590, 569 A.2d 674 (1990), could be characterized as \u2018conduct that is of extraordinary or outrageous character.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201cOfficer Albrecht fully articulated what it was that caused him to unlimber, \u2018rack,\u2019 [sic] and aim his shotgun. Virtually every officer who testified stated that he or she would have done the same thing in the same situation. Officer Albrecht was in the course of making a felony stop. The standard of conduct indisputably established by the evidence was that in the course of a felony stop it is reasonable to \u2018rack\u2019 and aim a shotgun if either of two additional conditions are present. One of those conditions is that a vehicle is involved in the felony stop. The other condition is that the felony stop involves two or more suspects. In this case, both conditions were satisfied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201cDarnell Budd, Rebecca Garnett, and James Littlejohn were all suspects. It was Rebecca Garnett who had driven two or three males away from the stabbing scene. In view of the tight time sequence, there was every reason for an arresting officer to believe that both Darnell Budd and James Littlejohn were two of the males driven from the stabbing scene. As Officer Albrecht approached Larchmont Terrace, both Darnell Budd and Rebecca Garnett were observed by him to be returning rapidly to the green Chevrolet automobile as they observed his approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672-673, 632 A.2d 163.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The Court of Special Appeals properly noted that gross criminal negligence in Rebecca\u2019s death cannot be predicated on a coincidental endangerment of bystanders which it said was the mere consequence of Albrecht\u2019s conduct, <em>vis-a-vis </em>the suspects and not <em>vice versa. </em>It said that the possible endangerment of bystanders was the effect of the confrontation of the suspects and not a contributing cause. <em>Id. </em>at 677, 632 A.2d 163. As to this, the court emphasized that the involuntary manslaughter charge must be premised on the reckless and wanton disregard of Rebecca\u2019s life directly and not to any consequential indifference exhibited toward bystanders. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Dwelling further on the evidentiary circumstances underlying this tragic episode, Judge Moylan writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cThe trial judge can hardly have been suggesting that, after Darnell Budd was observed leaving the scene wherein he had stabbed Timothy Fair, it was inappropriate for Officer Albrecht and Officer Thomas to pursue the green Chevrolet and to arrest Budd. Budd had left in a car with several other individuals. The officers had been told, at the stabbing scene, that Budd and several of the males who had been with him were drug dealers. They had been told, moreover, that one or more of the fleeing group might have a gun. When the car was discovered shortly thereafter by Officer Albrecht and the suspects, who had just been in that car, were numbered at three, it cannot be suggested that this was not one of those \u2018felony stops,\u2019 involving either a vehicle <em>or </em>multiple suspects, described by the Montgomery County Police Department as one where officers should approach with guns drawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cAlthough the trial judge demeaned the significance of the earlier stabbing as he used the phrase \u2018given the relative lack of severity of the crime\u2019 and demeaned the potential danger posed by Darnell Budd as \u2018a felon, not the most fearsome type,\u2019 a stabbing of a victim in the back with a glass bottle is no less serious than a stabbing with a knife. The pictures introduced at trial showed the gaping wound that had been inflicted on the back of Timothy Fair. The wound had been observed by Officer Albrecht and Officer Thomas. In the photograph, it is three to four inches in length and is gaping open to the width of an inch or more. It was no mere incident of some \u2018school boy scuffle.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe trial judge also, spoke of \u2018the lack of threats posed by the suspects.\u2019 When Officer Albrecht and Officer Thomas took off in pursuit of those suspects, they had been told that the two or three males in the group were drug dealers and that the group might be carrying guns. Neither Budd nor others with him could, except through hindsight, be lightly dismissed as \u2018not the most fearsome type.\u2019 In approaching a felony stop rife with that potential, that fear is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>not dissipated until the scene is neutralized and the hands of all suspects have been observed. The arresting officers \u2018get the drop on\u2019 the suspects first and only lower their weapons after they are reassured that the suspects pose no danger. When Officer Albrecht saw no weapons in the hands of Rebecca Garnett, he \u2018checked her off in his mind and was about to direct his attention to Darnell Budd and James Littlejohn when his shotgun accidentally discharged. The larger danger had not yet dissipated. Both Officer Albrecht and Officer Thomas were concerned about the hands of Darnell Budd. Officer Albrecht described Budd as \u2018manipulating\u2019 his shirt and preventing Officer Albrecht from getting an unimpeded view of Budd\u2019s hands. Viewing events, as we must, from the perspective of the officers on the scene, Darnell Budd cannot, as of the moment of the encounter, be lightly dismissed as \u2018not the most fearsome type.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cWhat is nowhere mentioned in the fact finding of the court is that James Littlejohn posed the most serious danger of all three suspects. The trial judge had earlier admonished that \u2018in evaluating the reasonableness\u2019 of Officer Albrecht\u2019s conduct, \u2018his actions must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u2019 \u2018With 20/20 vision of hindsight,\u2019 we now know that Littlejohn was an unarmed blind man and posed no danger at all. The officers, however, did not know that as they approached the scene. Officer Thomas knew Littlejohn by sight but acknowledged that, as he approached the scene, he did not know who that third figure in the back seat of the green Chevrolet was. Littlejohn, as that third figure, was shielded behind the front seat. His hands were completely out of the view of both officers. \u2018From the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,\u2019 Littlejohn was most definitely a suspect and posed a clear threat to the officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678-680, <em>632 </em>A.2d 163.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">As to the State\u2019s reliance upon Albrecht\u2019s customizing his shotgun to prove gross criminal negligence, the intermediate appellate court held that evidence of this fact, i.e., the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the bandolier or sling, was not a legally sufficient predicate upon which to find gross criminal negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 632 A.2d 163. Explaining, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cThere was no evidence to the effect that Officer Albrecht\u2019s fitting of a bandolier on his shotgun was either \u2018highly questionable\u2019 or \u2018potentially dangerous.\u2019 The bandolier carried fifteen rounds of ammunition. When fully loaded, the bandolier and the ammunition weighed a total of 2.39 pounds. Two experts testified with respect to the possible physical repercussions of the added weight on the firing of the weapon. Neither of the experts had any knowledge as to the policy of the Montgomery County Police Department with respect to such a bandolier.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Although somewhat repetitious, the concluding portion of Judge Moylan\u2019s opinion for the Court of Special Appeals bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201c... If we pay more than lip service to the principle of law that Officer Albrecht should not be judged on the basis of the harm that resulted from his conduct but only on the basis of the antecedent conduct itself, he exhibited no reckless and wanton disregard of human life. He was involved, indisputably, in a felony stop of a vehicle involving multiple suspects. A stabbing had occurred and at least one of the stabbers, if not more, was believed to have left the scene in the car driven by Rebecca Garnett. There were indications that the group leaving in that car were drug pushers who might well be armed. However innocent Rebecca Garnett may have turned out to be in hindsight, she was definitely a suspect when Officer Albrecht first approached her. According to standard procedure, you do not aim a shotgun at a suspect only after you perceive that the suspect <em>is </em>armed. That may be too late. It is rather the case that you aim a shotgun at a suspect immediately and keep it aimed until you are satisfied that the suspect <em>is not </em>armed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">\u201cIf aiming a shotgun at a suspect in the course of a felony stop of multiple suspects is a reckless or wanton disregard of human life or a gross deviation from standard police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>procedure, then that is what the Montgomery County Training Academy teaches. We do not believe that to be the case. If pointing a shotgun at a suspect under those circumstances is a reckless and wanton disregard of human life, then that is what Officer Albrecht\u2019s fellow officer, Officer Thomas, also was in the process of exhibiting on the day of this confrontation and that is what three of Officer Albrecht\u2019s fellow officers and classmates\u2014Donna Howard, Joyce Barrow, and Harold Burch\u2014exhibited on no less than thirty other occasions. We do not believe that to be the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201cSave only for the accidental discharge of the weapon, Officer Albrecht\u2019s conduct was no different from that, actual or hypothesized, of any of the other officers, with the single exception of Sergeant Muehlenhort. Neither did it deviate, let alone grossly deviate, from what he had been taught to do at the Police Training Academy. The norm, in terms of police response to a felony stop involving a vehicle and/or multiple suspects, is not what judges might wish it to be but what the evidence shows it to be. In terms of the evidence in this case, Officer Albrecht\u2019s conduct in aiming his weapon was the norm and not a departure, let alone a gross departure, therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201cWe hold that, given the factual finding that Officer Albrecht did not fire the shotgun intentionally, the remaining evidence was not legally sufficient to support a finding of gross criminal negligence, to wit, evidence that he was acting without justification and in such a way as to exhibit a reckless and wanton disregard for human life. Neither was the remaining evidence, once any fact finding that the gun had been fired intentionally was rejected, legally sufficient to support a verdict that Officer Albrecht was guilty of misconduct so reckless as to constitute a gross departure from the standard of conduct that a reasonable police officer would observe. We hold, therefore, that the verdicts of guilty of involuntary manslaughter and of reckless endangerment, necessarily predicated on such states of mind, were clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-688, 632 A.2d 163.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Being in full accord with the opinion of the intermediate appellate court, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
