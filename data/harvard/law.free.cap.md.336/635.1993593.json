A jury awarded the punitive damages under a count alleging tortious interference with a contractual arrangement concerning insurance commissions. The jury determined that the plaintiff, B. Dixon Evander &amp; Associates, Inc., was entitled to $4,000,000.00 in punitive damages from Alexander &amp; Alexander and $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages from Mary Scheeler. The issue before us is whether there was any basis for the awards of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">B. Dixon Evander is the founder, owner and principal officer of B. Dixon Evander &amp; Associates, Inc., an insurance brokerage corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The corporation specializes in procuring medical malpractice liability insurance for health care providers. In 1962, Evander was invited to submit a proposal for medical malpractice insurance for the University of Maryland Hospital and its staff. Evander obtained from the hospital the right to procure such insurance, and, between 1962 and 1985, Evander developed and managed a professional liability program for the hospital and its medical staff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Initially, Evander had secured insurance for the hospital from St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company. In 1975, St. Paul decided to withdraw from the state\u2019s medical malpractice market, and Evander procured policies for the hospital from the Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Insurance Company (\u201cMutual Fire\u201d). Evander negotiated the Mutual Fire policies through Mutual Fire\u2019s general underwriting manager and agent, Shand, Morahan &amp; Company, Inc. (\u201cShand\u201d). Shand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alexander <em>&amp; </em>Alexander, an insurance brokerage firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The Mutual Fire policies were \u201cclaims made\u201d policies. Thus, a claim would be covered only if it were made within the policy period. Because of some unusual features of medical malpractice claims, such as the relative frequency of latent injury, the termination of a claims made policy left the insured exposed for many years to liability for events that had occurred within the policy period. This potential exposure concerned the hospital, as the hospital\u2019s financial planning was undermined by uncertainty about the number and extent of the malpractice claims which it might receive. Because of this concern, the initial Mutual Fire policies contained an Optional Extension Provision (\u201cOEP\u201d) allowing the claims reporting period to be extended beyond the policy period in return for the payment of an additional premium. As rewritten in 1981, the OEP authorized the hospital to extend the claims reporting period indefinitely by making a single payment of 155% of the premium for the policies\u2019 final year. The OEP included the requirement that the hospital exercise the option, and pay the additional premium, within 30 days after terminating the policies. The OEP was included in each annual renewal of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Evander\u2019s relationship with the hospital continued amicably until 1984. In 1984 the hospital underwent an organizational change, becoming part of a corporate entity separate from the University of Maryland. One consequence of that change was the establishment of a committee, led by Dr. Susan S. Swift, to assess and review the hospital\u2019s insurance needs. The committee sent out \u201crequests for proposals\u201d to a number of insurance brokers, including Evander and Alexander &amp; Alexander (\u201cAlexander\u201d). The requests for proposals asked detailed questions about the brokers\u2019 organizations and about their experience and ability in the field of professional liability insurance. After reviewing the proposals of the six brokers who responded, the committee, on behalf of the hospital, chose Alexander to succeed Evander as the hospital\u2019s broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>On January 30, 1985, the hospital issued a \u201cbroker of record\u201d letter, authorizing Alexander to represent its insurance interests. The letter allowed Alexander to negotiate on the hospital\u2019s behalf \u201cas respects changes in existing insurance policies and in closing, changing, increasing or cancelling insurance.... \u201d The letter specifically provided that it was \u201cintended to include all policies presently placed with Mutual Fire ... through Shand, Morahan &amp; Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Evander was disappointed by the hospital\u2019s decision. Mr. Evander wrote to Dr. Swift, telling her that \u201c[h]aving initiated, developed and shepherded the current program through the past ten (10) years we feel, to be candid, as if there has been a death in the family without knowing the cause.\u201d Mr. Evander explained that he had continually modified the hospital\u2019s insurance program over the years, negotiating with Shand and Mutual Fire for concessions for his client. Under the circumstances, he wrote, it would be unfair for the hospital to appoint another broker if it intended to renew the Mutual Fire policies, because \u201cto have [another broker] step into our shoes after establishing and developing the program, we trust you will agree is an unearned position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Bob Liston, the Shand Vice President responsible for the hospital account, agreed with Evander. By February 1, 1985, Liston had learned that Alexander was ready to send Shand a broker of record letter from the hospital. On that date he wrote a memorandum to Joe Prochaska, Shand\u2019s Chairman, explaining that he had told Evander once, and Dr. Swift twice, that Shand would not accept a broker of record letter on the Mutual Fire policies from anyone except Evander. In support of his position, Mr. Liston noted Mr. Evander\u2019s many achievements for Shand: business worth over $39,000,000 which he had produced for Shand from Maryland, his careful attention to insurance legislation in Maryland, and his support of Shand through the implementation of sharp rate increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">For its part, the hospital was concerned that it might lose its access to Mutual Fire. The hospital committee was reluctant to forego any options in the precarious liability insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>market, and Dr. Swift told Alexander that Alexander\u2019s continued representation of the hospital depended on an agreement from Shand that the hospital, through Alexander, could renew the existing Mutual Fire policies if the hospital chose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Joe Prochaska and Mac Calhoun, the Chairman and President of Shand, were asked to attend a meeting of top Alexander executives in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February 1985. Prochaska and Calhoun met with the President of Alexander, Michael White. As a consequence of the meeting, White called Dr. Swift to tell her that Shand had no option but to accept the broker\u2019s letter from Alexander, and Shand did accept the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">At some time in early 1985, the hospital and Alexander entered into a brokerage contract. Alexander was appointed broker for the hospital for one year,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> beginning July 1, 1985.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Alexander was to provide a full range of brokerage services, and the hospital was to pay a flat annual fee of $250,000, payable in monthly installments. The parties expressly noted the consequences of the flat fee arrangement, stating in their agreement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u201c[t]he fees are intended to replace the commissions associated with procuring insurance. Therefore, all insurance quotations should be obtained net of commission fees. If this is not possible a credit will be granted in an amount equal to the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">This provision obliged Alexander to give the hospital credit for any insurance payment by the hospital that represented commission, since Alexander would already have been paid an agreed price for its services.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">After Alexander\u2019s appointment as broker, and before the July 1, 1985, date for termination of Evander\u2019s services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Evander continued to service the hospital account and to receive its commission on premiums paid by the hospital. Meanwhile, Alexander and the hospital were reviewing the range of available insurance options. Ultimately the hospital chose a system of self-insurance rather than renewal of the Mutual Fire policies. This decision was predicated on the exercise of the OEP option.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On May 6, 1985, Alexander told Shand that the hospital would not renew the Mutual Fire policies when they expired at the end of June. Alexander also told Shand that the hospital intended to exercise the OEP option. Shand passed the news on to Evander. On May 8, 1985, Evander sent a letter to the hospital, explaining how the OEP option had to be exercised and calculating the premium for the exercise of the option. Evander also claimed a commission on the premium. The alleged prior understanding between Shand and Evander was that Evander would receive a commission of 8% of premiums on policies procured by Evander. Evander calculated the amount of the OEP premium to be over $3,000,000, and asked Shand for a commission of $265,907.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Evander\u2019s request for a commission on the OEP premium threatened to wipe out Alexander\u2019s entire fee from the hospital for the year beginning July 1, 1985. If Shand\u2019s bill to the hospital were to include a sum equal to Evander\u2019s commission, as the bill undoubtedly would if Shand paid Evander, then, under the terms of the fee agreement between Alexander and the hospital, Alexander would be obliged to credit the hospital with the amount of the commission. Alexander asked Shand to bill the hospital for the exercise of the option in an amount that did not include Evander\u2019s commission. Shand refused. Alexander\u2019s position was that the hospital owed no commission to anyone, since the exercise of the option was an insurance service covered by Alexander\u2019s flat fee. Shand insisted that it owed Evander a commission on the premium. Shand, however, ultimately complied with Alexander\u2019s request, and the hospital received and paid a bill for a sum which did not include an amount equal to the commission demanded by Evander. Consequently, Evander received no commission for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the premium that the hospital paid to exercise its rights under the OEP provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Evander then brought the present action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Alexander, Shand, Mutual Fire and Mary Scheeler, an Alexander vice president and the executive responsible for the hospital account. Evander sought compensatory damages equal to the commission on the OEP and punitive damages. Evander\u2019s complaint contained fourteen counts. Only three were ultimately submitted to the jury: a breach of contract count against Shand and Mutual Fire, a count charging tortious interference with contract against Alexander and Scheeler, and a tort count based on \u201ccivil conspiracy\u201d against all four defendants. Evander sought only compensatory damages under the breach of contract count, but asked for both compensatory damages and $5,000,000.00 in punitive damages under each of the two tort counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">At trial, in connection with its claim for a commission on the OEP, Evander introduced into evidence a document, \u201cPX43,\u201d that allegedly contained the terms of a 1975 exclusive Producer\u2019s Agreement between Shand and Evander. The document, which had been sent by Shand to Evander in 1975, set out the proposed terms and conditions under which Evander was to produce medical malpractice insurance business for Shand. Evander had responded in 1975 by sending a letter to Shand explaining that PX43 did not reflect the agreement between the parties because it omitted both a ninety day notice provision for termination and an agreement that Evander\u2019s commission would remain unchanged for three years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Evander\u2019s letter stated that it would sign PX43 promptly if its requested changes were made. Shand denied that there had ever been any agreement that Evander\u2019s commission would be fixed for a three year period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, Shand offered to \u201cforward the necessary document\u201d if Evander wished to execute a contract including the ninety day notice provision, but excluding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>three year fixed commission. The record contains no evidence that Shand and Evander ultimately agreed on the terms of their relationship. Nonetheless, Evander took the position at the initial trial that the exclusive agreement described in PX43 gave it the sole right to receive a commission on the OEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Evander at the first trial also produced an expert witness in insurance matters, who testified that a party who produces an insurance policy is, according to custom and usage in the insurance industry, entitled to receive the commission on an OEP exercised when the policy is terminated. In addition, Mr. Evander testified to the course of his dealings with Shand and Mutual Fire over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In connection with evidence of \u201cmalice,\u201d a component of both the tortious interference claim and the request for punitive damages, Mr. Evander was permitted, over objection, to testify to comments allegedly made by Mary Scheeler. Mr. Evander told the jury that a vice president of Shand had told him during a telephone conversation that Scheeler \u201chates your ass\u201d and intended to drive him out of business. Similar testimony from Evander\u2019s former office manager was also admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The jury found for Evander under the breach of contract count and further found that \u201cthe precise commissions that Evander lost\u201d were $250,052.52 plus interest. The jury also found Alexander and Scheeler liable under both tort counts. The verdict sheet did not require the jury to assess separate compensatory damages on these counts; the parties had agreed that, if there was liability under the tort counts, the compensatory damages would be the same as under the contract count. The jury found that Alexander and Scheeler had tortiously interfered with a contractual relationship between Evander and Shand, and had done so with actual malice. Furthermore, the jury found that \u201cAlexander and Scheeler ... entered into a conspiracy with Shand and Mutual Fire ... to deprive Evander of commissions.... \u201d The jury found all the defendants liable for punitive damages under the tort counts, although the verdict sheet did not allocate punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>damages between the two tort counts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury assessed the amounts of punitive damages as follows: $40,000,000.00 against Alexander; $250,052.52 against Scheeler; and $70,-104.15 against Shand and Mutual Fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The trial court reduced the amount of the punitive damages awarded against Alexander to $12,500,000.00. Alexander and Scheeler appealed, challenging both the determinations of liability and the awards of punitive damages. Alexander and Scheeler argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no basis for a finding of actual malice. In this connection, they argued that evidence of Mary Scheeler\u2019s alleged statements had been improperly admitted. For reasons that do not appear in the record, Evander abandoned and released its claim for punitive damages against Shand and Mutual Fire before the case was argued in the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals upheld the award of compensatory damages under all three counts. With respect to punitive damages, however, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the awards and ordered a new trial. As the court explained, \u201c[t]his was, at bottom, a commercial dispute between two business competitors.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Evander, </em>88 Md.App. 672, 719, 596 A.2d 687, 710 (1991). Reviewing the trial court\u2019s proceedings in light of <em>Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip, </em>499 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991), a case decided after the judgment against Alexander had been rendered, the intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201c[o]n this record, we do not believe that a $12.5 million punitive award comports with due process.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Evander, supra, </em>88 Md.App. at 720, 596 A.2d at 710. The court remanded the case for a new trial, limited to \u201cthe issue of whether [the defendants\u2019] conduct justifies an award of punitive damages and, if so, in what amount.\u201d 88 Md.App. at 722, 596 A.2d at 711-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion was somewhat confusing with respect to the new trial. The court stated that the second jury should be instructed to assume as facts the specific findings listed on the first jury\u2019s verdict sheet, including the facts that Alexander and Scheeler tortiously interfered with a contract of Evander\u2019s, and that they did so with actual malice. 88 Md.App. at 722 and n. 14, 596 A.2d at 712 and n. 14. Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals also directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>that the second jury should be given a definition of actual malice and told that actual malice is a requirement for an award of punitive damages. 88 Md.App. at 722, 596 A.2d at 712. The intermediate appellate court did not address Alexander\u2019s and Scheeler\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s instructions on actual malice had been inadequate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Both sides petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. In particular, Alexander and Scheeler in their petition argued that Evander had failed to establish its tortious interference claim because \u201cat least three, and probably <em>all </em>\u201d of the elements of the tort had not been proven. Evander, on the other hand, challenged the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on counts alleging fraud, fraudulent concealment, conversion and conspiracy to commit each of those torts. In light of the remand for a new trial on punitive damages, we denied both petitions. <em>Alexander &amp; Alexander, Inc. v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assoc., </em>323 Md. 1, 590 A.2d 158 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Prior to the new trial, Alexander paid Evander the compensatory damages award, with interest, on its own behalf and on behalf of Shand and Scheeler. By the time of the second trial, Evander had dismissed its claims for punitive damages against Shand and Mutual Fire. Alexander and Scheeler were the only remaining defendants, and tortious interference with contractual relations was the only legal theory for the recovery of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The punitive damages retrial lasted over three and a half weeks. Evander presented largely the same evidence which it had at the first trial, with the addition of evidence of Alexander\u2019s net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">At the second trial, Alexander challenged Evander\u2019s characterization of PX43 as a writing that formally embodied the relationship between Evander and Shand. Alexander introduced evidence that Mr. Evander had testified at an unrelated trial that PX43 had never been executed or agreed to. Moreover, at the unrelated trial, Mr. Evander had claimed that, even if PX43 did reflect an informal agreement, it had been cancelled and terminated in October 1975. At the punitive damages retrial in this case, Alexander questioned Mr. Evander about this testimony, and Mr. Evander acknowledged that PX43 had been cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">As previously discussed, at the first trial Mr. Evander had testified, over hearsay objections, to comments allegedly made by Mary Scheeler about her attitude towards Mr. Evander and his business. At the retrial, the court excluded this evidence on the ground that it was \u201cinflammatory\u201d and inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">At the conclusion of the second trial, the trial court, over the defendants\u2019 objection, instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cYou are to assume as fact the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">One, that Shand ... and Mutual Fire ... had a contract with the plaintiff that entitled the plaintiff to a commission on the [OEP];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">Two, that Shand and Mutual Fire breached or broke that contract with the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">Three, that the defendants, Alexander &amp; Alexander, and Scheeler, tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs contract with Shand and Mutual Fire.... That this tortious interference by the defendants ... was done with actual malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The court further instructed the jury that \u201cactual malice is the performance of an act without legal justification or excuse but with evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, spite or ill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>will, the purpose being to deliberately and wilfully injure the plaintiff.\u201d The court told the jury that it could award punitive damages or not, as it saw fit, and explained that Evander had the burden of proving its entitlement to punitive damages by \u201ca preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The defendant made several objections to the court\u2019s instructions, including, <em>inter alia, </em>an objection to the instruction that Evander must prove its entitlement to punitive damages by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The second jury awarded punitive damages against Alexander in the amount of $4,000,000.00 and against Scheeler in the amount of $l,000,000.00.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendants appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and Evander cross-appealed. Prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, both sides filed petitions for a writ of certiorari which this Court granted, 331 Md. 284, 627 A.2d 1063 (1993). In this Court, the defendants argue, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence shows that no tort was ever committed,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that there was no evidence of actual malice, and that the punitive damages award should be set aside because it was not \u201crendered with meaningful standards.\u201d Evander complains about the exclusion from the second trial of evidence concerning the alleged statements attributed to Mary Scheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Punitive damages may be awarded only, <em>inter alia, </em>if there was tortious conduct accompanied by \u201cmalice.\u201d <em>Owens-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 454-460, 601 A.2d 633, 650-653 (1992). Consequently, while the award of compensatory damages in favor of Evander is not directly before us, the question of whether there was tortious conduct in this case is obviously pertinent in deciding the allowability of punitive damages. Since \u201cthe availability of a punitive damages award ought to depend upon the heinous nature of the defendant\u2019s <em>tortious </em>conduct,\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 454, 601 A.2d at 649 (emphasis added), if no tort was committed there can be no basis for a punitive damages award. Moreover, in this particular case, Evander has relied on identical alleged facts to show both the presence of the tort and the actual malice required for the allowability of punitive damages. Under Evander\u2019s theory, Alexander\u2019s interference with the contractual relationship between Evander and Shand was wrongful, and accompanied by actual malice, because of the ill-will and spite towards Evander disclosed by statements allegedly made by Mary Scheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Maryland recognizes the tort action for wrongful interference with contractual or business relationships in two general forms: \u201cinducing the breach of an existing contract and, more broadly, maliciously or wrongfully interfering with economic relationships____\u201d <em>Natural Design, Inc. v. Rouse Co., </em>302 Md. 47, 69, 485 A.2d 663, 674 (1984). We explained in the <em>Natural Design </em>opinion as follows (302 Md. at 69-70, 485 A.2d at 674):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\u201cThe principle underlying both forms of the tort is the same: under certain circumstances, a party is liable if he interferes with and damages another in his business or occupation. The two types of actions differ in the limits on the right to interfere which will be recognized in either case. Thus, where a contract between two parties exists, the circumstances in which a third party has a right to interfere with the performance of that contract are more narrowly restricted. A broader right to interfere with economic relations exists where no contract or a contract terminable at will is involved. <em>See generally Goldman v. Building </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Assn., </em>150 Md. 677, 682, 133 A. 843 (1926); <em>Sumwalt Co. v. Knickerbocker, </em>114 Md. 403, 414-415, 80 A. 48 (1911).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-6\"><em>See also Macklin v. Logan, </em>334 Md. 287, 297, 639 A.2d 112, 117 (1994); <em>K &amp; K Management v. Lee, </em>316 Md. 137, 154-155, 557 A.2d 965, 973 (1989); <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mutual, </em>306 Md. 754, 763, 511 A.2d 492, 497 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Earlier in this litigation, Evander appeared to argue that Alexander and Scheeler tortiously interfered with a specific, subsisting contract between Evander and Shand which gave Evander the exclusive right to a commission on the OEP premium. This contract was the one allegedly described in PX43. At the second trial and in the present appellate proceedings, however, Evander no longer contends that PX43 is the primary source of its right to a commission on the OEP premium. The Court of Special Appeals, after reviewing the record of the first trial, concluded that \u201cEvander\u2019s right to a commission on the OEP ... arose from an admixture of the 1975 producer\u2019s agreement with Shand and the 1975 policy procured by him from Shand/Mutual Fire, as renewed through June, 1985,\u201d and that the \u201cproducer\u2019s agreement and the Mutual Fire policy were constituent parts of an overall business arrangement between Evander, on the one hand, and Shand and Mutual Fire, on the other.\u201d 88 Md.App. at 687, 685-686, 596 A.2d at 694, 693. Evander\u2019s brief in this Court represents that Evander\u2019s \u201centitlement to a commission resulted from PX43 and Mr. Evander\u2019s understandings, his agreements and his practices with Shand over a 10-11 year period.\u201d (Evander\u2019s brief at 6). Counsel for Evander stated at oral argument before this Court that Evander\u2019s claim to the commission was not based on the alleged exclusivity agreement between itself and Shand, but on custom, usage and the overall course of dealings between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Consequently, this case does not involve an alleged wrongful interference with a specific, discrete contract between Evander and Shand but interference with an ongoing business relationship that included Evander\u2019s entitlement to a commission upon the hospital\u2019s exercise of the OEP option. This case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>thus implicates the broader form of the tort, namely malicious or wrongful interference with economic relationships.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The elements of the broader form of the tort have remained unchanged in Maryland since this Court articulated them in <em>Willner v. Silverman, </em>109 Md. 341, 355, 71 A. 962, 964 (1909) (quoting from <em>Walker v.

Moreover, for punitive damages to be recoverable under either form of the tort, the wrongful interference with contract or economic relations must be accompanied by \u201cactual malice,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>conduct by the defendant characterized by evil motive, intent to injure, ill will, or fraud. <em>See, e.g., Schaefer v. Miller, </em>322 Md. 297, 317, 587 A.2d 491, 501 (1991) (concurring opinion); <em>Rite Aid Corp. v. Lake Shore Inv., </em>298 Md. 611, 626-627, 471 A.2d 735, 742-743 (1984); <em>Damazo v.

Participants in the economic marketplace are expected to act aggressively in seeking business and furthering their own position in the market.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cIn the rough and tumble of the marketplace, competitors inevitably damage one another in the struggle for personal advantage.\u201d <em>Leigh Furniture and Carpet Co. v. Isom, </em>657 P.2d 293, 307 (Utah 1982). Courts and commentators have often found it difficult to determine when purposeful interference with business relationships, behavior that is an integral part of commercial competition, should be considered \u201cwrongful\u201d so as to give rise to a cause of action in tort.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">This Court has long recognized that self-interested commercial dealing has its proper place in the business world. Thus, in <em>Goldman v.

Competition is the state in which men live and is not a tort, unless the nature of the method employed is not justified by public policy, and so supplies the condition to constitute a legal wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>See also Macklin v.

Accordingly, we have made clear in our cases that acting to pursue one\u2019s own business interests at the expense of others is not, in itself, tortious. <em>Macklin v.

A successful plaintiff in a tortious interference case is not limited to the contract measure of damages, the benefit of the bargain, <em>Beard v.

Rouse Co., supra, </em>302 Md. at 71, 485 A.2d at 675, we reviewed our prior cases and noted that various factors might supply the element of malice under appropriate circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Willner v. Silverman, supra, </em>109 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Md. at 857, 71 A. at 964 (actual malice, such as ill will or spite); <em>McCarter v.

Building Assn., supra, </em>150 Md. at 682, 133 A. at 846 (unlawful acts). In <em>Natural Design, </em>the Court held that acts of interference committed in violation of a state antitrust statute constituted acts of wrongful or malicious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">In <em>K &amp; K Management v. Lee, supra, </em>316 Md. at 160-165, 557 A.2d at 975-979, we explained that an act of tortious interference with economic relations is characterized by the defendant\u2019s specific purpose to interfere, and that acts which incidentally affect another\u2019s business relationships are not a sufficient basis for the tort. In particular, the Court declined to hold that the tort would lie wherever an intentional breach of contract would foreseeably impinge upon a contracting party\u2019s economic relations with others. 316 Md. at 168-169, 557 A.2d at 980-981.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Court in <em>Travelers Indemnity v. Merling, </em>326 Md. 329, 343, 605 A.2d 83, 90, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 465, 121 L.Ed.2d 373 (1992), reiterated that \u201c[f]or one to recover for tortious interference with contractual or economic relations, the interference must have been wrongful or unlawful.\u201d We held that an insurance company was not liable for the tort of wrongful or malicious interference when the alleged act of interference constituted the insurer\u2019s compliance with a state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Most recently, .we held in <em>Macklin v. Logan, supra, </em>334 Md. at 301, 639 A.2d at 119, that malicious interference with economic relations requires \u201cboth a tortious intent and improper or wrongful conduct.\u201d In particular, the Court emphasized that tortious intent alone, defined as an intent \u201cto harm the plaintiff or to benefit the defendant at the expense of the plaintiff\u2019 <em>(ibid.), </em>was not sufficient to turn deliberate interference into a tort, but that the defendant must interfere through improper or wrongful means. 334 Md. at 302, 639 A.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Therefore, wrongful or malicious interference with economic relations is interference by conduct that is independently wrongful or unlawful, quite apart from its effect on the plaintiffs business relationships. Wrongful or unlawful acts include common law torts and \u201c \u2018violence or intimidation, defamation, injurious falsehood or other fraud, violation of criminal law, and the institution or threat of groundless civil suits or criminal prosecutions in bad faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>K &amp; K Management v.

Evander has based its theory of tortious interference, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>as well as its claim for punitive damages, on the existence of actual malice allegedly established by statements attributed to Mary Scheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">We note that under the circumstances of this case Evander carried a heavy burden in trying to establish the interference tort through proof of actual malice. As explained in <em>Macklin v. Logan, supra, </em>334 Md. at 305-308, 639 A.2d at 121-122, under the broader form of the tort, acts of interference with economic relations do not become tortious simply because the defendant carries them out with a wrongful intent. Proof that Alexander harbored animosity towards Evander when it interfered with Evander\u2019s economic relationship with Shand would not sustain the tort if Alexander\u2019s animosity was incidental to its pursuit of legitimate commercial goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">It would appear that Alexander\u2019s acts were undertaken pursuant to legitimate commercial goals. Evander, however, suggests otherwise because Alexander influenced decisions at Shand while Shand was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alexander. In Evander\u2019s view, the relationship between Alexander and Shand made Alexander\u2019s exercise of influence over Shand particularly objectionable. In fact, that relationship gave Alexander further legitimate reasons for acting as it did. A parent corporation is generally justified in requiring its subsidiary to modify economic arrangements, contractual or otherwise, if those arrangements do not benefit the parent. Under these circumstances, interference by the parent is ordinarily not tortious. <em>Green v. Interstate United Management Serv.

Alexander was generally justified in directing Shand not to continue relationships that Alexander <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>saw as detrimental to its own long-term financial interests. Provided that Alexander acted to protect these interests, it would not be liable in tort for interfering with Shand\u2019s economic relationships even if it harbored an incidental animosity towards Evander.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Even assuming, arguendo, that proof of ill will or spite could sustain the tort under these circumstances, Evander utterly failed to prove such ill will or spite. At the first trial, Mr. Evander was permitted to testify, over hearsay objections, to his recollection of a telephone conversation with Bob McDonald, a Shand executive. During that conversation, McDonald reportedly told Mr. Evander that Mary Scheeler had said that she was going to put Mr. Evander out of business and \u201cthat she hates your ass and she\u2019s going to get you.\u201d The record does not reveal to whom these statements were supposedly made.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Similar testimony admitted at the first trial, but not at the second trial, was elicited from Edna Watterscheidt, Evander\u2019s former office manager. Ms. Watterscheidt was permitted to testify at the first trial, again over defense objections, that McDonald had told her \u201con numerable occasions\u201d that Evander \u201cgot the shaft. We were screwed and we were f-.\u201d Questioned about what she meant by this testimony, Watterscheidt conceded that McDonald was describing in colorful terms his opinion of the fact that Evander would not get a commission on the OEP premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Mr. Evander\u2019s account of what McDonald allegedly told him that Mary Scheeler had said was hearsay within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>hearsay. Evander argues that this hearsay was improperly excluded at the second trail. Evander contends that it was admissible because it consisted of statements made by Mary Scheeler to her \u201cco-conspirators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Evander\u2019s argument is without merit. The record does not clearly show who was the recipient of Scheeler\u2019s alleged statements. Even if we assume that Scheeler made such comments to McDonald himself, there is no evidence that McDonald was involved in any kind of conspiracy to deprive Evander of a commission. On the contrary, Evander\u2019s own evidence showed that Shand\u2019s employees adamantly supported Evander until Alexander\u2019s president told Shand\u2019s two top executives that Shand must work with Alexander on Alexander\u2019s terms. There is no evidence that McDonald, who was not one of these top executives, ever took any position adverse to Evander\u2019s interests. Under the circumstances, there is no basis for Evander\u2019s claim that McDonald was a participant in a conspiracy against Evander. Accordingly, even if the hearsay exception for the statements of co-conspirators were otherwise applicable, it cannot help Evander here. <em>See Daugherty v. Kessler, </em>264 Md. 281, 291, 286 A.2d 95, 100 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Edna Wattenscheidt\u2019s testimony does not refer to any statements allegedly made by Scheeler. Instead, Ms. Wattenscheidt testified to what McDonald had told her about his opinion of the denial of commission to Evander. The co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule simply does not apply to this testimony.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court correctly excluded all evidence of McDonald\u2019s alleged statements from the second trial. In light of the complete absence of other evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>malice at the second trial, we can only conclude that the second jury reached its verdict because the court instructed it to find as a fact that Alexander and Scheeler had committed tortious interference with actual malice.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Evander\u2019s evidence of actual malice at the first trial also consisted of the statements attributed to Mary Scheeler. We have held that the trial court at the first trial erred in admitting that evidence. Thus, at both trials, Evander failed to offer sufficient admissible evidence of actual malice for this issue to have been submitted to either jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Evander failed to establish that the defendants\u2019 interference with economic relations was wrongful or malicious, and thus failed to prove the existence of tortious conduct. Moreover, even if we were to assume arguendo the existence of tortious conduct, Evander failed to establish the requisite actual malice to support an award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY UPON THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES AGAINST ALEXANDER &amp; ALEXANDER AND MARY D.

Since Shand and Mutual Fire were parties to the alleged contractual arrangement for commissions, Shand and Mutual Fire could not be liable for tortiously interfering with that contractual arrangement. <em>See, e.g., Travelers Indemnity v.

Consequently, the count charging interference with contractual relations was submitted to the jury only against Alexander and Scheeler. Awarding punitive damages for breach of contract is \"[c]ontrary to the settled policy of Maryland law,\u201d <em>K &amp; K Management, supra, </em>316 Md. at 169, 557 A.2d at 981. Therefore, the punitive damages against Shand and Mutual Fire must have rested on the \"civil conspiracy\u201d tort count.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">In this connection, we note that \"conspiracy\u201d is not a separate tort capable of independently sustaining an award of damages in the absence of other tortious injury to the plaintiff. As Judge Alvey said for this Court in <em>Kimball v. Harman and Burch, </em>34 Md. 407, 410-411 (1871), \"an act which, if done by one alone, constitutes no ground of action on the case, cannot be made the ground of such action by alleging it to have been done by and through a conspiracy of several.\u201d Later, as Chief Judge, he further explained for the Court in <em>Robertson v.

When the mischief contemplated is accomplished, the conspiracy becomes important, as it may affect the means and measure of redress. The party wronged may look beyond the actual participants in committing the injury, and join with them as defendants all who conspired to accomplish it; and the fact of the conspiracy may aggravate the wrong; but the simple act of conspiracy does not furnish a substantive ground of action.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\"><em>See also Green v.

In fact, the jury at the first trial was never given an actual malice instruction with respect to Alexander and Scheeler. Actual malice was defined for the jury only in connection with a conspiracy instruction. Later, the jury was told that it could award punitive damages against Shand and Mutual Fire if it found that Shand and Mutual Fire had committed \"tortious action in addition to a breach of contract.\u201d The instructions did not mention Alexander as a party to the conspiracy, and punitive damages were not mentioned in connection with the tortious interference instruction directed at Alexander and Scheeler. Alexander and Scheeler specifically objected at trial to the court's failure to give the actual malice instruction that they requested in connection with the tortious interference count, and they argued on appeal that the trial court had inadequately instructed the jury with respect to actual malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">. After the Court of Special Appeals had reviewed the first trial but before the retrial on punitive damages had begun, we decided <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 469, 601 A.2d 633, 657 (1992), which, <em>inter alia, </em>requires a plaintiff to establish entitlement to punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b725-11\">. It had been made clear at trial that Alexander would pay any damages awarded against Scheeler.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\">. The primary ground for this argument is Alexander\u2019s and Scheeler\u2019s contention that PX43, the \u201ccontract\u201d which formed the basis of Evander\u2019s tortious interference claim, never existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\">. Even if Evander were to rely primarily on the 1975 producer's agreement, PX43, the case would involve the broader form of the tort. By its terms, PX43 was terminable at will by either party. Interference with a contract terminable at will is analyzed as interference with economic relations broadly, and not interference with a specific contract. <em>Macklin v.

The idea that a tort is a \u201cwrong\u201d is embodied in the notion of fault that lies at the heart of Maryland tort law. <em>See Nissen Corp. v.

In this connection, we note that in some other jurisdictions the distinction between breach of contract and tortious interference has been somewhat obscured. In 1969, Dean Prosser summarized numerous cases nationwide as holding that a person who \"purposely interfered with somebody else\u2019s business\u201d would be prima facie liable for the tort of malicious interference, and would bear \"the burden of justifying his conduct by competition.\u201d 46 A.L.I.Proc. 196 (1969). This analysis was described as \u201creach[ing] the astounding result that the competitive order which we hold out to the world as a model is prima facie illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Even in our opinions, some language suggests that when a plaintiff relies upon interference with a specific contract, purposeful interference itself triggers liability. <em>See, e.g., Cumberland Glass Mnf'g Co. v. DeWitt, </em>120 Md. 381, 394-395, 87 A. 927, 932 (1913), <em>aff'd </em>237 U.S. 447, 35 S.Ct. 636, 59 L.Ed. 1042 (1915); <em>Knickerbocker Co. v. Gardiner Co., </em>107 Md. 556, 564, 69 A. 405, 408 (1908). On the other hand, we have on occasions specifically rejected this analysis. <em>See Travelers Indemnity v. Merling, supra, </em>326 Md. at 343, 605 A.2d at 90 (deliberate interference could not provide basis for tort where it was not \u201cwrongful or unlawful\u201d); <em>Sharrow v. State Farm Mutual, supra, </em>306 Md. at 764-765, 511 A.2d at 498 (intentional breach of an existing contract only tortious if \"wrongful or improper\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Since this case concerns only the broader form of the tort, which unquestionably requires more than purposeful interference, we need not further explore this matter. Nevertheless, we note that legal scholars are generally critical of the broad scope of the malicious interference tort in many jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Francis Bowes Sayre, <em>Inducing Breach of Contract, </em>36 Harv.L.Rev. 663 (1923); Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Tortious Interference with Contractual Relationships, supra, </em>34 Ark. L.Rev. at 335; Harvey S.

In connection with its civil conspiracy claim, Evander argued that Alexander\u2019s actions violated Maryland's anti-rebating statute, Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 226. Nevertheless, Evander has never argued that the statute is pertinent to establishing that the interference with Evander\u2019s contract or economic relations was tortious because it was unlawful. The Court of Special Appeals discussed the statute only in the context of the conspiracy claim. <em>Alexander v. Evander, </em>88 Md.App. 672, 694-703, 596 A.2d 687, 697-702 (1991). The parties have not briefed or argued the issue in this Court. Therefore, we need not explore, in this case, the meaning and scope of the anti-rebating statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. Section 769 of the Restatement provides that an entity or individual with a financial interest in another's business does not interfere improperly with that other\u2019s economic relationships if the interferer acts lawfully \"to protect his interest from being prejudiced by the relation.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">Comment e to the section states as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\"The rule stated in this Section applies for the purpose of protecting the actor\u2019s interest. If his conduct is directed to that end, it is immaterial that he also takes a malicious delight in the harm caused by his action; if his conduct is not so directed and is designed solely for some other aim, such as the gratification of his ill will, he is not entitled to the protection of the rule in this Section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">. It is not clear under Maryland law whether the interference tort lies where the plaintiff\u2019s contract or economic relations are with a corporation, and the defendant in the interference action is a controlling officer or stockholder (including parent corporation) of the contracting corporation. Although some jurisdictions have found tortious conduct under these circumstances, they have generally limited tort liability to situations in which the controlling individual or entity acted in bad faith. <em>See generally </em>Thomas G. Fischer, <em>Liability of Corporate Director, Officer, or Employee for Tortious Interference with Corporation\u2019s Contract with Another, </em>72 A.L.R.4th 492 (1989, 1994 Supp.). Under Maryland law, it could be argued that the analytical framework for the tort, as set out in <em>K &amp; K Management v. Lee, supra, </em>316 Md. at 154-156, 557 A.2d at 973-974, and <em>Travelers Indemnity v. Merling, supra, </em>326 Md. at 343, 605 A.2d at 89-90, does not exist where the entity that controls a corporation is sued for interfering with that corporation\u2019s contracts. <em>See Deauville Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>756 F.2d 1183, 1197 (5th Cir.1985) (\"the interests of [parent and subsidiary] are aligned so closely that we have difficulty even recognizing their separate identities for the purpose of this [tortious interference] analysis\u201d). We do not reach this question in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">. Interestingly, when Mr. Evander was asked at his deposition in 1988 whether or not he had any reason to suspect that Alexander had acted towards him with spite, he had answered \"I only know of a remark that came to me second or third hand that Mary Scheeler was going to put me out of business.\u201d Pressed to identify the source of the remark, Dixon Evander repeatedly stated that he could not remember it. Nonetheless, at trial in 1990 Mr. Evander confidently traced the comments to the telephone call with McDonald, saying \"I remember that conversation quite well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">In deposition testimony introduced as evidence at the first trial, Mr. McDonald denied having made any such remarks to Mr. Evander.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">. Indeed, Evander does not even attempt in its brief to apply the exception to the Watterscheidt testimony. Neither does it offer any alternative theory of admissibility for the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">. Evander argues that it introduced further \"malicious evidence\u201d in the form of testimony that Scheeler \"falsely accused [Mr. Evander] of improperly and unnecessarily collecting a state tax.\u201d (Evander\u2019s reply brief at 5). While it is true that Evander\u2019s trial counsel forcefully suggested to Ms. Scheeler that she had made such accusations, Scheeler repeatedly denied that she had done so. On the contrary, Scheeler explained that her investigation of taxes paid by the hospital in connection with the insurance policies was simply a part of her overall review of her new client\u2019s insurance transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Evander has pointed to no testimony or other evidence that Scheeler made accusations against Evander, and we have found none in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">. In light of our holding that there was no basis for any award of punitive damages, we need not in this case reach Alexander\u2019s alternative arguments that the punitive damages awards were disproportionate to Evander\u2019s injury and Alexander\u2019s culpability, and that the awards failed to satisfy due process requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
