Davis filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission against the Appellee Dyncorp and its insurer National Union Fire Insurance Company. The crux of Davis\u2019s claim was that he suffered a disabling occupational disease as the result of \u201ccontinual harassment\u201d by both management and fellow employees at Dyncorp. Davis had been employed by Dyncorp since February 1986 as a computer operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">At a 1992 hearing on his workers\u2019 compensation claim, Davis explained that, beginning in April of 1987 and extending over a couple of years, he was subjected to the following incidents of \u201charassment\u201d: (1) someone at work placed an explosive in his cigarette; (2) a co-worker placed a tack on his seat; (3) he was denied the use of a refrigerator and told to pay $10 if he wished to continue using it because he failed to take his turn cleaning it; (4) a \u201cmatch box sticker\u201d was placed on his desk, which explained how to obtain a high school diploma in one\u2019s spare time (Davis is a college graduate); (5) co-workers defaced a Department of Defense decal on Davis\u2019s vehicle at a nightclub; (6) after leaving work one day, a co-worker followed Davis in his vehicle \u201ctoo close[ly]\u201d for about a quarter mile; (7) while walking in the street on his way to the store, Davis was frightened by a co-worker, who pulled up behind Davis in an automobile, roared the engine, then hit the brakes; (8) Davis received annoying phone calls at home; and (9) Davis was called racially offensive names by fellow workers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of these and other similar incidents, Davis alleged that he experienced restlessness, sleeping problems, headaches, and developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, which prevented him from returning to work. Davis therefore main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tained that he was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because of a disabling occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, however, disallowed Davis\u2019s claim based on its finding that Davis \u201cdid not sustain an occupational disease of mental disorder arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Subsequently, Davis appealed to the circuit court. In a motion for summary judgment, Dyncorp maintained that even if all of Davis\u2019s allegations were true, Dyncorp was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Their first argument in support of their motion relied on language in <em>Belcher v. T. Rowe Price, </em>329 Md. 709, 621 A.2d 872 (1993), in which we stated that \u201c \u2018a mere showing that a mental injury was related to <em>general conditions </em>of employment, or to incidents occurring over an extended period of time, is not enough to entitle the claimant to compensation. The mental injury must be precipitated by an accident, i.e., an unexpected and unforeseen event that occurs suddenly or violently.\u2019\u201d 329 Md. at 739-10, 621 A.2d at 887 (quoting <em>Sparks v. Tulane Med. Ctr. Hosp. &amp; Clinic, </em>546 So.2d 138, 147 (La.1989)). Dyncorp therefore argued that this language in <em>Belcher </em>precluded Davis\u2019s recovery because his mental injury was related to general conditions of his employment. Davis, arguing to the contrary, maintained that <em>Belcher </em>was limited to accidental injury cases, and therefore was <em>not </em>controlling with respect to occupational diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Another ground for Dyncorp\u2019s motion was that the language of \u00a7 9-502(d) did not encompass Davis\u2019s claim. That section limits an employer\u2019s and an insurer\u2019s liability to cases where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201c(1) the occupational disease that caused the death or disability:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">(i) is <em>due to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist </em>and the covered employee was employed before the date of disablement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">(ii) has manifestations that are consistent with those known to result from exposure to a biological, chemical, or physical agent that is attributable to the type of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ment in which the covered employee was employed before the date of disablement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">(2) on the weight of the evidence, it reasonably may be concluded that the occupational disease was incurred as a result of the employment of the covered employee.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\"><em>Id. </em>Focusing on \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i), the parties primarily disagreed over whether an injury allegedly resulting from harassment could be deemed \u201cdue to the nature\u201d of Davis\u2019s employment as a computer operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County (Briscoe, J.), appeared to accept Dyncorp\u2019s characterization of the quoted language from <em>Belcher. </em>Nevertheless, the court held that even if Belcher\u2019s language did <em>not </em>apply to an occupational disease, as Davis contended, summary judgment should be granted for Dyncorp based on \u00a7 9\u2014502(d)(1). Addressing \u00a7 9-502(d)(l), Judge Briscoe stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">\u201cHarassment by fellow employees is neither a hazard -within the nature of the employment of a computer data operator nor a biological, chemical or physical agent attributable to the type of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The judge thus concluded that, \u201c[a]s a matter of law, the Plaintiffs condition is not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation statutes [and] ... summary judgment is granted to the Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Davis appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and prior to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s consideration of the case, we granted Davis\u2019s petition for certiorari to address the following issues: (1) Whether the quoted language in <em>Belcher </em>applies only to accidental injury cases, or whether it extends to occupational diseases and therefore prohibits Davis, as a matter of law, from receiving compensation benefits for \u201cpost-traumatic stress syndrome arising from harassment by fellow employees\u201d; and (2) Whether \u00a7 9-502(d)(l) requires the employer to provide occupational disease compensation for \u201cjob harassment which causes mental injury.\u201d We shall address each issue respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In <em>Belcher, </em>we were \u201ccalled upon to determine the expanse of the phrase \u2018accidental personal injury\u2019 in the contemplation of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act.\u201d 329 Md. at 711, 621 A.2d at 873. In that case, a three-ton beam crashed without warning through the concrete roof of the claimant\u2019s office and landed five feet from her desk. \u201cThe sound was deafening; it was [as] if a bomb had exploded. The lights in the office went out; pipes and wires were ripped apart; debris sifted over her and her surroundings; concrete dust went down her throat.\u201d 329 Md. at 713, 621 A.2d at 874. As a result of this incident, Ms. Belcher suffered from post traumatic stress disorder. 329 Md. at 714, 621 A.2d at 874-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">After recognizing that \u201cmental injuries can be as real as broken bones and may result in even greater disabilities,\u201d 329 Md. at 736, 621 A.2d at 885, this Court in <em>Belcher </em>held that \u201can injury under the Act may be psychological in nature if the mental state for which recovery is sought is capable of objective determination.\u201d 329 Md. at 745-46, 621 A.2d at 890. We cautioned, however, \u201c \u2018that a mere showing that a mental injury was related to <em>general conditions </em>of employment, or to incidents occurring over an extended period of time, is not enough to entitle the claimant to compensation. The mental injury must be precipitated by an accident, i.e., an unexpected and unforeseen event that occurs suddenly or violently.\u2019 \u201d 329 Md. at 739-40, 621 A.2d at 887 (quoting <em>Sparks, </em>546 So.2d at 147 (emphasis in original)). Based on this language, Dyneorp contends that <em>Belcher </em>controls the instant case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We specifically stated in <em>Belcher </em>that we were addressing the scope of the phrase \u201caccidental personal injury.\u201d 329 Md. at 711, 621 A.2d at 873. No reference to occupational diseases is made anywhere in the opinion. The statement that a mental injury must be \u201cprecipitated by an accident,\u201d rather than from \u201cincidents occurring over an extended period of time,\u201d was intended to be read within the context of ascertaining whether there was a compensable accidental injury. 329 Md. at 739-40, 621 A.2d at 887 (quoting <em>Sparks, </em>546 So.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>147). In determining whether the mental injury in <em>Belcher </em>was an accidental personal injury, we did not intend to address the complicated question of whether and what types of mental injuries are compensable under the rather antithetical category of occupational diseases. <em>See Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 284, 465 A.2d 1141, 1148 (1983) (\u201c[O]ccupational diseases and accidental personal injuries are, in general, antithetical in nature.... \u201d). Because <em>Belcher </em>does not resolve, as a matter of law, Davis\u2019s claim for compensation under the occupational disease statute based on \u201cpost-traumatic stress syndrome arising from harassment by fellow employees,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we shall now address whether the language of \u00a7 9-502(d)(l) precludes such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In support of their arguments regarding the compensability of work-induced mental stress as an occupational disease, Davis and Dyncorp have cited cases from other jurisdictions respectively accepting or rejecting the notion that mental stress in the workplace can be compensable as an occupational disease. <em>Compare McMahon v. Anaconda Co., </em>208 Mont. 482, 678 P.2d 661 (1984); <em>Matter of Compensation of James, </em>290 Or. 343, 624 P.2d 565 (1981); <em>Sawyer v. Pacific Indemnity Co., </em>141 Ga.App. 298, 233 S.E.2d 227 (1977); <em>Allen v. Goodyear Aerospace, </em>13 Ohio App.3d 190, 13 OBR 237, 468 N.E.2d 779 (1984), <em>with Rambaldo v. Accurate Die Casting, </em>65 Ohio St.3d 281, 603 N.E.2d 975 (1992); <em>Gatlin v. City of Knoxville, </em>822 S.W.2d 587 (Tenn.1991); <em>Douglass v. State, Reg. &amp; Licensing, </em>112 N.M. 183, 812 P.2d 1331 (App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>112 N.M. 77, 811 P.2d 575 (1991). <em>See also, </em>Donald M. Zupanec, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Annotation, <em>Mental Disorders as Compensable under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, </em>97 A.L.R.3d 161 (1980 &amp; Supp. Aug. 1993). The cases cited generally deal with interpretations of statutory language which are distinct from Maryland\u2019s occupational disease statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We therefore rely primarily on an examination of our own statute and the analysis provided by our prior case law in determining the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u201cIt often is necessary to look at the development of a statute to discern legislative intent that may not be as clear upon initial examination of the current language of the statute.\u201d <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 492, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993). Thus, we believe a brief summary of the development of Maryland occupational disease law may be helpful in understanding the goal behind this area of legislation before ascertaining whether Davis\u2019s claim is compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Traditionally, occupational diseases were not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See </em>J. Nicholas Shriver, Jr., <em>The Maryland Occupational Disease Law, </em>4 Md. L.Rev. 133, 135 (1940). In fact, early case law definitions of \u201coccupational disease\u201d originated in cases which sought to distinguish between accidental injuries, for which recovery was permitted, and occupational diseases, which were not compensable under the Act. <em>See, e.g., Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 486, 6 A.2d 48, 53 (1939) (\u201c[A]n occupational disease ... may be defined as some ailment, disorder, or illness which is the expectable result of working under conditions naturally inherent in the employment and inseparable therefrom, and is ordinarily slow and insidious in its approach.\u201d); <em>Gunter v. Sharp </em>&amp; <em>Dohme, </em>159 Md. 438, 443, 151 A. 134, 136 (1930) (explaining that an occupational disease arises \u201cgradually from the character of the employee\u2019s work,\u201d and stating that \u201c[a] typical illustration of an occupational disease is that of lead poisoning, commonly suffered by painters ...\u201d); <em>Victory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Sparkler Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 379, 128 A. 635, 638-39 (1925) (\u201cAn occupation or industry disease is one which arises from causes incident to the profession or labor of the party\u2019s occupation or calling. It has its origin in the inherent nature or mode of work of the profession or industry, and it is the usual result or concomitant. If, therefore, a disease is not a customary or natural result of the profession or industry, <em>per se, </em>but is the consequence of some extrinsic condition or independent agency, the disease or injury cannot be imputed to the occupation or industry, and is in no accurate sense an occupation or industry disease.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Perhaps sensing the unfairness of not compensating workers for certain occupational diseases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Legislature enacted the Occupational Disease Amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in 1939. <em>See </em>Chapter 465 of the Acts of 1939. <em>See also Miller v. Western Elec. Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 182, 528 A.2d 486, 491 (1987) (noting that the Legislature finally \u201crecognized [occupational disease] as a problem, like on-the-job accidental injury, that an industrial society had to address in a comprehensive fashion\u201d). This Amendment provided a \u201cschedule of [compensable] diseases includ[ing] a large number of all that apparently could arise from the nature of Maryland industry.\u201d Shriver, 4 Md.L.Rev. at 144. <em>See </em>Ch. 465 of the Acts of 1939, \u00a7 32A, at 991-95 (listing, <em>inter alia, </em>lead poisoning, phosphorus poisoning, arsenic poisoning, ammonia poisoning, silicosis, and asbestosis). Under the Amendment, \u201c \u2018[occupational [d]isease\u2019 ... mean[t] only the diseases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>enumerated and specified in [the schedule].\u201d Ch. 465 of the Acts of 1939, \u00a7 65(13), at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Although only certain occupational diseases were originally enumerated, the statutory definition of occupational disease was later generalized by eliminating the reference to the schedule of specific illnesses. In 1951, the Legislature provided that \u201c \u2018[occupational [d]isease\u2019 as used in this Article shall mean the event of an employee\u2019s becoming actually incapacitated, either temporarily, partially or totally, because of [a] disease contracted as the result of and in the course of employment....\u201d Ch. 289 of the Acts of 1951, \u00a7 67(13), at 752. This language has been substantially retained in the current definition of occupational disease contained in \u00a7 9-101(g). That section defines an occupational disease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201c \u2018Occupational disease\u2019 means a disease contracted by a covered employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">(1) as the result of and in the course of employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">(2) that causes the covered employee to become temporarily or permanently, partially or totally incapacitated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00a7 9-101(g). Even though the statute is no longer limited to certain, specified occupational diseases, \u201c[i]t should be borne in mind that the Act is designed to provide compensation to workers injured by the <em>effects of industry,\u201d </em>and therefore, \u201cthe definition of occupational disease should not be read too loosely . .. while a claimant might prove that a common cold was contracted in the workplace and that lost time resulted, compensation for that occurrence would far exceed the scope of remedy contemplated by the General Assembly.\u201d Richard P. Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook, </em>\u00a7 8.2-2, at 168-69 (2d ed. 1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Simply because a disease falls within \u00a7 9-101(g)\u2019s definition of occupational disease, however, does not mean it is compensable. Section 9-101(g) must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 9-502(d), which limits an employer\u2019s and insurer\u2019s liability to those cases where the occupational disease that causes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>disablement is either \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or the disease \u201chas manifestations that are consistent with those known to result from exposure to a biological, chemical, or physical agent that is attributable to the [employee\u2019s] type of employment....\u201d Section 9-502(d) further provides that in order to be a compensable occupational disease, \u201con the weight of the evidence, it reasonably may be concluded that the occupational disease was incurred as a result of the employment....\u201d As we explained in <em>Miller, </em>these provisions \u201cemphasize[ ] legislative concern with causation.\u201d 310 Md. at 183, 528 A.2d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">With this background in mind, we shall now address Davis\u2019s contention that his mental disease allegedly resulting from job harassment is \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">We are not convinced that Davis\u2019s mental disease could in fact constitute an occupational disease as defined by \u00a7 9-101(g). However, even assuming that Davis\u2019s disease was contracted \u201cas the result of and in the course of employment\u201d under \u00a7 9-101(g), we hold that it is not compensable under \u00a7 9\u2014502(d)(l)(i) because it was not \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Given its ordinary meaning, the word \u201cnature\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>means \u201c[a] kind, sort, type, order; general character.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1027 (6th ed. 1990). <em>See also </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1507 (Philip Babcock Gove ed. 1986) (defining \u201cnature\u201d as \u201cthe distinguishing qualities or properties of something\u201d). Thus, the question becomes whether mental disease caused by his job harassment may be reasonably characterized as due to the general character of Davis\u2019s employment. We believe that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Davis was employed as a computer operator, which entailed, among other tasks, the entry of data. According to Davis, he spent about 80% of his day entering data, and the other 20% of the day preparing paperwork, answering the telephone, and reading manuals and other publications. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s observation that \u201c[h]arassment by fellow employees is n[ot] a hazard within the nature of the employment of a computer data operator.... \u201d We see nothing peculiar to Davis\u2019s duties as a computer operator that made him more susceptible to harassment than in any other kind of employment. We note that the legislative emphasis on the relationship between a particular disease and a particular type of employment was certainly evident in the original workers\u2019 compensation legislation. For instance, adjacent to the column of diseases was a column describing the type of employment within which the disease might be contracted. <em>See </em>Ch. 465 of the Acts of 1939, \u00a7 32A, at 992-95 (describing, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>example, that \u201c[a]nthrax\u201d was associated with \u201c[h]andling of wool, hair, bristles, hides or skins\u201d). Although the specific diseases and employment descriptions have been eliminated, the necessity of a relationship between the particular disease and the \u201cnature\u201d of one\u2019s employment still exists. In the instant case, there simply is not the requisite relationship between the nature of Davis\u2019s work and the \u201cdisease\u201d that he allegedly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In reaching our conclusion that the harassment incurred by Davis did not result in an occupational disease which was due to the nature of his employment, we note that other jurisdictions have recognized that harassment, albeit sexual, is not a hazard within the nature of most work environments. <em>See e.g., Murphy v. ARA Services, Inc., </em>164 Ga.App. 859, 298 S.E.2d 528, 531 (1982) (\u201cWe refuse to say that the risk of [sexual harassment] ... belongs to or is in any way connected with what appellant had to do in fulfilling her responsibilities [as a cafeteria worker].\u201d); <em>Marable v. Singer Business Machines, </em>92 N.M. 261, 263, 586 P.2d 1090, 1092 (App.1978) (stating that \u201c[a] disease caused by harassment of male employees is not a natural incident of the employment. It is not linked with the process used by the employer by which the disease is caused, therefore, it is not an occupational disease.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Finally, although Dyneorp broadly asserts that \u201cthe Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation law should not be expanded to include stress-related claims absent the requisite physical injury or catastrophic event,\u201d we are not willing to rule out the possibility that some gradually resulting, purely mental diseases could be compensable occupational diseases or that there may be circumstances where work-induced stress may result in a compensable occupational disease.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Today, we merely hold that the mental disease resulting from the harassment encountered by Davis was not due to the nature of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>employment. The circuit court properly rejected Davis\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ST. MARTS COUNTY AFFIRMED.

At the circuit court hearing on Dyncorp\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Davis's counsel described his client's claim as follows: \"Mr. Davis can\u2019t point to one event as the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back ... because in order to show how his psyche became impaired you have to show that over a period of time there were various incidents causing him to be upset, discouraged, ridiculed, et cetera, and it is the combination of these within the employment atmosphere, encouraged by the employer perhaps by not doing anything about it which rendered him to have his post traumatic stress disorder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. We do note, however, that only Georgia, Montana, Oregon, and Ohio have apparently recognized the possibility of compensation for stress-related disabilities as occupational diseases. <em>See </em>1B Arthur Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 41.88, at 7-561 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. The 1925 case of <em>Victory Sparkler Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 128 A. 635 (1925) has been perceived as \"Maryland's attempt to legislate occupational disease coverage by judicial interpretation\" before the Legislature formally took action in 1939. J. Nicholas Shriver, Jr., <em>The Maryland Occupational Disease Law, </em>4 Md.L.Rev. 133, 135 n. 14 (1940). In <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>a young girl \"gradually contracted\u201d phosphorus poisoning while working in a fireworks plant. 147 Md. at 373, 128 A. at 636. Although occupational diseases were noncompensable at that time, this Court characterized the girl\u2019s ailment as \u00e1n accidental injury and therefore compensable. The Court stated, \"[t]he fact that [the girl] ... continued at her place of labor, in the doing of her common and regular task, makes it clear that the phosphorous poisoning happened without her design or expectation, and so her injury was accidental.\u201d <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 379, 128 A. at 639.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. Although \u00a7 9-502(d) has undergone various transformations in reaching its present form, one constant has been the requirement that, in order to be compensable, an occupational disease must be due to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist. <em>See </em>Chapter 465 of the Acts of 1939, \u00a7 32C, at 996; Ch. 290 of the Acts of 1951, \u00a7 23(c), at 754; Ch. 151 of the Acts of 1967, \u00a7 23(c), at 263; Ch. 706 of the Acts of 1980, \u00a7 23(c)(1), at 2431.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\">. The amicus brief submitted on behalf of various workers' compensation payors in Maryland relies heavily upon the judicial definitions of \"occupational disease\u201d contained in <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 486, 6 A.2d 48, 53 (1939) and <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 379, 128 A. at 638-39. Although these definitions may be of some assistance, they should not be unduly relied upon. As Professor Larson has explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\"[d]efinitions of 'occupational disease' should always be checked against the purpose for which they were uttered.\u201d IB Arthur Larson, <em>Workmen's Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 41.31, at 7-361 (1987). Larson distinguishes between definitions created for the purpose of \"defeating compensation because an injury is 'not an accident but an occupational disease\u2019 in jurisdictions which had at the time o\u00ed the decision no occupational disease coverage,\u201d <em>id. (i.e., Fable </em>and <em>Victory Sparkler), </em>and those created to allow \"awards for occupational disease under general definitions of the term, as against the contention that the disease is an ordinary nonindustrial illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Professor Larson believes that \"[i]t is of little value, and, indeed, may be quite misleading, to quote indiscriminately from old definitions whose only purpose was distinguishing accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 41.32, at 7-367. Thus, in determining whether a compensable occupational disease is alleged in the instant case, the statutory language contained in \u00a7 9-101(g) and \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i) is of primary relevance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. The issue of compensability for job-induced stress or harassment as an occupational disease is one which the legislature may wish to consider addressing in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b315-6\">. By reaching this conclusion, we in no way condone the type of harassment alleged in the instant case. We simply conclude that compensation for Davis\u2019s disease is not within the scope of Maryland's Workers\u2019 Compensation Acts. Davis certainly has other remedies to combat the infantile conduct and offensive language which he allegedly was subjected to by his fellow employees. Davis filed a civil suit and complaints with the EEOC and U.S. Department of Labor against Dyncorp. These disputes were resolved as the result of a settlement in which Davis received $25,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
