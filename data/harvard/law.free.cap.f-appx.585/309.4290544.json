Lacy, Texas prisoner # 594575, appeals the summary judgment dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit challenging the forfeiture of funds from his inmate trust account following his disciplinary conviction for trafficking and trading. Lacy is barred from proceeding IFP because, on at least three prior occasions while incarcerated, he has brought a civil action in a court of the United States that was dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See Lacy v. Velasquez, </em>54 Fed.Appx. 798 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Lacy v. Collins, </em>1995 WL 535114 (5th Cir. Aug. 8, 1995); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Further, nothing in the record reflects that Lacy is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">Accordingly, Lacy\u2019s IFP status is decer-tified, and the appeal is dismissed. Lacy has 15 days from the date of this opinion to pay the full appellate filing fee to the clerk of the district court, should he wish to reinstate his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-24\">IFP DECERTIFIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
