The district court imposed a sentence of 43 months of imprisonment, which was within the applicable sentencing guidelines range. On appeal, Sanchez-Larita challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">As an initial matter, Sanchez-Larita contends that the applicable guidelines provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based and, therefore, his sentence should not be subject to the presumption of reasonableness normally due to within-guidelines range sentences. However, he concedes that this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Because Sanchez-Larita objected in the district court, we review for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">The district court heard and considered Sanchez-Larita\u2019s arguments for a downward variance. It specifically considered his brief criminal history, his three prior removals, his past drug use, and his efforts at drug rehabilitation. The district court also stated that the sentence was based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly Sanchez-Larita\u2019s history and characteristics as well as the needs for deterrence and to protect the public. Sanchez-Larita\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-gujdelines sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b918-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
