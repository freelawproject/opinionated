He contends that, because his prior aggravated felony (possession of cocaine with intent to distribute) is an element of the offense under subsection (b)(2) of \u00a7 1326 and was not listed in the indictment, he could not have been sentenced to more than the two-year maximum set forth in subsection (a) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">We reject Mr. Delval-Estrada\u2019s argument. First, the Supreme Court has expressly held \u2014 in a case just like this one\u2014 that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) does not define a separate crime, and that the government is not required to charge the alien\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Second, \u201cwe have specifically rejected the argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was undermined by <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).]\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[W]e are bound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court ... overrules that decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
