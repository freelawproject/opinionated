Sharma, </em>703 F.3d 318 (5th Cir. 2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 78, 187 L.Ed.2d 30 (2013). On June 24, 2013, Gaurav Sunny Sharma, the Shar-mas\u2019 son, filed a third-party petition under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n) for an ancillary proceeding to determine his rights to property forfeited as part of the criminal convictions. The district court dismissed Shar-ma\u2019s petition, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-27\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding third-party claims to property subject to a forfeiture order and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Sharma, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 381, 382 (5th Cir.2013). Shar-ma argues that the entry of the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>criminal judgment reducing the amount of restitution allowed him 30 days to file a new third-party petition under \u00a7 853(n). Sharma, however does not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The language of \u00a7 853(n) as cited in <em>Sharma, </em>509 Fed.Appx. at 382, provides that \u201c[t]he thirty day window for a party to petition the court begins from either the date of actual notice or the final publication of notice of the forfeiture order, whichever is earlier.\u201d In <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>710 F.3d 565, 566 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2013), we held that the 30-day time limit began on the date of actual notice of the preliminary forfeiture order. Sharma \u201creceived actual notice of the preliminary forfeiture order on March 3, 2011.\u201d <em>Sharma </em>509 Fed.Appx. at 382. We found that \u201cthe district court\u2019s preliminary order of forfeiture expressly provided that any funds not used for the purpose stated in the plea agreement, i.e., Sharma\u2019s education, would be forfeited as fraud proceeds and substitute assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. On appeal, Sharma does not address the issue of actual notice as relevant to an ancillary proceeding under \u00a7 853(n). Sharma has shown no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his third-party petition under \u00a7 853(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
