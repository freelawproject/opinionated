He challenges the validity of his plea agreement and appeal waiver and the district court\u2019s calculation of the loss amount and restitution award and compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We review for plain error Blackwell\u2019s contentions that the district court violated his right to due process and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 by accepting his guilty plea. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). There is no plain error regarding the district court\u2019s failure to personally advise Blackwell of its authority to order restitution since the magistrate judge confirmed that Blackwell understood that he would be subject to the penalties and consequences explained by the Government, which included restitution, if he pleaded guilty. <em>See Burdick v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 545, 547-48 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Hekimain, </em>975 F.2d 1098, 1101 (5th Cir.1992). There is no plain error regarding the district court\u2019s failure to inform Blackwell of the probable quantum of the restitution award because it is subject to reasonable dispute whether this is required. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">We also review for plain error Blackwell\u2019s contentions that the plea agreement lacked consideration, the district court breached the plea agreement, and the plea agreement was ambiguous. <em>See id. </em>Assuming, arguendo, that consideration was required, the Government\u2019s promises to not bring additional charges and to dismiss the remaining charge provided consideration. <em>See Smith v. Estelle, </em>562 F.2d 1006, 1008 (5th Cir.1977). The imposition of mandatory restitution to all the victims harmed by Blackwell\u2019s fraudulent scheme was consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the plea agreement. Thus, there is no plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">The appeal waiver does not bar Blackwell\u2019s claim that the restitution award exceeded the victims\u2019 losses. <em>See United States v. Sharma, </em>703 F.3d 318, 321-22 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 78, 187 L.Ed.2d 30 (2013). Therefore, we need not resolve Blackwell\u2019s challenge to the appeal waiver as it pertains to the restitution award. As to the loss amount, the plea agreement and appeal waiver do not mention or purport to govern how the loss amount will be calculated for purposes of determining Blackwell\u2019s base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. Therefore, Blackwell\u2019s attempt to avoid the appeal waiver by arguing that the plea agreement was ambiguous as to how the losses would be calculated is unavailing. The appeal waiver thus bars Blackwell\u2019s claims of error regarding the loss amount and Rule 32. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>The district court was permitted to rely on the presentence report in finding, for restitution purposes, that Blackwell\u2019s fraud caused the victims\u2019 losses because Blackwell did not offer any competent rebuttal evidence. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Mendez, </em>752 F.3d 418, 429 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 298, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2014); <em>United States v. Ollison, </em>555 F.3d 152, 164 (5th Cir.2009). The district court did not plainly err in calculating the amount of restitution owed to Jack Morris since Blackwell\u2019s own testimony at the sentencing hearing supported the award. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that the victims\u2019 losses resulted from Blackwell\u2019s fraud and ordering Blackwell to pay restitution to all the victims. <em>See Sharma, </em>703 F.3d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
