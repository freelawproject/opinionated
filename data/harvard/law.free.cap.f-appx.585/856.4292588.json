Denial of such motions is reviewed under \u201ca highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). The BIA\u2019s decision will be upheld \u201cas long as it is not capricious, without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (\u201c[A] party may file only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened ... \u201d.). This time bar does not apply, however, if the motion is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing\u201d. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In this instance, the BIA, as required, properly compared the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to reopen with the evidence that existed at the time of Chen\u2019s 2003 merits hearing. <em>E.g., Gotora v. Holder, </em>567 Fed.Appx. 219, 221-22 (5th Cir.2014) (citation omitted). The 2003 Department of State report on China, which was submitted during Chen\u2019s original proceedings, establishes that \u201cgovernment respect for religious freedom remained poor\u201d and provides details of government treatment of various religious groups. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, <em>2003 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: China (Includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau) </em>Department of State, (25 Feb. 2004), http:// www.state.gov/j7drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27768. htm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The more recent State Department reports on China submitted with the motion to reopen support the BIA\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s motion because they do not establish a material change in country conditions since the time of Chen\u2019s prior proceedings; rather, they confirm \u201ccontinuing history of persecution\u201d. <em>Iqbal v. Holder, </em>519 Fed.Appx. 243, 244 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Accordingly, Chen fails to demonstrate the BIA abused its discretion. <em>Gomez-Palacios, </em>560 F.3d at 358. (This court, therefore, need not examine her claim that she is <em>prima facie </em>eligible for asylum, relief from removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.\u2019 <em>Iqbal, </em>519 Fed.Appx. at 244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b896-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
