He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Diaz asserts that when sentencing him, the district court failed to account for his personal history and circumstances, including that his motive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>returning was to escape a gang in El Salvador and that he had a past addiction to cocaine. He maintains that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the bifurcated review process adopted in <em>Gall, </em>we first consider whether the district court committed procedural error and next examine the sentence for substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The district court considered Diaz\u2019s request for a low sentence and for a reduction in his criminal history category and ultimately determined that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was appropriate under the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Diaz\u2019s argument that the court failed to consider his personal history and characteristics is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness afforded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (\u201cThe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d). Therefore, Diaz has failed to show that his 80-month, within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
