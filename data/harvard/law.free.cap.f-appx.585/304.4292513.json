Tompkins, </em>130 F.3d 117, 121 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cIn order to satisfy the consent exception, the government must demonstrate that there was (1) effective consent, (2) given voluntarily, (3) by a party with actual or apparent authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 438, 440 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-20\">We review for clear error both the district court\u2019s finding that Sanchez gave effective consent to the search, <em>see id., </em>and its finding that his consent was given voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 436 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous only if the court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d at 440. \u201cThe clearly erroneous standard is particularly deferential where denial of the suppression motion is based on live oral testimony ... because the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">We have recognized six factors relevant to determining voluntariness, none of which is controlling or dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-22\">(1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status; (2) the presence of coercive police procedures; (3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police; (4) the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse to consent; (5) the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence; and (6) the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>United States v. Olivier-Becerril, </em>861 F.2d 424, 426 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">At the suppression hearing the district court heard the live testimony of four officers. As Sanchez states in his brief, Sanchez \u201cdid not call witnesses or present any evidence at the hearing.\u201d After the hearing, the district court issued a written order in which it found that even though Sanchez was in custody at the time of his consent, his consent was nevertheless voluntary given the absence of coercion and his ready cooperation with law enforcement. Although Sanchez was not advised of his right to refuse consent, the district court suggested that Sanchez\u2019s lengthy criminal history made it likely that he was aware of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Ultimately, we are not \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d at 440; <em>see Olivier-Becerril, </em>861 F.2d at 426. Because the district court did not clearly err by holding that Sanchez voluntarily consented to the search, we need not consider his remaining arguments regarding the lack of probable cause and the inapplicability of the automobile and inventory exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
