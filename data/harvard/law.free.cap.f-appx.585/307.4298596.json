He appeals the denial of his motion to suppress, contending that a Border Patrol agent illegally stopped his vehicle. He argues that the facts supporting the stop lack the specificity and particularity required under the Fourth Amendment, and he also asserts that the record does not provide evidence of factors that are important in assessing whether there is' reasonable suspicion to justify a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review factual findings for clear error, while legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Rangel-Portillo, </em>586 F.3d 376, 379 (5th Cir.2009). The constitutionality of the stop, including whether there was reasonable suspicion, is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Neufeld-Neufeld, </em>338 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2003). In the context of a roving Border Patrol stop, we look to the totality of the circumstances, including the familiar factors set forth in <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884-86, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). <em>United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The stop occurred on Farm-to-Market Road 2050 (FM 2050), within 50 miles of the Mexican border. The proximity factor of <em>Brignoni-Ponce </em>is therefore satisfied. <em>See United States v. Zapata-Ibarra, </em>212 F.3d 877, 881 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Canales, </em>No. 94-60739, 1995 WL 450255, at *3 (5th Cir. July 7, 1995) (unpublished). As we have previously noted, and as shown by evidence presented at the suppression hearing, FM 2050 is \u201ca known alternative route of drug and alien smugglers seeking to avoid nearby Border Patrol checkpoints,\u201d and it is not well traveled. <em>United States v. De Leon-Reyna, </em>930 F.2d 396, 397 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (per curiam). \u201cIt is well established that a road\u2019s reputation as a smuggling route <em>adds </em>to the reasonableness of [an agent\u2019s] suspicion.\u201d <em>Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d at 429 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The agent, who had over six years of experience with the Border Patrol, determined that the rented Chevrolet Malibu vehicle driven by Rodriguez, which was not typical of vehicles that utilize FM 2050, was traveling in tandem with another vehicle. \u201cAlthough observation of two cars in proximity on a sparsely traveled road does not itself justify a stop, it may raise an agent\u2019s suspicions.\u201d <em>United States v. Villalobos; </em>161 F.3d 285, 290 (5th Cir.1998). We have \u201cgiven weight to an agent\u2019s observation that a vehicle\u2019s appearance was atypical of vehicles in the particular area in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>142 F.3d 857, 871 (5th Cir.1998). Further, before making the stop the agent knew that the vehicles that were traveling together were not registered in a nearby town, and he reasonably found it suspicious that vehicles with no connection to the local area were using FM 2050. <em>See United States v. Lujan-Miranda, </em>535 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>327, 329 (5th Cir.1976); <em>see also United States v. Delgado, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 493, 496 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished). The agent\u2019s suspicions were also raised by the fact that there had been recent alien smuggling activity in the area. <em>See Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d at 427-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u201cNot every <em>Brignoni-Ponce </em>factor need weigh in favor of reasonable suspicion for it to be present, nor does the Fourth Amendment require the law enforcement officer eliminate all reasonable possibility of innocent travel before conducting an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Zapata-Ibarra, </em>212 F.3d at 884. Analyzing the factors as a collective whole, <em>Neufeld-Neufeld, </em>338 F.3d at 379, we are satisfied that the agent had reasonable suspicion to stop Rodriguez\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
