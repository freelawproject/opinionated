Salmas appeals the dismissal without prejudice of his civil suit, which challenged the foreclosure of his home, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. He contests the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and argues that his claims fall within three exceptions to the doctrine, namely, exceptions based on a void judgment, fraud, and a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars a district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate if the federal plaintiff seeks to overturn a state judgment. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The doctrine \u201cis confined to ... cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">The record supports that Salinas initiated the instant federal proceedings to attack collaterally and to seek enjoinment of a preexisting state judgment in a forcible detainer suit and writ of possession rendered in favor of U.S. Bank National Association. Salinas\u2019s arguments implicate the validity of the state foreclosure judgment, and he seeks legal determinations that would allow him to retain, or reclaim, pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>session of his home. Because Salinas\u2019s present claims arise from the state court proceedings and are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d -with the state court\u2019s judgment\u2014 i.e., reversal of the state court\u2019s judgment would be a necessary part of the relief requested by Salinas, and the source of his claims is the state judgment and writ of possession \u2014 the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review his claims under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Exxon, </em>544 U.S. at 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517; <em>Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 375 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Moreover, Salinas\u2019s contention that his case presents exceptions to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is without merit. As to his first argument, under some circumstances, a federal court may review the state court record to determine if the judgment is void. <em>See United States v. Shepherd, </em>23 F.3d 923, 925 (5th Cir.1994). A Texas judgment is only void if \u201cthe rendering court (1) lacked jurisdiction over the party or his property; (2) lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit; (3) lacked jurisdiction to enter the particular judgment rendered; or (4) lacked the capacity to act as a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 925 n. 5. Salinas\u2019s complaint, however, is devoid of any factual allegations that the Texas justice court did not have jurisdiction or the proper capacity to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Salinas also relies on a fraud exception to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. However, \u201cthere is no such thing as a \u2018fraud exception\u2019 \u201d to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Truong v. Bank of America, N. A., </em>717 F.3d 377, 384 n. 6 (5th Cir.2013). Further, Salinas\u2019s claims that the state court judgment was procured through fraud are not \u201cindependent\u201d and instead are presented for purposes of contesting the parties\u2019 rights to foreclose on his property and the implication of those rights for the validity of the state court action. <em>See id. </em>at 384 &amp; n. 3. Finally, Salinas\u2019s attempt to place his claims within a due process exception fails, as there is no procedural due process exception to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, Inc., </em>355 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Liedtke v. State Bar of Texas, </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The request of Defendant-Appellees Barrett Daffin Frappier Turner &amp; Engel, L.L.P. and Vicki Hammonds that this court strike Salinas\u2019s appellate brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
