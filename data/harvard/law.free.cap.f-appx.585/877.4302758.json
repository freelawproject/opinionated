She claims that the district court plainly erred in applying the eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on a finding that her Texas conviction of felony theft was an aggravated felony. She contends that Texas\u2019s theft statute encompasses conduct broader than the generic, contemporary definition of theft because the Texas statute includes the appropriation of property when it is with consent that has been induced through deception or coercion. In <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014), we rejected that theory and held that the Texas theft statute, as set forth in Texas Penal Code \u00a7 31.03, \u201cdoes not deviate from the generic crime of theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
