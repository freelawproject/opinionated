Appellee, hereinafter referred to as plaintiff, recovered a judgment against the estate of James J. Walden, and the appellants Giles and Elsie Hubbard, hereinafter referred to as defendants. The facts, viewed in the light most favorable to upholding the judgment, follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">Plaintiff had lived with Walden for several years during which time Walden conveyed five parcels of real estate to her. After they separated, she conveyed one of the parcels back to Walden. At the time the deed was notarized, only one piece of land was listed. Later, four other parcels were added to the deed without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge. Testimony of three witnesses that Walden stated he had stolen the property from plaintiff was admitted against the estate of Walden only, and not against the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">The first issue we consider is whether there was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s instruction on rental value. The record shows no objection to the instruction. Unless there is fundamental error, an objection is required to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Michie v. Calhoun, </em>85 Ariz. 270, 336 P.2d 370 (1959) ; <em>Romero v. Cooper, </em>84 Ariz. 158, 325 P.2d 412 (1958). Also see, 16 A.R.S., Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 51(a). As we find no fundamental error, defendants are precluded from raising this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-21\">In his closing argument plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that three witnesses implicated Walden \u201cand another fellow that is another defendant.\u201d The Hubbards\u2019 attorney objected. The court told the jury that the comments of counsel are not evidence, but that counsel could argue reasonable inferences. Although the judge\u2019s admonition was not the proper one in this situation, the Hubbards\u2019 attorney made no further effort to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-22\">Since the testimony of these witnesses was admitted only against the Walden estate, the statement by plaintiff\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>was improper. <em>Bank of Arizona v. Thomas Haverty Co., </em>13 Ariz. 418, 115 P. 73 (1911). However, as the Hubbards\u2019 attorney did not request that the judge instruct the jury to disregard the statement, he did not preserve the issue for appeal. Furthermore, the jury was properly instructed at the close of the case that evidence admitted only against one defendant could not be used against the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The final issue presented is whether the plaintiff\u2019s attorney may, in his rebuttal argument, discuss a subject not mentioned by the defense attorney in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">At the end of his opening argument, plaintiff\u2019s attorney told the jury he would discuss punitive damages later. Neither opposing attorney mentioned punitive damages ' in their closing arguments. When plaintiff\u2019s attorney began to discuss punitive damages in his rebuttal, the Hubbards\u2019 attorney objected. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">It is the general rule that the plaintiff makes an opening argument, the defendant responds and advances his own issues, and the plaintiff then rebuts the arguments raised by the defendant. The scope of rebuttal is limited to matters discussed by the defendant. <em>Continental Bus System, Inc. v. Toombs, </em>325 S.W.2d 153 (Tex.Civ.App.1959); <em>Goldstein v. Fendelman, </em>336 S.W.2d 661 (Mo.1960); <em>Heddendorf v. Joyce, </em>178 So.2d 126 (Fla.App. 1965). However, this rule has not been strictly enforced. <em>Tilghman v. Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Co., </em>253 Iowa 1339, 115 N.W.2d 165 (1962). The major reason for not allowing the plaintiff to exceed the scope of rebuttal is that when he does so the defense attorney is not able to reply to the plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The Missouri Supreme Court has strictly limited the plaintiff\u2019s closing argument to rebuttal. In <em>Shaw v. Terminal Railroad Ass\u2019n of St. Louis, </em>344 S.W.2d 32 (Mo. 1961), the plaintiff\u2019s attorney at the end of his opening argument said there were other things he would discuss later. The defense attorney then stated that he would object to any points not mentioned by himself in his closing, and that if plaintiff was going to discuss damages, he wanted an opportunity to respond. The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection and plaintiff\u2019s attorney argued damages on rebuttal even though the defense attorney did not mention damages in his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\u201cWe recognize that there may be cases where a point has been inadvertently overlooked in the opening and, in the court\u2019s discretion, it may be permissible to supply it later . . . But we do hold, here and now, that the party having the affirmative of the issues in a suit such as this may not, after full notice and warning, withhold all argument on the vital questions of injuries and damages; we further hold that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting this argument in the reply, and that, under the circumstances of this case, the error was prejudicial.\u201d 344 S.W.2d at 36-37.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Although it was error to permit the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to exceed the scope of rebuttal in the present case, defense counsel could have avoided any prejudice by asking leave of the court to reply to the argument. Since he did not do so, the Hubbards cannot now claim prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b586-14\">HOWARD, C. \"J., and KRUCKER, J., concurring.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
