Failure of the adverse party to serve and file written opposition to any other motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of such motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">The motion to dismiss was duly noticed, no opposition was filed, and no appearance was made at the time the motion was heard. Therefore the appeal as to Dompe Supply Company must be dismissed pursuant to rule 41(c) Rules on Appeal.
