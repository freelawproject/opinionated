In this appeal, Rosales-Bruno claims that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on its finding that his prior conviction for false imprisonment under Florida law qualified as a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02 (defining \u201cfalse imprisonment\u201d as \u201cforcibly, by threat, or secretly confining, abducting, imprisoning, or restraining another person without lawful authority and against her or his will\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">Rosales-Bruno contends that, because Florida\u2019s false imprisonment statute creates criminal liability for detaining another person \u201csecretly,\u201d it is possible to commit the offense without employing the \u201cphysical force\u201d contemplated in the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii). From there, Rosales-Bruno argues that the government failed to establish that he did, in fact, employ \u201cphysical force\u201d when he committed the offense of false imprisonment. Because the government has not proven that Rosales-Bruno\u2019s guilty plea for false imprisonment necessarily supported a conviction for a violent felony, we vacate Rosales-Bruno\u2019s sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines impose a sixteen-level enhancement if an alien \u201cwas deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Nov. 1, 2011). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">We pursue a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d in making the determination about whether a prior conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1336 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1273, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Under this approach, we first look to the \u201cfact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense, as well as any charging paper and jury instructions to ascertain whether,\u201d as a formal matter, committing the offense required committing a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1328 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). However, where the statutory definition of the prior offense encompasses both violent and nonviolent conduct, we look beyond the fact of conviction and elements of the offense to determine whether the prior conviction falls under a particular statutory phrase that qualifies it as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">In making this second inquiry, we limit our review to reliable materials that allow us to determine whether the particular conviction \u201cnecessarily\u201d rested on a fact establishing the crime as a violent offense. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 21, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1260, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). Where, as here, the prior conviction stems from a guilty plea, the materials we review include \u201cthe terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or ... some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263. In that vein, we may also rely on facts contained in a presentence investigation report (PSR), so long as those facts are undisputed. <em>United States v. Bedeles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 843 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 24, 125 S.Ct. at 1261 (plurality opinion) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>(stating that, for a pleaded conviction, \u201cthe only certainty ... lies ... in the defendant\u2019s own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea\u201d). In contrast, we do not \u201crely on police reports or other documents supporting the criminal complaint because a defendant generally does not admit the conduct described in those documents.\u201d <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1328 (citing <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 22-23, 125 S.Ct. at 1260-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Addressing Rosales-Bruno\u2019s appeal then, we first consider whether false imprisonment under Florida law is categorically a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the Commentary of the Guidelines identifies several offenses as crimes of violence, it does not specify false imprisonment as being among that group. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii). Thus, we must decide whether a conviction for false imprisonment under Florida law \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">The meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d is a question of federal law, not state law. <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1331. But, in determining whether a conviction for false imprisonment under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02 is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for sentencing enhancement purposes, we are bound by Florida courts\u2019 determination and construction of the substantive elements of that state offense. <em>See Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1269; <em>see also Molinos Valle Del Cibao, C. por A. v. Lama, </em>633 F.3d 1330, 1348 (11th Cir.2011) (affording <em>Johnson </em>deference to states\u2019 intermediate courts, where no state supreme court precedent exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">The ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d \u201csuggests a category of violent, active crimes .... \u201d <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 11, 125 S.Ct. 377, 383, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). Further, when interpreting \u201cphysical force\u201d in defining the analogous statutory category of \u201cviolent felonfies],\u201d the Supreme Court has confirmed that \u201cthe phrase \u2018physical force\u2019 means <em>violent </em>force\u2014that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1271; <em>see also id. </em>at 1272 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018physical force\u2019 itself normally connotes force strong enough to constitute \u2018power\u2019\u2014and all the more so when it is contained in a definition of \u2018violent felony.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-10\">Against this backdrop, we look to Florida case law to determine whether a conviction under \u00a7 787.02 necessarily involves the employment of \u201cphysical force\u201d as that term is defined by federal law. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii). Section 787.02 requires that \u201csome amount of force\u201d be used. <em>Proko v. State, </em>566 So.2d 918, 920 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990); <em>see also id. </em>(noting that the state must prove, among other things, that a \u201cdefendant forcibly restrained the victim against her will\u201d). However, the force need not be \u201csubstantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, though that appears to be a fine distinction, case law since <em>Proko </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>makes clear that a \u00a7 787.02 offense can be committed without employing the type of \u201cphysical force\u201d contemplated in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Specifically, Florida jurisprudence indicates that \u201cthe statutory elements of the offense of false imprisonment do not necessarily involve the use or threat of physical force or violence against an individual.\u201d <em>Lamb v. State, </em>32 So.3d 117, 119 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009); <em>see also Kalogeras v. State, </em>58 So.3d 889, 891 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2011) (stating that false imprisonment does not \u201cnecessarily involve! ] an intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to another\u201d); <em>Davis v. State, </em>20 So.3d 1024, 1025 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (construing \u00a7 787.02 to permit false imprisonment to \u201cbe accomplished by physical force, <em>but also in other ways </em>\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Mosquera v. State, </em>16 So.3d 255, 256 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (suggesting that not all ways of committing false imprisonment \u201cinvolve the use or threat of physical force or violence\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). In light of this case law, we conclude that false imprisonment under Florida law encompasses several distinct crimes, some of which qualify as crimes of violence and others of which do not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">We now move to the second part of the modified categorical approach, inquiring whether the particular statutory phrase underlying Rosales-Bruno\u2019s prior false imprisonment conviction qualifies it as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See Johnson </em>130 S.Ct. at 1273. To prove that the conduct underlying Rosales-Bruno\u2019s conviction involved the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d and was therefore a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the government introduced three documents: (1) the information, a barebones document closely tracking the language of the three statutes that there was probable cause to believe Rosales-Bruno had violated; (2) the judgment, providing a record of conviction for two offenses to which Rosales-Bruno pleaded <em>nolo contendere', </em>and (3) an arrest affidavit, a sworn document outlining the arresting officer\u2019s on-the-scene understanding of the details of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">We will not rely on the arrest affidavit in making this determination. Evidence used to determine whether a pri- or guilty plea supported a conviction for a violent felony must \u201cbe confined to records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction.\u201d <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. at 1261. Like the Massachusetts police reports and complaint applications at issue in <em>Shepard, </em>the Florida arrest affidavit here was originally intended to be used to assess probable cause for a prosecution, and departs from the certainty of the record of conviction. <em>Compare </em>Mass. R.Crim. P. 3 &amp; 4, <em>with </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.140 (limiting charging instruments to either information or indictment); <em>see Burgess v. State, </em>831 So.2d 137, 141 (Fla.2002) (regarding such reports as inadmissible \u201cbased on the belief that observations by officers at the scene of a crime or when a defendant is arrested are not as reliable as observations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>by public officials in other cases because of the adversarial nature of the confrontation between the police and the defendant\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Thus, the arrest affidavit did not have indicia of reliability sufficient to meet Shepard\u2019s requirements. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">We will not rely on Paragraph 30 of the PSR either. Rosales-Bruno objected to the paragraph, which contains information from the arrest affidavit. <em>See Bedeles, </em>565 F.3d at 843 (permitting the district court to rely on undisputed statements in the PSR). The government claims that Rosales-Bruno\u2019s objection to the facts contained in Paragraph 30 of the PSR \u201cwas not made with the specificity and clarity required to raise a genuine dispute with those facts.\u201d It is true that \u201cvague assertions of inaccuracies\u201d in the PSR are not enough to raise a factual dispute; and that \u201cinstead the defendant must make clear and focused objections to specific factual allegations made in the report.\u201d <em>United States v. Owen, </em>858 F.2d 1514, 1517 (11th Cir.1988) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">We find, however, that Rosales-Bruno clearly objected to specific parts of Paragraph 30 of the PSR, disputing the factual accuracy of that paragraph\u2019s description of the conduct underlying his false imprisonment conviction. <em>See </em>PSR Addendum (\u201cThe defendant also objects to paragraph 30 which contains the circumstances of the false imprisonment case.\u201d). This objection gave the notice that the objection requirements are designed to ensure. <em>See United States v. Aleman, </em>832 F.2d 142, 145 (11th Cir.1987) (noting, preShepard, that the objection requirements protect the district court from having \u201cto guess whether a challenge is being mounted as well as what [the] defendant wishes to contest.\u201d). Indeed, we have found similar objections to be sufficient. <em>See, e.cj., United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.2010) (finding erroneous, under <em>Shepard, </em>the district court\u2019s use of police reports to substantiate facts after defendant \u201cobjected to the details of\u2019 a paragraph of the PSR). Thus, we conclude that Rosales-Bruno\u2019s objection was sufficiently clear and specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Relatedly, the government suggests that \u201cin the face of a general denial of PS[R] facts, without more, courts may rely on such facts in calculating the guidelines without requiring the production of further evidence.\u201d The cases the government cites for that proposition are non-binding because they are out-of-circuit. Equally significantly, none of the published cases the government cites was decided after <em>Shepard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">The government is correct that, pre<em>Shepard, </em>there was some \u201cslight\u201d burden for a defendant to substantiate his objection to a PSR. <em>United States v. Restrepo, </em>832 F.2d 146, 149 (11th Cir.1987). It seems probable that Rosales-Bruno would have met this <em>pre-Shepard </em>burden, since he would \u201cnot ... be required to prove\u201d the negative proposition that he was not violent, and his narrow objection to one paragraph of his PSR does not appear to be \u201cjust an attempt to harass the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">But, regardless, we have recognized that <em>Shepard </em>significantly impacted how we analyze objections to the PSR. <em>See Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1332-33 (concluding that <em>Shepard </em>abrogated prior panel precedent, and required the holding that \u201ccourts may not use police reports to determine whether predicate offenses ... were committed on\u201d different occasions). And we conclude that Rosales-Bruno\u2019s clear, specific objection to certain facts contained in Paragraph 30 of the PSR was enough to place on the government the burden of proving those facts. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>832 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhere a defendant objects to the factual basis of his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">The remaining documents introduced by the government\u2014the information and judgment\u2014were insufficient by themselves to support a finding that Rosales-Bruno\u2019s conviction for false imprisonment was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Essentially, both documents recited the elements of \u00a7 787.02, an offense which we have already concluded is not categorically a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The government urges us to read together all of the charges contained in the information and judgment to infer a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We find no support in our precedents for reading charges collectively to infer the nature of a defendant\u2019s conduct. If anything, this approach is of dubious merit. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (plurality opinion) (counseling that principles of constitutional avoidance \u2018\u2018limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">In any event, we decline to decide whether that course of action can at times be appropriate because, in this case, we need not reach the question. The information levied charges for three offenses: aggravated stalking, battery, and false imprisonment. The aggravated stalking charge was nolle prossed, while Rosales-Bruno ultimately pleaded <em>nolo contendere </em>to the battery and false imprisonment charges. Like false imprisonment, a conviction for the other charges contained in Rosales-Bruno\u2019s information can be secured without the \u201cphysical force\u201d necessary to commit a crime of violence. <em>See Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1270-73 (deciding that battery, as defined under Florida law, is not categorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d); <em>United States v. Insaulgarat, </em>378 F.3d 456, 466 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that aggravated stalking, as defined under Florida law, is not categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). Simply put, no conclusive implication of violence can be drawn from the inclusion of three non-\u201cerimes of violence\u201d in the judgment or information. So without some further evidence, even if we did read the charges in the documents together, we would still lack assurance that Rosales-Bruno \u201cnecessarily\u201d committed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by pleading guilty to false imprisonment under Florida law. <em>See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 21, 125 S.Ct. at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">As a result of our conclusion that it was error to find Rosales-Bruno\u2019s prior conviction under \u00a7 787.02 was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), we vacate Rosales-Bruno\u2019s sentence. We express no opinion, however, as to what sentence would now be appropriate for Rosales-Bruno. Instead, we remand so that the district court can resentence Rosales-Bruno on this record, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">. In <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>we stated in dicta that the defendant \"was convicted under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 787.02, False Imprisonment, which is a crime of violence.\u201d 283 F.3d 1268, 1273 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). But, since <em>Brooks, </em>the Supreme Court has clarified the \"crime of violence\u201d analysis considerably. <em>See Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1273; <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. at 1257. Indeed, in an implicit acknowledgment that we lack binding precedent on this question, we have since <em>Shepard </em>explicitly eschewed holding that a Florida false imprisonment conviction is categorically a crime of violence. <em>See United States v.
