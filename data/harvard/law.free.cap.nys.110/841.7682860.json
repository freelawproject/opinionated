The plaintiff introduced proof establishing a prima facie \u2022case, and rested. The record discloses the following as having oc\u2022curred during the introduction of defendant\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-16\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Cbunsel: It is conceded there is another action pending, wherein the present defendant is plaintiff and the present plaintiff is defendant, in \"the City Court of the city of New York, brought prior to the commencement \u25a0of this action, wherein the subject-matter of the alleged counterclaim sought to be interposed in this action was made tlje subject-matter of complaint in the other action, and that the answer was served and issue joined, and such \u25a0action is now actually pending in the City Court of New York. Now, I object to the proof of the counterclaim on the ground of, the previous action pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">The defendant was not allowed to introduce proof of the counter\u25a0claim; the trial court holding that it was for the same cause of action \u2022as that pending in the City Court. The appellant claims that this ruling was erroneous, and that the judgment should be reversed. It does not necessarily follow that the words \u201csame subject-matter\u201d imply \u201csame cause of action.\u201d We are, therefore, not able to say from the language of the stipulation that the cause of action set forth in the complaint in the City Court action is the same cause of action as that which constitutes the counterclaim herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The record must be returned to the files of the court below, to be-amended by annexing thereto the complaint in the City Court action..
