J., and CHESTER, KELLOGG, COCHRANE, and SEWELL, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b761-15\">W. H.

Corbin, of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b761-17\">COCHRANE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAd\">It is admitted that the claims in question are such as are subject to the jurisdiction of the town board of auditors. Some of them prior to the action \"of the board of supervisors had been disallowed by said town board either in whole or in part. The others had not been presented to the town board.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">It is urged by the appellants that the claims are lawful and proper charges against the town, and that the taxpayers are not therefore damnified by the action of the board of supervisors. It is sufficient to say in answer to this argument that the action of the board of supervisors was without jurisdiction, and the court will not consider whether or not in a proper forum such claims should be allowed. The supervisors without any authority of law attempted to fasten certain taxes on the town, and such unauthorized action constituted unlawful taxation and an illegal expenditure of public funds. Claims, however meritorious, are not legal within the meaning of the taxpayer\u2019s act (chapter 301, p. 620, Laws 1892), unless so determined by a forum empowered by law to make such determination. That act by its terms may be invoked \u201cto prevent any illegal official act on the part of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>such officer.\u201d The case differs materially from those cited by appellants where the wrongful official acts did not involve any public expenditure. That the want of jurisdiction may be challenged in an action of this kind was decided in the case of Osterhoudt v. Rigney, 98 N. Y. 222. As to such of the claims as had been disallowed by the town board, it may further be said that such action of the town board constituted a judicial determination by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction that such claims were illegal, which determination, until reversed or annulled as provided by law, is conclusive on every .one, including the board of supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">As to such rejected claims, however, the appellants claim the right of review under section 16 of the county law (chapter 686, p. 1748, Laws 1892), which provides that the board of supervisors \u201cmay correct any manifest clerical or other error in any assessment or returns made by any one or more town officers to such board or which may or shall have properly come before such board for its action, confirmation or review.\u201d It has been held that this statute conferred upon boards of supervisors no power to review the action of town officers in respect to the merits or. legality of the questions before them, but only to make clerical corrections and perform ministerial duties in reference thereto. Matter of Buffalo Mutual Gaslight Company, 144 N. Y. 228, 39 N. E. 86; Hermance v. Supervisors, 71 N. Y. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
