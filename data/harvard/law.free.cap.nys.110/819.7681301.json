The fifth defense is not good, because the matters alleged are neither matters of provocation, nor are they shown to have been brought to the knowledge of the defendant before the utterance alleged to be slanderous. Judgment should therefore be modified, so as to sustain plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the fifth defense, with leave to amend upon payment of costs of the demurrer. Only one bill of costs, however, is to be charged the defendant for the privilege of amending, if the defendant' shall avail himself of the right to amend the second and fourth defenses under the privilege granted him in the original judgment. As thus modified, the interlqcutory judgment is affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Interlocutory judgment modified as per opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs of appeal. All concur, except KELLOGG, J., who considers the fifth defense proper in mitigation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
