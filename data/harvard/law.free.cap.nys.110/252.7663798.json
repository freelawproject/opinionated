The motion was opposed below on the ground that the action was settled without the knowledge, consent, or authority of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who, at the time of the settlement had a contingent interest in the recovery, to the knowledge of defendant and her attorney. The grounds urged for a denial of the motion were insufficient. O\u2019Brien v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 27 App. Div. 1, 50 N. Y. Supp. 159; Zaitz v. Same, 52 App. Div. 626, 65 N. Y. Supp. 395; Varriale v. Same, 54 App. Div. 633, 66 N. Y. Supp. 559. The motion was properly granted, but it should have been upon \u201cpayment of all costs from the beginning of the action.\u201d Varriale v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 54 App. Div. 633, 66 N. Y. Supp. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The order appealed from should be modified so as to provide for the payment of costs as above indicated, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal, but with disbursements to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
