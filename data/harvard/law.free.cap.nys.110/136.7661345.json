The application should have been denied. Section 355 of the city charter (Laws 1901, p. 154, c. 466) provides that the police commissioner shall by order dismiss from the police force, and place on the roll of the pension fund any member of the police force who has performed duty on such force for 20 years or more, \u201cupon a certificate of so many of the police surgeons as the police commissioner may require, showing\u201d that such member \u201cis permanently disabled, physically or mentally so as to be unfit for duty.\u201d Such a certificate was regularly made in the case of the relator, following the decision in the case of Metcalf, 48 Misc. Rep. 420, 95 N. Y. Supp. 511; Id., 109 App. Div. 892, 96 N. Y. Supp. <em>868; </em>Id., 184 N. Y. 268, 77 N. E. 17. It thereupon became the duty of the commissioner to dismiss and retire him. Having therefore acted with jurisdiction, and as required by law, a writ of mandamus cannot issue to compel him to undo his action. The relator cannot successfully attack the commissioner\u2019s action and \u25a0 jurisdiction by going back of the same and attacking the truthfulness of the certificate of the surgeons. Their action was judicial and binding on the commissioner; and, moreover, if that question were here, we might have to decide that their action is not reviewable on an application for a writ of mandamus.

Supp. 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The order should be reversed, and the application denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Order reversed without costs, and application denied without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
