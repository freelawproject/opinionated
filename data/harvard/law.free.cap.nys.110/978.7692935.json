The court imposed the \"condition that the plaintiff pay the defendant\u2019s taxable costs and disbursements within 10 days, in default of which the complaint should be dismissed. The conditions were not complied with and a judgment of dismissal was entered. The plaintiff appeals from that judgment and discusses several alleged errors of the trial judge in the exclusion of evidence. The case and exceptions consist of 11 pages, the brief for the appellant consists of 15 pages, and that for the defendant of 32 pages\u2014an abuse with which we are growing painfully familiar. Nothing is said of the fact that the court did not dismiss the case, but allowed the plaintiff to withdraw a juror, and that the dismissal is based solely on his default to comply with the conditions imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
