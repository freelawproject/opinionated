Bingham, Police Commissioner (decided herewith) 110 N. Y. Supp. 217. In this case the whole police department were enjoined so long as the plaintiff\u2019s entertainment shall be given in such a manner as not to disturb the public peace or amount to a serious interruption of the repose and religious liberty of the community. There would thus.seem to be imposed upon the police officers the question of determining whether a performance of the plaintiff would be a serious interruption of the repose and religious liberty of the community, with the danger of a commitment for a contempt in case they should disagree with the court as to whether there was-such an interruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The \"order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10' costs and disbursements, and the motion for an injunction denied, with $10 costs.\u2019 All concur (LAUGHLIN, J., in memorandum).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b243-13\">LAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agr\">I concur in the reversal of the injunction order in this case upon the grounds stated in my concurring memorandum in Eden Musee American Company, Limited, v.
