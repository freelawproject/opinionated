Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 971. It was influenced to some extent in denying the motion by the condition of the jury calendar (it is over two years in arrears) as the memorandum filed with its decision shows. This was not improper. Indeed, motions like this are sometimes made hereabouts to avoid the speedy trial afforded by the equity calendar. A verdict for the defendant would not bind the court; it has the responsibility of giving judgment in the end, and the rule is for the court to try such cases without having its conscience enlightened or aided by a verdi.ct.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-19\">Order of the County Court of Kings county affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">RICH and MILLER, JJ., concur</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b842-21\">HOOKER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoG\">(dissenting). The action is for a foreclosure of a mortgage. The defense is that the mortgage was given without consideration and. was obtained through fraud and under duress. The defendant made timely application to the court under the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>of section 971 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the settlement of questions to be tried by a jury. The motion was denied, \u201cowing to the condition of the civil calendar\u201d of the court in which the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Section 971 of the Code reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">\u201cIn an action, where a party is not entitled, as of right, <em>to </em>a trial by a jury, the court may, in its discretion, upon the application of either party, or without application, direct that one or more questions of fact, arising upon the issues, be tried by a jury, and may cause those questions to be distinctly and plainly stated for trial accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">This is a substitute for the former practice of trying feigned issues in actions in equity. Carroll v. Deimel, 95 N. Y. <em>252. </em>Both under the old practice in equity and under the Code it is contemplated that the court shall exercise its discretion whether or not to settle issues upon the basis of the nature of the action and of the defense and the circumstances disclosed by the issues, rather than upon the basis of the condition of the jury calendar of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The order should be reversed, with costs, and the motion remitted to the County Court of Kings county for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">WOODWARD, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
