The plaintiff appeals from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-19\">The justice was without authority to make the order appealed from. Section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in which power is given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>to courts to grant stays for nonpayment of costs of a motion or \u201cdirected by an order to be paid,\u201d has no application to Municipal Courts. Richman v. Bonewur, 56 Misc. Rep. 609, 107 N. Y. Supp. 675. The case cited by the respondent was a case brought in the Supreme Court after an action had been brought in the Municipal Court, in which last-mentioned court the plaintiff\u2019s complaint had been dismissed, with costs. The costs in the Municipal Court not having been paid, the defendant in the Supreme Court moved for a stay of proceedings until the costs of the prior action were paid, which was granted, The exercise of the power to stay proceedings was, therefore, by the Supreme Court, while in the case at bar the power is attempted to be \u2019 exercised by a court without authority to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The order appealed from, however, is not an appealable one, and the appeal must therefore be dismissed. The lower court should vacate the order and permit the plaintiff to proceed in the action. Upon refusal so to do, mandamus would probably lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Appeal dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
