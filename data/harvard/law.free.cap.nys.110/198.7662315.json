The plaintiff put in evidence written orders running from the defendants to the Monarch Biscuit Company, containing-the following words: \u201cPlease ship for our account\u201d\u2014followed by shipping directions and a description of the quantities and kind of goods desired, but containing no price nor time nor other terms of payment. One of the defendants was permitted to testify over the plaintiff\u2019s objection that at the time the orders were given to the salesman of the Monarch Biscuit Company it was agreed that the goods were to be shipped \u201cgratis,\u201d and that the defendants were to pay for them only in case they should succeed in selling them at the Isthmus of Panama, to which place they were to be sent. This testimony was corroborated by a clerk who was present at the interview. I am of the opinion that \"this evidence was properly admitted. The memorandum omits all mention of price and time of payment, and is manifestly incomplete.. Under such circumstances it is well settled that paroi evidence is. competent to complete, though not to vary or contradict a writing. Thomas v. Scutt, 127 N. Y. 133, 27 N. E. 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The only question is whether the words \u201cfor our account\u201d are of\" such an import that they are contradicted by the testimony th\u00e1t was admitted. The expression, as I construe it, does not necessarily mean an absolute purchase, but would be equally applicable to such a trans- \u201e action as the defendant testified to. In such a case, the same as in the case of an absolute sale, the goods would properly be charged on the books of the Monarch Biscuit Company against the defendants, and would in due time have to be accounted for by them, and consequently it could properly be described as a shipment for the account of the defendants. There would be no warrant under the circumstances disclosed in the case for giving to the expression under consideration the narrow and rigid meaning the plaintiff seeks to impose upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">GILDERSLEEVE, P.

The omission of the terms and prices of the goods mentioned in the order is unusual in such an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>strument, and significant, in the light of the explanation of the defendants, of an incomplete expression of the real agreement between the parties. Considered in this aspect, the paroi proof as to the conditions under which the order was given would not be inconsistent with the contention of defendants that they were not to pay for the goods unless they succeeded in effecting sales of them. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
