Defendant entered the premises in the month of June, 1906; plaintiff stating to defendant that he would give him a two-year lease. No other terms were mentioned, and defendant entered the premises. Thereafter a written lease for the same term was signed by defendant, and also by plaintiff. Plaintiff delivered it to his real estate agents, who did not deliver it to the defendant. As there was no delivery of the lease, when signed, to defendant, no action on the written lease can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Defendant moved out of the premises prior to November 30, 1907, and this action was brought to recover rent for the months of December, 1907, and January, 1908. The paroi lease was given for two years from June 1, 1906. Occupation of the premises was taken under the paroi lease, and in such case the occupation inures as a tenancy from year to year. Reeder v. Sayre, 70 N. Y. 180, 26 Am. Rep. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">The tenant, by holding over and continuing after the expiration of the first year, became tenant for another year, and liable to pay the rent until the expiration of that year. Eoughran v. Smith, 11 Hun, 314. Defendant in his testimony admitted the paroi leasing for two years. This being once established, the fact that afterwards the rent receipts, signed by the agents of plaintiff, contained the words \u201clet by the month only,\u201d cannot affect the relations already established between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">The action was therefore properly brought for rent, and the judgment in favor of the defendant should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
