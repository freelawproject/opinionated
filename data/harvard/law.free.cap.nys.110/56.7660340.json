Upon the proof in this case the plaintiff cannot recover the price for that part, if it was neither sold by the defendant nor withheld by him, but was held by him subject to the plaintiff\u2019s orders, without assertion of any claim of-title or right of possession, save that derived from such consignment. As to the second cause of action, it is admitted that the defendant owes $50 for the -horse, and whether this is due, or $100 is due, can more clearly be determined upon the new trial. As to the third cause of action, it appears that in any event the assignor of the plaintiff was entitled to the earnings of the horse. If the earnings of the wagon when drawn by the horse belonged to the plaintiff, or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the earnings of the team belonged to the plaintiff, that can be established upon the new trial, and the complaint may be amended accordingly, and should be so amended, without terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
