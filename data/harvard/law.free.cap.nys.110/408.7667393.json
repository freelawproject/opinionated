The testimony of the defendant upon plaintiff\u2019s objection only showed that the wine delivered was not like the sample shown by the salesman and as guaranteed by him. I think the evidence as to sample and guaranty was clearly incompetent, as it tended to vary the terms of the written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">The\u00b0order described the kind of wine, its color, and expressly referred to a previous shipment to \u201cManzella.\u201d The effect of admitting testimony as to a sample was to eliminate the force of all that is contained in the written order, and to substitute in its place a sale by sample like that claimed to have been shown by the salesman. If the order is to stand as the contract between the parties, there was not a sale under a warranty by sample, and if the goods shipped did not comply with the description in the order, the contract being executory and the defects claimed being patent upon examination, the remedy of the purchaser was to refuse to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">It was also error to admit the conversations of the defendant with the plaintiff\u2019s salesman as to the complaints about the wine, in absence of authority shown in the salesman to receive complaints. It was also \u25a0error to have permitted defendant to testify as to the contents of a letter claimed by him to have been written plaintiffs, without proof of mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant' to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b433-17\">GIEGERICH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqWG\">(dissenting). The contract on which the plaintiff relies shows that the sale was made by sample. The words, \u201cSee first shipment Manzella,\u201d clearly indicate that the wine contracted for was to be like the shipment made to Manzella. Not only did the contract show this, but the testimony offered on behalf of the plaintiff recognizes the same fact. The plaintiff\u2019s vice president and secretary testified that the wine sent to the defendant \u201cwas exactly the same kind, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>out of the same cask and lot, as that shipped to Mr. Manzella of New York.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s salesman, Bonano, who made the sale in controversy, testified that the sample he showed to the defendant was the wine he had sold to Manzella, evidently meaning by that that the small bottle he had with him at the time of the sale was taken rfrom the former shipment to Manze'lla. The mere fact that the contract mentioned a former shipment as the sample, and that only a small bottle from' that shipment, instead of all of it, was shown the purchaser at the time of the sale, cannot, of course, change the nature of the transaction. The evidence on the defendant\u2019s behalf was that the wine delivered was-neither light in color, nor sweet like the Manzella wine, but was very dark and sour.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">I do not think any prejudicial error was committed in the admission of evidence. It is true that there is a printed statement on the order which the defendant signed that \u201call claims must.be reported within ten ' days after receipt of goods.\u201d In my judgment this general provision on the printed order was not intended, nor should it be held, to apply, to a case like the present, where the sale was made by sample and the defendant made his objection with reasonable promptness. Indeed, the defendant does not make a \u201cclaim\u201d in the sense in which the word would ordinarily be understood under such circumstances. He is not claiming anything on account of shortage, or damage, or any of the various things usually embraced under the description of that word, but is repudiating the entire transaction. The record shows that reasonable promptness was used in rejecting the goods. The defendant had a right either to reject them, or to keep them and sue for damages upon the warranty. In addition to the letter subsequently sent direct to the plaintiff, there was immediate notice to the plaintiff\u2019s agent who made the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">I think the judgment was right, and should be affirmed, with costs..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
