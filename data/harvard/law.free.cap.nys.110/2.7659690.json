There is only one stopping-place there. Railroad Law, Laws 1892, p. 1392, c. 676, \u00a7 34, calls a regular railroad stopping-place a station. It requires that \u201cany such station in an incorporated village shall have the same name as the village.\u201d The name given to this stopping-place by the railroad company is Pelham. It was given for the town of Pelham, within which both villages lie, and before they existed. There being only one stopping-place it cannot be given two names, and as it is not wholly \u201cin\u201d either village, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>but half in each, the petitioner cannot compel the railroad company to change from the old name to the petitioner\u2019s name. The statute has not provided for such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
