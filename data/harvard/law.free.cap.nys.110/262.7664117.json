Samuel, 18 App. Div. 99, 45 N. Y. Supp. 406. The motion for the new trial in this case is specifically stated not to be based upon any error in a finding of fact (clearly not. applicable to a jury trial) or ruling upon the law made by the judge upon the trial of the action, but is expressly limited to the grounds that the \u201cverdict is contrary to the law as ruled by said trial judge.\u201d In other words, a new trial is sought because the jury found a verdict in violation of the legal instructions of the court and the proofs submitted to them; and the case of Barrett v. Third Avenue R. R. Co., 45 N. Y. 628, seems to be authority for the correctness of defendants\u2019 practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
