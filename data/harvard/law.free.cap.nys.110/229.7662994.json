Courts\u2014Municipal Courts\u2014Entry op Judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-9\">Where, after overruling a demurrer to complaint, the Municipal Court indorsed on the summons, \u201cDemurrer overruled with leave to plead over, answer to be filed\u2019\u2019 on a certain date, the indorsement did not amount to a judgment, so as to be appealable, though it might be sufficient, under rule 3 of the rules of practice of the Municipal Court, to show a decision; the proper practice being to enter an order overruling the demurrer, followed by entry of an interlocutory judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>2. Same\u2014Trial by Demurrer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-5\">The Municipal Court act contemplates the entry of a judgment on a trial by demurrer, as indicated by Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. 1587, c. 580, \u00a7 334, making provisions for costs on trial by demurrer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Second District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">Action by Henry Binder against Caroline Robinson.

The summons is indorsed as follows: \u201cDemurrer overruled, with leave to plead over. Answer to be filed on or before February 26th * * * \u201d\u2014and this is signed by the justice. This is far from being a judgment. An indorsement upon a summons in a Municipal Court action may be sufficient, under rule 3 of the rules of practice of the Municipal Court, as evidencing a decision by the justice making it, but it is not sufficient as a judgment. Dalton v. Loughlin, 4 Abb. N. C. 187. The proper practice is to enter an order overruling the demurrer. This to be followed by the entry of an interlocutory judgment, from which an appeal would lie. Smith v. Ely, 46 Misc. Rep. 458, 92 N. Y. Supp. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">That the Municipal Court act contemplates the entry of a judgment on a trial by demurrer is shown by the provision for costs made in such a case in section 334 of that act (Laws 1902, p. 1587, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
