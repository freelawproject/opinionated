It is not necessary to determine whether the contract should be treated as beginning on March 25th or on March 24th, because in either event it by its terms was not to be performed within one year from the time it was made, and consequently came within the statute. In Billington v. Cahill, 51 Hun, 132, 4 N. Y. Supp. 660, it was held that an oral contract for the employment of a person-for the term of one year, the employment to commence on the following day, was void. A like ruling was made in Levison v. Stix, 10 Daly, 229. See, also, Oddy v. James, 48 N. Y. 685; Amburger v. Marvin, 4 E. D. Smith, 393;. Blanck v. Littell, 9 Daly, 268; Nones v. Homer, 2 Hilt, 116; Hartwell v. Young, 67 Hun, 472, 22 N. Y. Supp. 486; Booker v. Heffner, 95 App. Div. 84, 88 N. Y. Supp. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">An attempt is made in this case to argue that the additional year-contracted for was to begin on the 23d day of March; but the evidence does not support such a claim. In order to hold that the new year began on the 23 d, it would be necessary to hold that the new contract rescinded the old contract, so far as the unexpired portion of the period covered by it was concerned, and that the new .contract took effect before the termination of the old one and superseded it. There is nothing in the language testified to that would warrant such a construction. The plaintiff, according to his own testimony, said to one of the defendants that his contract expired that day, and the defendant's reply was that he would renew the contract for another year from that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">I cannot distinguish the case from Billington v. Cahill, supra, and Levison v. Stix, supra. The underlying principle governing all these cases is that if the contract for the year\u2019s services is made before the year begins, whether a month or a day before makes no difference, a writing is necessary. In Levison v. Stix, supra, the question was whether a hiring on December 31st for one year, to terminate on December 31st of the following year, was within the statute, and the court held that it was, observing that it was clear that the employment was not to commence until the 1st of January. An employment for a period beginning on the 31st of December and ending the 31st of December of the following year would not be an employment for a year,, but for a year and a day. So in the present case the then existing term of employment ended on March 23 d and would not expire until the end of that day. Any additional term would not begin until March 24th, and the additional year contracted for would expire, not on. March 24th, but on March 23d of the following year.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Only one point remains to be considered. The statute of frauds was not set up as a defense; but where the pleadings are oral, as they were here, it has been held that the defendant can rely upon the statute, although not pleaded. Booker v. Heffner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">GILDERSLEEVE, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b509-7\">GREENBAUM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWc\">(concurring).' Plaintiff testified that on March 33, 1907, the defendants renewed for another year their contract, which was expiring that day. It is obvious that it was not agreed that the old contract was to be deemed terminated before March 33 d, but that the new agreement of employment for one year was to begin subsequent to March 33d, a circumstance that brings the case within the statute of frauds and precludes a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">I concur in a reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
