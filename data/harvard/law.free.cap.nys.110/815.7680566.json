Where such fact does not appear, we do not think that an action of this character should be tried by a referee, but that the defendant should have the right to a jury trial of the issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, without prejudice to such action by the trial judge upon the trial as should be proper, if it shall then develop that such a large number of items are in dispute as to make a trial by jury impracticable.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">SCOTT, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
