The complaint was oral, the plaintiff declaring for goods sold and delivered. The answer was an oral general denial. On this state of proof and record the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was dismissed. A clear case entitling the plaintiff to recover was shown by the evidence, and it was error for the trial justice to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">It was not necessary that the summons or the complaint should say that the plaintiff was doing business under the name of the Williams-burgh Plumbing Supply Company. It was enough that the complaint alleged that he sold the goods, and he could make the allegation good on the trial in any way he could. There is no evidence that the company is a corporation or a partnership, and that cannot be presumed. The evidence is that the plaintiff did business under that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">The judgment should be reversed, and.a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
