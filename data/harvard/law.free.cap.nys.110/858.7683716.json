On October 24, 1906, the plaintiff and defendant made the following writing :\u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-14\">\u201cNew York, October 24, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-15\">\u201cThis will certify that Mr. Muller has paid me by check ($500) five hundred dollars this day on account of my place, known as \u2018Idler\u2019s Restaurant,'' formerly \u2018Freschman\u2019s,\u2019 next to Luna Park, for the amount of ten thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars. Three thousand ($3,000) to be paid October 27th. Balance to be agreed upon later. This sale includes open goods only used over the bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">It seems that the plaintiff paid the $500 called for by the memorandum, but never paid the $3,000. The parties never came to any agreement as to the balance of $7,250. It does appear that they met and negotiated, but their minds never came to a point on the question as to-the payment of the balance. It seems to us, then, that there was not any contract between the plaintiff and defendant. Mayer v. McCreery, 119 N. Y. 435, 23 N. E. 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">The point is made that tlj,e writing is a sufficient contract, because it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that he attempted to reach an agreement with the defendant as to the terms of the payment of the balance. But there was no sufficient proof of bad faith, even if such a principle is to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
