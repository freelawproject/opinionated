It was not returned, and at midnight on said December <em>2, </em>1907, the defendant\u2019s place was entered by burglars and said coat was stolen. Plaintiff sued for \u201cbreach of contract,\u201d and recovered a judgment for $40, the supposed v\u00e1lue of the coat, together with costs. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-19\">There is no evidence of negligence on defendant\u2019s part, so far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the burglary is concerned. The defendant, however, was guilty of .a breach of contract in failing to return the coat to plaintiff at 6 p. m., and the resulting damage of such breach of contract was the loss &lt;of the overcoat. Defendant, in failing to deliver the coat at the time specified, ran his risk of something happening to it, and must bear the -consequences. The amount of the damage allowed, however, was excessive, as the coat, which originally cost $45, was one that had been worn for one or two years, plaintiff does not know which, although it seems to have been in fairly good condition when delivered to defendant, according to plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which the court had a right to believe. See Young v. Leary, 135 N. Y. 569, 576, 577, 32 N. E. <em>607; </em>Cohen v. Moshkowitz, 17 Misc. Rep. 389, 39 N. Y. Supp. 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless plaintiff stipulates to reduce the \u25a0amount of the damages from $40 to $30, with appropriate costs in the court below, in which case the judgment, as modified, will be affirmed, \u2022without costs of appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
