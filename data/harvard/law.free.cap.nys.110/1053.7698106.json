The judgment was obtained in an action brought against the president of the association. Subsequently, after the return of execution unsatisfied, this present action was brought against four of the members of the said society, none of whom were parties to the previous action. The action was brought on a writing, signed by the president of the society, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-14\">\u201cNew York, June 5, 1905.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-15\">\u201cErste Foltichener Roum. Am. Kupp. Pay to the order of Isaac Barasch one hundred and fifteen dollars ($115) out of our treasury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1077-16\">\u201c[Signed] Abraham Donner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-17\">The instrument bore the seal of the society. The plaintiff did not prove that Donner was authorized to sign this instrument and bind the society. The plaintiff was sufficiently apprised at the trial that the defendant raised this question. Where an action is brought against the individual members of an unincorporated association, plaintiff must allege and prove, besides the original judgm\u00e9nt and the issuance and the return of execution unsatisfied, such facts as are sufficient to make out the original cause of action against the association.
