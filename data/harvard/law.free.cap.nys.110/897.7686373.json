The statute requires, in order to constitute a tenement house within the statute, that it shall be occupied by at least three families who have a common right \u201cin the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies, or some of them.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s husband rented the first southerly store and the northerly apartment in the building, the first floor thereof consisting of two stores, in the south one of which plaintiff\u2019s husband conducted a confectionery business, and next to it on the north was a dry goods store, and plaintiff lived in the apartments over the dry goods store, and defendant and his family lived over the confectionery store. There was a hall on the first floor between the two stores and stairs leading from it to the second floor, which divided the apartments of plaintiff and defendant. That part of the building occupied by plaintiff and defendant was a separate house; there being no communication between it and the dry goods store, and the occupants of that store did not use the hall or stairs. <em>Held, </em>that the statutory requirement of three families was lacking to constitute it a tenement, and there was no evidence that the families had a common right to the halls, yard, etc., except the yard, which plaintiff was permitted to use, but, even if there were three families, including the dry goods store, and they had a common right..to the yard, it did not constitute the building a tenement, as the statute required a common right in the halls, etc., or \u201csome\u201d of them, which necessitated a common right in more than one of the accessories named to constitute the building a tenement, and hence defendant was not liable for injuries resulting to an occupant from his failure to light the halls as required by statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b921-14\">[Ed.

These are the entire provisions of the lease having any materiality to the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ_\">The ground .floor of the building consisted of two and possibly three stores or places of business, in the south one of which the plaintiff\u2019s husband conducted a confectionery and ice cream business. The next one to the north was occupied as a dry goods store by one Leveridge, who used the rear part as a residence for himself and family. The north one was used as a printing shop; but whether . attached to or detached from the other two stores does not appear. That portion of the second floor over, the dry goods store was occupied by the plaintiff and her husband as a dwelling, and that over the confectionery store by the defendant and his family for living purposes. The second story does not appear to have extended over the printing shop, nor are any other persons shown to have occupied any part of the building. There was a hall on the first floor, between the middle arid south stores, leading to the street, on the north side of which a stairway led to a hall in the second story between and dividing the- apartments occupied by the plaintiff and her husband on the north side and the defendant and his family on the south side. There was .a banister rail on the south side of the stairs. There was no communication at the time of the accident, and had not been for some time prior thereto, between the hallway on the first floor and any part of the building, except the store on the first floor and rooms on the second occupied by the plaintiff and her husband, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>rooms on the second floor occupied by the defendant and his family. There was a gas jet in the lower hall at the foot of the stairs, which was connected with the meter used by the plaintiff\u2019s husband. The defendant\u2019s daughters used a bicycle, and it had been left occasionally in the lower hall. .It does not appear that it remained there for any length of time, or that it was ever seen in the hall except in the daytime. The testimony of the plaintiff tends to show that it was kept upstairs nights and brought down when it was desired to use it\u2014sometimes in the morning and at others late in the afternoon. On one occasion, it does not appear when, after the plaintiff\u2019s husband had made a complaint, he overheard one of defendant\u2019s daughters say to her father: \u201cMr. Aldrich wants to have that wheel taken out of the hall before somebody gets hurt.\u201d On the evening of September 7, 1904, at 7:30 o\u2019clock, the plaintiff passed through the lower hall and observed a bicycle resting against the wall on the south side, away from the stairway. She went to her rooms above, where she remained for a time, and during her absence some one moved it from the position it had occupied when plaintiff passed through the lower hall and placed it upon the stairs. At about 8 o\u2019clock the plaintiff in passing down the stairs to the lower floor came in contact with the bicycle , and was thrown down, receiving the serious injuries complained of. Both halls were unlighted and dark. There is no evidence that either of them had been lighted by the defendant at any time. The evidence does not even suggest that the defendant was in any manner responsible for the presence of the bicycle upon the stairs. It is not shown that it was the same bicycle that was in the lower hall when the plaintiff went upstairs, or that it was owned by any member of the defendant\u2019s family. There is no evidence that, after the defendant had been advised of the request of Mr. Aldrich that the wheel owned by his daughter should be kept out of the lower hall, it was not; no proof that it was ever in the lower hall thereafter. Neither the bicycle causing plaintiff\u2019s fall nor its location upon the stairs is in any manner connected with the defendant or any member of his family. The evidence does not establish a common-law liability of the defendant, and the trial court was justified in refusing to permit plaintiff to go to the jury upon that theory. Gorman v. White, 19 App. Div. 324, 46 N. Y. Supp. 1; Hilsenbeck v. Guhring, 131 N. Y. 674, 30 N. E. 580; Brugher v. Buchtenkirch, 167 N. Y. 153, 60 N. E. 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The evidence was not sufficient to 'have warranted the jury in finding that the' defendant\u2019s building was a \u201ctenement house\u201d within the meaning of the statute. That portion of the building occupied by the families of the plaintiff and defendant was an entire and separate house. Between it and the adjoining store, occupied by Beveridge, there was no interior communication and no common entrance or exit. Beveridge did not use the hall or stairs used by plaintiff and defendant, and had no rights therein or in any part of the premises occupied by them, nor had they or-either of them any rights in the store occupied by him, so that the first statutory essential of three families in one house is lacking. .. There is no evidence showing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>common right of these three families in the \u201challs, stairways, yards, water-closets, or privies\u201d of or connected with the building. The only accessory named in the statute which could be claimed to have established a basis for a recovery is the yard which it is contended was used in common by the three families. for drying clothes. The lease to the plaintiff\u2019s husband does not give any right to the lessee therein. .It purports to lease only the southerly store and northerly apartment. That his family were permitted to use the yard does not create or establish the \u201ccommon right\u201d required by the statute. The defendant had no access to the yard except through the premises of his tenants, and it is not shown that he reserved this or had any right to it. At the time of the accident and for some time prior thereto defendant is not shown to have used the yard. The testimony as to any use of it by .him or his family is limited tq the space above the ground forming the yard, over which a clothes line passed from his rooms in the second story to a pole in the back part of the yard upon which clothes were run out and dried. But, conceding that the three families did have a common right in the yard within the meaning of the statute, it would not avail the plaintiff, because it is evident from the language employed by the Legislature that a common right in one of the accessories is not sufficient to constitute the building with which it is connected a tenement house. The statute requires a common right by at least three families occupying the building \u201cin the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets or privies, or some of them.\u201d It cannot be held that the Legislature intended that a common right in one of the accessories should be supposed; otherwise it would have said so. It is apparent that the word \u201csome\u201d was not intended to be synonymous with \u201cany,\u201d and requires a common right by at least three families living in a building in more than one of the accessories named to bring such building within the statutory definition of a \u201ctenement house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The evidence was insufficient to sustain a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and the learned trial court was not bound to submit any question of fact to the jury. The exceptions do not present reversible error, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
