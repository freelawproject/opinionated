The complaint sets forth a cause of action in the most general language, from which it is impossible to ascertain the nature of the employment of the decedent, the manner of his death, or the negligent acts complained of. It alleges that on or about August 3, 1906, while plaintiff\u2019s intestate, was in defendant\u2019s employ on defendant\u2019s contracting operation at Thirty-Ninth street and First avenue, New York City, Manhattan, he :was caused to fall and sustain injuries resulting in his death; \u201cthat said injuries and death were caused without any negligence on the part of this plaintiff\u2019s intestate in any wise contributing thereto, but solely by the defendants\u2019 negligence, in that as deceased\u2019s master they failed to furnish him with a reasonably safe place to work, and failed to reasonably safeguard, inspect, and keep safe the place, appliances, and apparatus with which deceased was obliged to work, and failed to furnish him with reasonably safe appliances, apparatus, works, and machinery with which to do his work, and-failed to furnish him with competent foremen and co-workmen to guide, direct, and assist him in the performance of his work, and failed to formulate, promulgate, and enforce proper rules and regulations for his safety and that of his co-employ\u00e9s, as a result of which he was caused to fall and be injured and killed, as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In substance, the complaint alleges that decedent, while in the employ of the defendant, fell and was killed by reason of defendants\u2019 negligence. So far as informing the defendant of what it would be required to meet upon the trial, it might as well have been a piece of blank paper. A case could hardly be presented in which the propriety and necessity of a bill of particulars was more obvious. That the plaintiff is an administratrix is no answer. The case was on the day calendar when the motion was made. To recover she must prove her claim. Being upon the day calendar, she must be presumed to be ready to prove her claim, and it is the details of her claim, the particulars of which are aslced. As said many times, the object of a bill of particulars is to amplify the pleading, to define the issues, and to limit the proof, to make certain that which is uncertain, and to apprise the defendant of what he is required to meet. The learned court in denying the motion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\u201cThe facts sought to be discovered by the proposed bill of particulars are within the knowledge of the defendant\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">This is not a ground for the denial of the motion. Dwyer v. Slattery, 118 App. Div. 345, 103 N. Y. Supp. 433. This court has so frequently expressed its views upon the subject of bills of particulars in like cases that there should be no doubt in the profession as to the rule bearing upon the subject. Causullo v. Lenox Construction Co., 106 App. Div. 575, 94 N. Y. Supp. 639; Waller v. Degnon Contract<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ing Co., 120 App. Div. 389, 105 N. Y. Supp. 203; Kinsella v. Riesenberg, 124 App. Div. 322, 108 N. Y. Supp. 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The order - appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
