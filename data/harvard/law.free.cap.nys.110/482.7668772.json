The plaintiff seeks to support the judgment rendered in his favor by arguing that the trial justice reserved decision on the point of admitting the exhibit, and that his subsequent decision in favor of the plaintiff necessarily meant that he had changed his ruling and admitted it. There is nothing on the record to show that such was the situation. On the contrary, the exclusion appears to have been absolute and unconditional. That the plaintiff\u2019s attorney so regare -d it is evident from what he said upon the trial when he rested his case, and from the fact that in his brief on this appeal he excuses or accounts for his failure to put in certain further proof necessary to his case by saying that, as the agreement was not admitted, evidence of certain acts of performance thereunder on the part of the plaintiff were not admitted. When decision is reserved Upon the question of admitting particular evidence, it is manifest that a distinct announcement to that effect should be made, in. order that both sides may introduce whatever proof is necessary in anticipation of an ultimate ruling ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ther way upon the question left undetermined.

It is difficult to reconcile a ren-. dition of judgment in plaintiff\u2019s behalf with the exclusion in evidence of the agreement which lies at the foundation of this action. It affirmatively appears from the papers submitted upon this appeal that an unsuccessful effort was made upon the settlement of the case on appeal to have it show that the agreement in question had been admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
