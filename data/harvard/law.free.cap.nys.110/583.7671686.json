The complaint' alleges substantial performance. The plaintiff had judgment. The contract price was $3,100. There has been allowed to the defendant $314 for work which the plaintiff has not performed, in order to complete the contract. This is more than 10 per cent, of the contract price. Waiver of substantial performance is neither pleaded in the complaint nor proved by any satisfactory evidence. Under ordinary circumstances, and these in the record are not extraordinary, a failure to perform 10 per cent, of the contract price will not admit of the claim of substantial performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">\u2022 The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Judgment reversed on the law and facts, and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs.

While in an action to recover the amount alleged to be due on a building contract, on a complaint alleging performance of the contract, omissions or defects so trifling as to come under the maxim that the law does not regard trifles will be disregarded, and also deductions may be made from the contract price for minor omissions or defects which occurred inadvertently and in good faith and do not come under the class of trifles but .are substantial, instead of judgment being given for the defendant,- that is not the case before us. In the performance of such contracts such omissions or defects may so occur in the multitude of details. But on the other hand, there are cases where the omissions or defects are so substantial and material as to require in and of themselves a conclusion as matter of law that the contract was not substantially performed, or where the same conclusion may be required by minor substantial defects which, though not large and substantial enough to show willful and intentional omission in and of themselves, were nevertheless willful and intentional as matter of fact. Van Orden v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>MacRae, 121 App. Div. 143, 105 N. Y. Supp. 600. As the jury were charged in the present case, it appeared on the testimony for the plaintiffs that there were 36 fire escape ladders, and also 8 iron bar cellar grates or doors, not supplied and put in, all of the value of $314 at least. It was error to leave to the jury to find that these omissions were not substantial; and the finding of fact to that effect after the verdict of the jury, which was rendered on framed issues, came back to the equity part was also erroneous. The contention made for the plaintiffs here that the defendant prevented him from doing the omitted work is without any foundation in the evidence. There were also other omissions so substantial that they must be deemed willful and intentional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
