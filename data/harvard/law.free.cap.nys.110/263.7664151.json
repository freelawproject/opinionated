The plaintiff testified that the value of the dress' when she left it with the defendant was \u201cabout $50,\u201d that she paid \u201csomewhere in that neighborhood for it,\u201d that it was a summer dress, and that it was of no value to her at the time of the trial. This was the entire proof on the subject. The plaintiff failed to show when or where she bought the dress, the nature of the material composing it, the kind of dress, and the trimmings of the same, and whether it was old or new, or even what it cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
