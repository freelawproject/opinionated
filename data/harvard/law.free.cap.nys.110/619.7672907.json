Execution was issued upon such judgment and returned unsatisfied. The time within which the plaintiff might have appealed has expired, and no appeal has been perfected. The respondent was beneficially interested in the cause of action, which was prosecuted solely for his benefit. The plaintiff is insolvent, and the costs have not been paid. These facts are not controverted, and the appellant was entitled to the relief prayed for. Section 3247, \u25a0Code Civ. Proc.; Ward v. Roy, 69 N. Y. 96; Droege v. Baxter, 77 App. Div. 78, 79 N. Y. Supp. 29; Slauson v. Watkins, 95 N. Y. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We are not impressed with the contention that the order was discretionary, and that the learned justice at Special Term exercised this discretion properly. The liability of the person beneficially interested for costs is absolute, and to the same extent as if he was the plaintiff (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3247), and the court is without discretion to deprive him of this absolute statutory right. Although the language of the section is that, where costs are awarded against the plaintiff, \u201cthe court may, by order, direct the person so liable to pay them,\u201d we think, under the rules of law, that, where a statute directs the doing \u25a0of a thing for the sake of justice, the word \u201cmay\u201d means the same thing as the word \u201cshall\u201d (People ex rel. Otsego County Bank v. Board of Supervisors of Otsego County, 51 N. Y. 401), and that, if it is obvious that the Legislature intended to impose a positive duty, the language used has an imperative signification, and is to be so construed (Livingston v. Tanner, 14 N. Y. 64), and the rule declared in Wuesthoff v. Germania Life Ins. Co., 107 N. Y. 580, 14 N. E. 811, \u2022that \u201cthe intention of the Legislature is the cardinal consideration in the construction of statutes, and whether a particular provision is mandatory or directory is to be determined from the language used and the purpose in view,\u201d the provision of the Code under consideration is mandatory. Absolute liability of the beneficially interested person for costs being created, it becomes the duty of the court' to enforce such liability by granting the order intended to accomplish such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The order must be reversed, with costs, and the motion granted, &lt;with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
