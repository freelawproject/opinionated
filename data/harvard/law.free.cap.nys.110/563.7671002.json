The return shows that \u201cjudgment for the plaintiff against defendants, verified complaint defendants appearing, and on motion their answer having been stricken out as sham.\u201d The plaintiff complains:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201c(1) That on the 16th day of June, 1907, one Mount Morris Construction Company, a domestic corporation, duly made, executed, and delivered to the plaintiff, for value, its negotiable promissory note, in writing, dated the said 16th day of June, 1907, and thereby promised to pay to the plaintiff, at the Union Bank of Brooklyn, Merchants\u2019 Branch, the sum of $202, two months after the said date. (2) That prior to the delivery of the said note, and for the purpose of lending credit to the same, and to induce the plaintiff to accept and receive the said note in payment from the said Mount Morris Construction Company for moneys then due by said company to the plaintiff, the said defendants Jacob Grant and Jacob A. Rappaport duly indorsed the said note, and, after such indorsement by said defendants, the same was delivered to the plaintiff. (3) That at maturity the said note was duly presented for payment at the place therein designated, but the same was not paid, of all of which due notice was given to the defendants, the indorsers. (4) That upon the nonpayment of said note at maturity the same was duly protested by Walter D. C. Boggs, a notary public, at a cost of $1.50, which ' same is a fair and reasonable charge therefor, and that due notice of such nonpayment and protest was given by said notary public to the defendants herein. (5) That the plaintiff has duly demanded of the defendants the payment of the said note, and that the same has not been paid. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against the defendants and each of them for the said sum of $203.50\u2014the amount of said note with protest fees\u2014together with interest from the 16th day of August, 1907, together with the costs and disbursements of this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The defendants\u2019 answer, with verification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201cFirst. Deny each and every allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint contained, except as hereinafter specifically admitted. Second. Alleges that any indorsement by the. defendants of any note, such as is alleged and set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint herein, if made by the defendants, was made without any value or consideration therefor. Therefore the defendants demand that the -plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed, with costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The second subdivision of the answer is vicious because it is hypothetical. Bliss on Code Pleading, \u00a7 317; 1 Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, p. 845. The remedy is by motion to strike out. Bliss, supra, notes. The first subdivision is good pleading. Griffin v. Long Island Railroad Co., 101 N. Y. 348, 4 N. E. 740. Pittenger v. S. T. Masonic Relief Ass\u2019n, 15 App. Div. 26, 44 N. Y. Supp. 124. \u201cA good denial is' not vitiated by adding a contingent or hypothetical avoidance of the matter already denied.\u201d 1 Abbott\u2019s .Forms of Pleading, p. 1502, .citing Everitt v. Conklin, 90 N. Y. 645. Even if the second paragraph be considered as good pleading, it certainly does not admit all allegations of the complaint which the plaintiff was bound to establish by testimony. The court could not strike out- this answer as sham. Thompson v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Erie Railway Company, 45 N. Y. 468; Wayland v. Tysen, Id. 281; Schlesinger v. Wise, 106 App. Div. 587, 94 N. Y. Supp. 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial is ordered, costs to \u25a0abide the event. All concur. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
