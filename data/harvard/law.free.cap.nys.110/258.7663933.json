The trunk was never delivered. Defendant claims he could not get the trunk at the Pennsylvania depot, and that he returned the check to plaintiff. This is denied by plaintiff, who is corroborated essentially by a disinterested witness as to admissions of defendant\u2019s driver that he got the trunk from the depot. The defendant was asked if he did not tell plaintiff that his man would swear that he got the trunk and delivered it, and he replied: \u201cI might have said so.\u201d Defendant\u2019s -book showed.that the trunk was marked \u201cdelivered,\u201d and defendant\u2019s testimony trying to identify plaintiff as the person to whom he claims to have returned a check is not convincing, nor can his driver state if it was plaintiff\u2019s trunk or another trunk that he could not get at the Pennsylvania depot. There is no question as to the nondelivery of the trunk; and it seems to us that the judgment in favor of the defendant is against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
