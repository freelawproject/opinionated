Defendants sought to recover witnesses\u2019 fees for the term, and showed an oral arrangement with plaintiff for the trial of the action at that term, if it could be done. It was not shown that plaintiff\u2019s counsel knew that on the call of the calendar, the cause was set down for trial for a designated date, or that he acquiesced therein.

The present plaintiff was substituted by an order entered May 7, 1907. Such order further provided for the service on the defendants within 10 days of a supplemental summons and complaint, and that the defendants might then plead as they might be advised. On the same day service was made on the defendants of such supplemental summons and complaint. No pleading was interposed by the defendant Julia Jarvis. The defendants Wallace Kathan and Caroline Kathan served answers, respectively, on May 24th and May 25th. The cause was placed on the calendar for the Saratoga Trial Term beginning May 20th. On the call of the calendar it was set down for trial for May 23d. The respondents Wallace Kathan and Caroline Kathan subpoenaed witnesses, and on May 24th the cause was reached for trial, when, on application of the plaintiff, it was ordered over the term on the ground that it was not at issue and improperly on the calendar. At the Trial Term in October, 1907, the cause was dismissed with costs, the plaintiff not being in readiness for trial. Costs were taxed by the respondents, including a term fee for the said May term and witnesses\u2019 fees amounting to $68.26 for said term. There was also taxed an item of $16.10 for the fees of Jacob I. Gotthelf as a witness for the October term; the appellant claiming in opposition thereto that he' was an attorney and counselor at law, and that he did not attend said term in the capacity of a witness. The Special Term disallowed certain items taxed by the county clerk, but allowed the items above mentioned.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b919-10\">Argued before SMITH, P.

Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3251. Unless there is something in the case.to take it out of the general rule, it was clearly improper to tax a term fee or witnesses\u2019 fees for that term. The respondents seek to, avoid the application of such general rule because of an understanding with counsel for plaintiff, to the effect that the cause would be placed in readiness for trial and tried at the May term, and that, relying .on such understanding, they prepared for trial and subpoenaed witnesses for said term. Counsel for plaintiff says in an affidavit that a conversation was had before the order of substitution was made, in which conversation it was stated-:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-14\">\u201cThat if they could get an order of substitution, and the new pleadings ready and both parties be able to get ready for trial, that a trial at said May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>term would be agreeable to both, but it was further distinctly stated and understood between said parties that neither party would be understood as putting himself in a position to be forced to trial, or of promising to try said case at said term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">No agreement in writing was made as required by Supreme Court rule 11, and this controversy resulting from such alleged oral agreement which may more properly be called an oral disagreement demonstrates the wisdom of the rule requiring agreements of attorneys to be reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">I do not think, however, from the version of the negotiations as given by the respondents\u2019 counsel that the latter was entirely blameless in incurring these disbursements for the May term. It frequently happens that counsel on different sides of a cause indulge in expressions of a desire to dispose of such cause at an approaching term of the court, and of an intention to do so if possible. I cannot discover from the affidavit of respondents\u2019 counsel that counsel for the appellant did anything more. That affidavit states that several conversations took place \u201cand that it was talked and agreed * * * that the action should be tried at said term of court held in Saratoga county on the 20th day of May, 1907, if it could be done, and that said defendants Kathans\u2019 answers to said supplemental complaint might be served at any time before their time to answer had expired after the service of said supplemental complaint and the cause was set down for trial on the call of the calendar of said court on the opening day thereof for the 23d day of May, 1907.\u201d Here was no unqualified agreement to try the case at said term. It does not clearly appear that plaintiff\u2019s counsel knew that on the call of the calendar the cause was set down for trial for the 23 d of May, or that he acquiesced therein. The order for the substitution of the plaintiff had been opposed by the respondents. At least twice before the May term plaintiff\u2019s counsel had requested the service of respondents\u2019 answers, but they had not been served when the cause was actually reached for trial. There was therefore nothing to try. Respondents took the unusual and irregular course of preparing for trial and subpoenaing their witnesses before serving their answers. Until an issue was formed, there was no occasion for witnesses. The respondents certainly cannot complain of plaintiff for not trying the case, when, because of their own delay and negligence, it was not in readiness for trial. They should also have known that, even if they had promptly served their answers, the cause nevertheless could not have been tried until the other defendants had either pleaded or were in default. I think the respondents should attribute their unnecessary expenditure of witnesses\u2019 fees to their own looseness of practice, rather .than to the unfairness or duplicity of opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The fees of the witness Gotthelf for the October term were properly taxed, although he was an attorney at law and rendered services for the respondents in connection with the cause. The services were of such a nature as might have been performed by one not an attorney, and he did not sustain the relation of attorney or counsel to the action within the meaning of section 3288 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>The order should be modified so as to disallow the term and witnesses\u2019 fees for the May, 1907, term, and, as thus modified, affirmed so far as appealed from without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
