The case was tried before the court and a jury, and a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Upon the examination of the jury previous to the commencement of the trial, the following episode occurred, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-8\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Attorney (examining jury): Are you Insured against accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-9\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I object, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-10\">\u201cThe Court: Objection sustained. He may ask if they are stockholders or interested in any insurance company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-12\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Counsel: I ask for a mistrial, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-13\">\u201c(Motion denied. Exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">The minutes then go on to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-15\">\u201cThe jury, being satisfactory to both sides, was duly impaneled and sworn, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney opened the case to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">Eater on in the case defendant says that he is \u201cperfectly satisfied to go to the jury.\u201d There is no error in the above ruling. This line of questioning was not pursued by plaintiff, and defendant was not prejudiced to the extent of warranting the court in granting the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">The plaintiff, however, has not maintained the burden of proving her freedom from contributory negligence. The wagon was going on Fourth avenue, close to the curb, and was so close to the place where plaintiff started to cross that she had stepped less than two feet onto the street when she was struck. The uncontradicted evidence is that the wagon was going slowly, the horses being on a walk, so that plaintiff must have stepped right into danger, and if she looked, as she says she did, she must have seen the wagon coming.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-18\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
