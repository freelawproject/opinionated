The landlord\u2019s manager denied having such an understanding with the tenant regarding the running of the elevator, and the landlord adduced testimony to the effect that the elevator had during the period in question stopped running on two instead of three occasions, as testified to by the tenant\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"Aya0\">There was also a conflict of testimony as to the length of time the elevator ceased to run on such occasions. The tenant claimed that the operation of the elevator had been unnecessarily stopped, while the landlord insisted, on the other hand, that it was closed down for public safety. Although there was, as seen, a conflict of testimony upon all three propositions, the trial justice, notwithstanding the tenant\u2019s request to go to the jury upon the question \u201cwhether or not the elevator was out of order and repair on three different occasions for a period longer than it was necessary to put it in a state of good repair,\u201d directed a verdict in the landlord\u2019s favor for $60. The tenant duly excepted. We think that under the circumstances the questions whether the elevator was to be operated during the day and night as claimed by the tenant, and whether its operation had been stopped for repairs an unreasonable length of time, were ones of fact, to be determined by the jury (Ardsley Hall Co. v. Sirrett [Sup.] 86 N. Y. Supp. 792), and that it was error for the trial justice to withhold such questions from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The judgment should therefore be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
