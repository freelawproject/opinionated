Upon the trial the plaintiff attempted to prove that he had a cause of action in the original case which the defendant had undertaken to prosecute for him, and but for the defendant\u2019s negligence would have recovered a judgment therein for a substantial amount. The trial court excluded the evidence offered to sustain that contention, and dismissed the complaint, stating, \u201cthe principal ground on which the motion is granted being that the court did not deem it proper to try in this action the issues of the claim of Lamprecht v. Mohr or the estate\u201d\u2014and directed the exceptions to be heard in the first instance at the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In Quinn v. Van Pelt, 56 N. Y. 417, Rapallo, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201cIn such an action the onus is upon the plaintiff to prove the breach of agreement and the amount of damages sustained by reason thereof, and that she can recover only the damages thus proved. * * * The measure of damages is not the amount of the fee which he received. The damages may be more or less than the amount of the fee, and the burden rests upon the plaintiff to prove them, and not upon the defendant to prove how much of a stipulated fee he actually earned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In Vooth v. McEachen, 181 N. Y. 28, 73 N. E. 488, the trial court had charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201cWhen negligence has been proved, if you find there was any, in consequence of which a client has lost his case, it is not incumbent upon the client to show that but for the negligence he would have succeeded in that action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The Court of Appeals reversed because of this charge, and, citing text-books and cases, held that the damages recoverable are those shown to exist, and that the burden of showing the amount of damage suffered rests upon the plaintiff. The plaintiff, therefore, being required to show the actual damage suffered, was deprived of the opportunity to do so by the exclusion of the only evidence available for that purpose. Such exclusion was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">It follows, therefore, that the exceptions should be sustained and a new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
