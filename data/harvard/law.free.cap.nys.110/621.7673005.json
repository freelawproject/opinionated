The mandate of the section of the Municipal Court act is plain that all of the proceedings must be returned, and substantially all is not all. Returns in this language are not unlmown to this court, and, if they are persisted in, the court will not hesitate to dismiss appeals where they appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">This appeal should be dismissed, unless within 10 days the appellant causes to be filed in this court a return which conforms with the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Appeal dismissed, with costs, unless within 10 days the appellant causes-to be filed in this court a return which conforms to section 317 of the Municipal Court act.
