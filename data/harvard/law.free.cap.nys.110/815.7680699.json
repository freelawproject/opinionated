The injury complained of resulted from the collapse of a temporary foot bridge at the corner of Eighteenth street and Fifth avenue, in the city of New York, and the facts do not differ substantially from those shown in Parks v. City of New York, 111 App. Div. 836, 98 N. Y. Supp. 94; Id;, 187 N. Y. 555, 80 N. E. 1115. There is, therefore, no doubt as to the defendant\u2019s liability, and the only question involved in the appeal is as to the amount of the damages recovered.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The plaintiff suffered a Potts fracture of one ankle, for which it was conceded that she is entitled to recover. She claims, however, to be entitled also to recover for internal injuries, which in time necessitated a serious surgical operation. That she did submit to such operation is unquestioned; but we consider that the evidence, and especially the weight of the expert medical testimony, is heavily against' the plaintiff\u2019s claim that her internal ailments, which rendered the operation-necessary, resulted from the accident of which she complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">It follows that the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event, unless the respondent stipulates to reduce the verdict to $3,000, in which case the judgment, as thus reduced, will be affirmed, without costs in this court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
