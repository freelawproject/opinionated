Section 355 of the city charter (Laws 1901, p. 154, c. 466) provides that any member of the police force who has served for 20 years (which is the case of the plaintiff) shall \u201cbe relieved and dismissed from said force and service and placed on the roll of the police pension fund\u201d by the police commissioner, \u201cupon a certificate of so many of the police surgeons as the police commissioner may require,\u201d showing that he \u201cis permanently disabled, physically or mentally so as to be unfit for duty.\u201d The certificate of the surgeons on which the relator was retired complies with this. But section 357 varies, and, it may be, enlarges, the phraseology. It provides that no member of the force shall be granted or paid a pension \u201con account of physical or mental disability or disease\u201d except on such a certificate \u201cwhich shall set forth the cause, nature and extent of the disability, disease or injury.\u201d Even here the phraseology varies. An unscientific and bungling statute cannot be construed and interpreted by the same strict scientific rules as a consistent and scientific statute. It is claimed that the certificate does not certify the \u201ccause\u201d of the disability. It certifies in so many words that defective vision is the cause of the disability ; but the argument for the relator treats the defective vision as the disability, instead of the cause thereof, and then urges that the \u201ccause\u201d of the defective vision is what the statute requires, whereas the certificate does not give it. Our language is hardly flexible enough to express the whole argument on this head. The plain fact of the matter is that the certificate certifies that the relator is disabled, and that such disability is caused by defective vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The order should be reversed, and the application denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Order reversed, without costs, and application denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
