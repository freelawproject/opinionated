And then follows this allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">\u201cAnd the plaintiff alleges that the defendants and each of them permitted said premises to become out of repair, and to remain out of repair and to be in a dangerous condition; and said shutter was weak and unfastened and not secure and the defendants knew the same to be in a dangerous and negligent condition, or should have known of the same had the defendants inspected the same, and said shutter or blind had been out of condition for a long time prior to the happening of said accident\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It is hard to deal with this bungle of words. The general allegations that the defendants permitted the house to \u201cbecome out of repair,\u201d etc., have to be disregarded, for we have nothing to do with any part of the house except the blind. All there is alleged of it is that it was \u201cweak and unfastened and not secure.\u201d There is no allegation that that was by the defendants\u2019 negligence. It may have been by the negligence of no one, or by that of the tenant. Possession by the defendants is not alleged, but only ownership. True, it is then alleged the defendants knew it to be in a \u201cdangerous and negligent condition,\u201d or \u201cshould have known of the same had the defendants inspected the same.\u201d This is not an allegation that they knew of it, nor is there any allegation that they had any duty to inspect and neglected it. Then follows the mild and empty allegation that the blind \u201chad been out of condition\u201d for a long time. What does \u201cout of condition\u201d mean? Are the courts to construe it as meaning some dangerous condition? And if they could so construe it the difficulty would remain, for lack of an allegation that it was caused or existed by the negligence of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Instead of simply alleging that the blind fell by the negligence of the defendants in failing to have it safely fastened to the building (which would be scientific pleading and all that was necessary), the learned pleader resorted to all this verbiage, which falls short of that one simple and essential allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">RICH, J., concurs. JENKS and MILLER, JJ., concur in result. HOOKER, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
