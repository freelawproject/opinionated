Lease made by former owner to defendant was from June 15, 1906, to September 30, 1907; rent payable in monthly payments of $60 each, on 1st of month during term, in advance.

Checks about 1st of June, July, August, and September corroborate this. Defendant admits he owes Kilpatrick, former owner, for one half month\u2019s rent for November, 1906, and which he withheld because of dispute.
