There was no understanding between plaintiff and defendant for any lease, and at most plaintiff did not object to defendant\u2019s occupancy of the premises. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff could recover only on a claim for use and occupation notwithstanding the rule that, where a tenant enters into occupation under a void lease, the provisions thereof regulate the terms of the tenancy, except as to the duration thereof.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-12\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Sixth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-13\">Action by Louise Eink against the Standard Bread Company.

The agreement with plaintiff\u2019s husband related to his acquisition of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>interest in defendant\u2019s business, and the legal effect of the provision as to leasing which was incidental to the main purpose of the agreement, need not now be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">It seems to me that this case radically differs from such cases' as Laughran v. Smith, 75 N. Y. 205, 209, and Coudert v. Cohn, 118 N. Y. 309, 312, 23 N. E. 298, 7 L. R. A. 69, 16 Am. St. Rep. 761, relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent, in which the doctrine is recognized that, where the tenant enters into occupancy of premises under a void lease, its provisions will nevertheless regulate \u201cthe terms on which the tenancy subsists in all respects, except as to the duration of the term,\u201d for the reason that in those cases the tenant\u2019s occupancy was under a supposedly valid lease between the parties, whereas here there is a total absence of proof of any understanding for any lease between plaintiff and defendant. At most, one may indulge in the assumption that plaintiff did not object to the defendant\u2019s occupancy of the premises, in view of her husband\u2019s agreement with the defendant. The right to a recovery would therefore not rest upon an implied agreement of a leasing from month to month or from year to year, but upon a claim for use and occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
