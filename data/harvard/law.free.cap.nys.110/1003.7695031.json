They had to be upon the track of the defendant, and by it, to do the work. As the plaintiff was bent down putting a plank in position by the rails a car of the defendant came up behind and hit him. He was right by the defendant\u2019s track. Befdre he bent down he saw the defendant\u2019s car coming about 150 feet away. He was nonsuited for contributory negligence. That was for the jury. Men often have to work on car tracks, and with cars passing at frequent intervals they have to do the best they can to avoid danger and yet do the work. The plaintiff may well have supposed that with the car so far away he could safely stay awhile yet, especially as the car was required by law to stop before crossing the tracks of the steam road.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. Ail concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
