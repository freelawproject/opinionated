He was working on the. basement floor laying brick in a bay window at the front of the building. The defendant was a contractor engaged in laying concrete floors upon an upper story. The story upon which defendants\u2019 men were working was boarded over, but the boarding did not extend over the bay window in which plaintiff was working. In putting in the concrete flooring defendant used short pieces of iron, described in the case as \u201cchannel irons,\u201d which were laid between the iron beams, and with these beams made a sort of webbing to hold the concrete. While the plaintiff was at work a piece of iron fell, striking him upon the head and producing the injuries for which he sues. There was some confusion in the testimony as to the precise character and dimensions of the piece of iron which struck plaintiff; but there was testimony from which the jury would have been justified .in finding that it was a piece <em>ii </em>the channel iron used by defendant in the prosecution of its work/ There were other contractors at work on the building ; but the evidence was to the effect that none of them used pieces of iron similar to tffat'by which plaintiff was struck. There can be no doubt that the defendant was bound to exercise a reasonable degree of care to see that other persons working in the building were not injured by the fall of materials used in the prosecution of the work; and, if the evidence, was sufficient to identify the iron which struck plaintiff with that used by defendant, the burden would fall upon de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>fendant to show that it had not been negligent. Wolf v. Am. Tract Soc., 164 N. Y. 30, 58 N. E. 31, 51 E. R. A. 241. In pur opinion there was evidence to submit to the jury upon the question whether or not it was a piece of defendants\u2019 iron which struck plaintiff. If there was, it was error to dismiss the complaint.Y</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">EAUGHLIN and CLARKE, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">INGRAHAM, J.
