Defendant by its answer denied that it had made the threats, and then, as an affirmative defense, alleged that the displaying of such signs or advertisem\u00e9nts was in violation of an ordinance of the city, which was set forth. The court found that the displaying of such signs or advertisements was in violation of the ordinance, and that the same was not a necessary incident of plaintiff\u2019s business, and was an ultra vires act, for which reason it refused to grant the injunction and dismissed the complaint on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-20\">The complaint .was properly dismissed, and the judgment would be affirmed without opinion, were it not for the fact that we do not concur in the reasons assigned by the learned justice at Special Term for making this disposition of the case. From the facts proved, and the findings made, a case is not presented to a court of equity which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>\u25a0calls for the exercise of its powers. This court held, in Eden Musee Am. Co., Ltd., v. Bingham, as Police Com\u2019r (decided at the April Term, not yet officially reported) 110 N. Y. Supp. 210, that a court of equity would not exercise its jurisdiction to prevent a police officer from arresting, a person for the performance of an act which was not i crime. Much less, then, will it by injunction interfere to prevent a person or municipal corporation from doing an alleged illegal act, especially when it is apparent that such act, if committed, will not do the party complaining an irreparable injury, or such as may not be compensated in an action at law. A court of equity has great power; but it has only recently been supposed that such power would be exercised in every case, at the mere suggestion of a party, to prevent a real or imaginary wrong. If any person, by the use of force, destroys the plaintiff\u2019s coaches, or interferes with the signs or advertisements \u25a0on their exterior, then, if the plaintiff is legally entitled to display such \u25a0signs or advertisements, such person can be arrested and punished under the criminal laws of the state, and an action can also be maintained against the party committing such acts to recover the damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">z The plaintiff, under its charter, has a right to operate its stage line along the avenue in question, and whether or not it can, as an incident to that right, display signs or advertisements on the exterior of its coaches, must be determined when the question actually arises, and not, as here, upon a supposed case which has for its foundation a mere threat which may never be carried into effect. The plaintiff is incorporated under the statutes of the state, and if it be true, as asserted, that it is exceeding its corporate powers, this would seem to be a concern of the state, and not of the city, and it is difficult to imagine how the city can be legally justified in interfering upon this ground. The city undoubtedly, by ordinance, can regulate the traffic upon its streets; but it may not be out of place to suggest that the displaying of the signs or advertisements in question does not violate the ordinance set out in the defendant\u2019s answer and proved upon the trial. That ordinance reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-6\">\u201cNo advertising trucks, vans or wagons shall be allowed in the streets of the borough of Manhattan under a penalty of ten dollars for each offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the putting of business notices upon ordinary business wagons so long as such wagons are engaged in the usual business or work of the owner and not used merely or\" mainly for advertising.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s vehicles are engaged in its usual business, which is the transportation of passengers, and the same are not used \u201cmerely\u201d' \u25a0or \u201cmainly\u201d for advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">INGRAHAM, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1062-10\">SCOTT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbB\">I concur in the affirmance of this judgment on the grounds stated by Mr. Justice McLAUGHLIN, and upon the further ground that the plaintiff has no right or authority to use its stages for the purpose of advertising any other business than that which it conducts itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">CLARKE and HOUGHTON, JJ., concur with SCOTT, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
