The notice of lien recites that the \u201cagreed price or value\u201d of the labor performed and materials furnished is $1,175. The validity of the lien cannot be upheld, since this statement in the disjunctive is not in compliance with the law. Siegel v. Ehrshowsky, 46 Misc. Rep. 605, 92 N. Y. Supp. 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Further\u25a0 the complaint alleges that the labor was performed and' materials furnished at the request of the defendant. The proof fails-to support this allegation, but shows that the contract was made with one Thomas Costello, the defendant\u2019s husband, as contractor. \u2022 The notice of lien states that the name of the person with whom plaintiff\u2019s contract was made was Thomas F. Costello. The contractor is' not joined as a party, and the complaint contains no allegation that any sum was actually due to the contractor. There is no contractual relation established between the owner and the lienor to support a. personal judgment, and, as has been shown, the lien is fatally- defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs-to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
