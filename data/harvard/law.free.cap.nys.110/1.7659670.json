In this case there has been virtually an appeal from one Special Term of the Supreme Court to another, with the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>that the latter has reversed the former. This practice, which has grown altogether too common, cannot be too strongly condemned. The question is not new, and there is no reason why the practice should not be understood. \u201cThe practice of moving before one judge at Special Term to declare void the order or judgment of another judge at Special Term is not sanctioned by any provision of the Code that I am aware of, or by any controlling authority. It virtually amounts to an appeal from one Special Term to another Special Term for a review of the first order.\u201d Platt v. N. Y. &amp; Sea Beach Ry. Co., 170 N. Y. 451, 458, 63 N. E. 532, 534. If a review of the first order had been desired, it should have been had by an appeal to this court, instead of to a co-ordinate Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
