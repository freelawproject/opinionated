The answer was a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars set forth sales of coal between October 23, 1905, and March 8, 1907, aggregating $598.50, and payments between February 26, 1906, and August 23, 1907, aggregating $431.25, leaving a balance of $167.25. September 10, 1906, an agreement was made between the St. Gregory Society and the Volunteers of America whereby the society transferred all its interest in St. Gregory Free Emergency Hospital to the Volunteers, which retained the right to withdraw from the agreement by giving to the society 15 days\u2019 notice before the expiration of 3 months from its date, in which event the property should revert to the society; the society \"to assume all liabilities should the Volunteers withdraw \u201cafter said three months.\u201d If the Volunteers should continue after the three months, the society should disband.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">It seems to be conceded that after an experimental trial of three months, and about December, 1906, St. Gregory\u2019s Hospital of the Volunteers of America was incorporated by some of the parties to the agreement of September 10, 1906, and others, held its first meeting in January, 1907, and on January 18, 1907, plaintiff received a check for $100 \u201cin part payment of the old account.\u201d Dr. Gardner, identified with the entire transaction, called for the plaintiff, testified that he was selected to audit the accounts and approved plaintiff\u2019s claim; that the medical board of the society and the Volunteers each agreed to raise $1,250 as a loan, and that the Volunteers also agreed to pay these bills. \u201cWe gave them [the Volunteers] the hospital, and we didn\u2019t want to give them a hospital and pay the bills besides.\u201d Dr. Nelden, also identified with the entire transaction, 'called by plaintiff, testified that the Volunteers were to assume these debts if they continued the hospital after three months, and on that\" consideration it was turned over to them. Mr. Craft, also identified with the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>action and defendant\u2019s treasurer, was the only witness called by the defendant. He testified that the corporation at no meeting assumed the old debts and had never paid anything on account of these bills. The $100 paid plaintiff came from $1,250 advanced to the hospital by the medical board of the society. On cross-examination his direct testimony was considerably weakened, particularly by the production of a letter written by him to Dr. Gardner, January 10, 1907, upon the letter head of the \u201cSt. Gregory Emergency Hospital of the Volunteers of America,\u201d in which the writer agrees to pay several debts, and -concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">\u201cAs soon as they are settled, we will take up the matter of paying some of the creditors, so far as the money will go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The formality of a resolution by the defendant to pay these bills was not _ necessary. The parties to the corporation were practically the parties to the negotiations which led to its formation, and they took the property charged with any agreement relating to its transfer. The attempt of this charitable institution, in the circumstances, to avoid this claim is not commendable on moral grounds, but, fortunately for the plaintiff, is wholly overcome by the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
