At the trial the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was amended by reducing the claim to $110, which plaintiffs claim they were entitl\u00e9d to receive from the defendant as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-19\">(1) For cementing work on rough brick........................... 8 50 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-20\">(2) Enameling walls in 40 bathrooms, instead of painting, at $1 per</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-21\">room ...................................................... 40 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-22\">(3) Painting of galvanized! cornice on Edgecomb Ave............... 20 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-23\">Total ...................................................... $110 00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-24\">It appeared upon the trial that Orazio La Cagnina and Andea Ognibene were copartners, doing busi\u00f1ess under the name of O. La Cagnina &amp; Co., and, as such, entered into a contract in writing with the defendant, dated February 17, 1906, wherein and whereby the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>agreed to do certain work, labor, and services for the defendant, and the defendant agreed to pay plaintiffs the sum of $1,550 therefor. The contention of the plaintiffs is that the three items of work, hereinbefore enumerated, were extra work, and were not included in the aforesaid contract. The complaint was dismissed, and judgment rendered for defendant. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">It was admitted on the trial that the said sum of $1,550, the amount named in the original contract, was paid to the appellants by the respondent, and that the respondent received a general release of all claims against the said respondent, executed by one Di Luca claiming to act as agent of the appellents. Plaintiffs deny the authority of said Di Luca. It seems to us that the question of Di Luca\u2019s authority, as well as the one based upon the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the items above mentioned were extra work not included in the original contract, should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
