The facts are not in dispute. When the motion came on for argument, the defendant raised certain preliminary, objections based upon the alleged insufficiency of the moving papers. At first the court was of opinion that some of these objections were well taken, but, upon\" further argument, overruled them and granted the motion. These objections were not recited in the order granting the motion, and the defendant, by the motion which has been denied, seeks a resettlement of the order by the insertion therein of the preliminary objections. We are of opinion that the motion for resettlement should have been granted. If the defendant should desire to appeal, it would be entitled to have its preliminary objections considered, and it might be unable to do so, unless it appears from the order that the objections were duly taken at the proper time. Mix v. Andes Ins. Co., 74 N. Y. 53, 30 Am. Rep. 260; Matter of Nat. Graphophone Co., 82 App. Div. 593, 81 N. Y. Supp. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for resettlement granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
