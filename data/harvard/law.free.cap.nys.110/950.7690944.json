The bill of particulars furnished by the plaintiffs, in addition to certain disbursements which are insignificant, shows 25 separate charges for services, 3 of which are specified as' retainers. The remaining 22 items relate to services performed in only 5 separate matters, and those not of a complicated character, consisting mainly of consultations, conferences, and negotiations of settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-18\">While an attorney is not precluded from demanding a compulsory reference, on the ground that the trial of his action to recover the value of his services will involve the examination of a long account (Feeter v. Arkenburgh, 147 N. Y. 257, 41 N. E. 518), still the tendency of the courts is to refuse such a reference (Hoff v. Reid &amp; Co., 110 App. Div. 95, 97 N. Y. Supp. 107; Prentice v. Huff, 98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>App. Div. 111, 90 N. Y. Supp. 780; Stein v. New York News Pub. Co., 47 App. Div. 550, 62 N. Y. Supp. 579; Hoar v. Wallace, 24 App. Div. 161, 48 N. Y. Supp. 748; Hedges v. Methodist Protestant Church, 23 App. Div. 347, 48 N. Y. Supp. 154), except in extreme cases, where it is reasonably apparent that the items are so numerous that a jury cannot hold them in mind and make a proper determination (Lewis v. Snook, 88 App. Div. 343, 84 N. Y. Supp. 634; Clinch v. Henck, 49 App. Div. 183, 62 N. Y. Supp. 1058; Richards v. Stokes, 1 App. Div. 305, 37 N. Y. Supp. 246).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Numerous itemized charges for one matter do not make a long account, within the meaning of section 1013 of the Code. Randall v. Sherman, 131 N. Y. 669, 30 N. E. 589. Where the services relate to one matter, or can be grouped into so few separate matters that a jury can easily bear them in mind, a compulsory reference is improper. We are of the opinion that such is the situation in the present action. The services rendered in each of the five separate matters can be testified to, and the aggregate value of each given, and there will be no difficulty in a jury bearing them in mind, and ascertaining the value of each, and computing the total value of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
