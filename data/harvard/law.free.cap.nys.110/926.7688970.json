Demand for payment was made on January 15, 1908. The answer alleged that the $300 received by defendant was for a retaining fee \u25a0on account of services theretofore and to be rendered as a certified public accountant and as an expert witness in an action brought by the American Audit Company against the plaintiff, that services were rendered, and that' defendant was still ready and willing to perform the services for which he was engaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">The action brought by the audit company was for $1,271.45, balance of $4,621.42. The receipt given by defendant to plaintiff was as follows: \u201cTo retainer in suit brought by American Audit Co., $300.\u2014Aug. 1, 1907.\u201d The action of the audit company against plaintiff had not been determined at the time of this trial. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was to the effect that several conferences were had with \u25a0defendant concerning the claim of the audit company and that $300 was to cover this preliminary work, and in case the audit company did go into court he would get $25 a day while in court. Defendant testified that the work done by the audit company was not correct; that he also conferred with plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the preparation of its answer to the audit company\u2019s claim. His testimony showed that he sought to keep in touch with the situation and agreed to show that the accounting prepared by the audit company was not properly prepared. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that he called on defendant with reference to preparing for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Several questions were asked of the defendant as to his readiness to attend as a witness for the plaintiff in the audit company suit. All these questions were excluded, and defendant excepted. This was \u25a0error. Undeniably a contract was entered into. Unquestionably the \u25a0defendant was retained and performed some services. If plaintiff \u25a0wished to rescind, the defendant was entitled to some compensation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>if not to all his retainer, unless fraud or utter failure to perform were shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
