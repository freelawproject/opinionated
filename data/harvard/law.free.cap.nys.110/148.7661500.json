The defendant may and probably does desire to deny the allegations of employment of plaintiff\u2019s testator and the rendition-of services by him. It is aggrieved because it may not be able to deny the evidentiary facts unnecessarily set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">Where a pleading requiring an answer or a reply contains allegations, of mer\u00e9-evidence not necessary to a statement of the cause of action or counterclaim or affirmative defense, the opposite party has the right to have such unnecessary allegations stricken out. Hamilton v. Hamilton, 124 App. Div. 619, 109 N. Y. Supp. 221; Tradesmen\u2019s National Bank v. U. S. Trust Co., 49 App. Div. 362, 63 N. Y. Supp. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">The motion should have been granted. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10' costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
