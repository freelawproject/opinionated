So-called defenses III, IV, and V, respectively, set up the lack of the court\u2019s jurisdiction of the person' of the defendant, of the subject of the action, and the failure of the complaint to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The real ground of the motion, as urged by respondent and as upheld by the learned court below, was that the pleas numbered III, IV, and V were in reality demurrers, and therefore inconsistent with the defenses I and II, for the reason that under our practice \u201cthe only pleading on the part of the defendant is either a demurrer or an answer.\u201d Section 487, Code Civ. Proc.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">It is to be observed that defendant\u2019s pleading does not assume both to answer and demur, nor is it one that answers in part and demurs in part. In the former case a motion to elect, and in the latter to strike out, would be appropriate. Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, \u00a7 928, and cases there cited. The precise question here presented has been passed upon in Barnard v. Morrison, 29 Hun, 410, and Camp v. Bedell, 52 Hun, 63, 5 N. Y. Supp. 63, adversely to respondent\u2019s contention. Defendant\u2019s pleading, having been designated by him as an answer, is not to be treated as both an answer and demurrer, notwithstanding that some of the alleged defenses were grounds of demurrer only. The objectionable allegations will be regarded as unnecessary or surplusage, which, in the Camp Case, supra, the court intimated might be stricken out upon motion. It is, however, also stated in the same case that the allegation \u201ccannot by any possibility' do the plaintiff any harm. The plaintiff\u2019s position is in no way changed because of the fact that the answer contains the needless allegation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJT\">The practice as laid down by the appellate courts, and which in recent years has been quite uniformly followed, is to grant motions to strike out irrelevant or redundant matter in a pleading only where it is evident that the moving party otherwise will be aggrieved. Stokes v. Star Co., 69 App. Div. 21, 74 N. Y. Supp. 528; Howard v. Automobile Co. of America, 75 App. Div. 23, 77 N. Y. Supp. 957. It may be noted, too, in the case at bar, that the allegation of want of juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>diction of the person would be deemed waived, unless pleaded, and, as the question of jurisdiction on that ground is not' apparent upon the face of the complaint, it is peculiarly well pleaded in the answer. Sections 498, 499, Code Civ. Proc.; Seamans v. Barentsen, 180 N. Y. 333, at page 336, 73 N. E. 42, at page 43, 105 Am. St Rep. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
