There was no eyewitness to the accident. While we may infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>-that the intestate\u2019s hand was caught in the moving cogwheels of the \u25a0machine and her fingers th\u00e9reby cut off, all else is but conjecture and speculation, aside from the testimony of the sister and fellow servant of the intestate that, two or three minutes after she had seen the intestate cleaning some part of the framework of the machine, she heard her sister scream, ran over to her, and found her hand maimed. It 'is tersely and correctly said by Spring, J., in Wilson v. New York Mills, 107 App. Div. 99, 94 N. Y. Supp. 1090:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201cSubmission to a jury implies controverted facts or circumstances from which contrary inferences may fairly tie drawn. The isolated fact that an employs was killed in the course of his employment does not of itself permit a jury to find that the employs was free from fault contributing to his death. The plaintiff must show affirmatively his freedom from negligence, and, if he utterly fails in this essential part of his case, the duty of the court to nonsuit still remains in spite of the employer\u2019s liability act, for the reason that there is no fact to submit to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">I think that the order for the new trial must be reversed, and the dismissal affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
