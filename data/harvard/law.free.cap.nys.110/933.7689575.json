Evidence, however, was introduced without objection of the agreement of Sontag (defendant) to return the $800 if plaintiff did not obtain the property. Plaintiff did not obtain the property. A motion by plaintiff to conform the pleadings to the proof was granted. Defendant claims, first, that the interest of defendant, Sontag, in the contract with Weissberger and Junger, was assignable; and, second, that the proofs did not follow the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">The judgment should stand, as the parties consented to litigate the issues as to whether the defendant agreed to return the $800 to plaintiff if plaintiff did not obtain the property, and on that question the verdict is final. Parties may consent to try an issue not pleaded. Frear v. Sweet, 118 N. Y. 459, 23 N. E. 910; Gillies v. Manhattan Co., 147 N. Y. 420, 42 N. E. 196; Deyo v. Morss, 144 N. Y. 216, 39 N. E. 81. The defense is conscienceless, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
