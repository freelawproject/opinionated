The issues were as to the amount of tobacco sold and the amount of the commissions paid. All material testimony on both sides was received without objection, and presents a sharp conflict. The conclusion of the trial judge that the plaintiff had failed to establish the cause of action alleged is warranted. There is no legal proof, however, to support the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The only testimony is: \u201cWe advanced him the $54.\u201d This is not evidence of a loan, or of the terms or conditions under which it was made. So far as appears,.it may have been an advance on account of commissions to be earned. Schlesinger v. Burland, 42 Misc. Rep. 206, 85 N. Y. Supp. 350; N. W. Mut. v. Mooney, 108 N. Y. 118, 15 N.
