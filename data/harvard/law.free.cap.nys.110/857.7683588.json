The defendant was restoring the surface of the street after the tunnel was completed. The street was dug up and littered. Teams had to go on the sidewalk on account of the broken and littered condition of the roadway. The defendant was engaged under contract with the tunnel company in restoring the street.

She walked from the adjoining flag into the depression caused by the temporary removal of the flag and fell. It was in the ,daytime. Judgment should have been given for the defendant.
