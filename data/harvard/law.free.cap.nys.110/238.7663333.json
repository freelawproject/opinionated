Plaintiff admits payment for alleged services rendered in procuring the increase of salary during the season of 1906-1907, and alleges that on or about the 23d day of September, 1907, defendant entered upon the performance of her engagement for 33 weeks, and up to the time of the commencement of this action has \u201crendered and performed thereunder for 10 weeks consecutively.\u201d Recovery is sought for 5 per cent, of the total amount of salary received for 10 weeks by defendant upon the second alleged engagement, to wit, 5 per cent, of $25,200, or $1,250. A verdict was rendered in behalf of plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">From the allegations of the complaint and the proofs it is clear that the sole issue in the case was whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of defendant\u2019s contract for a 33 weeks\u2019 engagement made with the firm of Klaw &amp; Erlanger. No proper reason appears for clouding this issue with plaintiff\u2019s alleged claim arising out of the first of the two contracts described, except to the extent that the facts connected with the transaction might throw light on the one here litigated. The plaintiff was the only witness in his behalf. The proofs do not establish that plaintiff ever was engaged as defendant\u2019s manager, and a recovery could only be sustained upon the theory that defendant\u2019s increase of salary was brought about by the efforts of plaintiff. The claim is analogous to that of a broker\u2019s. It was therefore incumbent upon him to establish that he was the procuring cause of the agreement for a 33 weeks\u2019 engagement under which defendant was to secure a weekly salary of $2,500. Although the complaint alleges that defendant was to pay plaintiff \u201cat the end of each and every week\u201d of her engagement, plaintiff\u2019s proof is that she agreed to pay him \u201ceach week after she received her salary.\u201d The weekly compensation, according to plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, was conditioned upon defendant\u2019s receipt of her weekly salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The proof of plaintiff\u2019s services seems to consist almost entirely of. statements on his part as to what he told the defendant he did respecting the procurement of the Klaw &amp; Erlanger agreement; but there is an ominous silence as to what actually occurred between himself and Mr. Erlanger, or his agent, Mr. Morris. The mere fact that he told defendant that he \"negotiated with Mr. Erlanger, or his agent, is not proof of actual negotiations that he had; and his statement to defendant that Klaw &amp; Erlanger would sign a contract is no proof that he procured the contract, and it is consistent with defendant\u2019s claim \u25a0that she procured it. A broker, who seeks to recover commissions for effecting a contract, is. obliged to show what he did. He. should prove what negotiations he had, and that his efforts resulted in the making of the contract. Defendant denies that plaintiff was her agent. It is practically undisputed that he was not her manager, as he alleged in his complaint, and she denies that he procured the Klaw &amp; Erlanger contract. It seems to be conceded that the payment of $500 made under the first alleged cause of action was a voluntary one on defendant\u2019s part, a circumstance somewhat inconsistent with plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>It was incumbent for plaintiff to prove his case by satisfactory proof. It would have been sufficient, from a legal point of view, if he himself had detailed his negotiations with Mr. Erlanger, or his agent; or he might have produced Mr. Erlanger, or his agent, or both, to establish the facts. But he neither testified to the main facts nor produced either of these witnesses. It is true that defendant also failed to call either of these witnesses; the only testimony in the case being that of the respective parties. But the burden was upon the plaintiff, and I do not think that he fully sustained this burden. If plaintiff\u2019s case were one which depended upon inferences which might properly be drawn from the proofs given, because of inherent difficulties of establishing certain facts, it might be urged that a failure of justice might result if the jury were not permitted to indulge in inferences logically ded\u00facible from the proofs. But such is not this case. The plaintiff had it in his power to testify to the actual facts. He failed to do so. He did not even prove that defendant had received her weekly salary under the Klaw &amp; Erlanger agreement. The issues were clouded by a mass of irrelevant testimony, and the plaintiff, by reason of the peculiar facts in the case, to wit, his failure to show that he was a manager, what he-did in respect of the Klaw &amp; Erlanger contract, the voluntary payment of $500, and the receipt by him of numerous presents from defendant, was entitled to a wider range of cross-examinatian, as to the relations between the parties, than was accorded her. It seems to me that the interests of justice will be subserved by a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
