(See next page.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-7\">A. W. Robertson, witness for plaintiff, testified substantially that about the year 1866 he examined into the title to the O. S. Brewster survey; did so at the request of J. A. Black; and his opinion was that the record of deeds of Denton County showed at that' time that the title was in Black; that he could not state the different instruments of conveyance; could not say that he saw or examined any transfer on the record from Brewster to Black, or to any one else, and if he saw the same he could not give the state of contracts or to whom such transfer was made; did not remember seeing a transfer from Brewster to the Brewster land; that he has known the land since the war; there was at one time a house on it and some parties living on it; this was in 1868 or 1870; they moved off, and at the time John Davidson purchased the land (November 28,1877) there was no one living on any part of it; Mr. Davidson, shortly after he purchased the land, improved it, put a house on it, fenced a portion of it, moved on the land, and resided there till he sold out to plaintiff (11th of February, 1887). He moved on the land in December, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-8\">Matt Dougherty, witness for plaintiff, testified that he knew the survey;- had known it since the war; had been deputy county clerk of Den-ton County, and had first and last a great deal to do with the land records of the county; that his impression was there was once on the records some kind of a transfer to the land, but could not state that there ever was a transfer from Brewster to any one conveying either the certificate or the land. The court house of the county was burned, and all the records were destroyed by the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">C. C. Dougherty, witness for plaintiff, testified that there was a house built on the land in 1865, but that it was moved off about the year 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-10\">J. A. Carroll, witness for plaintiff, testified that at one time he owned the south of the survey; bought it at sheriff\u2019s sale, and had the field notes of the survey copied into his deed; does not remember that he ever saw any transfer or record of it by Brewster to any one of the certificate or the land; that the land he bought was sold as the land of one Palmer, and his deed described the portion he bought at the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-11\">Wm. Pierce, county surveyor of Denton County, witness for plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>testified that he ran out the land called for in plaintiff\u2019s deed from Davidson last summer; located its corners and boundaries. Commenced at the northeast corner of the A. N. B. Tompkins survey and ran out the distance of its north line to what should be the northeast corner of the Brewster in the prairie. The Brewster calls to begin at the northwest corner of the Tompkins. He then ran the north line of the Brewster and found its northwest corner; found the west line and the southwest corner, then ran out and found what he took to be the southeast corner of the Brewster, which would be the southwest corner of the Tompkins; then ran out the 320 acres of the Brewster which Elias.Brush had deeded to Palmer and located its north boundary line, which would be the south boundary line of plaintiff\u2019s tract; found that the Strouds had about 35 acres of the land under fence north of the line he established. The plaintiff, he said, was in possession of about 167-2- acres of land, 30 acres more than the number called for in his deed, and to include all the land north of the line established by him, it would give Mr. Greenlee about 202-2- acres. On the south end of the east line of the Brewster there is no conflict with land claimed by defendant Taylor and which he has in possession; but the east boundary line of the Brewster, at about one-half of its length, crosses the west string of Tajdor\u2019s fence, and at the northeast corner of the Brewster the line is about 20 varas inside of Taylor\u2019s fence, thus including in Taylor\u2019s field about 2 acres of land properly belonging to the Brewster survey. The 2 acres are in a wedge shape, 300 varas long and 20 varas wide at the north end, a point at the south end. There is a public road just outside of Taylor\u2019s field on the west. The Brewster calls for the Tompkins; witness did not run out the Tompkins, only its north line. The northeast corner of the Tompkins is defined and can be identified, but its northwest corner is in.the prairie and can only be found by course and distance. He don\u2019t know the variation on which the Tompkins lines were run. He found at the southwest corner of the Tompkins a witness tree marked as called for in its field notes, and witness is satisfied it is the southwest corner of the same; found one marked tree on the line of the Tompkins. . He had Carroll\u2019s deed from the sheriff with him when running out the Carroll 320 acres, and established its northeast and northwest corners according to the calls in the deed.</summary>\n<summary

Mr. John Davidson at the time owned the land described in the petition which the plaintiff now owns north of the 160 acres sold by Carroll to defendants Stroud. \" When Bacon and I got out to where the land was, went to Mr. John Davidson, who was then living on his tract, and asked him to point out to us his southeast corner. He took us to where his southeast corner was and pointed the same out to us. It was a rock in the road, a little east of the east corner or end of his south string of fence. From this corner Mr. Davidson had a fence running west about half way on his south .line, standing where the present fence now stands between the plaintiff and the 160 acres. Mr. Bacon commenced at this corner and run off and located on the ground the 160 acres described in the Carroll deed to the Strouds, defendants; set up and marked corners to the same. In the fall of 1880 the 160 acres so surveyed was enclosed with a fence. The fence on the south line of Davidson was extended to the west line of the Brewster survey. Defendants Strouds built the west end of the division fence, but John Davidson assisted in building it, and when it was finished it constituted the north line of the 160 acres and the south line of the Davidson tract, and the same was kept and recognized by defendants and John Davidson as a division fence .between their tracts of land. After the fence was made in the fall of 1880 defendants broke up and placed in a state of cultivation about 35 acres of land. They broke the land up to the division fence and cultivated' the same during every year from that time till the present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-3\">\"They hired Mr. Davidson to assist in building a small tenant house on ' the disputed strip of land, about thirty steps from the fence, which cost about $75. Davidson lived on his land described in plaintiff\u2019s petition, February, 1887, when he sold to plaintiff. During all this time, and while defendants were breaking, cultivating, and improving the land immediately south of the fence, Davidson knew of it, and at no time did he intimate that he was claiming any land south of the division fence; and since he sold the land to plaintiff the defendants and the plaintiff have been keeping up the division fence, the plaintiff the east end and defendants the west end. Defendants Strouds have paid all the taxes as-. sessed on this 160 acres for the years 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, and 1887 (the suit was filed July 3, 1888), and have all the tax receipts for every year since they owned it, to-wit, the land sold to them and run of by the surveyor Bacon, which has been enclosed with a fence.

He was one of the chain carriers, and his recollection was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Davidson was another.

Davidson gave him permission to take the rock, and witness asked him to show him his land, and he (Davidson) pointed to the land north of the division fence and told witness he could get the rock there. The Strouds were cultivating land close up to the fence on the south side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-6\">Defendant Taylor read in evidence a deed from Thomas Fletcher to him, dated 16th June, 1874, together with the acknowledgment and certificate of registration, to 77 acres and the 43 acres, as described in his answer, out of'the Tompkins and the Puchilaski surveys, recorded June 22, 1874, and again duly recorded 2nd January, 1878. He moved on the land sold to him by Fletcher in 1870, Fletcher and he having bought it in 1870, when in 1874 Fletcher sold to him. He says the entire tracts sold to him were run out and located on the ground by George Gray, who was at the time county surveyor, who at the same time ran out the Tompkins survey. In 1874 all the land sold to him was enclosed with a fence, and in same year was put in a state of cultivation. The west string of his fence, he says, is not as far west as the west boundary of his land as located on the ground, but is a few feet east of such line. He has repaired the fence, and four or five years before the trial he changed the rail fence to a barbed wire fence, as close to the rail fence as it could be done, which barbed wire fence is on the land as surveyed to him by George Gray. There is a public road on the west side his farm, along by the side of the west boundary fence between his land and the land of plaintiff. He has cultivated and used all the land inside of the fence since 1874, and paid all the taxes on .the land described in his deed since it was enclosed, from 1874 to 1888 inclusive, and has all the tax receipts for taxes paid every year; such taxes paid on all the land run off to him and enclosed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-7\">Plaintiff Greenlee testified in his own behalf.

There was no submission of such a question to the jury by the lower court, no charges asked by plaintiff below, and no assignments of error on the issue presented in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AAxh\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim of title was by limitation under the t\u201een and five years statute. Let it be admitted for argument sake that his deed described and included the strip of land in dispute, and that there was no agreement by Davidson or acquiescence binding upon him that defendants Strouds\u2019 fence was the division line, and let it be admitted that the Strouds have no title under the five years statute of limitation because they failed to show that their deed from Carroll described and included the land in controversy, still the plaintiff can not recover, because she has no title by limitation or otherwise. The suit is trespass to try title with plea of not guilty, and before boundary questions can be important plaintiff must show title, otherwise defendants will recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The three years statute of limitations pleaded cannot avail, because the plaintiff has not shown title or color of title. She can not recover under the five years statute, because she and those under whom she claims have not had five years exclusive and uninterrupted possession. There is no dispute, and can be none, concerning the evidence on this question. Davidson\u2019s possession commenced in 1877, after his purchase from Hogg, and conceding that his deed included the land in controversy, his possession was only constructive as. to the land in dispute, and this possession was interrupted by-the actual pedal possession of defendants Strouds in 1880, who fenced all the disputed land and cultivated portions of it up to fence. Such actual possession stopped the running of the statute in favor of plaintiff\u2019s constructive possession. Defendants Strouds have continued to so hold the land up to the present time. If their deed embraced the land in dispute, their possession was sufficiently long to give them title under their plea of five years limitation, all other requirements of the statute having been complied with; but if their deed does not describe the land, their possession has been adverse to Davidson\u2019s and to plaintiff\u2019s (which if continued sufficiently long would give them title under the ten years statute), and consequently from the time of their actual entry the statute ceased to run in favor of plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s possession and that of others which she pleads was less than five years, and of course less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>than ten years. Therefore, having shown no title, she can not recover. Bracken v. Jones, 63 Texas, 184.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b173-9\">Adopted December 19, 1890.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Defendant Taylor had been in the actual occupancy of the strip of land demanded of him by plaintiff\u2019s suit since 1874, more than ten years prior to the institution of this suit, claiming the same as his own, cultivating and using the same. Whether his deed describes the disputed two acres or not so as to give him title under the plea of five years limitation, he can hold the same under the plea of ten years limitation. There is no question but that all the defendants claimed to own the land in possession by them for which they are sued. Their possession was'hostile and adverse from the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">It is not necessary to consider other questions in the case. Ho other judgment could have been legally rendered in the case than the one that was rendered, and we think it ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
