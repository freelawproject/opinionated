Sale of Community Property Pending Divorce Suit. \u2014 Article 2867, Revised Statutes, provides: \u201c On and after the day on which the action for divorce shall he brought it shall not be lawful for the husband to contract any debts on account of the community, nor to dispose of the lands belonging to the same; and any alienation made after that time shall he null and void if it be proved to the satisfaction of the court that such alienation was made with a fraudulent view of injuring the rights of the wife. \u201d This is applicable in a case in which divorce proceedings were pending in which the right to the property owned by the husband and wife was not put in issue.

That deed purported to convey to his children \u201call my right, title, interest, and claim in and to said lots,\u201dand was without valuable consideration.'</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The same deed conveyed to Mrs. Berg some of the property described in her petition, and it seems that under the husband\u2019s direction the wife delivered it to the clerk for record.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Mrs. Berg subsequently married again, and she and her second husband conveyed the lots in controversy to the defendants or to persons through whom they claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">This action is by the children of Jacob Berg, claiming under the deed made to them by their father; audit is conceded that the judgment in favor of defendants should be affirmed if the deed did not pass superior title.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">On the trial of this cause the court found the facts to have been such as entitled Mrs. Berg to the judgment rendered in the action for divorce, and further found that the conveyance by Berg to his children was made with intent to injure his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">It is now urged that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the finding last named; but in view of the facts it would be difficult to arrive at any other conclusion than that reached by the judge who tried this case. If. however, this were not true the same result would be reached on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">The\"conveyance made by Berg was made pending litigation in reference to the property in controversy, and plaintiffs were purchasers <em>Ks pendens </em>and therefore are bound by the-decree rendered in the divorce suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">The statute declares that \u201con and after the day on which the action for divorce shall be brought it shall not be lawful for the husband to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tract any debts on account of the community, nor to dispose of the lands belonging to the same; and any alienation made by him after that time shall be hull and void if it be proved to the satisfaction of the court that such alienation was made with a fraudulent view of injuring the rights of the wife.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 2867.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Alc\">Delivered February 3, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b540-3\">The succeeding article provides for an inventory and appraisement of real and personal property, arid also for injunction for the preservation of the rights of a wife pending divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The statute quoted would be applicable in a case in which proceeding for divorce was pending but in which the right to the property owned by husband and wife was not put in issue; but it was not intended thereby to take such property out of the general rule, which makes the right of a purchaser <em>lis pendens </em>to depend on the result of litigation in which the right to the property sold was in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">There is no error in the judgment and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\n<em>Affirmed. .</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
