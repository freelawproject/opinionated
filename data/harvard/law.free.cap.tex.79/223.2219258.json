An essential feature of the citation provided for by the article referred to is that it \u201cshall state the file number of the suit.\u201d Prior to the adoption of the Revised Statutes in 1879 this was not required. Pasch. Dig., arts. 1430, 1431.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It is well settled in several decisions that a citation which does not \u201ccontain the names.of the parties to the suit\u201d is not sufficient to authorize a judgment by default. Norvell v. Garth waite, 25 Texas, 585; Heath v. Fraley, 50 Texas, 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The article cited does not more imperatively require that \u201cthe names of all the parties to the suit\u201d shall be contained in the citation than that it \u201cshall state the file number of the suit.\u201d The same reason for holding in the cases mentioned that the citation was fatally defective, applies to the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Although the citation may be in all other respects perfect, and the objection urged may be therefore plainly technical, still the language of the law is unmistakable and leaves no room for construction. To hold that the citation in this case, which does not \u201ccontain the file number of the suit,\u201d is sufficient and will support a judgment by default would be to dispense by judicial construction with a statutory requirement, and in effect repeal that portion of article 1215 declaring that the citation \u201cshall state^the file number of the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We think the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
