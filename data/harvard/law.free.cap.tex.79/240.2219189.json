Russell\u2019s Heirs, 1 Texas, 725, Justice Lipscomb uses the following strong language on the subject:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u201cThe permitting such evidence can not be too strongly reprobated as leading to improper tampering with the jurors to procure such affidavits after verdict; and further, a juror so shamelessly disregarding the obligation of his oath as to be guilty of such irregularities after a cause has been submitted to him justly deserved punishment and ought to have received it.\u201d Handley v. Leigh, 8 Texas, 130; Little v. Birdwell, 21 Texas, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">We do not think the present is a case'calling for a departure from the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Appellants complain that the court erred in its charge in restricting their right to recover by requiring the jury to believe that they had acquired their title to the logs on or before the 28th day of August, 1884. The evidence clearly shows, without there being anything to the contrary, that plaintiffs, if they had title at all, acquired it before said date, and hence they could not have been prejudiced by the charge in that particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Appellants complain that the court erred in instructing the jury that the right of the plaintiffs under the evidence did not accrue until the parties had counted the logs and they had been delivered to plaintiffs. We do not think that the objection presents the charge as actually given. While we think the plaintiffs were entitled to a charge presenting to the' jury their title as complete before the logs had been counted, if they found plaintiffs\u2019 version of what had occurred preceding that transaction to be true, we yet think the charge given was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">If another view of the evidence, and one more favorable to the plaintiffs, was likewise correct, they should have requested an additional instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">We think, however, that the charge as given correctly presented plaintiffs\u2019 whole case as it was developed by the evidence, and we can not see that any injury could have resulted to them from that source.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">Appellants insist that \u201c the court erred in the eighth section of its charge in the instruction to the jury as to the evidence generally, including the written eonti\u2019acts and other written evidence, <em>\u2018 </em>that they were the exclusive judges of the weight and value of the evidence,\u2019 and in the failure of the court to construe said contracts and other writings and to instruct the jury as to their legal effect, thus in effect excluding said written evidence from the consideration of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b259-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Delivered January 13, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The charge as given was correct. If there were before the jury any instruments of writing requiring construction (which under the issues made by the pleadings is not apparent to us) it would have been proper for appellants to have requested a charge supplying the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The other assignments of error relate to the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Notwithstanding the reluctance always exhibited by this court to disturb the verdicts of juries upon the facts merely, we feel constrained in this case to say that we think the verdict is so repugnant to the evidence as to have made it the duty of the District Court to set it aside, and to make it curs to reverse the judgment because it was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">As the cause will be remanded for another trial, we do not think it proper for us to express in detail our view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
