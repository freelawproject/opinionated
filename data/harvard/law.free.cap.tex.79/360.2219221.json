After Thomas had exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>cuted said bail bond certain interlineations therein were discovered by attorney Kittrell, who called the attention of other attorneys who were associated with him in the cause thereto, and thereupon a consultation was. had by them with reference to the validity of said bond, and it resulted in their concluding that the interlineations and alterations avoided the bond.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AE1U\">Delivered January 27,1891.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"A9P\">\u25a0 There was no evidence that attorney Kittrell was ever spoken to by Thomas with regard to the bond, or that he ever spoke to Thomas about it; nor is there any that the one referred to or any other consultation about the bond was held at the instance or request of Thomas, We can see no more in what occurred, when the evidenced considered in its most favorable aspect for plaintiffs, than a voluntary conversation or discussion between attorneys on the subject of the effect of the alteration of the bail bond. We can not see why it should have had any greater effect in the way of disqualifying them from subsequently acting as judges in the bail bond case than it would have had upon any other attorneys at law who, without being connected with the murder case, had joined them in their discussion of the bond. Had the attorneys at the solicitation of their client examined or given an opinion on the question of the validity of the bond for any reason or purpose it would have been different. The murder case and the subsequent case upon the bail bond were distinct and separate causes. Being counsel in the murder case did not by itself make-file attorney counsel in the bail bond case any more than subsequently being counsel in the bond case would, without his having h\u00e1d any actual connection with it' otherwise, have made the attorney in the bond case counsel in the murder case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The disqualifying clause in the Constitution reads as follows: \u201cHo judge shall sit in any cause where he shall have been counsel in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">It was held in this court in the case of Haverty v. The State, 32 Texas, 606, that having been of counsel in the criminal case did not disqualify the attorney from subsequently presiding as judge upon a trial of the bail bond case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">This court decided in the case of Slaven v. Wheeler, 58 Texas, 23, that the relation of client and attorney may exist so as to disqualify the attorney from subsequently acting as judge before any suit has been brought, and that \u201cIf as an attorney he should advise as to a matter in dispute, the judge would be thereafter disqualified from sitting in the case when it had ripened into a suit, even though he had charged no fee for his advice, provided he was consulted professionally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Ho question seems to have been made as to whether the necessary parties were before the court, and as this appeal can be disposed of on the merits so as to end the litigation, we express no opinion on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
