As a result, the court-martial panel which tried the accused was jurisdictionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Contrary to his pleas, the accused was convicted by a special court-martial, which included officers and enlisted members, of attempted transfer of mescaline and transfer of cocaine and marijuana in violation of Articles 80 and 134, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 880, 934, Code, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">At the time of trial, the accused was assigned to the 341st Security Police Squadron, one of several squadrons included in the 341st Security Police Group. One of the court members, Chief Master Sergeant Larry E. Larios, was listed on the orders appointing the court as assigned to the 341st Security Police Group. At no time during the trial did the military judge advise the court members that enlisted members of the court could not be a member of the same unit as the accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No challenge was made to Sergeant Larios\u2019 presence on the court-martial panel. Chief Master Sergeant Larios had been assigned to the 341st Security Police Squadron for a number of years, but at the time of trial he was nominally assigned to the 341st Security Police Group staff. Chief Master Sergeant Larios had daily contact with the security police squadron commander and worked closely with other squadron personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Captain Euler, the commander of the 341st Security Police Squadron and the accuser in the case, testified as a prosecution witness. His testimony included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">Q. How many individuals do you have in your squadron?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">A. Counting the Group Headquarters, I believe we\u2019re close to about 280 individuals. I have SPS and Security Police Group under me for administrative purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\">Q. And you\u2019re the Commander of those individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-12\">A. Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">During our consideration of this case, appellate government counsel agreed that enlisted personnel of the 341st Security Police Group staff such as Chief Master Sergeant Larios were attached to the 341st Security Police Squadron for administrative and disciplinary purposes including the imposition of Article 15 punishments and the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, there was <em>no </em>separate squadron for personnel of the security police group staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">The precise issue involved here is whether, under such circumstances, enlisted personnel assigned or attached to a squadron for administrative and disciplinary purposes including the imposition of Article 15 punishments and court-martial purposes are members of that same squadron for purposes of Article 25(c), Code, <em>supra. </em>If they are, they are not eligible to serve on a court-martial involving a member of that squadron. Article 25(c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, <em>inter alia, </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-15\">(1) Any enlisted member of an armed force on active duty who is not a member of the same unit as the accused is eligible to serve on general and special courts-martial....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-16\">(2) In this article, the word \u201cunit\u201d means any regularly organized body as defined by the Secretary concerned, but in no case may it be a body larger than a company, squadron, ship\u2019s crew, or body corresponding to one of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">The Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), paragraph <em>4b, inter alia, </em>provides: <em>\u201cAir Force. </em>A \u2018unit\u2019 of the Air Force in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>sense of Article 25(c) is a squadron or other organization of the Air Force for which a separate unit military strength balance report is prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The limitation against enlisted personnel of an accused\u2019s unit serving on his court-martial is jurisdictional in our view.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellate government counsel do not dispute the jurisdictional effect of the limitation but argue that Air Force regulations define unit, for military strength balance reporting purposes, as organizations having separate Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) codes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They assert that since the security police group and the security police squadron have separate PAS codes, Chief Master Sergeant Larios was simply not a member of the same unit as the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">However, in our view, an individual attached to a squadron for administrative, disciplinary and court-martial purposes and thus a member of the unit, subject to its discipline, for other purposes under the Code, is <em>equally </em>a <em>member </em>for purposes of Article 25(c). The prohibition against enlisted personnel from the same unit avoids \u201cbias or prejudice either for or against an accused which experience has shown was likely to develop in an integrated body of troops where the members worked and lived in close association with each other.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It avoids \u201ca possible mental identification with the supposed interests of his unit in the disposition of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The limitation also has a salutary effect in insulating enlisted members from possible criticism from other members of the same unit <em>and </em>in avoiding command influence proscribed by Article 37, Code, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 837, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Considering the object and purpose of the codal limitation on eligibility, we hold that Chief Master Sergeant Larios was a member of the 341st Security Police Squadron for purposes of Article 25(c), Code, <em>supra, </em>because he was a member of that same squadron for other administrative and disciplinary purposes under the Code, <em>supra. </em>To hold otherwise would provide a potential device to subvert both the reasons and the salutary benefits of the limits on eligibility. Moreover, no cogent reason exists, in our view, as to why Air Force enlisted members otherwise attached to and therefore considered members of an accused\u2019s squadron need to be available for appointment as court members.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe our position is consistent with the language and purpose of the Uniform Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">In view of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to decide the other assertions of error urged by appellate defense counsel. The findings of guilty and the sentence are set aside. A rehearing is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">POWELL, Senior Judge, concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\">.

In Article 25 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Congress partially defined the term by listing the maximum size of a \u201cunit.\u201d The Code dele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>gates to the Secretaries of the respective services the authority to complete the definition. With guidance from the President, paragraph <em>4b, </em>Manual for Courts-Martial 1969 (Rev.), the Secretary o\u00ed the Air Force has completed the definition of the term \u201cunit\u201d for the Air Force. I find that definition wholly adequate to resolve this case. In my view, the majority\u2019s expansion of that definition is an unnecessary and unwarranted infringement upon the prerogatives of Congress, the President, and the Secretary of the Air Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">For purposes of clarity, I have divided my dissenting opinion into four sections. The first section states my position: in accord with Article 25 and relevant implementing directives, the enlisted member in question was eligible to serve as a member of the accused\u2019s court-martial. The next two sections are in response to the position of the majority. Specifically, in the <em>second </em>section, I indicate why I believe, as a matter of judicial restraint, the majority\u2019s reliance upon legislative history is inappropriate in this case. In the <em>third </em>section, I present the results of my research of the legislative history, which lead me to a different conclusion as to statutory intent than that reached by the majority: I am persuaded that the purpose of the several limits regarding eligibility of enlisted court members was to avoid compelling the convening authority to appoint enlisted members of the accused\u2019s unit to serve on courts-martial in remote locations or combat conditions where no other enlisted personnel are available. Finally, in the <em>fourth </em>section, I conclude by pointing out what I perceive to be the untoward consequences of today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">I. ARTICLE 25 IS CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS: CHIEF LARIOS WAS ELIGIBLE TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE ACCUSED\u2019S COURT-MARTIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The question of who may serve on courts-martial was raised and resolved by Congress in enacting Article 25 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825. In view of the complexity of the limitations on enlisted member eligibility, I quote the section in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayq\">\u00a7 825. Art. 25. Who may serve on courts-martial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aov\">(a) Any commissioned officer on active duty is eligible to serve on all courts-martial for the trial of any person who may lawfully be brought before such courts for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">(b) Any warrant officer on active duty is eligible to serve on general and special courts-martial for the trial of any person, other than a commissioned officer, who may lawfully be brought before such courts for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\">(c) (1) <em>Any enlisted member of an armed force on active duty who is not a member of the same unit as the accused is eligible to serve on general and special courts-martial for the trial of any enlisted member </em>of an armed force who may lawfully be brought before such courts for trial, <em>but he shall serve as a member of a court only if, </em>before the conclusion of a session called by the military judge under section 839(a) of this title (article 39(a)) prior to trial or, in the absence of such a session, before the court is assembled for the trial of the accused, <em>the accused personally has requested in writing that enlisted members serve on it. After such a request, the accused may not be tried by a general or special court-martial the membership of which does not include enlisted members in a number comprising at least one-third of the total membership of the court, unless eligible enlisted members cannot be obtained on account of physical conditions or military exigencies. If such members cannot be obtained, the court may be assembled and the trial held without them, but the convening authority shall make a detailed written statement, to be appended to the record, stating why they could not be obtained.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-11\">(2) <em>In this article, the word \u201cunit\" means any regularly organized body as defined by the Secretary concerned, but in no case may it be a body larger than a company, squadron, ship\u2019s crew, or body corresponding to one of them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>(d) (1) When it can be avoided, no member of an armed force may be tried by a court-martial any member of which is junior to him in rank or grade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-4\">(2) When convening a court-martial, the convening authority shall detail as members thereof such members of the armed forces as, in his opinion, are best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament. No member of an armed force is eligible to serve as a member of a general or special court-martial when he is the accuser or a witness for the prosecution or has acted as investigating officer or as counsel in the same ease. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">Applying the statutory provisions to the facts in this case, most of the requisites for Chief Larios\u2019 eligibility as a court member are easily satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">a. the accused was enlisted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">b. the accused\u2019s personal written request for enlisted members was timely, and is attached to the convening orders in the record of trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">c. Chief Larios was not junior in grade or rank to the accused; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">d. the record establishes that Chief Larios was not the accuser, a witness for the prosecution, an investigating officer, or counsel in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The remaining statutory question is whether Chief Larios was a member of the same \u201cunit\u201d as the accused. If he was, I would concur with the majority: the error was jurisdictional, and the trial a nullity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">In determining whether Chief Larios was a member of the same \u201cunit\u201d as the accused, and thereby rendered ineligible as a court member, I look to the legislative definition of \u201cunit\u201d provided in Article 25(c)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVAp\">\n<em>\u2014any regularly organized body;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\"><em>\u2014as defined by the Secretary </em>concerned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-13\">\n<em>\u2014in no case . . . larger than a .. . squadron.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">Thus, a \u201cunit\u201d is a regularly organized body, of squadron size or smaller, as further defined by the Secretary of the Air Force. In formulating such definition the Secretary has been provided guidance by the President:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-15\">A \u201cunit\u201d of the Air Force in the sense of Article 25(c) is a squadron or other organization of the Air Force for which a separate unit military strength balance report is prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-16\">Paragraph <em>4b, </em>Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.). The definition of \u201cunit\u201d provided by the Secretary of the Air Force is promulgated in Air Force Regulation 35-40, Military Personnel Strength Accounting, 11 February 1974, relevant portions of which are quoted below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-17\">sk sk :k sk sk sk</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-18\">MILITARY PERSONNEL STRENGTH ACCOUNTING-GENERAL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-19\">1 1.

Basic Principles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-9\">a. <em>Each USAF member is assigned to a specific active unit while on active duty. A member will not be assigned to more than one unit at the same time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-12\">b. <em>A member is counted as part of the strength of the unit to which he or she is assigned. His or her duty status, location, or attachment to another unit does not change his or her assigned status.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-13\">c. For strength accounting purposes, a member is assigned to a unit (not to an activity or installation). If a detachment or subordinate element is not identified by an exclusive PAS, it is not a unit for military personnel strength accounting purposes. This principle applies regardless of the detachment\u2019s physical location and the member\u2019s duty location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-14\">* 5}! * * * Sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-15\">BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">Turning to the facts in the record before us, there is no doubt that the accused was assigned to the 341 Security Police Squadron, and that Chief Larios was assigned to the 341 Security Police Group.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While this issue was not litigated at the trial, records filed before us on this appeal clearly establish a separate PAS code for each of those organizations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, as defined by Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>gress, and the Secretary of the Air Force pursuant to statutory delegation, the accused and Chief Larios were assigned to separate and distinct \u201cunits\u201d within the clear meaning of Article 25(c)(1), Uniform Code of Military Justice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, Chief Larios was \u201celigible\u201d to serve as an enlisted member of the court-martial which tried the accused.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Believing, as I do, that the Code speaks for itself, I am hesitant to proceed further, lest I obscure my position. However, since the majority opinion relies in part upon legislative history, I wish to point out why I believe such reliance is at variance with accepted principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">II. COURTS MUST APPLY CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS STATUTES AS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BODY.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">As an aid in determining the intent, and hence the applicability, of legislative enactments, courts have developed numerous conceptual devices, the goal of which is to determine the intent of the legislature at the time it enacted the statute. These devices are not substantive rules of interpretation, but procedural guides aimed at a common end: the determination of the actual intent of the legislature.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Paramount among these procedural guides is the principle that an unambiguous statute is the clearest expression of legislative </em>intent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such statutes must be applied as enacted, without resort to other aids in determining intent, such as legislative history.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-16\">In applying any statute, such as Article 25, it is our judicial function to apply the separate parts in a literal fashion, harmonious with the rest of the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Only where such efforts fail are we at liberty to look outside the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the statute in an effort to construe its meaning and effect. In my opinion, the majority\u2019s expanded definition of the word \u201cunit\u201d is unnecessary for interpretation or application of the Code to the facts of this case, and it constitutes an unwarranted usurpation of the legislative function.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-17\">The term \u201cunit\u201d, with reference to a military organization, has no generally fixed or accepted meaning among the services. Were it undefined in the statute, I would be somewhat more hesitant to disagree with the conclusion reached by the majority. However, the Congress, in enacting Article 25, provided for a complete definition of the term \u201cunit\u201d, for purposes of that statute, in clear, easily discernible terms.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In determining the scope and applicability of that statute, we are required to accept and apply that definition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-18\">In arriving at its conclusion, the majority places heavy, if not exclusive, emphasis on the fact that the 341 Security Police Squadron Commander exercised administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>and non-judicial punishment authority over enlisted members of the 341 Security Police Group.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is this commonality of disciplinary and administrative authority over the accused and Chief Larios that the majority finds pivotal in its determination to expand the statutory definition of the term \u201cunit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">My reading of Article 25 discloses no reference to commonality of disciplinary and administrative authority in <em>any </em>fashion, much less in relation to the legislative definition of the term \u201cunit.\u201d In limiting the eligibility of enlisted members for service on courts-martial, circumstances, such as those presented in this case, were <em>not </em>unforeseeable to the drafters of the Code. Even if they were, proper exercise of judicial restraint on our part precludes us from altering the clear statutory scheme to accommodate circumstances which could have been dealt with by the legislature.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In view of the foregoing, I believe it is inappropriate to refer to the legislative history of Article 25 to determine the eligibility of Chief Larios to serve as a member of the accused\u2019s court-martial. However, since the majority has quoted some references to legislative history in support of its position, I have undertaken my own examination of the relevant legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab9\">III. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY CONFIRMS THAT CONGRESS DID NOT INTEND A BROADENING OF THE CODAL DEFINITION OF \u201cUNIT\u201d IN DETERMINING ENLISTED MEMBER ELIGIBILITY.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">I have examined the legislative proposals, hearings, debates, and reports relevant to Article 25 as presently enacted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> My examination reveals that, while there are \u201csalutary benefits of the limits on eligibility\u201d of enlisted members, they are ancillary to the intent of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">I have found no single statement or report which reconciles all of the facets of the codal provisions pertaining to enlisted membership on courts-martial. To the extent there is a unified rationale for the entire scheme, it must be gleaned piecemeal from the available history.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>The impetus, and unifying objective of the predecessor provisions dealing with enlisted membership on courts-martial, was public pressure, during and following World War II.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Committees of prominent citizens were appointed to study, and make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>suggestions for change to, the Articles of War, and the Articles for the Government of the Navy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As a result of the committee reports, legislative proposals were submitted by the War Department and the Department of the Navy, and bills were submitted by several individual Senators and Congressmen. While a complete catalog of these proposals is unnecessary, some indication of their diversity is helpful in understanding the compromise process which led to the enactment of the statute substantially in its present form.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> One proposal would have made the appointment of enlisted members mandatory for <em>all </em>general courts-martial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Others required enlisted members at the request of an enlisted accused.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Still others would have made the appointment of enlisted members discretionary with the convening authority, at his own initiative, or at the request of the accused.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As to proportionate representation, the proposals ranged from providing for a majority of enlisted members,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to at least one-half,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> to at least one-third,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to a minimum of one or two.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>It was well recognized at the time that even \u201cat least one-third\u201d enlisted members would, if unified, often be capable of controlling the verdict.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The fears spawned by this consideration resulted in two basic proposals for limitations on enlisted eligibility. One was to exclude members of the <em>accused\u2019s </em>unit;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the other would have, in addition, excluded members of the <em>accuser\u2019s </em>unit.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">There was a consensus, in view of the sharp demarkation between the enlisted and officer classes, that peer pressure might result in bias among enlisted members closely associated with an enlisted accused. These sentiments were exemplified in the Report of the Committee on Military Law of the War Veterans Bar Association, presented during the testimony of its chairman, Mr. Arthur E. Farmer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">... so long as the status of officers and enlisted men remain as sharply differentiated as they are at present, it would be unjust both to the accused and to the enlisted [members], as well as to the Army from a morale viewpoint, to appoint enlisted men to sit on courts martial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Even among proponents of the various proposals to place enlisted members on courts-martial, the legislative history reflects considerable concern as to the practical consequences of such an innovative measure. It was important, of course, that courts-martial not only do justice, but that they also <em>appear </em>to do justice. The concern was that the presence of enlisted members, while bolstering the appearance of justice, might in fact diminish the actual quality of justice.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Then, as now, it was recognized that courts-martial, as compared to civilian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>criminal trials, resulted in few acquittals of the guilty, and even fewer convictions of the innocent. The injection of a new variable, which might increase unwarranted convictions or acquittals was regarded with considerable apprehension. Not only was the integrity of the court-martial system of justice at stake, but of paramount concern was the impact of a diminution in the quality of military justice upon military morale and discipline. If the actual or perceived ability of courts-martial to dispense justice was diminished, a corresponding diminution in morale and/or discipline could be anticipated. This, in turn, would have an adverse impact upon the ability of our fighting forces to carry out their missions in war or peace.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The majority opinion has focused upon one portion of the Article 25 limitations relative to the appointment of enlisted members: what is a \u201cunit\u201d? Focusing solely upon that question, it is not difficult to find support in the legislative history for the theory advanced in the majority opinion, namely that the purpose of the exclusion of members of the accused\u2019s \u201cunit\u201d was to exclude enlisted members who work (or fight) and live (or die) in close proximity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the accused.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is not hard to accept the conclusion, even absent empirical evidence, that such members would be more likely than others to harbor bias for or against the accused.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Not surprisingly, it is also possible to find quotes supporting the logical fear that such enlisted members might be subject to various pre-trial pressure or post-trial retribution from peers or superiors.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">While superficially appealing, these considerations, adopted as the majority\u2019s theory for the intent behind the statutory exclusion of enlisted members from the accused\u2019s \u201cunit\u201d, fail to consider three important factors. The first is what Article 25 does <em>not </em>cover, and the other two are integral parts of Article 25, to which we must accord due deference in construing the statute.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\"><em>First, </em>Article 25 does not purport to be a substitute for common sense on the part of the convening authority. Given free choice in the matter, it is exceedingly unlikely that a convening authority would attempt to \u201cpack\u201d the court with the accused\u2019s buddies. In a similar vein, Article 25 is not the portion of the Code which deals with attempts to influence or punish court members in regard to or as a result of their service on a court-martial. Such activity is expressly made punishable elsewhere in the Code.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Moreover, at the trial itself, the Code provides for a voir dire and challenge procedure to eliminate from the court any members who are biased for or against the accused.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>Second </em>the Article 25 exclusion of enlisted members of an accused\u2019s \u201cunit\u201d is only one part of the overall limitation bearing upon the appointment of enlisted members. Another part is that portion of the definition of the term \u201cunit\u201d preempted by the Code, and not left to Secretarial discretion. In the Air Force, \u201cunit\u201d, as defined by the Secretary, can be no larger than a squadron. Article 25(c)(2), Uniform Code of Military Justice; paragraph <em>4b, </em>Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.). Viewed in isolation this portion of (or subtraction from) the limitation on eligibility appears to make no particular sense.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Yet, it was intended to, and does in fact, play a pivotal role in protecting the existence of the right of an accused to have enlisted members on his court-martial. It does so by ensuring that, in exercising his delegated authority to define the term \u201cunit\u201d, the Secretary cannot make the term so broad as to effectively deny the accused the right to enlisted members.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> As an extreme, for example, the Secretary might, without the codal restriction, designate the entire Air Force as one \u201cunit\u201d, thereby rendering all Air Force enlisted personnel ineligible for duty as court members.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>Third, </em>the final part of the Codal limitation on appointment of enlisted members (who are not otherwise ineligible under Article 25(d)), is that if no <em>eligible </em>enlisted members are available because of \u201cphysical conditions or military exigencies\u201d, the trial may proceed without them, despite the accused\u2019s request. The use of the term \u201celigible\u201d here relates directly to the \u201cunit\u201d limitations previously discussed \u2014 in fact, this part of the Codal limitation appears to be the principal purpose for the other parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">a. The \u201csame-unit\u201d limit on eligibility, viewed alone, is redundant to common sense on the part of the convening authority, separate Codal provisions prohibiting attempts to influence or retaliate against court members, and the challenge procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">b. The subtraction from that limit, making the disqualifying unit no larger than a squadron, precludes nullification of the accused\u2019s right to enlisted members in normal circumstances, but would be altogether unnecessary without the \u201csame-unit\u201d limit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">The aforementioned limits are <em>necessary </em>for only one purpose: to protect the integrity of the court-martial in an isolated location or in combat conditions.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> They are the foundation on which is built the exception for the requirement for the convening authority to appoint enlisted members. They were essential to narrowly limit the circumstances in which the accused may be tried without enlisted members despite his request therefor.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Specifically, they ensure that wherever and whenever an enlisted accused is tried by court-martial, he has the right to enlisted members, <em>unless, </em>as a result of physical conditions or military exigencies, only members of the accused\u2019s unit are available, and that unit is of squadron size or smaller <footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Thus, while the limits on eligibility of enlisted court members may afford the accused some ancillary benefits redundant to the challenge procedure, or codal provisions designed to preclude unlawful influence on court members, the purpose of those limits in Article 25 is <em>not </em>to protect the accused. They are intended to preclude compelling the convening authority to appoint enlisted members \u2014 or forego trial \u2014 under the particularly delicate conditions of combat or a remote environment, where appointment of enlisted members from the accused\u2019s \u201cunit\u201d would have a grave potential for subverting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>justice and undermining military discipline.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The two codal limitations on the accused\u2019s right to enlisted members were enacted for divergent reasons, as part of a consistent statutory scheme: (1) the limitation on eligibility of court members from the accused\u2019s unit was designed to preclude the possibility that an alliance of enlisted members could obstruct justice within a small isolated unit by relieving the convening authority from any duty to place enlisted members of such \u201cunit\u201d on the accused\u2019s court-martial; (2) the limitation on the Secretary\u2019s authority to designate the size of \u201cunits\u201d was to preserve the existence of the accused\u2019s right to enlisted members on his court-martial under all other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In my view, the legislative history is in total accord with the literal language of the Code, as it pertains to the appointment of enlisted members. In essence, the Code \u2014 as it was intended \u2014 creates an inchoate duty for the convening authority to appoint enlisted members. The sole condition necessary to trigger that duty is the accused\u2019s written request. There is, however, a narrow exception, relieving the convening authority of that duty under relatively dire circumstances, where the only available pool of enlisted members is the small and cohesive \u201cunit\u201d to which the accused belongs. The purpose of that narrow exception, created by the limitations on enlisted member eligibility, was to preserve the integrity of the court-martial in the extremes of isolation or combat.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Alm\">IV. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">As a result of today\u2019s decision, a basic, clear, and settled codal provision has become unnecessarily ambiguous and uncertain. Prudent convening authorities can avoid possible error by ensuring that the accused and the enlisted court members do not come under the disciplinary, administrative, or supervisory authority of a common third person at (or near) the squadron level. Potentially, however, the resulting expansion of the class of \u201cineligible\u201d enlisted personnel will serve to deny enlisted court members to an accused, in a remote or combat location, who would otherwise be afforded that right under Article 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">I find no error in the composition of the court-martial which tried the accused. I have considered the remaining assignments of error, and would resolve them adversely to the accused. Thus, I would affirm the findings of guilty and the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-12\">. If, as the majority has determined, Chief Larios was a member of the same \u201cunit\u201d as the accused, and that \u201cunit\u201d was of squadron size or smaller, then the Chief was <em>ineligible </em>to serve as a court member. Not all of the criteria set forth in Article 25, and summarized in the text, render a member ineligible. The appointment of members junior in grade to the accused, for example, is within the discretion of the convening authority, <em>United States v. Branford, </em>2 C.M.R. 489 (ABR 1952), and failure to challenge for cause, or object at trial, constitutes a waiver of any error in the exercise of that discretion. <em>United States v. Aho, </em>8 M.J. 236 (C.M.A.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-10\">. The majority opinion states that Chief Larios was \u201cnominally\u201d assigned to the 341 Security Police Group. To the extent this qualification implies some lack of substance to the Chiefs assignment, I disagree. In the course of our review we have accepted for consideration an authenticated official record showing that Chief Larios was assigned to the Group at the time of the accused\u2019s trial. He was assigned to no other unit at that time, and his unit of assignment was not altered by his attachment to the Squadron for administrative and disciplinary purposes. Paragraph l-5a and l-5b, Air Force Regulation 35-40, Military Personnel Strength Accounting, 11 February 1974. For <em>strength accounting purposes, </em>paragraph 45, Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), Chief Larios was assigned to the 341 Security Police Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b826-11\">. The Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Directory lists, at page 116, PAS MBOSFDHF for the 341st Security Police Squadron, which was the accused\u2019s unit. On the same page, the directory lists separate PAS codes for two other squadrons within the 341st Security Police Group, and lists the PAS for the Group as MBOSFXWZ. Clearly, the Secretary of the Air Force has defined the 341st Security Police Group, and each of its three squadrons, as separate \u201cunits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">The Navy Court of Military Review recently addressed essentially the same issue presented here. The accused was a member of the ship\u2019s company. The enlisted members of his court-martial were members of the embarked squadrons, which maintained separate unit personnel diaries. Paragraph 45, Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.). The Court held that those embarked squadrons retained their status as separate \u201cunits\u201d for purposes of Article 25(c), Uniform Code of Military Justice,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-18\">. .. notwithstanding their deployment on board RANGER and notwithstanding the authority of the ship\u2019s commanding officer to exercise special or summary court-martial jurisdiction over the members of the embarked squadrons, and to impose non-judicial punishment on the members of those units. As with any large military base with many tenant commands, each with its own separate diary, or as with any battalion with its several companies, there is bound to be some professional as well as social interaction among the individual members; but those commands and those companies remain \u201cunits\u201d within the definitions set out by the UCMJ and the <em>Manual </em>as long as they retain their own unit personnel diary separate from the greater command, [citations and footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>United States v.

Even were I to conclude that the accused and Chief Larios were members of the same \u201cunit\u201d, I would not find that fact to be disqualifying in the circumstances presented. The \u201cunit\u201d described by the majority consists of the 341st Security Police Squadron, <em>plus </em>all enlisted personnel of the 341st Security Police Group. Perforce, a squadron plus a separate component of enlisted personnel \u2014 whatever one chooses to call such a \u201cunit\u201d \u2014 is <em>larger </em>than a squadron. Hence, Chief Larios\u2019 co-membership with the accused in such a \u201cunit\u201d would not render him ineligible as a court member.

By section 212 of Public Law 759, Eightieth Congress, second session (1948) (see A.W. 16) Congress similarly limited competency to enlisted persons not assigned to the same company or corresponding military unit. A corresponding military unit aboard a ship is felt to be the ship\u2019s crew, which, though it may in some cases be a larger group than the Army company, is the same kind of integrated body, living and working in close association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-17\">The last sentence of the first paragraph of subdivision (c) was added to make it possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>to proceed with a trial where competent enlisted persons cannot be obtained.

The first courts to which were appointed enlisted personnel were convened by Headquarters Command, USAF, at Bolling Air Force Base, District of Columbia, and also by a court-martial jurisdiction in Heidelberg, Germany. Its value is yet to be demonstrated. The special committee on military justice of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York wrote thus:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-25\">\u201cThere has been considerable discussion concerning the presence of enlisted men on military courts. Your committee believes that the public attention given to this aspect of the bill far outweighs its importance. The presence of enlisted men on courts is of doubtful value to the accused, since, in all likelihood, those appointed would be career soldiers, more severe than officers or their subordinates. If, however, the provision tends to give the enlisted man more confidence in the courts and a greater feeling that justice will be done, we see no objection to the experiment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-26\">The committee above quoted has probably stated the real value of such provision. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>insistence that enlisted men be placed on courts martial is motivated by the idea that the courts would be more lenient, the proponents of the plan will most probably be bitterly disappointed. In the opinion of the witness, the presence of qualified, intelligent enlisted men on the court will not in any respect result in more acquittals or in less onerous sentences. If, on the other hand, the placement of enlisted men on courts is prompted by the desire to strengthen the courts in the eyes of both the public and the enlisted personnel, this change is justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ail\"><em>Bills to Unify, Consolidate, Revise and Codify the Articles of War, the Articles for the Government of the Navy, and the Disciplinary Rules of the Coast Guard, and to Enact and Establish a Uniform Code of Military Justice: Hearings on S. 857 and H.R. 4080 Before a Subcomm. of the Senate Comm, on Armed Services, </em>81st Cong., 1st Sess. 183 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Testifying at a hearing on the aforementioned amendment to the Articles of War, Brig.

Courts Martial Legislation, note 18, <em>supra. </em>The legislative study prepared for the Senate Armed Services Committee reflected both a contemporaneous and an historical concern that the effectiveness of our fighting forces is dependent upon the effectiveness of our system of military justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">The difference between a military and a civilian organization was recognized in the fifth amendment of the Constitution, which specifically excepts from its guaranty of indictment by a grand jury \u201ccases arising in the land and naval forces.\u201d By judicial interpretation the same exception has been held applicable to the guaranty of jury trial recognized in the sixth amendment. This exception was considered so obvious by the founding fathers that it did not call forth a single word of discussion as it passed through the first session of the First Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">The objective of a democratic form of government is to enable people to live together in peace and in reasonable happiness. The object of criminal law is to secure to every human being in a community all the liberty, security, and happiness possible, consistent with the safety of all. The civilian community is content simply to restrain assaults, while letting its members go on about their several businesses, whereas the military not only wants its men to refrain from striking each other, it wants them all to march in a prearranged direction. The Military Establishment needs obedience; must have it. The civilian community does not need it to the same degree, nor for the same purpose. While an army composed of literate, free men can be led in a large measure by precept, example, and exhortation, there is always a large indifferent segment, and always an irreducible minimum who respond only to the fear of the consequences of disobedience. It is only through punishment and the fear of punishment that this last group can be made to obey. An armed expedition of 2,000,000 men is a totalitarian organization which must in the final analysis obey implicitly the decision of one man and, by a natural evolution of command, every man must immediately and without question obey his immediate superior, even if it means his death. The commander cannot obtain this obedience unless such obedience can be made preferable to the alternative fate in store for those who malinger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">In a military organization, because of its nature, justice cannot be based solely upon the crime that the man has committed. It must be based to some extent upon the effect the punishment will have on the morale of the remainder of the command.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\">Therefore, it seems a reasonable conclusion that, since the objectives of civil and military justice are wide apart, each requires its own separate system of laws \u2014 statute and common. And because an army or a navy is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man, every enactment, every change of rule which impairs this principle weakens the army, impairs its value, and defeats the very object of its existence. All the traditions of civilian lawyers are antagonistic to this vital principle, and it is here that the argument has raged, with military men defending their position on the grounds above stated, and the civilian-turned soldier attacking this position because of its basic differences from the laws of his civil society.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-13\">The tradition of civil justice and the traditions behind military justice are different. The military man believes that his concept of military justice is vital, and that, if it is not applied, an army will become demoralized by grafting onto the military code the deductions obtained by considering only the civil code and practices. This is the crucial point which must be decided by the Congress in the consideration of this pending legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 3, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. <em>See </em>note 16, <em>supra, </em>commentary on subdivision (c), proposed Article 25, Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">.

There are always more enlisted persons around than there are officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-19\">Mr. Larkin. Yes; that is right. That specific provision in subdivision (c) was, as I recall, objected to by Mr. Wolman. It is a difference and one which I wish to point out to the committee. It differs from the provisions of the Elston bill last year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-20\">Last time it was provided, that is your committee provided, for the Army only that where an enlisted man requested enlisted men on his court, he could not be tried unless such enlisted men were on the court, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>though members of his own company were not competent to sit on that court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">Now, when we addressed ourselves to the problem of enlisted men and tried to make it apply to the Navy as well \u2014 and as designed by your committee problems of the Navy I am sure were not before you \u2014 it seemed to us that you would have a number of circumstances in the Navy where a man would request enlisted men on his court and by virtue of the fact that none of the men in his own ship\u2019s crew, in this so-called unit, were eligible to sit, you might be faced at sea particularly in special courts with the situation that no other eligible men were available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">The men of his own ship, of course, are not eligible and the problem of trying to transfer some enlisted men on the high seas from another ship is so great that unless you made provision for trying him without enlisted men even though he had requested them in those extraordinary circumstances, you couldn\u2019t try him at all perhaps for a lengthy period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">Now, we realized that to leave any discretion with the commander was bordering on a situation where there might be criticism that commander would not follow the spirit of this provision and the intent of Congress that there be enlisted men where the enlisted men wanted them on generals and special courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">So for that reason we attempted in providing for that isolated exception that in such event the convening authority, if he finds the circumstance is such that there are no eligible enlisted men available at sea, because the ship\u2019s crew are not eligible, shall make a detailed written statement to be appended to the record stating why he found it impossible to obtain eligible enlisted men at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">Mr. Elston. It doesn\u2019t say \u201celigible.\u201d It says \u201ccompetent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">Mr. Larkin. Well, it is the same notion, 1 think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\">Mr. Elston. Well, \u201ccompetent\u201d \u2014 an officer might interpret that to mean a person who is incompetent by reason of lack of intelligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-12\">Mr. Larkin. Of course, there is a provision covering that, but our idea as I am trying to reconstruct it would have the exception apply only when there are no eligible men, eligible in the sense or competent in the sense that there are no enlisted men outside of the unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-14\">Mr. Elston.

Such delays and expenses could arise in connection with offenses committed on ships at sea or on isolated units ashore such as remote weather stations. The language of the subdivision makes it clear that mere inconvenience is no ground for proceeding with the trial without enlisted men on the court and the requirement of a detailed written statement of the ground insures that the purpose of the subdivision will be complied with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-20\">Now we intended that that be part of the legislative history, as instructions to the commanders and the people that write the manual that it would only be in the most exceptional type of case that they would proceed and it would only be after the commander writes a statement of the conditions he has faced which made it impossible for him to obtain enlisted men and the statement is to go with the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-21\">So it will not just be arbitrary or capricious convenience of his which he could adopt in order to avoid using enlisted men in the event he was the type of commander who wasn\u2019t sympathetic with this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-22\"><em>Id. </em>at 1149-51.

I do not mean to imply that military justice is merely an instrument of military discipline.

Reflective of this concern by Congress is the statement of Lt. Gen. J. Lawton Collins, an infantry commander in both the Pacific and Europe in WW II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">During the war we served all over the world and there were many cases where there were relatively small groupings of men, for instance, in the China-Burma theater \u2014 and if we had mandatory provisions that required enlisted men to serve on such courts, I think often it would have delayed justice. It might have made it impossible to have a court at the place where the crime was committed. When you consider that many times the witnesses were native; or they were people that couldn\u2019t be picked up and moved from that location to some other place where there were enough men and large installations to guarantee getting qualified men, I think you will see that if you make it wholly mandatory and rigid, it would be a rather difficult provision to actually administer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">House hearings on H.R. 2575, note 17, <em>supra, </em>at 2156.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
