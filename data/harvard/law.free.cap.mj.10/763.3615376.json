The court-martial was held in Japan; the pretrial agreement in this case waived the personal appearance of character witnesses located outside the limits of Japan in return for a limitation on the sentence. We do not find such a provision void as against public policy. <em>See United States v. Hanna, </em>4 M.J. 938, 940 (N.C.M.R. 1978) (dictum). Accordingly, the findings and sentence as approved on review below are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
