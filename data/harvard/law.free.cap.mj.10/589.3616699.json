Convicted of stealing, by exceptions, one watch valued at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>$75.00 and of the remaining two charges, appellant was sentenced to reduction to pay grade E-l and a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority disapproved the findings of guilty as to the unlawful entry charge and its specification but, on reassessment, approved the sentence awarded; this sentence was also approved by the supervisory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In his initial assignment of error, appellant contends for the first time that his court-martial was improperly constituted and was therefore without jurisdiction because the enlisted members of his court were from his same unit, contrary to Article 25(c)(1), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 825(c)(1). Since such a defect if it existed would go to the jurisdiction of the court, the failure to raise the issue at trial does not constitute a waiver. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>25 C.M.R. 636 (A.B.R.1957); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>16 C.M.R. 404 (N.B.R.1954). <em>See also United States v. Glidden, </em>34 C.M.R. 577 (A.B.R. 1963); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>34 C.M.R. 522 (A.B.R.1962). It appears the two enlisted members of appellant\u2019s court were both from squadrons embarked on the USS RANGER (CV-61), which was appellant\u2019s unit at the time of the offense as well as at the time of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">Article 25(c)(1) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">Any enlisted member of an armed force on active duty who is not a member of the same unit as the accused is eligible to serve on general and special courts-martial for the trial of any enlisted member of an armed force who may lawfully be brought before such courts for trial....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT8\">The term \u201cunit\u201d is defined at Article 25(c)(2) as \u201cany regularly organized body as defined by the Secretary concerned, but in no case may it be a body larger than a company, squadron, ship\u2019s crew, or body corresponding to one of them.\u201d This definition is further defined, as regards the Navy and Coast Guard, in the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.) </em>(MCM), at paragraph 4 <em>b, </em>which describes a \u201cunit\u201d as \u201ca ship, company, detached command, or other organization for which a separate unit personnel diary is prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The accused\u2019s unit was USS RANGER (CV-61); he was a member of the ship\u2019s company, and it was the ship which carried appellant on its unit personnel diary. In contrast, both enlisted members of appellant\u2019s court were members of their respective squadrons and were carried on the unit personnel diaries of those squadrons. The diaries of those squadrons remained separate from that of the ship and, hence, the legal and actual identity of those squadrons remained intact, notwithstanding their deployment on board RANGER and notwithstanding the authority of the ship\u2019s commanding officer to exercise special or summary court-martial jurisdiction over the members of the embarked squadrons, JAGMAN \u00a7 0107c, and to impose non \u2014 judicial punishment on the members of those units, JAGMAN \u00a7 01015(3). As with any large military base with many tenant commands, each with its own separate diary, or as with any battalion with its several companies, there is bound to be some professional as well as social interaction among the individual members; but those commands and those companies remain \u201cunits\u201d within the definitions set out by the UCMJ and the <em>Manual </em>as long as they retain their own unit personnel diary separate from the greater command.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are thus compelled as a legal as well as a practical matter to find that the squadrons embarked on board the aircraft carrier to which appellant was attached were separate units in the sense of Article 25(c)(1) and that the court had jurisdiction to try appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The second assignment of error also merits some discussion; appellant there summarily argues that Prosecution Exhibit 4, a Navy Occupation/Training and Awards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>History (NAVPERS 1070/604) from his service record book, was improperly admitted in aggravation over his objection because he did not acknowledge in writing an adverse entry nor was he given the opportunity to rebut the entry, contrary to Article 1110, <em>U. S. Navy Regulations, 1973, </em>and <em>Bureau of Naval Personnel Manual </em>(BUPERSMAN) Article 5030420. The exhibit consists of two pages and shows appellant\u2019s enlisted classification code, his advancement to pay grade E-2, his successful completion of two military schools, and the allegedly adverse entry, that is, that appellant was \u201cDropped for Cheating\u201d from a military course of instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The government concedes that the entry in question was adverse to appellant\u2019s interests; they argue, however, that the entry was not offered in aggravation but to rebut evidence of appellant\u2019s good character and performance of duty as presented by the defense during presentencing and was thus admissible pursuant to paragraph 75e, MCM, and <em>United States v. Ferris, </em>No. 77 1616 (NCMR 30 November 1977) (unpublished). Such a concession is consistent with the prior decision of this Court in <em>United States v. Swist, </em>No. 77 1616 (NCMR 30 November 1977) (unpublished), in which it was found that an administrative remark on a page 13 entry in Swist\u2019s service record relating to a civilian conviction for breaking and entering and for larceny was derogatory and therefore inadmissible because the entry was not acknowledged in writing by Swist contrary to BUPERSMAN Article 5030320. Upon closer scrutiny, however, we are of the opinion that such matter as we have in the case <em>sub judice, </em>and as was considered in <em>Swist, </em>was neither \u201cadverse matter,\u201d as intended by Article 1110, <em>U. S. Navy Regulations, 1973, </em>nor an \u201centry of a derogatory nature,\u201d as contemplated by BUPERSMAN Article 5030420 so as to require an acknowledgment in writing or an opportunity for the member concerned to rebut. We believe that the intent behind those regulations is to prevent the entry into a service member\u2019s jacket without his knowledge of such information as would constitute an adverse <em>opinion </em>as opposed to a matter of <em>fact </em>without his knowledge and without permitting him the opportunity to rebut the opinions contained in the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The material in issue before this Court, as was that in <em>Swist, </em>is adverse in the general sense of the word; but we do not believe that it is \u201c \u2018adverse matter\u2019 within the expanded meaning of that term.\u201d Opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy JAG: 131.4: JLW:case Ser. 13/5124 of 7 Mar. 1978 (enclosure (14) to <em>Off The Record </em>Issue No. 73) (discussing the historical background and present impact of Article 1110, <em>U. S. Navy Regulations, </em>1973). Insofar as <em>Swist </em>leaves the impression that entries of a purely factual matter, such as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>cannot be used during the presentencing stage in accordance with paragraph <em>75d, </em>MCM, because of a failure of acknowledgment or of an opportunity to rebut, it is rejected. The report of the reasons behind the dropping of the accused from a military school was purely factual and there was no need for appellant to acknowledge or be given the opportunity to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Appellant\u2019s remaining summary assignment of error also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Accordingly, the findings and sentence as approved below are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Judge DONOVAN and Judge GLADIS concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. One member was attached to Attack Squadron One Forty-Five; the other was a member of Helicopter Squadron Four.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\">. Battalions or other large commands performing centralized personnel administration for their companies or other separate components may not necessarily thereby dissolve the components\u2019 independence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
