Upon his plea to the lesser included offense of unauthorized absence in violation of Article 86, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 886 appellant was found guilty and sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for 9 months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to pay grade E-1. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged but suspended confinement in excess of 3 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">Appellant has assigned three errors. We will not address Assignments of Error I and III unless the case comes before us again as the result of our disposition of Assignment of Error II, which asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-12\">THE STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE WHO PREPARED THE POST TRIAL REVIEW WAS DISQUALIFIED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHQ\">A. BECAUSE HIS PRETRIAL ADVICE MISSTATED THE LAW MATERIAL TO THE CONVENING AUTHORITY\u2019S RESOLUTION OF THE CHARGES;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-14\">B. BECAUSE THE MILITARY JUDGE RULED THAT HE WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">The staff judge advocate did not inform the convening authority in the original pretrial advice that among the options available to the convening authority was the referral of a lesser included offense of desertion to a forum other than a general court-martial for adjudication. In response to a defense motion at trial, the military judge ordered a supplemental pretrial advice. In the new supplemental advice the staff judge advocate clearly misstated the pertinent law as well as the rationale behind his recommendation that the convening authority adhere to his original decision. Once again the defense objected to the staff judge advocate\u2019s criterion for the selection of a trial forum. The military judge ruled that the challenged portion was \u201cclearly inappropriate\u201d; he then held that the staff judge advocate transcended the parameters of his Article 34, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 834, duties to such an extent that the staff judge advocate was disqualified from acting further in the case. The judge thereupon ordered a second supplemental Article 34 advice letter prepared by a judge advocate not associated with the convening authority\u2019s staff judge advocate\u2019s office. The order was followed; the convening authority, however, maintained his previous decision regarding referral to a general court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">The defense originally had asked for a new pretrial advice. They got such advice and then made a motion to dismiss. This motion was denied, but the military judge provided appropriate relief in the form of the second supplemental advice prepared by someone outside the convening authority\u2019s staff judge advocate\u2019s office. The military judge found that the advice letter as supplemented was adequate and that the case properly was referred to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">Sandwiched in the middle of this motion practice was the denial of a motion to dismiss for violation of Article 37, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 837. The root cause for this motion was the original supplemental advice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>the staff judge advocate, Commander R. L. Wilkins, JAGC, USN, which improperly advised the convening authority that the Chief of Naval Operations \u201cdoes not appreciate being tasked\u201d with court-martial review duties, which he would have to do if the convening authority did other than adhere to his original decision to refer the case to a general court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">After trial, the staff judge advocate who wrote the original supplemental advice proceeded to review the case for the convening authority; this review included advice on the Article 37 motion, notwithstanding the military judge\u2019s finding that the staff judge advocate\u2019s previous action disqualified him from acting further in the case. The staff judge advocate opined that he was not disqualified from further action, having articulated the standard for disqualification of a staff judge advocate to be \u201cinsatiable prosecutorial lust.\u201d We reject this standard outright; this rejection, however, does not end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The military judge at trial was attempting to carry out his trial duties in accordance with the teachings of <em>United States v. Collins, </em>6 M.J. 256 (CMA 1979). It is apparent from the record that the military judge felt that the staff judge advocate was disqualified from preparing the post-trial advice. Criteria for disqualification of a staff judge advocate from participating in the post-trial review are prior disqualifying participation as set out in Article 6(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 806(c); preparation of a pretrial advice that is not correct in all material aspects, both of fact and law, <em>United States v. Collins, </em>supra; and conduct which \u201cmay be so antithetical to the integrity of the military justice system as to disqualify him from participation,\u201d <em>United States v. Engle, </em>1 M.J. 387, 389 (CMA 1976). In making special findings<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the military judge should have provided those facts which he utilized in arriving at his conclusionary statement of disqualification<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which showed that the staff judge advocate had misstated a material fact, omitted a fact, arrived at an erroneous factual conclusion, or made misstatements of law material to the convening authority\u2019s conclusion. In doing so the judge would have provided the staff judge advocate or reviewing authority with meaningful facts upon which to base a determination of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The problem with the military judge\u2019s statement of disqualification of the staff judge advocate is that in its language it extends beyond the necessity for disqualification of the staff judge advocate. The staff judge advocate who had drafted the faulty supplemental Article 34 advice was not required to review his original faulty pretrial advice when preparing his post-trial advice. This issue had been mooted by the military judge\u2019s grant of appropriate relief. The relief sought was awarded, and was accomplished by the subsequent pretrial advice of another person acting as staff judge advocate for the convening authority; the convening authority\u2019s conscious effort not to be influenced by the faulty advice is evidenced by remarks he made on the subsequent pretrial advice when referring the case to trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, without an existing necessity to review his work on the pretrial advice there was no <em>per se </em>disqualification of the original supplemental advice staff judge advocate from conducting the post-trial review. We are thus constrained to reject the military judge\u2019s reading of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>that he had the authority in this case to disqualify the staff judge advocate from conducting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>post-trial review. The judge\u2019s role is to make findings of fact, for an alleged pretrial deficiency may be immaterial, as here, or a material deficiency might not be prejudicial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Upon further review we do not see in the record any matter which would cause disqualification under Article 6(c), UCMJ. As to conduct which might be antithetical to the integrity of the military justice system, standing alone the staff judge advocate\u2019s advice calling upon the convening authority to utilize improper matters in his determination of the proper forum would not necessarily require his disqualification. The advice, however, does not stand alone; it is here combined with highly erroneous advice that the standard for disqualification of the author attorney was \u201cinsatiable prosecutorial lust,\u201d a standard so far removed from existing law to be ludicrous. A staff judge advocate\u2019s primary function when advising a convening or supervisory authority is to clarify the law as well as the facts of a particular case. <em>See United States v. Powis, </em>8 M.J. 809 (NCMR 1980). Only when the reviewing authority is properly advised can he perform an informed and legally acceptable review of the case, which of necessity includes a review of the advice, past and present, given him by his staff attorney. In this case, as we have said, there was no need for post-trial discussion of the Article 37 motion, given the remedy fashioned and appellant\u2019s subsequent plea of guilty. <em>See United States v. Packer, </em>8 M.J. 785 (NCMR 1980). The motion was discussed, however, and as part of his discussion the staff judge advocate compounded his error by giving the convening authority more bad advice. This misadvice thereby coupled two highly improper standards, crippling the convening authority\u2019s ability to accomplish a complete and proper review of the case as a whole. It is at this point, then, that the staff judge advocate\u2019s activity reached in this case such a level as to be \u201cantithetical to the military justice system.\u201d To maintain the integrity of the system, which requires laymen to review the legal matters concerned, and to protect the interests of the service member involved, we demand more accurate advice than that given here.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Accordingly, the convening authority\u2019s action is set aside and the ease is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy in order that a new post-trial review can be prepared by another staff judge advocate for submission to the convening authority, for another action.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Senior Judge BAUM and Judge PRICE concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">. <em>United States v.
