On our own motion we have chosen to reconsider the case in order to correct two errors made by the convening authority in his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">First, the convening authority\u2019s action not only approves the findings and sentence, but also orders the sentence executed. Since he does not have the authority to order a sentence to confinement at hard labor for a year into execution until it is reviewed by this Court, the portion of his action purporting to do so is illegal as premature and, hence, void. Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), paragraph 98; <em>United States v. Parker, </em>45 C.M.R. 546 (A.C.M.R.1972), <em>pet. denied, </em>45 C.M.R. 928 (C.M.A.1972); <em>United States v. White, </em>25 C.M.R. 733 (N.B.R.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">Second, the convening authority erroneously directed the forfeitures applicable to allowances as well as pay becoming due on and after the date of his action. <em>United States v. Lovejoy, </em>39 C.M.R. 774 (A.C.M.R. 1968), <em>pet. denied, </em>39 C.M.R. 293 (C.M.A.1969) .</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">The Court adheres to its original decision of 22 October 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed. However, the forfeitures shall apply to <em>pay </em>becoming due on and after the date of the convening authority\u2019s action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
