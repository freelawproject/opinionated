It is apparent that the supervisory authority\u2019s action transmitting the record to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy meets the requirements of both <em>United States v. Keller, </em>1 M.J. 159 (CMA 1975), and <em>United States v. Harris, </em>No. 80 0231 (NCMR 30 May 1980). The former case mandates a justification for the supervisory authority\u2019s action when it differs from that recommended by his staff judge advocate. The latter case calls for a comparison of the staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation with the action showing what the supervisory authority considered as substantial factors influencing his action. Here the supervisory authority considered (1) the recommendation, (2) the general nature of the offense, (3) the appellant, (4) the circumstances surrounding the offense and, (5) the effect of the offense on appellant\u2019s command. No more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Accordingly, the findings and sentence as approved on review below are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
