The approved sentence includes confinement at hard labor for nine months (now served), a bad-conduct discharge, reduction to the grade of Private El, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. The record is before us for review pursuant to Article 66, Uniform Code of Military Justice, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">Each of the four specifications alleging solicitation in violation of Article 134 alleges that the appellant \u201cdid, at Fort Benning, Georgia, on or about [a specified date], wrongfully solicit [a named soldier] to commit an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to wit: to possess marihuana.\u201d The appellant contends that these specifications do not allege an offense because the possession of marihuana is not alleged to have been unlawful and is, therefore, noncriminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">This contention was made for the first time in the trial defense counsel\u2019s rebuttal to the staff judge advocate\u2019s post-trial review. The court agrees with and adopts the following analysis by the staff judge advocate in an addendum to his review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">[T]he allegations referred to by the defense counsel do contain the essence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>criminality which the defense argues is missing. The accused in each of the specifications referred to by the defense is charged with \u2018wrongfully soliciting ... to possess marihuana.\u2019 The fair import of this allegation is not that the act of solicitation was wrongful because the act solicited was lawful but that the solicitation was wrongful because the act solicited was wrongful. I would have to assume that the defense counsel desired the government to charge the accused with wrongfully soliciting the victim to wrongfully possess marihuana. This may clarify for the defense the theory the government was proceeding upon but, in my opinion, this does not add to the basic underlying criminal nature of the allegation now argued by the defense to be legally insufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Allied Papers, Addendum to Post Trial Review, par. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Similarly, appellate counsel for the Government argue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">[A]ppellant asserts that <em>United States v. Brice, </em>17 U.S.C.M.A. 336, 38 C.M.R. 134 (1967), requires \u2018words of criminality\u2019 in order for a specification alleging possession of marihuana to state an offense. The Government agrees and contends that the instant specifications meet that test in at least two ways. Both the word \u2018wrongfully,\u2019 used before \u2018solicit,\u2019 and the language \u2018to commit an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice\u2019 satisfy <em>Brice, supra....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Reply to the Assignment of Error at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Another case relied upon by appellant is discussed by the Government in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-10\">Appellant also contends that <em>United States v. Oakley, </em>7 U.S.C.M.A. 733, 23 C.M.R. 197 (1957), supports his view. In <em>Oakley, </em>the accused was charged with wrongfully soliciting another to procure poison to be used to poison a third person and that the intended use of the poison was made known to the individual solicited to procure the poison. Oakley argued that the act solicited [which had not been alleged to be \u2018an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u2019 as was alleged in this case] was not alleged to be wrongful and could have been innocently intended.... Reading the whole specification the Court of Military Appeals concluded that the criminal nature and intent of Oakley\u2019s solicitation was made clear. So in the absence of magic words such as wrongful or unlawful it is a question of whether the \u2018necessary facts [of criminality] appear in any form or by fair construction can be found\u2019 in the specification ... [citing <em>United States v. Sell, </em>3 U.S.C.M.A. 202, 206, 11 C.M.R. 202, 206 (1953)]. The Government respectfully submits that the instant specifications satisfy that test. As appellant notes, in attempting to distinguish <em>Oakley, </em>\u2018Oakley had solicited an act violating the UCMJ\u2019 (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 4). The specifications in question charged appellant with soliciting just such an act, one which violates the Code. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is without merit....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6d\">Id. at 4-5. <em>Cf. United States v. Torrey, </em>10 M.J. 508 (A.F.C.M.R.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">We so hold. The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Judge CLAUSE and Judge FOREMAN concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
