He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement at hard labor for thirty-six months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the grade of Private (E-l). The sentence was approved by the convening authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">On 14 March 1979, the appellant was apprehended at the German-Dutch border for possession of the hashish after it was discovered under the back seat of a vehicle which he was driving. His defense at trial was lack of knowledge concerning the hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The appellant was represented at trial by detailed military counsel and by civilian counsel. The only government witness to testify as to Specialist Jeancoq\u2019s knowledge of possession was a Sergeant Brown. The appellant\u2019s civilian counsel had represented Sergeant Brown on unrelated drug charges, prior to Specialist Jeancoq\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The appellant assigns as error the effectiveness of his civilian defense counsel in that he had a potential conflict of interest which thereby denied the appellant the assistance of counsel mandated by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">We assume, without deciding, that at the time of the appellant\u2019s trial there existed a potential conflict of interest on the part of the civilian counsel. Upon consideration of the entire record and the numerous post-trial affidavits, we also conclude that the military judge was not informed by any party to the trial of the potential conflict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), we find no error. While the present case does not entail multiple representation, the representation of the appellant and the primary government witness against him is so similar as to bring this case within the holding of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">Therein the Court stated at 346-47, 100 S.Ct. at 1717:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-14\">Defense counsel have an ethical obligation to avoid conflicting representations and to advise the court promptly when a conflict of interest arises during the course of a trial. Absent special circumstances, therefore, trial courts may assume either that multiple representation entails no conflict or that the lawyer and his clients knowingly accept such risk of conflict as may exist.... \u2018An attorney ... is in the best position professionally and ethically to determine when a conflict of interest exists or will probably develop in the course of a trial.\u2019 (citations omitted). Unless the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists, the court need not initiate an inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">As in <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, supra, </em>there is nothing to indicate that the trial judge had an obligation to inquire whether there was a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">A potential conflict of interest is an inadequate basis upon which to attack a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An appellant \u201cwho raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance\u201d before a Sixth Amendment violation will be found.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our review of the entire record reveals no such conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-18\">Chief Judge RECTOR concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\">. Thus this case differs from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 M.J. 430 (C.M.A.1977), wherein the military judge was aware of a potential conflict of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-19\">. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>at 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1717.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-20\">. <em>Id. See also United States v. Hearst, </em>638 F.2d 1190, (CA9, 1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>O\u2019DONNELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ATX\">concurring in the result:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">I agree, giving due consideration to the conflicting affidavits introduced before us, that the military judge was not required to conduct an inquiry as he was unaware of any possible conflict of interest on the part of the civilian counsel. <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). <em>Cf., United States v. Davis, </em>3 M.J. 430 (C.M.A.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Unlike the majority, I conclude that an actual conflict of interest existed in this case as a result of the civilian counsel\u2019s previous representation of a government witness. I agree, however, that the appellant has not demonstrated that this conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance. <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
