Despite his pleas, he was also convicted of separate offenses of possession of marijuana and hashish. The approved sentence extends to a bad conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for eighteen months, total forfeitures and reduction to airman basic.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-26\">The accused was observed selling hashish by an undercover Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) agent, Ms. S, on four occasions prior to 1 March 1979. One sale was made to her. On 1 March, the accused made a further sale to S. At that time, as well as earlier, she told the accused that she wanted to buy a larger quantity of hashish, apparently an amount larger than the accused could sell. As a result, the accused arranged for S to meet a Sergeant Kitchen for this larger buy. The stipulated facts at trial were that the accused and Kitchen agreed to sell the hashish to S while in the accused\u2019s- barracks room, and that subsequently, pursuant to the agreement, Kitchen sold 99 grams of hashish to S in a different barracks room. The accused\u2019s participation in the arrangements, which date back to early February, forms the basis for the conspiracy offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Appellate defense counsel now claim that the accused, because he was unable himself to sell the larger quantity, simply introduced S to Sergeant Kitchen and that the accused never acknowledged the existence of a conspiracy. In support of their claim of an improvident plea, they point to accused\u2019s statement during the <em>Care </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> inquiry that he did not profit from this transaction and did not participate in all the discussions between S and Sergeant Kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">In our view, acceptance of accused\u2019s plea is supported in law and fact by the record, and the claim of improvidency is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">During the existence of a conspiracy, each conspirator is liable for all of the acts of other members of the conspiracy done in pursuance of the conspiracy unless he effectively abandons or withdraws from the conspiracy. Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.), paragraph 160; <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946); <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>142 U.S. 450, 12 S.Ct. 292, 35 L.Ed. 1077 (1892). The scope and extent of a conspiracy must be determined from the available record. <em>United States v. Kidd, </em>13 U.S.C.M.A. 184, 32 C.M.R. 184 (1962). Its existence may be proved by circumstantial as well as by direct evidence. <em>United States v. Salisbury, </em>14 U.S.C.M.A. 171, 33 C.M.R. 383 (1963); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>9 M.J. 599 (A.F.C.M.R.1980), pet. denied, 9 M.J. 413 (C.M.A., 1980). As the Manual for Courts-Martial, <em>.supra, </em>paragraph 160, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">The agreement in a conspiracy need not be in any <em>particular form nor manifested in any formal words. </em>It is sufficient if the minds of the parties arrive at a <em>common understanding to accomplish the object </em>of the conspiracy, and this may be <em>shown by the conduct of the parties. </em>The agreement need not state the means by which the conspiracy is to be accomplished or what part each conspirator is to play. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">In this case, we are convinced that the accused and Sergeant Kitchen arrived at a common understanding to sell hashish. In addition to the discussion on 1 March the accused had talked with Kitchen about this larger sale to S in early February. We find no reason to question the providency of accused\u2019s plea. Accused fully acknowledged the existence of the conspiracy during the <em>Care </em>inquiry as the following demonstrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">MJ: And was there any overt understanding or public understanding between yourself and Kitchen that he was going to make that sale to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">Acc: , Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">MJ: Did you understand at the time that you were bringing Kitchen in and at the time you were suggesting to [S] that she buy from him that when you what you were agreeing to do was a violation' of the Uniform Code of Military Justice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">MJ: Specifically, that you were being a party to a wrongful sale of marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-16\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-17\">MJ: And that you were, in essence, making an agreement with Kitchen that he would make the wrongful sale to [S]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-18\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-19\">MJ: Any question in your mind about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-20\">ACC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-21\">MJ: Now, do you also acknowledge that while the agreement took place or while you were still involved in that particular series of events, that, in fact, the sale did take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-22\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-23\">MJ: Okay, you knew that it took place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-24\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-25\">MJ: And you knew that it took place in furtherance of that arrangement that you\u2019d made and that agreement that you had with Kitchen, as well as with [S]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-26\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-27\">MJ: Any question in your mind about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ACC: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">MJ: You are certain that the transfer did take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">MJ: And that the substance transferred was hashish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">ACC: Sir, I couldn\u2019t be certain of that, because I didn\u2019t see what he handed her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">MJ: Did you believe that it was hashish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">MJ: And that\u2019s certainly what you had foreseen in making that agreement? ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> <em>United States v.
