The judge recessed the trial and directed that invitational travel orders be tendered to the doctor so that he might travel to the overseas area to examine the accused, but the doctor did not accept the offer or examine the accused. Based on the information provided in the letter, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by ruling that the psychiatrist was not a material witness and refusing to provide expert witness fees for him. <em>United States v.
