As pointed out in the individual defense counsel\u2019s <em>Goode </em>response to the review of the staff judge advocate, the record discloses several comments by the prosecutor which exceeded acceptable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>bounds of fair advocacy, and affronted the spirit, if not the letter, of the ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function, \u00a7\u00a7 5.8(b), 5.8(c), 5.9, and 6.1(a). <em>See, United States v. Doctor, </em>7 U.S.C.M.A. 126, 21 C.M.R. 252 (1956). On balance, we also find it difficult to conclude that the trial counsel maintained the courteous and respectful attitude required by paragraph 42b, Manual for Courts-Martial, 1969 (Rev.).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In his opening argument on sentence, the trial counsel expressed his personal opinion at two points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-5\">TC: .. . The accused probably, in the feeling of the United States, has the most deplorably, despicable military record that has ever been seen, at least by this trial counsel in a military court____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">. . . Any period of confinement less than four years would be an absolute mockery and a joke ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Later, during his argument on sentence, individual defense counsel was responding to the trial counsel\u2019s suggestion that the court should \u201clock [the accused] up and throw the key away,\u201d when he was interrupted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">IDC: .. . It\u2019s not going to make [the accused\u2019s] parents happy; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it\u2019s certainly not going to make him happy. It\u2019s not going to make the people in this courtroom watching happy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">TC:----Actually, it will make me happy, Your Honor. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">We believe that counsel should conduct themselves with the same high standards in arguing to a military judge alone as they would in arguing to a court constituted with members, notwithstanding the presumption that a military judge exercises discretion in distinguishing between proper and improper argument. <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>20 U.S.C.M.A. 35, 42 C.M.R. 227 (1970); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>1 M.J. 856 (A.F.C.M.R.1976). Consequently, in the interest of justice, and the appearance of justice, we have decided, on the facts of this case, to reassess the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and so much of the sentence as provides for a dishonorable discharge, confinement at hard labor for two (2) years, and forfeiture of $299.00 per month for 24 months are</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b818-26\"> The accused\u2019s parents were witnesses at the sentencing portion of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
