Knight appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The issue is whether the jury was properly instructed on the lesser included offense of mitigated deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">This case arose from a drug deal gone sour. In January 1990, Knight and his long-time friend Donald Brey agreed to travel from Billings, Montana, to California, with the purpose of buying cocaine for resale in Montana. Brey had the necessary \u201cconnections\u201d in California. They purchased the cocaine and financed the trip with $7,000 Knight had received from an insurance settlement. Knight and Brey agreed that Brey would sell the approximately four ounces of cocaine they purchased and that they would divide the profits from this venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">Following the trip to California, Knight began having trouble reaching Brey. On the occasions when he did reach Brey, Brey told him that he could not yet pay him his share of the money because the cocaine was not selling as quickly as expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>On February 11, 1990, Knight learned that Brey had moved from Billings to Laurel, Montana, about fifteen miles away. Knight was upset that Brey had not told him he was moving. A mutual acquaintance directed Knight to the house Brey was renting in Laurel, but Brey was not home. At about 10:00 p.m., Knight returned alone to Brey\u2019s house in Laurel. Brey and his cousin Cody Puckett were in the garage working on a car. Knight kicked open a side door to the garage and confronted Brey about the money. When Brey put him off, Knight drew a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Knight\u2019s trial testimony about what happened next differed from that of Puckett, who also testified at trial. Knight testified that Brey kicked his hand, causing the gun to go off in Brey\u2019s face. Puckett testified that Knight fired the gun in Brey\u2019s face. Brey died immediately. Knight further testified that he believed Puckett had a gun. He shot Puckett several times before fleeing the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Knight surrendered to authorities the next day. He was charged with the deliberate homicide of Brey and the attempted deliberate homicide of Puckett, who survived wounds to bis leg, chest, and shoulder. The District Court sentenced Knight to 100 years in the Montana State Prison on each count plus ten additional years on each count for the use of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the jury was properly instructed on mitigated deliberate homicide as a lesser included offense to deliberate homicide. Settlement of instructions began prior to Knight\u2019s presentation of evidence in his defense. At that time, the State offered its proposed instruction 5A, which defined both deliberate homicide and mitigated deliberate homicide. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Any objections to 5A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u201c[KNIGHT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: If Your Honor please, if the Court concludes a mitigated deliberate is a lesser included, I at least do have an objection as to 5A the way it is now, if you\u2019d like to hear that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">\u201c[KNIGHT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well, Your Honor, we would take the position that with respect to 45-5-103(2), that on \u2014 and I realize that\u2019s the statute as it now exists in the state of Montana. We\u2019re taking the position that it is unconstitutional switching of the burden of proof to the defendant. That he\u2019s put in a position to \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Off the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">The court refused both parties\u2019 instructions on lesser included offen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ses, stating that it would \u201cpass\u201d on instructions on that subject \u201cuntil we find out what the evidence really is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">After all of the evidence was presented, the court and counsel met again to settle the remaining jury instructions. The court proposed its own instructions on deliberate homicide and mitigated deliberate homicide. When asked if there were any objections to the instructions proposed by the court, Knight\u2019s attorney replied,</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I put any objections I have on the record yesterday, most notably the one \u201d I believe it was State\u2019s 15 or 15A \u201c concerning the burden of proof on mitigated deliberate, and <em>I have no problems with the Court\u2019s Instructions as redone.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.] The comb\u2019s proposed instructions were given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The State emphasizes that Knight\u2019s counsel specifically stated that he no longer had any objection to the instructions proposed by the court. Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, provides that a claim of error which was not objected to at trial may be noticed on appeal only if the claimed error affected jurisdictional or constitutional rights, was prejudicial as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment, and meets one of three additional requirements. Knight has not alleged that his claim of error meets any of those three requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Knight maintains that he clearly placed on the record his objection to the statutory scheme on mitigated deliberate homicide and that this objection is retained. We conclude that, after the above exchanges during the settlement of jury instructions, any surviving objection is limited to the constitutionality of \u00a7 45-5-103(2), MCA. Therefore, the issue on appeal is limited. We will examine Knight\u2019s arguments that under Montana\u2019s statutes regarding the degrees of homicide, it is impossible for a jury to be able to consider mitigating evidence and that the defense of mitigated deliberate homicide as it is defined in Montana\u2019s statute unconstitutionally shifts the burden of proof to the criminal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Section 45-5-102, MCA, provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">\u201c(a) he purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Section 45-5-103, MCA, provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of mitigated deliberate homicide when he purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being but does so under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>reasonableness of such explanation or excuse shall be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u201c(2) It is an affirmative defense that the defendant acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional stress for which there was reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which shall be determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the actor\u2019s situation. This defense constitutes a mitigating circumstance reducing deliberate homicide to mitigated deliberate homicide and must be proved by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Knight points out that the customary method of instructing juries regarding consideration of lesser included offenses is to have the jury first consider the charged offense. If they do not find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged offense, then and only then are they to proceed to consideration of the lesser included offense. In this case, the elements of the charged offense, deliberate homicide, are 1) purposefully or knowingly, and 2) causing the death of another human being. The lesser included offense of mitigated deliberate homicide also has those two elements, plus a third element: 3) defendant acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional distress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Knight is correct that this situation requires carefully drafted jury instructions. The jury must be informed that, if the defendant meets the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted under the influence of extreme mental or emotional distress for which there is reasonable explanation or excuse, they may find the defendant guilty of mitigated deliberate homicide, <em>even though all </em>the <em>elements of deliberate homicide are present. </em>We conclude, however, that nothing in the statutes restricts a jury from reaching consideration of mitigated deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Under Montana\u2019s statutes, mitigated deliberate homicide is a lesser included offense of deliberate homicide only if the defendant presents evidence that he acted under extreme mental or emotional stress for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse. <em>State v. Olivieri </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 357, 360, 797 P.2d 937, 939. A statute requiring a defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the presence of mitigating factors in support of an affirmative defense does not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to the defendant. <em>Patterson v. New York </em>(1977), 432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed. 2d 281. The State</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\u201cis not required to prove the nonexistence of every fact which it is willing to recognize as an exculpatory or mitigating circumstance affecting the degree of culpability or the severity of the punishment. [Citations omitted.] The due process clause does not put the states to a choice between abandoning affirmative defenses \u2018or undertaking to disprove their existence in order to convict of a crime which otherwise is within its constitutional powers to sanction ...\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><em>State v. Sorenson </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 155, 161-62, 619 P.2d 1185, 1189, citing <em>Patterson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We hold that the above statutes do not prevent a jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence and that \u00a7 45-5-103(2), MCA, does not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to a criminal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-7\">JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER, and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
