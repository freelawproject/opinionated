The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearings examiner who deemed Stuker \u201cpartially permanently disabled\u201d due to a torn biceps muscle. The court awarded Stuker $122.74 per week for 75 weeks under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-705 through -708, MCA (1985), along with attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">We restate the issues presented by the claimant into a single issue: whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in its findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Stuker is a thirty-six-year-old male who graduated from Havre High School in 1972 and did not pursue additional schooling. He worked short-term jobs before entering the Army, including in a bakery as a helper, and in a department store as a custodian. In the Army he drove a truck with a special military driver\u2019s license. He remained in the Army until 1976 and then returned to Havre. He worked a series of shortterm, often parttime jobs, including: driving a grain truck, serving customers as a clerk in a grocery store and filling orders for a company that distributed products such as potato chips. He also worked as a tire repairman for approximately ten months before being laid off. Stuker then became involved in various types of seasonal work including roofing houses and helping on his relatives\u2019 ranches. The roofing operation began in 1980 when he submitted roofing bids to general contractors. In addition to roofing, Stuker began working for his uncle on the Stuker Ranch each year during March and April, beginning in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In March 1986 while working for his uncle on the Stuker Ranch, Stuker began to experience pain in his right shoulder after lifting hay bales but continued working anyway. In early April, 1986, while lifting an irrigation tarp, Stuker felt instant pain in the biceps muscle region of his right arm. Stuker thought he had hyperextended his arm; he treated it with a heating pad and continued to work until April 17,1986, the end of calving season. Stuker saw Dr. Kelly in late April about the injury; Dr. Kelly consulted with Dr. Luettjohann, who diagnosed Stuker\u2019s problem as a torn biceps muscle. Stuker continued to see Dr. Luettjohann in 1986. A subsequent visit in 1987 and exploratory surgery in January 1987, revealed that Stuker sustained a ruptured biceps muscle.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In February 1987, Stuker worked for two different uncles performing ranching duties. Dr. Luettjohann had advised him he could return to work depending on his comfort level. Accordingly, he worked for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the Stuker Ranch in March and April 1987 doing the night check on cattle. Here he monitored the cattle herd and assisted with the birthing of calves. Later he worked for his uncle Ira Hammond, for three or four weeks doing dry farming. Stuker plowed fields, planted grain and drove a truck and tractor. In both 1988 and 1989 Stuker again worked for Ira Hammond from January to May. Stuker also engaged in softball and fishing activities throughout the years. Stuker did not apply for any jobs other than farm jobs with his relatives. He stated that he preferred to work for his relatives. The record indicates the following income reported on Stuker\u2019s tax returns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">Year Income from Roofing Total Income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAz\">1980 $337.00 $1,376.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asn\">1981 $378.00 $ 404.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">1982 none none</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1D\">1983 $860.00 $1,511.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnZ\">1984 $737.00 $1,683.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">1985 $441.00 $1,373.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Stuker claims that as a result of the injury, he cannot lift more than twenty pounds on a consistent basis, and that he experiences headaches and numbness in his arm and fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">A Workers\u2019 Compensation claimant can choose between two different types of awards. <em>Walker v. Johnson </em>(1978), 180 Mont. 405, 411, 591 P.2d 181, 184. According to the statutory scheme of 1985, Stuker could pursue a loss of earning capacity disability award under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-703, MCA (1985), or he could pursue an indemnity award under 39-71-705 through -708. A disability award is based on the \u201cactual loss of earning capacity resulting from the injury,\u201d whereas an indemnity benefit awards compensation for \u201cpossible loss of earning capacity in the future.\u201d <em>McAlear v. McKee </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 462, 467, 558 P.2d 1134, 1137; citing <em>Jones v. Glac. General Assurance Co. </em>(1965), 145 Mont. 326, 400 P.2d 888. An indemnity benefit is \u201ccompensation regardless of earnings to compensate for possible loss of earning capacity in the future.\u201d <em>McAlear, </em>171 Mont. at 467, 558 P.2d at 1137; citing <em>Jones, </em>145 Mont. 326, 400 P.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">Stuker elected to pursue an indemnity award under 39-71-705 through -708, MCA (1985). Section 39-71-706, MCA (1985), \u201c[p]rovides for applying the percentage of disability in determining the number of weeks of compensation under the <em>indemnity </em>alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tive, where injury is less than total loss of a scheduled member, or where the injury is a \u2018whole man\u2019 injury not scheduled.\u201d <em>McDanold v. B.N. Transport, Inc. </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 470, 478, 679 P.2d 1188, 1192. This means that the permanent partial disability percentage is multiplied by the 500 week maximum to arrive at the number of weeks of payments. In the case at bar, the court arrived at a 15% disability percentage. Stuker elected to proceed under \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-705 through -708, MCA (1985), and since Stuker\u2019s injury is not among those specifically listed in \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-705, MCA (1985), which imposes durational limitations, the correct calculation is as follows: 15% x 500 = 75 weeks. In the case at bar, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court used the proper method to calculate the duration of Mr. Stuker\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The record indicates that in arriving at the 15% disability percentage the court considered the testimony of the experts, the claimant\u2019s \u201cage education, work experience, pain and disability, actual wage loss, and the loss of future earning capacity.\u201d <em>Hartman v. National Union Fire Insurance </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 141, 145, 768 P.2d 1380, 1383; citing <em>Flake v. Aetna </em>(1977), 175 Mont. 127, 129, 572 P. 2d 907, 909. The court specifically addressed each of these factors as evidenced by its own statement in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cIn calculating a permanent partial disability award under Section 39-71-705 through -708, MCA, this Court has considered the following factors in determining the claimant\u2019s loss of earning capacity under that section. These factors include consideration of the actual wage loss, work experience, education, age, pain, and the 12 percent impairment rating of the whole person assigned by his treating physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Accordingly, the hearings examiner addressed Stuker\u2019s past work history and indicated that his pre-injury work record was extremely limited. This fact made it more difficult to establish the impairment of Stuker\u2019s earning capacity and was adequately discussed. The court correctly refused to speculate what Stuker\u2019s wages would have been had he actively sought employment, especially when the record indicates that Stuker\u2019s work efforts were minimal. Stuker\u2019s post-injury earning capacity indicates that he will earn more than he did in any of the five years prior to his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The court also considered Dr. Luettjohann\u2019s 12% impairment rating to the whole man based on the injury to Stuker\u2019s right arm and the pain involved when exceeding his lifting capacity. The court acknowledged that Stuker cannot perform heavy labor but has \u201c[flive approved occupations he can perform in his labor market.\u201d The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>stated that exceeding Stuker\u2019s lifting capacity will cause him to experience pain which lasts thirty minutes or less. In total, the court made a finding that Stuker \u201cis not suffering from such pain or disability that would reduce his earnings in the occupations approved as being within his physical capacity.\u201d Finally, the court notes that Stuker is a young man of thirty-six and can obtain additional training by his own choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On appeal, we -will not overturn the findings of fact of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court if there is substantial credible evidence to support them in the record. <em>Grenz v. Fire and Casualty of Connecticut </em>(1991), [250 Mont. 323,] 820 P.2d 472, 475, 48 St.Rep. 967, 969; citing <em>Kraft v. Flathead Valley Labor &amp; Contr. </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 363, 365, 792 P.2d 1094, 1095. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law will be upheld if the tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Grenz, </em>820 P.2d at 745, 48 St.Rep. at 969; citing Steer, <em>Inc., v. Dept. of </em>Revenue\u201d <em>(1990), </em>245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603. Clearly in the case at bar, the comb supported its findings of fact with substantial credible evidence and it made correct conclusions of law. Therefore, we will not disturb the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER, and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
