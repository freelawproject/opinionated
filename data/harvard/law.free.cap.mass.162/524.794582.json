Writ dated January 29, 1894. The Franklin Savings Bank, summoned as trustee, answered that, at the time of service upon it, there was in its hands the sum of $133.33, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>which was subject to the order of the defendant \u201c upon the fulfilment of certain conditions \u201d; and this answer was sworn to. The trustee afterwards, by leave of court, filed an additional answer, alleging that the trustee lent the defendant a certain sum of money upon a promissory note secured by a mortgage of real estate in Boston, of which the plaintiff was life tenant, the defendant being the remainderman in fee, and out of that sum retained the sum of $133.33 as a deposit to protect the trustee against the plaintiff\u2019s life estate, and upon the condition that the trustee should surrender the same to the defendant as soon as the life estate should cease as an estate superior to the trustee\u2019s claim; that subsequently the real estate was conveyed to a third person, the plaintiff releasing her interest therein, on January 15,1894, and the mortgage was afterwards discharged by the trustee, and the note surrendered as paid, the trustee having no further claim by reason thereof; and that, at the time of service upon it, the trustee had in its hands said sum of $133.33 as the property of the defendant, with no claim of the trustee thereon, except as the facts above stated would entitle it to any claim. This answer was not sworn to. Robert S. Hall appeared as claimant of the funds in the hands of the trustee, alleging certain facts not necessary to be stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Mason, C.

We find no question of law in the bill of exceptions presented by the defendant. The defendant contends, in a general way, that so far as appears by the record the Superior Court was not entirely just towards him. We see no reason to think so. The defendant filed a general appearance, and a motion for leave to defend the action on the judgment as of the original suit. He afterwards sought to withdraw his general appearance, but this the court declined to allow. The court also overruled the motion. These were both matters within the discretion of the court. The latter is expressly made so by statute. Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>2. The trustee was charged on its answer, and the claimant\u2019s claim was disallowed. Both the defendant and the claimant appealed. We will deal first with the appeal of the latter. A claimant cannot be allowed to prove that nothing was due from the trustee to the principal defendant. <em>Clark </em>v. Gardner, 123 Mass. 358. <em>Moors </em>v. Goddard, 147 Mass. 287, 290. He appears for the purpose of showing that he is entitled to the goods, effects, or credits which may be in the hands of the supposed trustee; and he may allege and prove any facts not stated nor denied by the supposed trustee. Pub. Sts. c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 36. In this case the claimant has alleged certain facts, but proved none. It does not appear that any evidence whatever was introduced or offered in support of his claim, or that any ruling of law was asked for or given in respect thereto. No question of law is presented by the claimant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">3. We come now to the defendant\u2019s appeal. It has- been said that the principal defendant has no right of appeal from an order charging a trustee. <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>99 Mass. 501. <em>Wasson </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>117 Mass. 91, 96. The defendant, however, contends that he has an interest to appeal, because a judgment against the trustee will discharge him from the defendant\u2019s claim against him. <em>Webster </em>v. Lowell, 2 Allen, 123. However this may be, no error is shown in the order charging the trustee. The chief ground of complaint is that the trustee\u2019s supplemental answer was not upon oath. An objection of this kind must be taken at the hearing, or it will be deemed to have been waived. The omission was probably by inadvertence, and might have been remedied at once if attention had been called to it. The defendant might have alleged and proved other facts not stated nor denied by the trustee, if he had seen fit to do so. Pub. Sts. c. 183, \u00a7 17. But he did not. He submitted the matter to the determination of the court upon the trustee\u2019s answers, without further proof or allegation, and, so far as appears, without calling attention to the want of an oath to the supplemental answer. The trustee was properly charged. According to the terms of its two answers, the defendant\u2019s money which the trustee retained as a protection or security against the plaintiff\u2019s life estate became absolutely due by the extinction of that estate prior to the service upon the trustee in the present action. Even with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>out the supplemental answer, the trustee, admitting funds, and showing no right to retain them, might it would seem be held chargeable. <em>Defendant\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>Order charging trustee affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
