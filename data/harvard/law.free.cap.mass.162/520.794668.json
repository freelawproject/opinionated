If the' direction was correct, the verdict was to stand; otherwise, a hew trial was to be ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>8.

Argument cannot make plainer that the proviso only saves such oleomargarine as is free from coloration or ingredient that causes it to look like butter. The statute did not intend to allow oleomargarine to be made or sold when so colored, whether the particular purchaser was advised of its real character or not. It easily could be sold again to persons who were not advised of it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>156 Mass. 236, 239, 240. We understand that the construction of the statute is the only question intended to be presented. <em>Verdict to stand.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
