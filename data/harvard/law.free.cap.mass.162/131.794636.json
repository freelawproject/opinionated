No question arose under the count for assault and battery. The count for slander alleged that \u201c the defendant, on or about February 16, 1893, publicly, falsely, and maliciously accused the plaintiff of the crime of larceny by words spoken to, of, and concerning the plaintiff substantially as follows: \u2018 You (meaning plaintiff) were the last one in my (meaning the defendant\u2019s) store, you (meaning the plaintiff) have stolen my (meaning the defendant\u2019s) coat, and you (meaning the plaintiff) must have it\u2019; \u2018You (meaning the plaintiff) have stolen my (meaning the defendant\u2019s) coat, you (meaning the plaintiff) must have it \u2019; \u2018I (meaning the defendant) wish you (meaning the plaintiff) had not come into my (meaning the defendant\u2019s) store, for then I would still have my (meaning the defendant\u2019s) coat \u2019; \u2018 You (meaning the plaintiff) must have the coat, you (meaning the plaintiff) have stolen the coat \u2019; \u2018 You (meaning the plaintiff) have stolen the coat; you (meaning the plaintiff) must have it.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Richardson, </em>J., the defendant requested the judge to dismiss the action, as the plaintiff had failed to sustain the burden of proof. The judge ruled that there was evidence for the consideration of the jury, and that it was for them to determine whether the plaintiff had sustained the burden of proof, and instructed the jury in a manner not objected to by either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-3\"><em>J.

Two witnesses besides the plaintiff . herself testified to the speaking of the defamatory words in their presence and hearing. The defendant now contends that the words were privileged by the occasion. The case, however, could not. be withdrawn from the jury on this ground. If the defendant\u2019s goods had been stolen, and if he was trying to find the thief, the plaintiff' was nevertheless entitled to go to the jury upon the question of his good faith in making the charge against her, and also upon the question of his actual malice. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>5 Cush. 104. <em>Brow </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>13 Allen, 239. <em>Dale </em>v.
