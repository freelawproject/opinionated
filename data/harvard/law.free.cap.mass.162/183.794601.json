It is not contended that the complaint is defective in this particular. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Barrett, 108 Mass. 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">It is argued that the complaint should charge that public travel was obstructed, or that the defendant intended to obstruct it. But such an allegation is unnecessary. The language of the ordinance in regard to the obstruction of travel applies only to standing with a team across the highway or street, and to stopping with a team at the side of or near to another team. To stop with a team or carriage upon or across a crosswalk is made an offence by itself, without reference to actual obstruction of public travel, or to an express intent to obstruct it. The obvious reason of the provision is, that such stopping would be likely to interfere with the convenience of the public in passing from one side of the street to the other, even though actual obstruction could not be shown. We are of opinion that, in a city where there is much travel by pedestrians, and where crosswalks are built for their accommodation, such an ordinance is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">What construction should be given to the word \u201cstop,\u201d in the connection in which it is used, is a question which we have no occasion in this case to decide. Very likely it should be held to mean something more than to halt for an instant under an exigency which would require or justify halting.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
