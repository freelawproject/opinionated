After the former decision, reported 161 Mass. 259, the case came on to be heard in the Superior Court upon the question of entering a decree on the decision of the commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-10\">The decree, after reciting the previous proceedings in the cause, contained the following provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-11\">\u201cIt is now, after a full hearing of the parties, hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the decision of said commissioners as to Washington, Chapel, and Guild Streets, as shown and set out in their report, be and the same is hereby affirmed, and that the said company and the said town of Norwood shall forthwith proceed to carry out the work of abolishing the grade crossings of said railroad at Washington Street, at Chapel Street, and at Guild Street, in the way and manner set out in the report of said commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-12\">\u201cAnd that Albert E.

But the act contains this express provision: \u201c The Superior Court, or any justice thereof sitting in equity in any county, shall have jurisdiction to compel compliance with this act, and with the decrees, agreements, and decisions made thereunder; and may issue and enforce such interlocutory decrees and orders as justice may require.\u201d St. 1890, c. 428, \u00a7 8. This authorizes the making of an order for doing the work at the time of confirming the decree of the commissioners, as well as afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Section 7 of the statute expressly authorizes the appointment of an auditor. The appointment in this case was properly made, and properly embodied in the decree confirming the decision of the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\"><em>Decree </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
