F. Davenport, a chemist, to the defendant, which was dated Boston, February 20, 1893, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">\u201c Your milk samples were not received by me until this morning. We close Saturday at 3 p. m., or as soon thereafter as we can finish the particular work in hand. Hence I cannot mail you my report till the next morning. I shall drop the express a note to call for your return empty cans and box.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">\u201c As you see by my report, two of your samples were all right, and the other two, although I have not any doubt that they were watered a little, yet they were so much above twelve per cent solids that I should advise you not to enter them as your first case in court, but with the advice and consent of your mayor to put them on probation upon their payment of all your costs. I accordingly send you bills made out for each of them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">The other letter was from the defendant to Davenport, dated Lawrence, March 21,1893, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">\u201c Enclosed find a sample of Oleo, which I wish you to analyze and report as soon as possible, belonging to one J. J. Caveney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-11\">\u201c In regard to those two first samples (of Feb. 20) of milk, Mayor (Alvin) Mack says it would not be advisable to ask those men to pay the charges, and he desires to know if yon will not call those four samples ten dollars, and let your bill go in the first of next month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-12\">\u201c (Paid ten dollars April 13.) \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-13\">The defendant objected to the admission of the letters, neither of which was referred to in any \u00f3f the alleged conversations. The judge admitted the letters in evidence only for the purpose of showing the intent with which the defendant made the alleged threats.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The jury returned a verdict of guilty ; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-5\"><em>K. P. </em>Moulton, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-6\"><em>W. S. </em>Moody, District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b423-7\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3v\">We cannot see that the two letters had any legitimate tendency to prove a criminal intent on the part of the defendant in the acts which were the subject of the indictment. They were written more than six months before, and related to other persons, and do not show any purpose to collect black-mail of dealers in milk. Since an objection was expressly taken to the admission of this evidence, and since it was admitted as having some tendency to show a criminal intent, and since we are unable to see that it had any such tendency, we feel constrained to grant a new trial, although the other evidence may have been sufficient to warrant the conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
