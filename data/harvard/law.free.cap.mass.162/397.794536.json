At the close of the defendants\u2019 case they renewed the motion, which was again denied. The jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendants moved that the verdict be set aside for the reasons that it was against the law, and against the evidence and the weight of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-12\">At the hearing on this motion the records of the Superior Court in this case were produced by the plaintiff, from which it appeared that the verdict found by the jury in this trial was the third verdict found for the plaintiff in this action, and that the preceding verdicts had been set aside upon like motions. The plaintiff asked the court to rule \u201c that under these circumstances it had no authority to set the verdict aside, either on the ground that it was against the evidence or the weight of evidence, and that it would be an abuse of discretion on the part of the court to set it aside on either of those grounds,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-13\">The judge declined to give the ruling requested, and directed that the verdict be set aside upon the ground that it was against the evidence and the weight of the evidence; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-14\"><em>W.

S. 478. <em>Schofield </em>v. Chicago, Milwaukee, &amp; <em>St. Raul </em>Railway, 114 U. S. 615. In the present case, the court may have thought it expedient to leave the case to the jury without such direction, in the expectation that they would find for the defendants, and thus save any further question ; or for the moment it may have seemed doubtful whether there was not some slight evidence entitling the plaintiff to go to the jury. However this may have been, the plaintiff has not referred us to any case where it has been held that the omission to give such direction, on motion of the defendant, will debar the court from afterwards setting aside a verdict for the plaintiff, as against the evidence. No such limitation of authority is found in Pub. Sts. c. 153, \u00a7 6, providing that \u201c the courts may at any time before judgment in a civil action set aside the verdict and order a new trial for any cause for which a new trial may by law be granted.\u201d We have no doubt of the legal authority of the court to set aside the verdict, although the defendants\u2019 motion to direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendants had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In this Commonwealth, there is no rule of law limiting the number of times that a judge may set aside a verdict as against the evidence. On the other hand, it has been recognized that in an extraordinary case the court may set aside any number of verdicts that might be returned. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Phenix Ins. Co. </em>15 Pick. 291, 295. <em>Denny </em>v. Williams, 5 Allen, 1, 5. <em>Brooks </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Somerville, 106 Mass. 271, 275. See also <em>Davies </em>v. Roper, 2 Jur. (N. S.) 167; <em>State </em>v. <em>Horner, </em>86 Mo. 71; <em>Wolbrecht </em>v. <em>Baumgarten, 26 </em>Ill. 291. The fact that three successive verdicts for the plaintiff have been returned does not of itself make it the legal duty of the court to allow the last verdict to stand if unsupported by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">No other reason except those above referred to has been assigned for questioning the action of the court in setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff, and neither of these shows that the court exceeded its legal authority. <em>^Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> The counsel for the plaintiff cited in his brief <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Allen, 1; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Western Railroad, </em>7 Allen, 98; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Deerfield, </em>8 Allen, 522, 524; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Chicago, Rock Island, </em>&amp; <em>Pacific Railway, </em>69 Iowa, 154; <em>Linkauf v.
