Underwood, upon which, on January 3, 1893, execution duly issued, and an application was made to a court having jurisdiction of the parties for a certificate authorizing the arrest of both Leach and Underwood, in which the affiant stated that he believed \u201c that the debtors Hosea W. Leach and P. A. Underwood, named in the said execution, have property not exempt from being taken on execution which he does not intend to apply to the payment of the judgment creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-12\">The judge ruled that the allegation \u201chave property not exempt,\u201d etc., considered in connection with the other parts of the affidavit, was to be construed distributively, and admitted the affidavit; and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-13\">The plaintiff offered in evidence the citation issued upon the application above stated, directed to both Leach and Underwood, as judgment debtors, to appear before the district court upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>day and hour named and submit to an examination touching their estate. The defendants contended that the citation was invalid by reason of the joinder therein of both the judgment debtors, but the judge ruled that it was sufficient, and admitted it; and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">The defendant Leach was arrested on the execution, and recognized on the usual conditions that he should within thirty days \u201cdeliver himself up for examination, before some magistrate authorized to act, giving notice of the time and place thereof,\u201d as by law provided, and afterward made default. The defendants asked the judge to rule that the recognizance was void, because the condition required the debtor to deliver himself up before some magistrate, instead of before some court of record, or police, district, or municipal court, or, except in the county of Suffolk, some trial justice. The judge declined so to rule; and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">The judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the recognizance; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-7\"><em>W. C. </em>Cogswell, for the defendants, did not care to he heard.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-8\"><em>C. jF. </em>Eldredge, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-9\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVB\">The first objection which the defendants make is, that the affidavit annexed to the execution' is defectix-e in stating \u201c that the debtors Hosea W. Leach and P. A. Underwood, named in the said execution, have property not exempt from being taken on execution which he does not intend to apply to the payment of the judgment creditor\u2019s claim.\u201d It is contended that it is uncertain who is meant by \u201c he,\u201d and that therefore there is no charge that the defendant Leach has property which he does not intend to apply to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. But we think that the affidavit is to be construed distributively, as if it read, <em>\u201c </em>the debtors Hosea W. Leach and P. A. Underwood each have property,\u201d etc. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>4 Allen, 72. <em>Hill </em>v. Bartlett, 124 Mass. 399. <em>Foster </em>v. Leach, 160 Mass. 418. <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Hemenway, ante, </em>17.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">The other questions are disposed of by <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Hemenway, ubi supra, </em>and therefore need,not be further considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
