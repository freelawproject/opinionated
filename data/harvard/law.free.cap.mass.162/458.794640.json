Two other witnesses for the government testified that they had never heard any one call him by the name of Pierre, but that he had told them that that was his name. <em>Held, </em>that the judge rightly refused to rule that there was a variance, -and properly left it to the jury to determine whether his name was Pierre or not.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-9\">Complaint, charging the defendant with the alleged illegal sale of intoxicating liquors to one Pierre A.

Upon cross-examination the witness said he had worked in the same shop with Maguant, and had always heard him called Peter, and had never heard him called by the name of Pierre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-11\">One Wells and one McKenney, witnesses called by the Commonwealth, testified that the name of Maguant was Pierre A. Maguant. Upon cross-examination they testified that they had never heard any one call him by that name, but that Maguant at one time told them his name was Pierre A. Maguant, and that was the only knowledge they had of what the name of Maguant was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-12\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, by reason of a variance, that there was no competent or sufficient evidence to prove that the name of the alleged purchaser of liquor was Pierre A. Maguant, but that the only competent evidence introduced upon the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of the name was that of Murchison, who testified positively that his name was Peter; and that he was commonly known by the name of Peter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">The judge refused so to rule, but, with appropriate instructions on the subject, left it to the jury to determine whether the name of the alleged purchaser was Pierre A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYn\">We are of opinion that evidence that the person described in the complaint as Pierre A. Maguant had said that this was his name is some evidence that this was his name, or that he was known and called by this name. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>147 Mass. 414, the defendant was indicted for adultery with Albino Jefferds, and he introduced evidence that the true name of this woman was Albina Gervais, and that she was never called or known as Albino Jefferds. The government was permitted to introduce evidence, against the objection of the defendant, that the person described as Albino Jefferds had pleaded not guilty \u201cto a complaint issued from the Central District Court of Worcester, in August, 1887, against Albino Jeffards, for fornication with Joseph Brigham.\u201d Upon this objection, this court say: \u201c In determining whether this latter person was rightly named in the indictment, it was competent to show to what name she had answered, and how she had permitted herself to be called. . . . When one answers to a name, it is certainly evidence that such is either his true name or one by which he consents to be known,\u201d etc. A declaration by a person that certain words constitute his name is, Ave think, as clearly evidence that such is his name as answering to that name in pleading to a criminal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
