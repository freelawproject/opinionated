Upon this evidence, the defendant contended that the section of the statute above cited is applicable only to the second kind of oleomargarine. But this is too narrow a construction of the statute. Whoever delivers oleomargarine from a vehicle upon the public streets must have upon his vehicle the placard described. This statute was not intended to draw fine distinctions between different kinds of oleomargarine, all of which would resemble butter; but it requires that every one who thus delivers oleomargarine, of whatever sort, shall carry along with him upon his vehicle a public notice that he is licensed to sell oleomargarine; in other words, that he shall go under his true colors. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>156 Mass. 236, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
