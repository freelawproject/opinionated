At the trial in the Superior Court, before Bond, J., the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-12\">At the hearing on the allowance of the exceptions, the plaintiff moved that the same be dismissed on the ground that notice of the filing thereof had not been duly served upon him or his attorney. The defendant\u2019s attorney testified that the notice was left by him in the office of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in his absence; but the plaintiff\u2019s attorney deposed that he never received it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-13\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that, if the notice required by law had been left at the office of the attorney of the plaintiff during office hours, the office being then open, within the time required for giving said notice, such notice was duly served.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-14\">The judge declined so to rule, and found that notice of the filing of exceptions was not given in accordance with the statute and the rules of the Superior Court, and dismissed the exceptions ; to which ruling the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-15\"><em>J.

The statute also is to the same effect. Pub. Sts, c. 153, \u00a7 8. By Rule 31, \u201c All notices required by or given in pursuance of these rules shall be in writing, and may be proved by an affidavit of the party or his attorney to a copy thereof, and setting forth that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the same was delivered personally to the adverse party or his attorney, or deposited in the post office directed to him, postage prepaid.\u201d Under this rule, a notice left at the office of the attorney in his absence is not duly served unless it actually reaches him. Leaving it in his office is not an equivalent for sending it by mail. The rule shows in explicit terms how notices are to be served, and one who departs from the method there pointed out must take the risk of being able to prove that the-notice actually came to hand. In the present case, it did not appear whether the notice was left on the attorney\u2019s desk, or elsewhere in the office; and the attorney deposed that he never received it. The judge, therefore, might properly refuse to rule as requested, and find that the notice was not duly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
