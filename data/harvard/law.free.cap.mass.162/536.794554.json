Trial in the Superior Court, before Bishop, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that his wife received severe injuries by the negligence of the defendant, its agents or servants, as set out in his declaration; and that he had expended money for medicines and for the services of physicians who attended his wife on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\">The defendant introduced evidence tending to show that there was no negligence upon its part, or on the part of its agents or servants, as the plaintiff contended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-11\">The alleged injuries sustained by the wife consisted of a rupture, some six or seven inches in length, extending along the central line of the abdomen, and a fracture of the collar bone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-12\">The defendant contended that the injuries were occasioned by the acts of the plaintiff, and were not due to anything happening while the wife was a passenger on its car; that the rupture was an old one, of some months\u2019 standing prior to April 30, 1891; and, in support of this contention, the defendant, without objection, introduced in evidence the testimony of a neighbor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>plaintiff, one Mrs. Helliwell, who testified that, upon a certain day in January, 1890, she was called into the plaintiff's house, where the plaintiff\u2019s wife was on her back on the floor, and the plaintiff had hold of her feet and was kicking her with his boots on, and kicked her twice after the witness went in, while the wife put her hands to her back and leaned over to the right side, and the plaintiff called her crazy; and that these kicks were not upon that portion of her person where the rupture was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-3\">The plaintiff introduced in evidence, without objection, testimony of his family physician and others, that his wife, prior to April 30, 1891, had been of a naturally sanguine, cheerful temperament ; and that since that time her disposition and general demeanor had undergone a change, so that she was depressed, nervous, and melancholy. The plaintiff contended that this change was due to the injuries, and should enter into the question of damages, as lessening the value of her society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\">The defendant put in evidence, without objection, the record of the plaintiff\u2019s conviction, on September 18,1890, of the offence of drunkenness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">The defendant then called as a witness one Quinn, the police officer who made the arrest on which such conviction was had, and, on direct examination, asked him to state the circumstances of the arrest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-6\">The plaintiff objected, but the witness was permitted to testify that on the occasion of the arrest he was accosted, about eleven o\u2019clock at night while on his beat, by one of three women who stood on the sidewalk in front of the plaintiff\u2019s house, and one of whom was the plaintiff\u2019s wife, but that he thought she did not herself call him ; that, in consequence of what they said, he effected an entrance for them into the house, which was locked, and he found the plaintiff inside in an intoxicated condition ; that he had a scuffle with him; that the plaintiff then, in his wife\u2019s presence, complained of her actions; and that he then arrested the plaintiff for drunkenness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-7\">The defendant also called as a witness another police officer, one Ryder, who, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, was permitted to testify that on two separate occasions, both shortly prior to the time of the arrest above mentioned, he had been called to the plaintiff\u2019s house, and had there found more or less confu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>si on, and the plaintiff in an intoxicated condition; and that, at the wife\u2019s request, he had endeavored to calm the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-4\">The plaintiff excepted to the admission of the evidence of both witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-5\">The evidence of Quinn and Ryder was introduced by the defendant in mitigation of damages, by tending to show such relations between husband and wife as indicated that the husband did not avail himself of the companionship and society of the wife, the loss of which was alleged, and prevented the same; and the judge in his charge instructed the jury to regard it only as bearing on the question of damages. The plaintiff excepted to this instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-6\">There was no evidence in the case, otherwise than is above recited, that the plaintiff ever did or offered to do violence to his wife, or that their relations as husband and wife had ever been interrupted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-8\"><em>H. I). Pratt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-9\"><em>Gr. F. Richardson, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-10\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOuk\">The evidence objected' to, whether admissible or not, was confined to the question of damages by the express and repeated directions of the judge. It was not let in generally, as in <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Short, </em>21 Pick. 142, <em>Crowell </em>v. Porter, 106 Mass. 80, and <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Middlesex </em>Railroad, 115 Mass. 239. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>7 Allen, 507, the evidence was let in generally, and naturally would affect the amount of damages found by the jury. See <em>Anthony </em>v. Travis, 148 Mass. 53, 59. Ordinarily, it must be assumed that the jury follow the instructions which they receive. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ham, 150 Mass. 122. And although this assumption may not prevent the granting of a new trial when the inevitable effect of inadmissible evidence is to prejudice the objecting party\u2019s whole case and testimony, as in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>158 Mass. 127, we do not regard such an effect as likely here. Evidence of disturbed marital relations at particular times had no bearing on the questions whether the plaintiff had lost his wife\u2019s services, or the defendant had been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">\n<em>Fxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
