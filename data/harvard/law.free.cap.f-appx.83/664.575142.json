(the \u201cDebtors\u201d), and are one part of a mass of litigation between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">In Case No. 03-10421, Appellant challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s sale of estate property at auction to the Debtors. However, an appeal of a sale by the bankruptcy court does not affect the validity of a sale in good faith unless the authorization and sale were stayed pending appeal. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m). The Appellants failed to obtain a stay. We accept the bankruptcy court\u2019s implicit finding of good faith on the part of the Debtors made in its bench ruling of June 13, 2001. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed as moot. See <em>Ginther v. Ginther Trusts (In re Ginther Trusts), </em>238 F.3d 686 (5th Cir.2001); <em>In re Gilchrist, </em>891 F.2d 559 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-23\">In Case No. 03-10475, Appellant challenges the abandonment to the Debtors by the Trustee of certain causes of action of the Debtors. The Appellants failed to timely appeal the Abandonment Order or timely request an extension of the deadline to appeal, electing rather to file a Motion to Vacate the Abandonment Order which the bankruptcy court denied and the district court affirmed. We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on the Motion to Vacate for abuse of discretion. In this case of intentional abandonment by the Trustee, the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that the abandonment was final upon entry of its order and that it had no authority to grant relief related to that property. See <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, </em>\u00a7 554.02[3]. The district court correctly affirmed the bankruptcy court as the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in abandoning the causes of action to the Debtors or in refusing to revisit that decision in response to the Motion to Vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-24\">Case No. 03-10421 \u2014 APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-25\">Case No. 03-10475 \u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-21\">.
