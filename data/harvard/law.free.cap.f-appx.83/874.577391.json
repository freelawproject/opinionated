Tuadles asserts the BIA erred because she demonstrated \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d excusing her failure to depart, and because the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen violated her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">This court reviews denials of motions to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890-91 (9th Cir.2002). When the BIA reviews the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision de novo, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, and questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1281-82 (9th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s ruling should not be disturbed unless it acted arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law. <em>Celis-Castellano, </em>298 F.3d at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">I. \u201cExceptional Circumstances\u201d Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b905-21\">The BIA denied Tuadles\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that under INA \u00a7 242(e)(2)(A), Tuadles\u2019s failure to comply with her voluntary departure order barred her from adjustment of status consideration for five years from the date she should have departed. Tuadles contends that \u00a7 242(e)(2)(A)\u2019s bar to eligibility should not apply because her failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>comply with the voluntary departure order was due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242B(e)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(e)(2)(A) (repealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">We do not have jurisdiction over this claim because Tuadles has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to this issue. Under INA \u00a7 106(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a, the statute providing for judicial review of this case, \u201c[a] petitioner must exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial review\u201d and the \u201c[flailure to raise an issue below constitutes failure to exhaust administrative remedies and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d <em>Farhoud v. INS, </em>122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Rashtabadi v. Immigration and Naturalization, </em>23 F.3d 1562, 1567 (9th Cir.1994)). Tuadles concedes that she did not raise her \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d argument before the BIA in her motion to reopen. Tuadles first raised the argument with the BIA in a motion for reconsideration filed the same day as this appeal. As of the date of this order, we have not been advised that the BIA has ruled on Tua-dles\u2019s motion. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction over Tuadles\u2019s \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d claim. <em>Compare Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999) (where petitioners simultaneously filed petition for review of denial of reopening with court and motion to reconsider with BIA, and BIA subsequently denied motion to reconsider, court found that petitioners had exhausted administrative remedies, making review of all issues by court appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">II. The BIA\u2019s Denial of Tuadles\u2019s Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Tuadles challenges the BIA\u2019s decision to deny her motion to reopen on due process grounds. Unlike her \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d claim, Tuadles was not required to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>Farhoud v. INS, </em>122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cThere are exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.... [T]he exhaustion requirement will not apply where, as here, there is a constitutional challenge to the Immigration and Naturalization Act or procedures of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\u201d). Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to hear her due process claim under INA \u00a7 106(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as modified by the transitional rules for judicial review in IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4), even if the claim was not raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The due process clause protects aliens in deportation proceedings and includes the right to a full and fair hearing. <em>Farhoud, </em>122 F.3d at 796. To establish a violation of due process warranting reopening, the alien must also show that he or she was prejudiced by the denial of this right. <em>See Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1994). Tuadles argues that the BIA violated her due process rights when it denied her motion to reopen because it unreasonably delayed in deciding her motion until after her scheduled departure date, and refused to extend her departure date accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Respondent asserts that Tuadles\u2019s claim is barred by <em>Shaar v. INS, </em>141 F.3d 953 (9th Cir.1998). In <em>Shaar, </em>the petitioners filed a motion to reopen only days before their voluntary departure date, and the BIA did not hear the motion until after their date of departure. <em>Id. </em>at 957. Because the petitioners failed to leave by their date of departure, the BIA denied the petitioner\u2019s motion. The petitioners appealed, asserting that the BIA\u2019s failure to hear their case prior to their date of departure violated their due process rights. A divided panel rejected this argument, because the petitioners had delayed filing their motion to reopen until only days before they were to depart, and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>not seek an extension of their departure date. <em>Id. </em>at 957-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Unlike the petitioners in <em>Shaar, </em>Tuadles did not unreasonably dawdle in seeking a visa and filing the motion to reopen, as she sought both less than a month after her marriage occurred and months before her scheduled departure date. She also has particularly compelling substantive grounds for her claim of relief from deportation, namely, that she is married to a U.S. citizen and has a U.S. citizen daughter. Moreover, Tuadles has since received a visa based on her marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Indeed, Tuadles found herself in an impossible situation. She filed her visa application and motion to reopen several months before she was scheduled to depart. The IJ denied her motion to reopen because the visa had not yet been approved by the INS. Before the BIA heard the appeal of this decision, the visa was approved; however, the BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s decision on the ground that she remained in the country after her departure date. Thus, even though she timely moved to reopen and sought an extension of her departure date, she was deprived of a meaningful hearing on her motion to reopen through no fault of her own. <em>See Shaar, </em>141 F.3d at 958-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">For these reasons, Tuadles established a due process violation warranting the granting of her petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the case is remanded to the BIA on due process grounds with directions to reopen her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. As the court finds a due process violation, it need not address Tuadles's other constitutional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
