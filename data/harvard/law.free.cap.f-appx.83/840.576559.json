Farrar argued in her complaint that these tapes would have helped prove her case in the pending action, in which she claimed that City employees had conspired to retaliate for her past lawsuits against the City by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>spying on her and generally making her life difficult through the \u201cuse of sirens, horns, planes and or physically showing up.\u201d <em>Farrar v. City of Chicago, </em>61 Fed.Appx. 967, 968 (7th Cir.2003) (unpublished). Farrar\u2019s initial complaint in state court alleged intentional spoliation of evidence and interference with prospective advantage due to the City\u2019s interference with her lawsuit. However, after the lawsuit was removed to federal court, the district court allowed her to amend her complaint to add ten additional claims. In April 2003, the district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and Farrar appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The district court carefully, examined Farrar\u2019s claims. In its order dismissing Farrar\u2019s amended complaint, the court analyzed each of the twelve counts individually, attempting unsuccessfully to extract a viable legal claim from Farrar\u2019s arguments. In her brief on appeal, Farrar responds to the dismissal by reiterating the facts and case law that she presented to the district court, but we find no fault in the district court\u2019s analysis of any of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Farrar\u2019s principal contention in this lawsuit is that the City intentionally destroyed 9-1-1 tapes in order to cause her to lose her then-pending lawsuit against the City. However, the district court dismissed the earlier case and we affirmed that judgment because Farrar chose not to comply with discovery orders, not because of any action by the City. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, even if we were to assume that the City intentionally destroyed the tapes to cause Farrar to lose her earlier lawsuit, she cannot prove that she was harmed by the City\u2019s actions, and her case has no merit. <em>See Henderson v. Sheahan, </em>196 F.3d 839, 848 (7th Cir.1999) (it is axiomatic in tort law that to recover monetary damages plaintiff must establish that she has been harmed by defendants\u2019 actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
