He was sentenced to life imprisonment, plus 20 to 40 years. The Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed on April 25, 1995, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied <em>allocatur </em>on November 16, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">Gale filed a petition under the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA) on November 27, 1996. Following an evi-dentiary hearing, the Court of Common Pleas denied his petition on the merits on December 12, 1998, which was affirmed by the Superior Court on November 30, 1999. The state supreme court denied Gale\u2019s request for allowance of appeal by <em>allocatur </em>on May 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-21\">Gale filed a second PCRA petition <em>pro se </em>on August 25, 2000. Following a hearing, the trial court denied his petition as untimely on January 22, 2001 and the Superi- or Court affirmed on July 25, 2002. Gale did not seek <em>allocatur </em>in the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court nor did he seek cer-tiorari in the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-22\">Gale filed a federal habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on July 26, 2002, which was denied on February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>28, 2003 as untimely. The District Court held that Gale\u2019s first PCRA petition tolled AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations but that Gale\u2019s second PCRA petition did not satisfy Pennsylvania\u2019s timeliness requirements and therefore, was not a \u201cproperly filed\u201d petition that could toll AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. App. at 7. The District Court also noted that in reviewing Gale\u2019s second PCRA petition the Pennsylvania Superior Court further determined that \u201cGale failed to allege let alone establish any lawful excuse for its untimely filing under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b).\u201d App. at 7. Nonetheless, the District Court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Gale\u2019s second PCRA petition tolled the statute of limitations for filing this action. Gale timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Gale filed a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We have plenary review over issues involving statutes of limitations. <em>See Merritt v. Blaine, </em>326 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 317, 157 L.Ed.2d 219 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), provides that a prisoner may file a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus within one year from the date on which the prisoner\u2019s state conviction became final. <em>See Burns v. Morton, </em>134 F.3d 109, 111 (3d Cir.1998). If a state prisoner\u2019s conviction became final prior to the enactment of AEDPA, the one-year period begins to run on the effective date of AEDPA, April 24, 1996. <em>See Sweger v. Chesney, </em>294 F.3d 506, 513 (3d Cir.2002). This applies to Gale, who was convicted prior to the enactment of AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">However, the one-year statute of limitations may be tolled for the \u201ctime during which a <em>properly filed </em>application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (emphasis added); <em>see also Swartz v. Meyers, </em>204 F.3d 417 (3d Cir.2000). Therefore, Gale\u2019s statute of limitations was tolled from November 27, 1996, the date on which Gale filed his PCRA petition, to August 15, 2000, 90 days after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied <em>allocatur </em>(the period for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari). Thus, Gale had until January 10, 2001 to file a habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">The parties agree that Gale\u2019s first PCRA petition tolled AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. The dispute is over Gale\u2019s arguments that his second PCRA petition also tolled AEDPA and that the period of time the second petition was pending in the state court while that court determined if the applicability of any of the state\u2019s exceptions to the timeliness rule should toll the AEDPA limitations even though the state court found Gale\u2019s second PCRA application untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">In <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000), the Supreme Court addressed the question whether an application for state post-conviction relief containing claims that are procedurally barred under state law is \u201cproperly filed\u201d under AEDPA. The Court declared that \u201can application is <em>\u2018properly </em>filed\u2019 when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings,\u201d including, but not limited to \u201cthe time limits upon its delivery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 121 S.Ct. 361 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">We followed <em>Artuz </em>in <em>Fahy v. Horn, </em>240 F.3d 239 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Horn v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Fahy, </em>534 U.S. 944, 122 S.Ct. 323, 151 L.Ed.2d 241 (2001), where we stated that we must look to \u201cstate law governing when a petition for collateral relief is properly filed\u201d and \u201cdefer to a state\u2019s highest court when it rules on an issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44. We stated that a \u201cproperly filed\u201d application must be filed \u201cpromptly and properly under state law in order to preserve [petitioners\u2019] right to litigate constitutional claims that are more than one year old in federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. As such, a \u201cproperly filed\u201d petition only tolls AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations if it is \u201c \u2018submitted according to the state\u2019s procedural requirements, such as the rules governing the time and place of filing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed Fahy\u2019s petition as untimely, we held that we were bound by the state court\u2019s determination that the \u201cPCRA petition was not properly filed as a matter of state law\u201d and held that Fahy\u2019s petition did not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Supreme Court next considered the AEDPA tolling issue in <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002), where the Court considered the question left open in <em>Artuz </em>as to whether the petition is \u201cpending\u201d while the state court determines if the petitioner falls into one of the state\u2019s exceptions to the timeliness rule. California\u2019s post-conviction relief statute at issue in <em>Carey </em>was unusual as it contained no specific time period because it only required appealing petitioners to file a second, original petition in a higher state court within a \u201creasonable\u201d period of time. Thus, the holding of the Court on the issue of \u201creasonableness\u201d is not applicable here but other aspects of the Court\u2019s opinion are informative. First, the Court noted that a partial merits ruling did not automatically transform an otherwise untimely petition into a timely one. <em>See id. </em>at 225-26, 122 S.Ct. 2134. Furthermore, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5G\">If the California Supreme Court had clearly ruled that [petitioner\u2019s] 4%-month delay was unreasonable, that would be the end of the matter, regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the claim, or whether its timeliness ruling was entangled with the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 226, 122 S.Ct. 2134 (quotation and citation omitted). Significant for our purposes is the Court\u2019s clear statement that if the state court ruled that the petitioner\u2019s untimeliness were not excused by a state exception, the federal courts should not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations for that period. <em>See id. </em>The <em>Carey </em>decision also disposes of Gale\u2019s argument that the state court\u2019s consideration of a possible justification for the delay related to a \u201ccondition to obtaining relief\u2019 and not to a \u201ccondition for filing.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s holding that a state court\u2019s conclusion that the application was untimely meant it had not been properly filed necessarily means that a state court\u2019s consideration of possible justification is a condition for filing and not a condition for obtaining relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We followed <em>Carey </em>in our decision in <em>Merritt, </em>where we held that \u201can untimely application for state post-conviction relief by a petitioner, who sought but was denied application of a statutory exception to the PCRA\u2019s time bar, is not \u2018properly filed\u2019 under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d 326 F.3d at 159. That holding is dispositive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Merritt, like Gale, filed two unsuccessful PCRA petitions. Although there was no dispute that Merritt\u2019s first PCRA tolled AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations, Merritt argued that even if his second PCRA petition were untimely it was still \u201cproperly filed\u201d because the PCRA contained statutory exceptions to the time limit for filing. The state courts determined that Merritt did not properly allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>or prove that he fell within any of the statutory exceptions to the timeliness rules. The federal District Court then denied Merritt\u2019s habeas petition as time-barred, reasoning that because the state courts found Merritt\u2019s second PCRA petition to be untimely it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and did not toll the statute of limitations under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We affirmed, emphasizing the \u201crequirement of deference to the state court\u2019s decision\u201d and stating that the panel was \u201cbound by the state court\u2019s finding that Merritt\u2019s second PCRA petition was untimely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 168; <em>see id. </em>at 168 (\u201cOnce the Pennsylvania court has so decided [that a petition is untimely and does not qualify for any of the exceptions], it would be an undue interference for a federal district court to decide otherwise.\u201d). Because the highest state court held that Merritt\u2019s petition was untimely, we concluded that Merritt\u2019s second PCRA petition was not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166; <em>see id. </em>at 168 (\u201c[I]f a state\u2019s Supreme Court has determined that a petition was not timely, then we <em>must </em>hold that it was not \u2018properly filed.\u2019 \u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Gale does not dispute the symmetry between his case and <em>Merritt. </em>Instead, he argues that <em>Merritt </em>was wrongly decided. He would have us adopt the holdings in <em>Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>244 F.3d 724, 727-28 (9th Cir.2001), and <em>Smith v. Ward, </em>209 F.3d 383, 385 (5th Cir.2000), both of which were decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Carey. </em>In <em>Merritt, </em>we explicitly declined to adopt the reasoning of those decisions. We said that, \u201c[w]e need not decide whether we would find the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis persuasive because we are bound by our prior holding in <em>Fahy.\u201d </em>326 F.3d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Gale\u2019s reliance on <em>Nara v. Frank, </em>264 F.3d 310 (3d Cir.2001), is also unavailing. In <em>Merritt, </em>we distinguished <em>Nara </em>and noted that \u201c[a]fter <em>Carey, Nara </em>would be analyzed differently.\u201d <em>Merritt, </em>326 F.3d at 166 n. 7. It follows that Gale\u2019s arguments have already been considered and rejected by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">In conclusion, the weight of authority\u2014 from the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ar-tuz </em>and <em>Carey </em>and this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Fahy </em>and <em>Merritt </em>\u2014 makes clear that, if a state court finds that a PCRA petition was untimely and ineligible for exceptions to the timeliness rule, that petition was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and does not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. Gale\u2019s second untimely PCRA petition did not toll the AEDPA statute of limitations. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Gale\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus as time-barred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
