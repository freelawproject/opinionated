We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">Vasquez-Ramos contends that the district court erred by failing to make factual findings concerning whether a firearm found in his house was used in connection with the offense, and by concluding that he was ineligible for the \u201csafety-valve\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 solely because he received an enhancement for possession of a firearm pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(1). We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>222 F.3d 545, 549 (9th Cir.2000), and its compliance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, <em>United States v. Standard, </em>207 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir.2000). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination that a defendant is ineligible for relief under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>United States v. Real-Hernandez, </em>90 F.3d 356, 360 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">The district court applied the wrong standard of proof for eligibility for the \u201csafety-valve.\u201d <em>See Nelson, </em>222 F.3d at 549-50 (stating that an enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) requires the defendant to prove that it was clearly improbable he possessed a weapon in connection with the offense, but the safety-valve requires only proof by a preponderance of the evidence). Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for the district court to determine whether Vasquez-Ramos proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the weapons were not used in connection with the offense, and, therefore, whether he qualifies for the \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">VACATED and REMANDED for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b950-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
