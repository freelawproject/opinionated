The district court granted International Paper\u2019s Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6) motion and dismissed the action. The court held first that the Effects Bargaining Agreement does not represent or constitute a plan under ERISA because it does not require International Paper to exercise sufficient discretion to meet the requirements identified in <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co., Inc. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 11, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). Further, the district court held that even if the Agreement were determined to be an ERISA plan, Campbell failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he did not allege facts that would entitle him to severance benefits under the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-20\">Having had the benefit of oral argument, and having carefully considered the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order thoroughly and accurately sets out both the undisputed facts and the governing law and clearly articulates the reasons underlying its decision. Because the issuance of a full opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose and would be duplicative, we AFFIRM the judgment on the basis of the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b123-21\">R. GUY COLE, JR., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-22\">The district court opinion \u2014 which the majority now adopts in full \u2014 is incorrect not only in its ultimate legal conclusions but also in its analytical underpinnings. The district court\u2019s opinion ignores this Circuit\u2019s binding precedent concerning what constitutes an ERISA \u201cplan\u201d and instead relies on inapposite cases from other circuits. Moreover, the district court and the majority have imposed upon Campbell a higher pleading standard than required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Supreme Court. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the agreement at issue is analyzed in light of this Circuit\u2019s case law and when Campbell\u2019s complaint is analyzed pursuant to the proper procedural standards, the proper conclusions are that the agreement at issue is an ERISA plan and Campbell sufficiently stated a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">As the majority explained, the district court granted International Paper\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that the Effects Bargaining Agreement did not constitute an ERISA \u201cplan\u201d pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in the alternative, on the ground that even if the Agreement was an ERISA plan, Campbell failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">A brief recitation of the facts is in order. Because the underlying motion was brought pursuant to Rule 12, we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Plaintiff Elmer Campbell was separated from his employment with defendant, International Paper, when the plant where he had worked for over twenty-five years closed. In anticipation of the plant\u2019s closing, Campbell\u2019s union negotiated the Effects Bargaining Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), which provides severance benefits. Specifically, the Agreement provided that employees who did not receive an employment offer from Smart Papers- \u2014 -International Paper\u2019s successor \u2014 -would be paid \u201c60 hours pay at the rate of their current permanent classification ... on the date of sale for each full and pro-rata year of continuous service with International Paper.\u201d Those employees who received an employment offer from Smart Papers are not entitled to such severance pay \u201cunless they are terminated from Smart Papers, through no fault of their own,\u201d within eighteen months of the sale date. The Agreement also provides for the continuation of medical and life insurance; retiree life insurance; sickness, accident, and long term disability coverage; and retiree medical benefits. Finally, the Agreement provides for professional re-employment assistance and financial planning services: \u201cState and local agencies will be utilized to identify employment opportunities for interested employees. Assistance with resume preparation will be provided.... The company will provide financial group counseling sessions by a certified financial planner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">When International Paper\u2019s plant closed, Campbell received and accepted an offer of employment from Smart Papers. However, after working there for fewer than eighteen months, Campbell left his employment because he was \u201cunable to perform the essential functions of his position.\u201d In his complaint, Campbell contends that the circumstances surrounding his departure amounted to constructive termination \u2014 occurring \u201cthrough no fault of his own\u201d \u2014 and that therefore, he is entitled to severance benefits pursuant to the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The legal standards for determining whether a severance agreement constitutes an ERISA plan are well-established by the Supreme Court. The decisive inquiry is whether the agreement \u201crequires an ongoing administrative program to meet the employer\u2019s obligation.\u201d <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co., Inc. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 11, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). ERISA is implicated when a severance plan places \u201cperiodic demands on [an employer\u2019s] assets that create a need for financial coordination and control.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>at 12. In <em>Fort Halifax, </em>the Supreme Court analyzed a Maine statute that required employers who shut down operations to make one-time severance payments to their employees. The Supreme Court held that although the one-time payment constituted a <em>benefit, </em>it did not constitute a <em>benefit plan </em>implicating ERISA. \u201cThe requirement of a one-time, lump-sum payment triggered by a single event requires no administrative scheme whatsoever to meet the employer\u2019s obligation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Puzzlingly, the district court altogether failed to analyze the Agreement at issue in light of this Circuit\u2019s application of the <em>Fort Halifax </em>standard. <em>See Sherrod v. General Motors Corp., </em>33 F.3d 636 (6th Cir.1994) (Norris, J.); <em>Shahid v. Ford Motor Corp., </em>76 F.3d 1404 (6th Cir.1996) (Batchelder, J., joining in opinion of the court). In <em>Sherrod, </em>this Court concluded that a benefit option implemented pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement \u2014 under which GM employees could elect to receive a one-time, lump-sum payment if they voluntarily ceased working at the plant and relinquished their seniority rights \u2014 was not an ERISA plan because the plan was neither ongoing nor required continuing administration of the payment program. As in <em>Fort Halifax, </em>the payment in <em>Sherrod </em>did not require the company to monitor its financial health and budget for any future disbursements; the employer could satisfy its duty under the benefit option all at once, by making a single set of payments to employees at the time of their departure. By contrast, in <em>Shahid, </em>this Court determined that a voluntary termination agreement was an ERISA plan where components of the agreement included substantial severance payments, professional re-employment assistance, the continuation of medical and life insurance coverage for up to one year, and retirement \u201cgrow in\u201d provisions. Because the plan would make periodic demands on Ford\u2019s corporate assets, this Court ruled that the agreement in <em>Shahid </em>implicated ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">As in <em>Shahid, </em>the Agreement in this case provides for substantial severance payments, the continuation of medical and life insurance coverage, and professional re-employment assistance. Furthermore, while the severance schemes in <em>Fort Halifax </em>and <em>Sherrod </em>did not have the potential to make periodic demands on the employer\u2019s assets, the Agreement at issue here clearly does \u2014 the Agreement contemplates a need for processing requests for benefits and making severance payments for up to eighteen months after the plant\u2019s sale date. In short, the Agreement here looks much more like <em>Shahid </em>than like those in <em>Fort Halifax </em>and <em>Sherrod. </em>As such \u2014 pursuant to the binding precedent of this Circuit\u2014 the Agreement should be considered an ERISA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">In any event, the Agreement is certainly not \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to that in the Eighth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Kulinski v. Medtronic Bio-Medicus, Inc., </em>21 F.3d 254 (8th Cir.1994) \u2014 as the district court stated and the majority now endorses. <em>Kulinski </em>involved a \u201cgolden parachute\u201d plan for a single executive. The employer agreed <em>to </em>provide Kulinski with severance benefits if, within one year of a hostile takeover, he was either terminated or he resigned for \u201cgood reason.\u201d The agreement explicitly gave Kulinski \u201cthe unfettered discretion to decide whether good reason existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. As the Eighth Circuit noted, \u201conce a hostile takeover occurred and Kulinski resigned his employment for what he regarded as a good reason, there was nothing for the company to decide, no discretion for it to exercise, and nothing for it to do but write a check. The \u2018plan\u2019 contemplated nothing more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in the case before us, it is not for the employee to freely determine when he has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u201cterminated through no fault of [his] own.\u201d That determination is left to the discretion of International Paper. Moreover, once that decision has been made, it is simply not the case that \u201c[t]he \u2018plan\u2019 contemplated nothing more,\u201d as in <em>Kulinski </em>The Agreement here contemplates \u2014 among other things \u2014 the continuation of various forms of insurance, long-term disability coverage, and professional re-employment assistance. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Kulinski </em>is simply misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Moreover, the overwhelming majority of courts \u2014 including this one \u2014 have concluded that where the reason for termination is relevant to an employee\u2019s eligibility for severance benefits, the agreement is an ERISA plan because such a determination requires the exercise of some managerial discretion. <em>See, e.g. Franklin v. Pitney Bowes, Inc., </em>919 F.2d 45 (6th Cir.1990) (where policy provided severance pay to employees who were terminated without cause, court assumed \u2014 without deciding\u2014 that the unwritten severance policy was an ERISA plan); <em>Emmenegger v. Bull Moose Tube Co., </em>197 F.3d 929 (8th Cir.1999) (severance policy was an ERISA plan where no single event triggered a one-time payment of benefits and where benefits would only be paid to employees who gave \u201cexcellent service\u201d and were not terminated for disciplinary reasons), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 389, 157 L.Ed.2d 277 (2003); <em>Schonholz v. Long Island Jewish Medical Center, </em>87 F.3d 72 (2d Cir.1996) (severance agreement was an ERISA plan where receipt of benefits turned on whether employee was involuntarily terminated).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that even if the Agreement is an ERISA plan, Campbell failed to state a claim for relief pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 \u2014 also now endorsed without comment by the majority \u2014 was also in error. Campbell claimed that he was wrongfully denied severance benefits pursuant to the Agreement after he was terminated from Smart Papers through no fault of his own within eighteen months of the plant\u2019s sale date. The pleaded factual basis for his contention was that he was no longer able to perform the essential functions of his job and that the circumstances surrounding that development \u2014 which he does not expound upon \u2014 constituted constructive termination. Although greater specificity might have been helpful, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, in <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002), that there is no requirement in federal suits to plead the facts or elements of a claim, with the exceptions (inapplicable to this case) listed in Fed. R.Civ.P. 9. In other words, Fed.R.CivJP. 8(a)(2)\u2019s liberal system of notice pleading governs: Campbell needed to provide no more than \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). It was therefore sufficient that plaintiff claimed that he was terminated through no fault of his own by virtue of his no longer being able to perform the essential functions of his job due to constructive termination by International Paper. Campbell\u2019s complaint satisfied the minimum requirements of notice pleading and we have no basis to impose upon him a higher stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>dard than that required by the Federal Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Because the Agreement at issue was an ERISA plan and because plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim for relief, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">. As a procedural matter, where the sole basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction is ERISA but the evidence fails to establish the existence of an ERISA plan, the case should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), not for failure to state a claim for relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. Similarly, courts in the following cases concluded with little or no discussion that the severance agreements in question \u2014 all of which denied benefits to employees who were terminated involuntarily, \"for cause,\u201d or misconduct \u2014 constituted an ERISA plan: <em>Raber v. Southern Ohio Coal Co. Severance Pay Plan, </em>106 F.3d 391 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Lindemann v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>79 F.3d 647 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Reeves v. Continental Equities Corp. of America, </em>912 F.2d 37 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
