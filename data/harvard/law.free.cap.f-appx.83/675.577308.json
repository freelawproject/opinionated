The district court sentenced him to life in prison. This court affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence was unsuccessful. Martinez-Gil\u2019s numerous motions seeking authorization to file a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion were likewise unavailing. Martinez-Gil then filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 enhancement information for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>lack of service\u201d in which he argued that the enhancement information upon which his sentence was based should be dismissed for want of proper service. The district court determined that Martinez-Gil was attempting to bring a successive motion to vacate his sentence without having received this court\u2019s authorization to do so. The district court thus dismissed the case. Martinez-Gil now appeals the dismissal of this motion. He argues that the district court erred in classifying his motion as properly sounding in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and he also moves this court for a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to vacate his life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Martinez-Gil has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his motion, which raised a thinly disguised challenge to his sentence, was really an attempt to bring an unauthorized successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Because Martinez-Gil had not obtained this court\u2019s authorization to file this motion, the district court did not err in dismissing Martinez-Gil\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir. 2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and Martinez-Gil\u2019s motion for a writ of mandamus is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
