Bator alleged that the district court had federal jurisdiction because the underlying claim involved the denial of Bator\u2019s planned use of his property. The district court determined that because the state criminal action is ongoing, the district court would abstain under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to abstain pursuant to <em>Younger. Green v. City of Tucson, </em>255 F.3d 1086, 1093 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). When a plaintiff seeks relief in federal court that would interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding, the federal action must be dismissed pursuant to <em>Younger </em>if the state proceeding: (1) is ongoing, (2) implicates important state interests, and (3) provides the plaintiff an adequate opportunity to litigate its federal claims. <em>Columbia Basin Apartment Ass\u2019n v. City of Pasco, </em>268 F.3d 791, 799 (9th Cir.2001). We agree with the district court that Bator\u2019s suit meets these requirements and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court in its Order filed May 13, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
