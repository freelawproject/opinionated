The district court construed Conrod\u2019s claims as also arising under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">Conrod argues that the district court improperly applied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his FTCA claim because the court failed to consider whether his claim could be brought under an exception to the statute. However, the exceptions on which Conrad relies all apply to forfeiture proceedings not relevant to the instant case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)(l)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-23\">Conrod also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his <em>Bivens </em>claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. He argues, for the first time on appeal, that he has a valid excuse for failing to exhaust the last two steps of the grievance process because after he filed his first two grievances, the warden told him that he could not obtain monetary relief and suggested that he file suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-24\">\u201cThe clear rule of this circuit limits review of claims raised for the first time on appeal to claims involving purely legal questions where [the court\u2019s] failure to consider them would result in a \u2018miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vogel v. Veneman, </em>276 F.3d 729, 734 (5th Cir.2002). Because Conrod\u2019s argument is not purely legal, we will not consider it. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
