He argues that the district court erred in refusing to adjust his offense level downward by three levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 because he refused to discuss with the probation officer his offense conduct or criminal history and because he timely pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Whether a defendant has sufficiently demonstrated acceptance of responsibility is a factual question, and the standard of review is even more deferential than \u201cclear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Spires, </em>79 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.1996). This court will affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooten, </em>933 F.2d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We have recognized the refusal to debrief a probation officer as a factor in deciding whether to apply the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>62 F.3d 118, 123 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003). Having reviewed the record in this case, we hold that the district court\u2019s refusal to grant the adjustment was not without any foundation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment (n.3); <em>Hooten, </em>933 F.2d at 297-98. Henderson also has not shown reversible error by arguing that U.S.S.G \u00a7 3E1.1 recognizes his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent with the probation officer. <em>See United States v. Kleinebreil, </em>966 F.2d 945, 953 (5th Cir. 1992). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
