For reversal Smith argues the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in discounting her subjective complaints of pain, in characterizing her past relevant work (PRW) as light work and finding she could perform it, and in failing to evaluate her physical and mental impairments and their combined effect on her residual functional capacity (RFC). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>See Anderson v. Barnhart, </em>344 F.3d 809, 812 (8th Cir. 2003) (standard of review). The ALJ adequately explained his credibility findings by listing the relevant factors from <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320, 1322 (8th Cir. 1984), and noting the scant objective medical evidence and Smith\u2019s failure to seek aggressive treatment for pain. <em>See Haggard v. Apfel, </em>175 F.3d 591, 594 (8th Cir. 1999) (decision of ALJ who considers but for good cause expressly discredits claimant\u2019s subjective complaints will not be disturbed). Based on Smith\u2019s description of her PRW and the description of cashier work in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, </em>the ALJ properly identified Smith\u2019s PRW as light work. Further, the ALJ properly found Smith could perform light work based on what she testified she could do (to the extent her testimony was credited) and the lack of any functional restrictions by her treating physicians. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1217 (8th Cir.2001) (it is claimant\u2019s burden to prove RFC, and ALJ\u2019s responsibility to determine RFC based on medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and claimant\u2019s description of limitations). Because Smith had no mental impairments, the ALJ did not err in failing to evaluate them in combination with her physical impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Smith raises additional points in her brief, but we find them to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-16\">. The Honorable Jerry W. Cavaneau, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
