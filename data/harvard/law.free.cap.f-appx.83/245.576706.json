We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual determinations concerning a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for asylum, and must uphold them unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">At her removal hearing, Vivar-Martinez testified that in 1989, guerrillas kidnaped her father and brother in an attempt to recruit them, killed her brother who tried to defend her father, and severely beat Vivar-Martinez. Vivar-Martinez provided no evidence, however, that the guerrillas\u2019 were motivated by an enumerated ground. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Vivar-Martinez failed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 483-84 (holding that forced recruitment without more is insufficient to establish persecution on account of political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In failing to qualify for asylum, Vivar-Martinez, necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard or withholding of removal. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b275-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
