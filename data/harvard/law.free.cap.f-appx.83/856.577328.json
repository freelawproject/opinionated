Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues as to any material fact exist. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). All evidence and inferences are to be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). After reviewing the record <em>de novo, </em>see <em>Uhiren v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </em>346 F.3d 824, 827 (8th Cir.2003), we conclude that summary judgment was proper because the defendants\u2019 statements were not so severe or pervasive as to affect a term, condition, or privilege of Ms. Brewington\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">After working as a clerk for the City of Lone Jack, Missouri, for approximately four years, Ms. Brewington resigned in May 2000. She asserts that throughout her employment with the City of Lone Jack, police chief Jeffrey Jewell and officers Steven Berry and Derrick Ross made lewd and offensive statements about women in her presence on a daily basis. Though no statements were ever directed at Ms. Brewington personally, she alleges that these statements amounted to sexual harassment in the form of a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">To establish a hostile-work-environment sexual-harassment claim, Ms. Brewington must prove (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she was sexually harassed; (3) the conduct was based on her gender;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (4) the conduct was unwelcome; and (5) the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of her employment. <em>Moving v. Ark. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>243 F.3d 452, 455 (8th Cir.2001). To determine if the conduct affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment, this Court applies both an objective and subjective test, examining whether the conduct created \u201can environment that a reasonable person would find hostile and one that the victim actually perceived as abusive.\u201d <em>Duncan v. General Motors, </em>300 F.3d 928, 934 (8th Cir.2002). The conduct must be \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Howard v. Burns Bros., Inc., </em>149 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 1998), quoting <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). \u201cRelevant factors for determining whether conduct rises to the level of abusiveness include \u2018the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Ottman v. City of Independence, Mo., </em>341 F.3d 751, 760 (8th Cir.2003), quoting <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">The defendants\u2019 statements do \u201cnot constitute \u2018discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [Ms. Brewington\u2019s] employment and create an abusive working environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ottman, </em>341 F.3d at 760, citing <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998), quoting <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 21. Though the statements were offensive, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>has rejected hostile-work-environment claims premised upon facts more egregious than the conduct at issue here. <em>E.g., Duncan v. General Motors, supra. </em>Therefore, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-10\">. The Hon. Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-14\">. Because Ms. Brewington did not prove that the conduct was severe or pervasive, we do not reach the issue of whether the conduct was based on gender.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
