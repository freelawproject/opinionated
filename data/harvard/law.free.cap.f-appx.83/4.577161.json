Kyoshabire\u2019s claims are dependent upon the resolution of Baguma\u2019s. We directly review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Baguma contends that the IJ erred by finding that punishment of Baguma for treason, resulting from his passing of military secrets to rebels, was not persecution \u201con account of\u2019 his political opinion. This claim fails because \u201cthe mere existence of a generalized \u2018political\u2019 motive\u201d does not establish persecution <em>\u201con account of </em>political opinion.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997) (acts of harassment \u201cattributed to the civil unrest in the country during wartime\u201d); <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994) (mistreatment due to desire to discover terrorist activity). <em>Accord Chanco v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 298, 302 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cProsecution for participation in a coup does not constitute persecution on account of political opinion when peaceful means of protest are available for which the alien would not face punishment. Prosecution in these circumstances is no different from prosecution for a common law crime.\u201d). Baguma has not shown \u201c \u2018that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84,112 S.Ct. 812).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Baguma also contends that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility assessment was baseless. A panel of this Court \u201ccannot replace the ... IJ\u2019s determinations concerning witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations with its own determinations.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). The IJ\u2019s finding that Baguma was not credible was a reasonable interpretation of the record, and the evidence did not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The motion, contained within the brief, that this Court reconsider its denial of a stay of deportation is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">PETITION DENIED; ALL MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b34-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
