See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">Colin Seale petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging that the district court has unduly delayed in acting on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court has now ruled on his \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, because the district court has recently decided Seale\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant Seale\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
