She pled guilty and on July 22, 2002, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey sentenced her to 70 months imprisonment to be followed by 5 years of supervised release. Gonzalez-Velez filed a pro <em>se </em>appeal and counsel was appointed and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asking this court to allow him to withdraw because he is unable to find any non-frivolous issues for our review. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s counsel directed us to portions of the record that might arguably support an appeal. Counsel pointed out two possible issues: (1) whether the District Court conducted a sufficiently thorough plea hearing and; (2) whether Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s sentence was legally imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-18\">The plea hearing conducted by the District Court complied with the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and therefore, was sufficiently thorough. The District Court made sure that Gonzalez-Velez understood the charges against her, the rights she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>giving up by entering the plea, the maximum and minimum penalties, and that she wished to enter a guilty plea to the specific charge of knowingly and intentionally conspiring with others to import more than 5 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 963. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d). In addition, the District Court ensured that there was an adequate factual basis for Gonzalez-V elez\u2019s guilty plea by personally questioning her regarding the facts of the case. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f). Therefore, because Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s plea proceeding complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, it was sufficiently thorough. <em>See United States v. Tannis, </em>942 F.2d 196 (3rd Cir. 1991) (granting counsel\u2019s request for withdrawal after finding that Appellant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and that the District Court complied with the requirements of Rule 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">It is clear from the record that Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s sentence was legally imposed. Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s total offense level was 27, she had no criminal history points, and she qualified for the \u00a7 5C1.2 \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Therefore, the District Court correctly determined that the range under the guidelines was 70 to 87 months imprisonment. The District Court sentenced Gonzalez-Velez at the lower end of the range, 70 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. Moreover, the District Court stated, in detail, its reasons for imposing such a sentence. Therefore, Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s sentence was legally imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Lastly, as required by <em>Anders, </em>Gonzalez-Velez was given notice of her counsel\u2019s desire to withdraw, allowing her the opportunity to raise any non-frivolous issues for appeal in a <em>pro se </em>brief. Gonzalez-Velez failed to file such a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Because Gonzalez-V elez\u2019s plea proceeding was proper and her sentence was legal, we will GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. Because we find that Gonzalez-Velez\u2019s issues are without merit, we will AFFIRM the judgment of sentence entered by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-13\">. We note that because Gonzalez-Velez entered an unconditional guilty plea on the record in open court, her arguments on appeal are limited to challenging the jurisdiction of the District Court, the validity of the plea, and the legality of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 569, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
