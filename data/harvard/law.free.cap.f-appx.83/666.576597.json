Jarvis argues that, because the BIA adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) decision without opinion, this court should not give the BIA decision any deference. Jarvis\u2019s argument for non-deferential review is foreclosed; this court\u2019s review of the factual determinations of the BIA is for substantial evidence. <em>See Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-21\">Jarvis also argues that he was a credible witness. This court may not review the IJ\u2019s credibility determination or the decision to deny Jarvis asylum based upon such a determination. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-22\">Jarvis also argues that he should have been granted asylum because asylum is available to those, whose persecutors have some pecuniary or other non-political agenda so long as he provides some evidence that he has a well-founded fear that he will be persecuted because of his political opinion. Substantial evidence exists to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Jarvis was not a refugee and did not suffer persecution on any recognized ground. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Girma v. United States, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667 (5th Cir.2002). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
