On appeal, Russell argues that the district court erred in ruling that: 1) he did not have a liberty interest in his job; and 2) his challenge to the disciplinary proceedings against him attacked the validity of the punishment imposed and, therefore, was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and, after de novo review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">The district court, adopting the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge, ruled that Russell did not state a claim for the deprivation of his constitutional rights arising from the loss of his prison job because he did not have a protected liberty interest in his prison employment. On appeal, Russell argues that he did have a liberty interest in his job because it was not a typical prison job. Regardless of the nature of his position, Russell did not have a protected liberty interest in participating in a work program or in a particular work assignment. <em>See Toussaint v. McCarthy, </em>801 F.2d 1080, 1094-95 (9th Cir.1986). The district court did not err in dismissing Russell\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">The district court also ruled that Russell\u2019s allegations of constitutional violations in the procedures of his disciplinary hearing were not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Russell was earning worktime credits at former job and, under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 2933, worktime credits reduce a prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment. Because the result of Russell\u2019s disciplinary hearing affected his ability to earn worktime credits, the hearing affected his term of imprisonment. Russell\u2019s allegations, if proven, necessarily implicate the validity of the result of the disciplinary hearing and the length of his confinement. Therefore, under <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997), Russell\u2019s claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 unless the result of the hearing was previously invalidated. Because the result was not previously invalidated, the district court did not err in dismissing Russell\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1009-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
