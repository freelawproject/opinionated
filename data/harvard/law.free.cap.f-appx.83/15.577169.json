The respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>argues that these claims must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on a failure to exhaust the claims administratively.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Because the exhaustion requirement is statutorily mandated, an alien\u2019s failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar to this court\u2019s consideration of the issue. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). The alleged procedural errors raised by the Toros could have been corrected if they had been presented to the BIA. Therefore, these claims are not subject to review based on lack of exhaustion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The Toros argue that the BIA erred in allowing the case to be \u201cstreamlined\u201d because the factual issues in the case merited a full review by the BIA and the errors in the decision were not harmless or nonmaterial. The BIA\u2019s affirmance was not a summary affirmance pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (now 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)) because the BIA did not cite that provision as required by the regulation and did not indicate that it was affirming without opinion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii). Further, the BIA provided reasons for agreeing with the decision of the IJ. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The Toros argue that the BIA erred in adopting the Id\u2019s finding that the Toros were not \u201crefugees\u201d based on a well founded fear of future persecution because Toro was no longer working for the alarm company and was not sure if the company was still in business. A refugee is a person who is outside of his or her country and is unable or unwilling to return \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Pretermitting the question whether the action taken by the guerillas against the Toros was due to Mr. Toro\u2019s political opinion or his membership in a social group, the evidence of threatening telephone calls and verbal threats made by guerillas during Toro\u2019s brief detention does not reflect that such action was so severe as to constitute persecution. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 303-04 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Abdel-Masieh v. U.S. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 582, 584 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution,\u201d Toro \u201cmust show that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would fear persecution if deported.\u201d <em>Mik-hael, </em>115 F.3d at 304. Toro does not dispute that his company is no longer in business. Thus, the guerillas\u2019 main reason for harassing him has been eliminated. Toro has not provided any evidence to show that it is likely that the guerillas will single him out for intolerable abuse if he returns to Colombia. Thus, the Toros have not established that a reasonable person would fear persecution if he returned to Colombia. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s denial of the Toros\u2019 application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Because Toro did not establish a prima facie case for asylum, he also cannot meet the more stringent standard for proving his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Gima v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666-67 (5th Cir.2002). Toro failed to brief any arguments regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT and has therefore abandoned any arguments relating to that claim. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the unexhausted claims is GRANTED. The petition for review is DENIED. The respondent\u2019s motion to waive the briefing requirement is GRANTED, and the motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b46-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
