Chen argues that the IJ made an improper adverse credibility determination and that the IJ considered impermissible hearsay evidence to support his finding of adverse credibility. Finally, Chen has filed a motion requesting this court to remand to the BIA pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(c) for consideration of additional evidence, or, in the alternative, to hold his case in abeyance pending the BIA\u2019s decision on his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">The IJ\u2019s finding that Chen was not credible is a reasonable interpretation of the record and the conclusion that Chen was credible is not compelled by the evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Because Chen failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to the hearsay issue, this court is precluded from addressing it. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001). Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) transitional rules, a court may not order the taking of additional evidence under \u00a7 2347(c). <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(B). The court declines to hold this ease in abeyance pending the BIA\u2019s ruling on Chen\u2019s motion to reopen, as the motion to reopen does not affect the finality of the deportation order. <em>See Mamoka v. INS, </em>43 F.3d 184,187 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Accordingly, the petition for review and the motion are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
