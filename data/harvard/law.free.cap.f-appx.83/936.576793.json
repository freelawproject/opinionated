Altamirano-Vargas\u2019s claim is precluded by this court\u2019s controlling precedent. <em>See Pena-Cabanillas v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 785, 790 (9th Cir.1968) (deciding that illegal reentry is a general intent crime, which does not require the government to prove that defendant knew he was not entitled to enter the country without the permission of the Attorney General); <em>see also United States v. Leon-Leon, </em>35 F.3d 1428, 1432-33 (9th Cir.1994) (finding irrelevant the defendant\u2019s reasonable belief that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>permission to reenter the United States with respect to a conviction under \u00a7 1326).</p>\n<p id=\"A3W\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b966-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
