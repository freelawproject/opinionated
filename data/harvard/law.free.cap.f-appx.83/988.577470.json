We previously reversed the district court\u2019s denial of Manning\u2019s petition and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the actions of Manning\u2019s attorney (\u201cRyan\u201d) were the cause of Manning\u2019s procedural default. <em>Manning v. Foster, </em>224 F.3d 1129 (9th Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cManning </em>/\u201d). On remand, the district court found that Ryan\u2019s actions did constitute cause and granted Manning\u2019s petition. In this appeal, the State argues that the district court applied an incorrect standard in evaluating Ryan\u2019s actions, and that the district court erred in finding that such actions constituted cause excusing Manning\u2019s default. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review the district court\u2019s grant of the habeas petition <em>de novo, Hunter v. Ayers, </em>336 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-15\">The district court applied the correct legal standard in finding that Ryan\u2019s actions constituted cause excusing Manning\u2019s procedural default. In our opinion in <em>Manning I, </em>we directed the district court to determine \u201cwhether Ryan\u2019s actions effectively prevented Manning from learning of and vindicating his right to petition for state post-conviction relief within one year of his conviction.\u201d 224 F.3d at 1135. The magistrate judge applied this standard after the evidentiary hearing, as did the district court in its independent review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-16\">The district court properly concluded that Ryan\u2019s actions constituted cause excusing Manning\u2019s procedural default. As the district court pointed out, Ryan\u2019s actions <em>taken together </em>constitute objective factors that are external to Manning and that cannot be fairly attributed to him. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 753, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). The record amply supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the cumulative effect of Ryan\u2019s improper actions was to effectively prevent Manning from learning of and vindicating his right to petition for state post-conviction relief within one year of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1019-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
