We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Dominguez contends that the district court should have required \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence of his criminal conduct before revoking his probation and imposing a sentence in excess of the sentencing range set forth in the Chapter 7 Policy Statements. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The district court applied the correct standard of proof in assessing Dominguez\u2019 alleged violations and did not abuse its discretion by revoking his probation. <em>See United States v. Verduzco, </em>330 F.3d 1182, 1184 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that a district court may revoke probation if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of [probation]\u201d). Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 48-month sentence upon revocation because it expressly considered the guideline range for the underlying offense and imposed a sentence below the statutory five-year maximum. <em>See United States v. Olabanji </em>268 F.3d 636, 639 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that if the district court rejects \u201cthe range prescribed by the policy statements!,]\u201d it must \u201cconsider the range applicable to the underlying offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Tadeo, </em>222 F.3d 623, 626 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that the Chapter 7 policy statements \u201cmay be freely rejected by a district court without abusing its discretion, if the sentence actually imposed is within the statutory maximum\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b256-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
