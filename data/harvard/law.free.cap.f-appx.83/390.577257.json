L. No. 87-301, \u00a7 5(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1994) (repealed 1996; current version at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252), for review of a May 31, 2002 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA summarily affirmed the September 29, 1997, decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), who found Ou not credible, denied his application for asylum and withholding of deportation, and ordered him deported from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">In general, we treat an IJ\u2019s determination of credibility as a factual finding sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ject to the substantial evidence standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). A decision of the IJ will be reversed only where \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 49 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Discrepancies and omissions that concern integral grounds of the asylum claim, unlike immaterial inconsistencies, afford a sufficient basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>Cf. Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In this case there is ample relevant evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. The IJ noted numerous inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony. For example, the petitioner gave conflicting dates for the military maneuvers undertaken by the Chinese government; petitioner indicated that the military maneuvers were unsuccessful but he was unable to identify the purpose of the maneuvers; although petitioner claimed in his asylum application that he was questioned by government officials because of his conversation with a journalist, he did not recount this incident at his asylum hearing; petitioner testified that the port was closed during the 1995 calendar year, but also that his wife\u2019s abortion occurred in September, 1995 and that he was not at home because he was at sea (it would be unlikely for him to have been at sea if the port had been closed). Significantly, petitioner failed to mention the allegedly coerced abortion of his wife on his asylum application \u2014 or at any point in the proceedings\u2014 until ten days prior to the hearing before the IJ. In addition, the IJ noted that the petitioner\u2019s demeanor while testifying was consistent with someone who was not being truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the BIA properly dismissed Ou\u2019s appeal, and the petition for review is hereby DENIED. The judgment of the BIA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">. Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision and, in doing so, adopts the IJ's reasoning, we directly review the IJ's decision. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
