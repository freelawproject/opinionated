Bailey argues that (1) the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process by allowing his co-defendant to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against testifying, and that he was entitled to a continuance until his co-defendant was sentenced; and (2) the district court erred in applying a two-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) to Bailey\u2019s offense level for supervision of another\u2019s criminal activity. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm both the conviction and the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we include here only those facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>necessary to explain our decision. During Bailey\u2019s trial, the district court conducted a hearing outside the presence of the jury, at which co-defendant Morgan asserted her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. The court found her claim to be valid, and denied both Bailey\u2019s request for a continuance and his alternative request to compel a grant of use immunity for Morgan\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">I. Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">A criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, but \u201c[a]n accused\u2019s right to compulsory process to secure the attendance of a witness does not include the right to compel the witness to waive his fifth amendment privilege.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>682 F.2d 853, 856 (9th Cir.1982) (citing <em>United States v. Trejo-Zambrano, </em>582 F.2d 460, 464 (9th Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">We apply de novo review to Morgan\u2019s assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. <em>United States v. Rubio-Topete, </em>999 F.2d 1334, 1338 (9th Cir.1993). For her assertion to be valid, she must be \u201cconfronted by substantial and real, and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d <em>United States v. Apfelbaum, </em>445 U.S. 115, 128, 100 S.Ct. 948, 63 L.Ed.2d 250 (1980) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">We conclude that Morgan faced a genuine possibility of self-incrimination if she testified at Bailey\u2019s trial. As a convicted but unsentenced defendant, Morgan retained her Fifth Amendment rights. <em>United States v. Paris, </em>827 F.2d 395, 399 (9th Cir.1987). <em>See also Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999). Morgan had pled guilty to only one count of a two-count indictment. <em>See Moore, </em>682 F.2d at 856; <em>United States v. Valencia, </em>656 F.2d 412, 416-17 (9th Cir.1981). Additionally, the plea agreement was binding only on the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, and did not protect Morgan from prosecution by a state authority, or by the Department of Justice outside of that district. Finally, the statute of limitations on the crimes charged is irrelevant to Morgan\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege, because the district court \u201cmay consider as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes actions which may be barred from prosecution by the applicable statute of limitations.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>217 F.3d 751, 754 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">We review for plain error Bailey\u2019s claim, made for the first time on appeal, that Morgan waived her Fifth Amendment privilege in her plea agreement. <em>See Paris, </em>827 F.2d at 398. We are unpersuaded by Bailey\u2019s argument. It is well-settled that a voluntary plea pursuant to a plea agreement \u201cis a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege only in regard to the crime that is admitted; the defendant retains the right against self-incrimination as to any crimes for which [she] may still be prosecuted.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>682 F.2d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The district court\u2019s decision to exclude testimony based on an anticipated invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Klinger, </em>128 F.3d 705, 709 (9th Cir.1997). Since Morgan\u2019s claim of privilege was valid, the district court did not abuse its discretion, nor did it commit plain error, in finding that Morgan should not be called as a defense witness nor required to answer Bailey\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">The district court\u2019s denial of the motion for a continuance was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rude, </em>88 F.3d 1538, 1550 (9th Cir.1996). Bailey has not established that Morgan would have testified, or that any testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>would have been favorable. <em>See United States v. Sukumolachan, </em>610 F.2d 685, 687 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Similarly, the refusal to compel a grant of immunity to Morgan was not error. It is well-settled in this Circuit that an accused\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process does not entitle him \u201cto compel a prosecutor to grant immunity to a potential defense witness to get [her] to testify.\u201d <em>Trejo-Zambrano, </em>582 F.2d at 464. The district court, on the other hand, can compel a grant of immunity only in limited circumstances, where such a measure is required by due process. <em>See United States v. Lord, </em>711 F.2d 887, 890 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Westerdahl, </em>945 F.2d 1083, 1086 (9th Cir.1991). Even if Morgan\u2019s testimony would have been relevant and non-cumulative, Bailey has failed to establish that the government violated due process by intentionally distorting the fact-finding process. No prosecutorial misconduct is present in this case: the government asserted correctly in the district court that Morgan\u2019s plea agreement was not binding on any authority other than the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, and Morgan decided to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege on the advice of counsel. <em>See United States v. Duran, </em>189 F.3d 1071, 1087 (9th Cir.1999). The district court did not err in refusing to compel a grant of use immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">II. Two-level upward sentencing adjustment for supervision</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The district court\u2019s factual determination that a defendant qualifies for a role adjustment is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000). Although it is a close question, we conclude that the district court did not err in enhancing Morgan\u2019s sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(e), which provides for a two-level increase \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d not involving five or more participants, and that is not otherwise extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">In this case, Bailey directed Curtis to accept $310,000 in cash to purchase property, told him to place the money in escrow, and to spend it as instructed. On these facts, it was not clear error for the district court to find that Bailey supervised Curtis, and to impose the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
