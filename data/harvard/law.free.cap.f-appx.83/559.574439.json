See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Steven Antwone Watson seeks to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The order is appealable only if a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Watson has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Watson\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-13\"> The parties consented to the magistrate judge's exercise of jurisdiction in the case in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
