Miceli claims that the retaliation took the form of an August 3, 1998, memorandum from his direct supervisor notifying him that his performance did not meet expectations and requiring him to improve his performance or face disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the FAA, holding that the August 3, 1998, memorandum did not constitute an adverse employment action and that, even if it did, Miceli has offered no proof that the memorandum was the result of his testimony in 1996. Miceli appealed to this court, arguing that these findings were in error. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-17\">Miceli has worked for the FAA in the air traffic control tower at the Northern Kentucky-Greater Cincinnati International Airport for more than thirty years. Miceli alleges that, sometime prior to 1996, he witnessed the then manager of the tower, Wayne Goswick, sexually harass another employee, Cheryl Harris. In June or July 1996, Miceli testified against Goswick in response to a government investigation into Harris\u2019s sexual harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-18\">In late 1996, Goswick separated from the FAA. In February 1998, Michael Wheeler became the manager of the Cincinnati tower and Sherry Jensen became Miceli\u2019s direct supervisor. Miceli alleges that Wheeler and Jensen verbally abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>him, demeaned him, and \u201ceffectively \u2018cut [him] out of the loop\u2019 of management decisions\u201d in retaliation for his testimony against Goswick in 1996. According to Miceli, this \u201cdemeaning treatment\u201d culminated when he received a memorandum dated August 3, 1998, from Jensen which informed him that his performance was unsatisfactory. Miceli was also informed in this letter that he would have the opportunity to participate in the company\u2019s \u201cOpportunity to Demonstrate Performance Plan,\u201d the outcome of which would determine his future job status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On September 23, 1998, Miceli filed a complaint of discrimination with the Department of Transportation, Office of Civil Rights, alleging that the August 3, 1998, memorandum (referred to by the parties as an ODP letter) constituted retaliation for his 1996 testimony. By letter dated October 14, 1998, Jensen notified Miceli that he had successfully completed his Opportunity to Demonstrate Performance Plan. Miceli exhausted all of his administrative remedies with respect to his 1998 complaint, and on September 12, 2000, Miceli filed this action in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The district court, adopting the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, granted the FAA\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss or for summary judgment.\u201d We review such a grant <em>de novo </em>under the summary judgment standard. We affirm a lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Little v. BP Exploration &amp; Oil Co., </em>265 F.3d 357, 361 (6th Cir.2001) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">\u201cIn order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) the exercise of his civil rights was known to the defendant; (3) thereafter, the defendant took an employment action adverse to the plaintiff; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Allen v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>165 F.3d 405, 412 (6th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">Here, Miceli cannot demonstrate that the FAA took any adverse employment action. To satisfy the adverse employment action element of a Title VII claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she suffered a \u201cmaterially adverse change in the terms of her employment.\u201d <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., </em>97 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>876, 885 (6th Cir.1996). In other words, there must be \u201ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Burlington Indus. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The ODP letter did not constitute an adverse employment action because it did not materially change the terms of Miceli\u2019s employment, as viewed in light of the above standard. <em>Cf. Agnew v. BASF Corp., </em>286 F.3d 307 (6th Cir.2002) (holding that an employer\u2019s requirement that an employee comply with a \u201cperformance improvement plan\u201d or face disciplinary action did not constitute an adverse employment action under Michigan\u2019s equivalent of Title VII). For instance, the ODP letter did not affect Miceli\u2019s wages. <em>See Hollins v. Atlantic Co., </em>188 F.3d 652, 662 (6th Cir.1999) (holding that lowered ratings in a performance evaluation did not constitute an adverse employment action in the absence of \u201cevidence to show that the lowered performance ratings actually had an effect on her wages such that a court may conclude that there was a materially adverse employment action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The absence of an adverse employment action defeats Miceli\u2019s claim. The claim also fails, however, because Miceli has not demonstrated that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action. To show a such a causal connection, Miceli must either show direct evidence, or offer proof of \u201cknowledge coupled with a closeness in time that creates an inference of causation.\u201d <em>Nguyen v. City of Cleveland, </em>229 F.3d 559, 566 (6th Cir.2000). The <em>Nguyen </em>court goes on to note that \u201ctemporal proximity alone will not support an inference of retaliatory discrimination when there is no other compelling evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Here, Miceli testified in June or July of 1996. Miceli submits his own affidavit, in which he states that, sometime around August 1996, Goswick told him that by testifying earlier that summer Miceli had \u201cgone outside the circle of management\u201d and that \u201cyou don\u2019t do that.\u201d The alleged retaliatory discrimination did not take place until 1998, two years after Miceli testified. In addition, Goswick separated from the FAA in late 1996 and was not involved in the 1998 decision to issue the ODP letter to Miceli. Miceli also attests that soon after Wheeler became manager, Miceli \u201cheard Mr. Wheeler angrily expressing, in substance, that \u2018they\u2019re not going to do to me what they did to Go-swick.\u2019 \u201d This isolated statement does not constitute evidence that Miceli\u2019s 1996 testimony resulted in the 1998 ODP letter. Thus, here Miceli has failed to offer evidence of temporal proximity or other compelling evidence of a causal connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">For these reasons, we find that Miceli has not met his burden of producing evidence that he was subject to an adverse employment action. In addition, even if we accept his contention that the ODP letter was an adverse employment action, Miceli has not produced evidence from which a trier of fact could find a causal connection between the protected activity, testifying about Goswick\u2019s alleged sexual harassment, and the ODP letter. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to the FAA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">.
