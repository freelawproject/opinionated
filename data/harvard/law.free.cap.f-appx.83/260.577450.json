We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Bryant contends that her sentence of 25-years-to-life under the California three-strikes law, CaLPenal Code \u00a7 667, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. This claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1173-74, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that a state court\u2019s decision affirming petitioner\u2019s sentence of two consecutive terms of 25-years-to-life under the three-strikes law was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court law) and <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1190, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (holding that petitioner\u2019s 25-years-to-life sentence under the three-strikes law did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Bryant has made no showing that the California three-strikes law fails to give notice to individuals that the conduct they engage in is forbidden by statute. <em>See Colautti v. Franklin, </em>439 U.S. 379, 390, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979). The three-strikes law clearly provides that the penalty for committing a felony with two prior serious felony convictions is a sentence of at least 25-years-to-life.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Although Bryant\u2019s sentence is severe, we cannot say that it violates clearly established Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b291-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
