Almenas, </em>143 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir.1998). The district court also concluded correctly that D\u2019Amato cannot recover damages against Rattoballi under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 or 1622, because these criminal statutes, standing alone, do not provide for civil remedies. To the extent that D\u2019Amato has also alleged state-law claims, the district court properly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to address those claims. <em>See Valencia ex rel. Franco v. Lee, </em>316 F.3d 299, 305-08 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">On appeal, D\u2019Amato also raises various claims against the district court judge. He cannot prevail on these claims either. It is well-established that a judge is entitled to absolute immunity from liability for damages under section 1983 for actions performed in her judicial capacity, and that the judge \u201cwill not be deprived of immunity [even] if the action [she] took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of [her] authority.\u201d <em>Fields v. Soloff, </em>920 F.2d 1114, 1119- (2d Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). As for D\u2019Amato\u2019s claims that the district court has, among other things, unduly delayed the resolution of his habeas petition, even were that true, an application for a writ of mandamus, rather than a section 1983 action, would be the proper vehicle with which to address the claims. <em>See Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>490 U.S. 296, 308, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
