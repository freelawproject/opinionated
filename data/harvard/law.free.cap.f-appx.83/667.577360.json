George argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying the Assistant Federal Public Defender Chris A. Cooklin\u2019s first motion to withdraw as appointed counsel. A valid guilty plea waives any nonjurisdic-tional defects leading to a conviction <em>United States v. Owens, </em>996 F.2d 59, 60 (5th Cir.1993). The issue of the district court\u2019s denial of appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw involves a purported nonjurisdie-tional defect waived by George\u2019s valid guilty plea. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-22\">George also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A district court may grant a motion to withdraw a guilty plea before a defendant is sentenced upon a showing by the defendant of \u201ca fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B) (2003); <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 857 (5th Cir.1998) (citing former Fed. R.Crim. P. 32(e)); <em>see also United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying George\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See Brewster, </em>137 F.3d at 857-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
