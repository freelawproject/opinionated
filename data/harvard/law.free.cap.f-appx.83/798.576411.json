This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">Adams initiated this action against Detective John Minogue, Detective of the Domestic Violence Unit of the Jefferson County Police Department. He sues defendant Minogue in his individual capacity and seeks monetary and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">According to the complaint, defendant Minogue \u201cillegally entered\u201d Adams\u2019s apartment on June 10.2001, while Adams \u201cwas away.\u201d Defendant Minogue additionally \u201cconducted an illegal search.\u201d Adams claims that the \u201csearch was illegal because the defendant entered [Adams\u2019s] apartment while no exigent circumstances existed, and without the benefit of a search warrant.\u201d During the search, defendant Minogue photographed several areas and items in Adams\u2019s master bedroom, dining room, and kitchen. \u201cAs a result of this illegal entry and search the defendant Detective John Minogue maliciously charged [Adams] ... with Intimidating a witness. Terroristic threatening, and Menacing under the laws of the city of Louisville.\u201d Adams claims a violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) in light of the holding in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364,129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">The district court\u2019s order is reviewed de novo. <em>See McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997). Upon review, we conclude that Adams\u2019s complaint is barred by <em>Heck. </em>In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner cannot make a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983 for an alleged unconstitutional conviction or for \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d unless a prisoner shows that the conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d' <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Furthermore, the claim is not cognizable and must be dismissed whether the plaintiff seeks to obtain monetary damages or to attack the validity of his confinement. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>see also Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (habeas corpus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>proceeding, not \u00a7 1983, is appropriate remedy for a state prisoner to attack the validity or length of his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">As Adams\u2019s conviction has not been invalidated, any ruling on Adams\u2019s arguments would call into question the validity of his conviction. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Adams\u2019s civil rights complaint. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87,114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
