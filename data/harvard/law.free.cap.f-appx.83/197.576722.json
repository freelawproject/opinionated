We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds, and we review the district court\u2019s findings of facts for clear error. <em>See Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir. 1999). We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Hernandez contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because his counsel misrepresented to him that she would file a petition for review with the California Supreme Court, but failed to do so, and because she delayed sending petitioner his trial transcripts for four months. However, counsel\u2019s negligence does not typically warrant equitable tolling, <em>see Frye v. Hickman, </em>258 F.3d 1036, 1038 (9th Cir.2001), and petitioner had more than eight months following counsel\u2019s alleged negligence to file his federal petition. <em>See Allen v. Lewis, </em>255 F.3d 798, 799-800 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Hernandez also contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because an alleged prison lockdown limited his access to the law library, preventing him from photocopying his petition. However, he has failed to produced any evidence demonstrating how this limited access made it impossible for him to file a timely petition. <em>See Allen, </em>255 F.3d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Because Hernandez has not alleged specific facts which, if true, would entitle him to relief, he is not entitled to a hearing on equitable tolling. <em>Cf. United States v. McMullen, </em>98 F.3d 1155, 1159 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b227-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
