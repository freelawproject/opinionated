Illston, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b969-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">In July, 1988, appellant Patrick Grady was convicted following jury trial of conspiracy to distribute cocaine (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846), distribution of cocaine (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)) and several related telephone offenses (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b)). In September, 1988, he was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment. In June, 1990, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mistretta v. United </em>States, 488 U.S. 361, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), he was resentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines to 293 months in prison followed by five years supervised release. He was not convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848, the continuing criminal enterprise statute. He now argues that he was sentenced in violation of <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), because the jury was not asked to make a unanimous finding regarding the contested drug quantity that the sentencing court used to increase his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-17\">As appellant concedes, the <em>Richardson </em>holding applies only to those charged with or convicted of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848: \u201c[A] jury in a federal criminal case brought under \u00a7 848 must unanimously agree not only that the defendant committed some \u2018continuing series of violations\u2019 but also that the defendant committed each of the individual \u2018violations\u2019 necessary to make up that \u2018continuing series.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson, </em>526 U.S. at 816, 119 S.Ct. 1707. Appellant argues, however, that the rationale of jury unanimity behind <em>Richardson </em>should apply to his claim. He argues that his rights to due process were violated when the sentencing court made drug quantity findings based on evidence with which the jury was never presented and on which it never reached a unanimous verdict. However, <em>Richardson </em>dealt with the substantive elements of the continuing criminal enterprise statute, not to statutory sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">Appellant also asserts that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) would require that the jury decide the contested drug quantity in his case. However, <em>Apprendi </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>decided long after appellant\u2019s conviction became final. It announced a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure which had not been announced at the time that appellant\u2019s conviction became final; and, as was decided by this court in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664, 671 (9th Cir.2002), does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Prior to filing this challenge to the legality of his sentence, appellant had already filed one petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He was therefore prohibited by AEDPA from filing another \u00a7 2255 petition, unless he first obtained certification from this Court that his petition was premised on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law. Appellant has previously requested, and was denied, such certification from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Appellant therefore couched this claim as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, even though this kind of challenge to the legality of the sentence must normally be brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255. He argues that he may do so here under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause: \u201cUnder the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 ... a federal prisoner may file a habeas corpus petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 to contest the legality of a sentence where his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u2018inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hernandez v. Campbell, </em>204 F.3d 861, 865 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and <em>Moore v. Reno, </em>185 F.3d 1054, 1055 (9th Cir. 1999)). This exception has been applied where defendants have claimed \u201cactual innocence\u201d of the substantive offense, including at least one instance where the actual innocence claim was based on <em>Richardson v. United States. See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>234 F.3d 277 (5th Cir.2000). Such an exception, however, does not apply to appellant, whose claim is not controlled by or affected by <em>Richardson v. United States.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The district court correctly concluded that the \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus should be construed as a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and the court correctly dismissed it as a second or successive petition not authorized by the Court of Appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b969-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
