Marin (aka Melvin M. Marinko-vic) appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order denying his request for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal from the summary judgment dismissing his action under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and various state laws, and the district court\u2019s order enjoining Marin from commencing future litigation unless he complies with certain pre-filing restrictions. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion both the denial of a motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal, <em>Alaska Limestone Corp. v. Hodel, </em>799 F.2d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam), and the imposition of pre-filing restrictions, <em>Moy v. United </em>States, 906 F.2d 467, 469 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Marin\u2019s motion seeking an extension of time within which to file a notice of appeal because Marin\u2019s belief that a pending vexatious litigant order somehow tolled the time within which to file a notice of appeal does not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-22\">The district court abused its discretion when it enjoined Marin from commencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>any pro se lawsuit or other proceeding in any federal district court unless certain conditions were satisfied. Even though the court gave Marin sufficient notice and opportunity to oppose its order to show cause; provided a more than adequate record for review demonstrating that Marin\u2019s litigation activities were and are \u201cnumerous\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d; made substantive and detailed findings that both the content and the number of Marin\u2019s filings indicated frivolous litigation or a pattern of harassment; and found that the extraordinary scope of Marin\u2019s litigation activities warrants a broad injunction, the pre-filing restriction is not narrowly tailored. <em>De Long v. Hennessey, </em>912 F.2d 1144, 1147-48 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The district court abused its discretion when it imposed a blanket pre-filing restriction upon all future litigation that Marin may attempt to pursue in any federal district court, whether or not such litigation is related to matters that have been heard in the Eastern District of California. <em>See Wood v. Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce, Inc., </em>705 F.2d 1515, 1523-24 (9th Cir.1983) (upholding an injunction into prevent re-litigation in other courts so as to preserve principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata). Despite the fact that the \u201cextraordinary\u201d nature of Marin\u2019s litigation activities warrants an \u201cextraordinary\u201d response, <em>Franklin v. Murphy, </em>745 F.2d 1221, 1231 (9th Cir.1984), the district court should consider upon remand whether it should narrow the scope of the restriction to all legal matters that Marin may attempt to pursue in the Eastern District.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Marin\u2019s other contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b977-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
