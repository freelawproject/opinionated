We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see McNeil v. Middleton, </em>344 F.3d 988, 994 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">Phillips contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 4502. Specifically, he argues that the state did not prove that he knew the weapon was in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">The California Court of Appeal concluded that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have inferred that Phillips knew about the weapon in his shoes, based on the inflexibility of the shoes, coupled with the testimony of a witness who saw Phillips wearing the shoes just prior to handing them over for inspection. As a result, the California Court of Appeal found the evidence sufficient to support Phillips\u2019 conviction. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (setting forth sufficiency of the evidence standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-19\">In light of the record before this court, we conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination was not \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1174-75, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). Accordingly, the district court properly denied Phillips\u2019 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b971-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-22\">.
