He argues that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is the appropriate vehicle for attacking his convictions based on a new rule of law set forth by the Supreme Court. He argues that, in view of <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), his firearm conviction should be vacated because he did not use or carry the firearm in furtherance of drug-trafficking activity. Because Torres has not shown that his claims were foreclosed by circuit law when he filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, Torres has not shown that his claims fall within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 903 (5th Cir.2001). Further, Torres\u2019 claim, that there was no evidence that he possessed the firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense, was raised and rejected on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 410 (5th Cir.2000). He may not relitigate this claim. <em>See United States v. Rocha, </em>109 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Torres\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">For the first time on appeal, Torres argues that: (1) the district court did not have jurisdiction to enhance his sentence; (2) his five-year sentence for the firearm offense violated his plea agreement; (3) his conviction and sentence for possession with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine should be vacated in view of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (4) his counsel was ineffective. This court will not consider new claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
