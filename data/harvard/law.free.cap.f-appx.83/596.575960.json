Nolley\u2019s sentence was increased pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because a firearm was possessed. He argues that the Government\u2019s failure to allege his use or possession of a firearm in the indictment rendered his judgment of conviction invalid under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Nolley\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Randle, </em>304 F.3d 373, 378 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S.-, 123 S.Ct. 1748, 155 L.Ed.2d 514 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-22\">Nolley also contends that his judgment of conviction is invalid on the same ground under <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). He asserts that, despite contrary language in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), the holding of <em>Harris </em>is suspect in light of <em>Ring. </em>Nolley\u2019s arguments regarding <em>Ring </em>and <em>Harris </em>are wholly lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
