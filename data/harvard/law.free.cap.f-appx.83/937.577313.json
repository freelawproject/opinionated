We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-29\">Villa-Serrano contends that the district court erred by denying his request for a minimal role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 361.2(a). We review for clear error, <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436 (9th Cir.1994), and find none. Because Villa-Serrano helped coordinate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the drug transaction, involved his co-defendant in the offense, and received money for the drugs, he failed to show that he was plainly among the least culpable participants. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 4; <em>Davis, </em>36 F.3d at 1436-37 (affirming denial of role adjustment where defendant had responsibility for carrying drugs and accepting money for them).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Villa-Serrano\u2019s next contention is that the district court erred by denying his request for a downward adjustment or departure based on sentencing entrapment. Because Villa-Serrano stated that he was not predisposed to commit any drug offense prior to the informant\u2019s contacting him, the facts of this case do not support a reduction or departure for sentencing entrapment. <em>See United States v. Staufer, </em>38 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.1994) (stating that sentencing entrapment occurs when \u201ca defendant, although predisposed to commit a minor or lesser offense, is entrapped in committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision not to grant a sentencing entrapment reduction or departure was not error. <em>See Marino v. Vasquez, </em>812 F.2d 499, 508 (9th Cir.1987) (stating that a court of appeals may affirm district court on any grounds contained in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Villa-Serrano\u2019s final contention is that the district court erred by denying his request for a downward departure based on aberrant conduct pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.20. Because the district court acknowledged it had the authority to depart, but simply declined to do so on these facts, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Garcia, </em>927 F.2d 489, 491 (9th Cir.1991) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b967-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
