Kennedy argues that the district court\u2019s erroneous advice concerning the maximum sentence on his firearm possession offense invalidated his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-23\">Because Kennedy failed to object to the district court\u2019s Rule 11 colloquy, the issue is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 58-59,122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Under the plain-error standard of review, \u201creversal is not required unless there is (1) an error; (2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-24\">The district court misadvised Kennedy that the maximum penalty on the firearm possession count was five years\u2019 imprisonment. The stated term was in fact the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). Although the district court erred, Kennedy fails to establish that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d at 459. At rearraignment, Kennedy confirmed that his maximum sentencing exposure was life imprisonment on the conspiracy count and that any sentence imposed on the firearm possession count would run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. The district court imposed only a 120-month sentence on the conspiracy count and a 60-month sentence on the firearm possession count. <em>See United States v. Cuevas-Andrade, </em>232 F.3d 440, 444 (5th Cir.2000). Kennedy has not established that the district court\u2019s error materially affected his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>(5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
