In 2002, after Lockett admitted violating conditions of his supervised release, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 46 months imprisonment. Lockett appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-24\">We conclude the district court did not exceed the limits of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) or abuse its discretion by imposing a 46-month sentence, because this term does not exceed the 5-year maximum prison sentence that could have been imposed upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (drug offense involving 50 grams or more of cocaine base is punishable by sentence of not more than life); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(1) (offense punishable by maximum term of life is Class A felony), 3583(e)(3) (limiting supervised-release revocation sentences to no more than 5 years imprisonment where offense that resulted in term of supervised release is Class A felony); <em>United States v. St. John, </em>92 F.3d 761, 766 (8th Cir.1996) (period of time defendant\u2019s freedom can be restrained upon revocation of supervised release is capped by original supervised-release term); <em>United States v. Grimes, </em>54 F.3d 489, 492 (8th Cir.1995) (sentence imposed within limits of \u00a7 3583(e) is reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-25\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-21\">. The Honorable Dean Whipple, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
