We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">The evidence presented by the Tsoys does not compel this court to grant asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tsoys have put forth no proof that the bombing of their Seventh Day Adventist Church was either committed by government forces or by forces that the government was either unable or unwilling to control.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, the record supports the finding of the IJ that no facts sustain the argument that the Russian government would not or could not act to stop such a bombing. The United States Department of State\u2019s report on the country conditions of Russia states that \u201cpolice action is less likely to be based on [such grounds as the religious, ethnic or political background of the victim] as on inadequate staffing,\u201d and that if the complaint does not provide the Russian authorities with \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of the culprit, the authorities are unlikely to take action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the Seventh Day Adventist Church has registered under a 1997 Russian law and is therefore guaranteed freedom of religion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, while the bombing of the Tsoys\u2019 church was a terrible occurrence, and the failure of the police to apprehend the culprit unfortunate, the incident does not prove with compelling evidence that the Russian government was unwilling or unable to stop such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">The additional incidents suffered by the Tsoys do not rise to the level necessary to compel this court to find past persecution on an individual or cumulative basis. Nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>ther do the incidents establish with substantial evidence a well founded fear of future persecution. Therefore, this court may not overturn the decision of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">. <em>See Ochave v.
