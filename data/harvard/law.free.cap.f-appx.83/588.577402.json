Because Tillman\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the legality of his conviction, Tillman was required to show that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provided him with an inadequate or ineffective remedy. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). \u201c[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which established that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">To bring his claim under the \u201csavings clause,\u201d Tillman argues that he could not have brought the instant claim that the sentencing court was without jurisdiction to sentence him until 1998, when the Eleventh Circuit issued <em>Harris v. United States, </em>149 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.1998). <em>Harris, </em>however, is not a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that Tillman may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense. Because Tillman fails to identify any authority demonstrating that he was convicted of a non-existent offense, his jurisdictional challenge to his conviction fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Tillman\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
