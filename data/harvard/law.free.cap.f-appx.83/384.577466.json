Shirley Gaicano was convicted of one count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(3) (violent crime in aid of racketeering) and a second count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(3) (narcotics conspiracy). Luis Ramirez and Juan Ramirez were both convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (racketeering), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) (racketeering conspiracy), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1) (kid-naping in aid of racketeering), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1) (murder in aid of racketeering), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (conspiracy to rob), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 &amp; 2 (robbery), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (narcotics conspiracy). In addition, Juan Ramirez was convicted of counts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(3) (assault), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1952 &amp; 2 (interstate travel in aid of racketeering), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 <em>&amp; </em>2 (conspiracy to rob and robbery), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201 and 2 (kidnap-ing), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314 &amp; 2 (interstate transportation of stolen goods), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) &amp; 2 (use of a firearm), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (unlawful possession of a firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-20\">\n<em>Severance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">At trial, both Gaicano and Luis Ramirez made motions to sever their cases. The district court denied both motions. These denials amounted to neither an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d nor a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>11 F.3d 315, 341 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Friedman, </em>854 F.2d 535, 563 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\n<em>\u201cOther Acts\u201d Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Gaicano challenges three of the district court\u2019s decisions to admit testimony relating to \u201cother acts\u201d not directly at issue in this case: (1) her post-arrest statement to police that \u201c[s]he has changed since doing all that\u201d followed by \u201cshe\u2019s been living in Reading for seven years\u201d; (2) her 1991 crack sales to Angelica Gonzalez\u2019s mother; and (3) her possession and firing of a gun during a squabble with Melissa Nieves. The district court did not exceed its discretion in admitting any of this evidence, <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>214 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2000), particularly in light of the broad range of evidence that is admissible in the conspiracy and racketeering context, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 682 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Calcano\u2019s post-arrest statement was subject to multiple interpretations, and the competing interpretations were properly before the jury for its evaluation. As for Calcano\u2019s purported 1991 crack sales, we are not persuaded on the record before us that the district court\u2019s statement that, \u201c[A]s I understand the law, I have to let it in,\u201d demonstrated that the court was unaware of its discretion to conduct a balancing of factors referred to in Rule 403 before admitting the evidence. Rather, we agree with the government that in context, the statement reflects the court\u2019s conclusion after exercising that discretion. <em>Cf. United States v. Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 942-43 (2d Cir.1980). Finally, the district court\u2019s admission of evidence relating to Calcano\u2019s possession of a small-caliber firearm was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Exclusion of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Gaicano further argues that the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence she sought to have admitted. None of these exclusions amounted to an abuse of discretion. First, it was not clear from the question to Angelica Gonzalez about the identity of her \u201csupplier\u201d that the question was intended to establish a link between Gonzalez and the conspiracy. Had a direct question been asked \u2014 for instance, whether her supplier was a member of the organization \u2014 we doubt that the district court would have ruled it irrelevant. Second, any error arising from the exclusion of Juan Ramirez\u2019s statement contained in Investigator Schade\u2019s police report of June 27, 1995 was mitigated by Juan Ramirez\u2019s decision to testify in his own defense. Finally, the exclusion of Officer Graul\u2019s June 27, 1995, report summarizing Rache Williams\u2019s statement was not an abuse of discretion inasmuch as Officer Graul was present to testify. <em>See United States v. Amuso, </em>21 F.3d 1251, 1262 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Gaicano alleges two instances of prose-cutorial misconduct. They do not require reversal. Gaicano has not come forward with evidence sufficient to establish that Rache Williams perjured herself and that the government used her testimony knowing of such perjury. We note further that Gaicano did not make a timely motion for a new trial on grounds that a government witness committed perjury. Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2); <em>United States v. McCarthy, </em>271 F.3d 387, 399 (2d Cir.2001). We also agree with the district court that the prosecution\u2019s summation did not render the trial unfair or cause substantial prejudice to Gaicano. The flaws in the summation therefore did not violate Calca-no\u2019s due process rights. <em>See United States v. Forlorma, </em>94 F.3d 91, 94 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">Luis Ramirez alleges several instances of prosecutorial misconduct, most of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>he did not object to at trial. Even had timely objections been made, however, we conclude that \u201cthe statements, viewed against the entire argument before the jury, [did not] deprive[ ] the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>793 F.2d 486, 490 (2d Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). A <em>fortiori, </em>their admission did not constitute \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>22 F.3d 430, 437 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\n<em>Challenge to a Juror for Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Juan Ramirez argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury when it rejected a challenge for cause to a juror. This argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Towne, </em>870 F.2d 880, 885 (2d Cir.1989) and <em>United States v. Murray, </em>618 F.2d 892, 899 (2d Cir.1980); <em>cf. United States v. Nelson, </em>277 F.3d 164, 201 (2d Cir.2002). <em>Admission of Purportedly Prejudicial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Juan Ramirez challenges the district court\u2019s admission of testimony relating to (1) the slashing of a man\u2019s neck at a club, (2) an incident at the beach where he pulled his girlfriend\u2019s hair and \u201cwhack[ed]\u201d her with a cast, and (3) another incident at the club involving the slashing of a dancer\u2019s face. The district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling this evidence admissible. We note, moreover, that (a) no objection to the testimony regarding the slashing of the dancer was taken; (b) the testimony about the events at the club were either not hearsay, under Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), or were admissible as \u201cstatements against interest\u201d under Fed. R.Evid. 804(b)(3), inasmuch as Juan Ramirez \u2014 who had not yet decided to take the stand \u2014 was \u201cnot available\u201d at the time the government\u2019s witnesses testified about events at the club; and (c) the district court could have admitted the testimony with respect to the hair-pulling incident to establish the relationship between the co-conspirators, and Juan Ramirez\u2019s role among organization members.</p>\n<p id=\"A0L\">\n<em>Self-Representation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Towards the end of the trial, Juan Ramirez made a request to represent himself <em>pro se. </em>Requests to proceed <em>pro se </em>that are made after trial has begun are left entirely to a district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>142 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.1998). The district court did not abuse that discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">\n<em>Instruction on Accomplice Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">In its charge to the jury, the district court explained reasons for scrutinizing accomplice testimony especially carefully, but then said that if these special considerations did not apply, there was \u201cno reason\u201d not to credit the accomplice testimony. When viewed in light of the charge as a whole, particularly the general instruction to the effect that the jury was the sole judge of all witness credibility, the challenged instruction was not unduly prejudicial. <em>See Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973); <em>United States v. Bok, </em>156 F.3d 157, 160 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Carr, </em>880 F.2d 1550, 1555 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">\n<em>Hobbs Act Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">Luis Ramirez, <em>pro se, </em>argues that contraband is not \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 <em>&amp; </em>2, and that in any event, the question of whether contraband constituted property was one for the jury. Robbery of contraband may, however, support a Hobbs Act conviction. <em>See United States v. Jamison, </em>299 F.3d 114 (2d Cir.2002). This is consistent with the general common law principle that contraband may be the subject of robbery. 77 C.J.S. Robbery \u00a7 6. In any event, it does not appear that a timely objection was made on these grounds. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\n<em>Uwilt-Assuming Hypothetical Questions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Assuming that the questions complained of were in fact \u201cguilt-assuming,\u201d the defense\u2019s specific questions to character witness Louis Schlanger relating to the charged crimes \u201copened the door\u201d to such questions by the government. <em>United States v. Russo, </em>110 F.3d 948, 953 (2d Cir.1997). They are therefore not grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\n<em>Vouching</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The government\u2019s conduct complained of as improper \u201cvouching\u201d for witnesses by the government was permissible. The testimony constituted \u201cfair response\u201d to testimony elicited by the defendants. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 32, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>22 F.3d 430, 438 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Luis Ramirez raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Without reaching the merits, we decline to entertain the argument here in light of our preference that such claims be raised in a collateral proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, an avenue still available to Luis Ramirez. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>205 F.3d 23, 35 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\n<em>Cumulative Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude, finally, that cumulative error warranting reversal has not been established by any of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
