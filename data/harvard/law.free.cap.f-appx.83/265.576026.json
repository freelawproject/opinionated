RApp. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Plaintiff Joyce Montabon appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant City and County of Denver on her claims alleging gender discrimination under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e through 2000e-17, for gender discrimination, and retaliation for complaining about violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621-34.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Montabon\u2019s gender discrimination claims were based on hostile work environment and disparate treatment. In granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court held that: (1) Montabon\u2019s hostile work environment claim fails because she is simply complaining about the general environment in which she worked and she has not adequately linked any of her complaints to gender; (2) Montabon\u2019s disparate treatment claim fails because she does not offer any evidence that other similarly-situated male employees were treated differently; (3) Montabon\u2019s ADEA claim fails because she cannot demonstrate that she engaged in protected activity in opposition to discrimination. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c) as the district court. <em>See Simms v. Okla. ex rel. Dep\u2019t of Mental Health &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1321,1326 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On appeal, Montabon raises the following issues: \u201c(1) Could the treatment of the plaintiff-appellant be viewed as sexually discriminatory under Title VII, [under] either hostile work environment or disparate treatment? (2) Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, did she complain about age discrimination? (3) Could a jury have found that plaintiff-appellant\u2019s age discrimination complaints resulted in retaliation?\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">After careful review of the record on appeal and the applicable legal standards, we conclude that the district court correctly decided this case. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated in its thorough Order dated November 27, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AA\">. The district court also granted summary judgment in favor of the City on Montabon's Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) claim, but Montabon did not appeal that judgment. See Aplt's Br. at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
