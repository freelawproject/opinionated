Because Richardson\u2019s grievances were denied as untimely, he did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866-67 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Marsh v. Jones, </em>53 F.3d 707, 710 (5th Cir.1995). Richardson has not explained the delay in filing his grievances or shown that any defenses to the exhaustion requirement such as waiver, estoppel, or equitable tolling are applicable. <em>See Days, </em>322 F.3d at 866. This court will not consider Richardson\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies because he was seeking monetary relief which is not available through the administrative process. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Nonetheless, prisoners must exhaust administrative remedies without regard to whether monetary relief is available. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
