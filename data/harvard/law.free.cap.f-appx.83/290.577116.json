The district court dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s complaint because it in essence sought appellate review of a state-court judgment. Plaintiff argues before this court that he was denied due process when the district court dismissed his complaint. We disagree and AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Plaintiff sustained an on-the-job injury on January 10, 1994. He brought suit against his employer, LPR Construction Company, and its insurer, Pinnacol Assurance, for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied benefits and the ICAO affirmed. Plaintiff then appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed. The Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari on January 13, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">On June 23, 2003, Plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in federal district court. The complaint is on a district court form. Plaintiff captioned the complaint \u201cUnfair-compation \u2014 Deceptive Practices Bad Faith.\u201d He listed as defendants the ICAO, LPR Construction, Miller Consulting, and Pinnacol Assurance. In the space after the printed words \u201cJurisdiction is asserted pursuant to the following statutory authorities:\u201d he wrote \u201cSupreme Court, State of Colorado Two East Fourteenth Avenue Denver, CO 80203.\u201d The complaint set forth three allegations: (1) \u201cGary Kemper first represented by counsel of Nortan Frickey\u201d; (2) \u201cAfter exten-sevie time counsel of the Frickey law firm Janet Frickey before ALJ DeLoras Atenced\u201d; and (3) \u201cGary Kemper forced to represent pro see to get inforcement rema-dey. Set hearing that begin Supreme Court State of Colorado action no. 02SCG71.\u201d The complaint requested the following relief: \u201cThat the U.S. District Court assert jurisdiction of enforcement and penaties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">The district court, liberally construing Mr. Kemper\u2019s complaint, found that he was seeking review of a state court judgment and dismissed the complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feld-man, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 414-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">In his opening brief to this court, Plaintiff asserts that the district court erred, but he does not explain how, nor does he address the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. In his reply brief he asserts: \u201cThis matter was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to deny due process. District court acting as advocate for defendants. Indication of case prejudicial.\u201d He admits, however, that \u201cthe basis for Mr. Kemper\u2019s complaint in District Court was to detur-main unlawful disscretion of judgment by Court of Appeals and its Panal.\u201d We understand this last statement to mean that Plaintiff is challenging the ruling of the Colorado Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We agree with the district court that Plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. \u201c[A] party losing in state court is barred from seeking ... appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court.\u201d <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994). In applying that doctrine, the district court did not deny Plaintiff due process, nor did it display any bias against Plaintiff. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s July 3, 2003, Order, we AFFIRM. All pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
