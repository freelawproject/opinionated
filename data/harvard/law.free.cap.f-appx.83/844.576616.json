The district court granted Maximus\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that Cunningham failed to allege a basis for federal jurisdiction and that none was apparent from the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">On appeal, Cunningham argues in the most general terms that the district court wrongly dismissed the complaint. We note that Cunningham\u2019s appellate brief fails to conform to the requirements of Fed. R.App. Proc. 28(a)(9) and 30, because he failed to present a coherent legal argument supported by relevant legal authority. We have dismissed pro se litigants\u2019 appeals for similar deficiencies. <em>See, e.g., Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545-46 (7th Cir.2001). Cunningham has failed to present a coherent argument and to respond to the district court\u2019s conclusion that he had not alleged a basis for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">DISMISSED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
