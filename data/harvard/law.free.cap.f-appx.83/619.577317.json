Solan argues that the district court erred in using acquitted conduct and unindicted conduct to justify making an upward departure in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Solan is not entitled to relief pursuant to the savings clause because his claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes his innocence. Additionally, Solan\u2019s claim was not foreclosed by circuit law at the time of his trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). In fact, So-lan acknowledges that he raised the instant claim on direct appeal and in his first \u00a7 2255 motion. The fact that Solan was unsuccessful in his first \u00a7 2255 motion or the inability of him to meet AEDPA\u2019s \u201csecond or successive\u201d requirement does not make \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 829 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Solan\u2019s argument for the expansion of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause beyond the criteria established by this court in <em>Reyes-Requena </em>has already been rejected in <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003). Solan does not raise on appeal his claim that he is entitled to relief because he is imprisoned in violation of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. It is therefore deemed abandoned, and this court need not address it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Solan\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-43\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
