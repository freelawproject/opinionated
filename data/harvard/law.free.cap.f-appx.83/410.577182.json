Sentyz, Jr. appeals from an order of the District Court affirming the denial of his application for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying Sentyz\u2019s claim for benefits \u201cis identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">In determining whether a claimant is disabled, the Commissioner must follow the familiar five step sequential analysis set forth in the regulations promulgated by the Social Security Administration. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. Here, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) concluded that: Sentyz was not engaging in substantial gainful activity; he did have a severe impairment, <em>i.e., </em>degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine; his severe impairment did not satisfy the criteria of any of the listed impairments in Appendix 1; Sentyz was unable to perform his past relevant work; but Sentyz\u2019s residual functional capacity did not preclude him from performing other work in the national economy. Thus, the ALJ determined that Sentyz was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">Sentyz appealed to the District Court, arguing that the ALJ erred at step three by concluding that the medical evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>record did not meet the criteria of listing 1.05C,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby resulting in an automatic finding of disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). According to Sentyz, this aspect of the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence because the ALJ failed to specifically identify the listings considered and to explain his conclusion that the medical evidence failed to satisfy that listing as required by <em>Burnett v. Commissioner, </em>220 F.3d 112 (3d Cir. 2000). After consideration of a report and recommendation by a magistrate judge, the District Court acknowledged that \u201cwhile the ALJ did not expressly lay out his reasoning for the determination under step three of the analysis that such error did not warrant remand of the matter back to the Commissioner in accordance with <em>Bumett[.]\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In <em>Burnett, </em>we were troubled by the ALJ\u2019s analysis at step three which summarily concluded that the plaintiff suffered from a severe musculoskeletal impairment, but that \u201csaid impairment failed to equal the level of severity of any disabling condition contained in Appendix 1, Subpart P of Social Security Regulations No. 4.\u201d 220 F.3d at 119. We reiterated that an ALJ must set forth his reasons for his decision to afford meaningful judicial review and remanded the case so the ALJ could discuss the evidence and explain whether and why Burnett\u2019s back and knee impairments, either alone or combined, were equivalent to the listed impairments in \u00a7 1.03 and \u00a7 1.05C. <em>Id. </em>at 119-20. We recognized, however, that the \u201cburden is on the claimant to present medical findings that show his or her impairment matches a listing or is equal in severity to a listed impairment.\u201d 220 F.3d at 120 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Unlike <em>Burnett, </em>here there was only one listing applicable to Sentyz\u2019s singular severe impairment of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, <em>ie., </em>listing 1.05C. Sentyz\u2019s counsel argued during closing statements that this listing applied and that there was sufficient medical evidence to establish the spasms, limitation of movement and \u201cneurological deficit[s].\u201d The focus of the proceeding before the ALJ was consistently on this particular listing and whether the limitations resulting from Sentyz\u2019s degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine satisfied either the criteria of that listing or precluded Sentyz from performing other work in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Consistent with this focus, the ALJ had to determine whether there was medical evidence of a \u201csignificant motor loss with muscle weakness <em>and </em>sensory <em>and </em>reflex loss\u201d as specified by listing 1.05C.2. Sentyz failed to identify evidence of this nature. Instead, he cited to medical evidence after he sustained his injury which established that the \u201cpower [was] intact in both lower extremities\u201d from October 1998 to May 1999. This does not establish a motor loss. In addition, Sentyz generally referred to \u201cneurologic deficits.\u201d His reliance on the neurologic deficits, however, ignored not only Dr. Wolk\u2019s report that his motor strength was equal, his reflexes were symmetrical and his sensation was intact, but also medical evidence from his treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>physician Dr. Kirschman in January 2000 that the strength in his lower extremities remained strong and equal and his reflexes were symmetrical. Thereafter, in March 2001, Dr. Page documented that Sentyz\u2019s reflexes in his lower extremities was normal, as was their appearance. In June 2001, Dr. Kirshman opined that Sentyz\u2019s reflexes were equal bilaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Accordingly, despite the inadequate explanation by the ALJ, meaningful judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s analysis at step three is possible because of the nature of Sen-tyz\u2019s back impairment, the singular listing at issue and the type of medical evidence necessary to establish this presumptively disabling condition. After consideration of the entire record, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision that Sentyz\u2019s impairment, though severe, did not satisfy the criteria of listing 1.05C. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-5\">. Listing 1.05C, which has since been recodified at 1.04, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">C.
