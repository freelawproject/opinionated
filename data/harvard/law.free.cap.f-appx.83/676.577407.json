Dade argues that the district court judge who convicted and sentenced him, and the appellate court judges who affirmed his conviction, violated his constitutional rights. He also argues that the Texas legislature violated his constitutional rights when it enacted various laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Dade\u2019s complaint lacks an arguable basis in law. He has sued judicial officers who are immune from suit, without identifying facts that would overcome judicial immunity. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). He has also sued the Texas legislature, which enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy. </em>Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). Additionally, the issues Dade raises imply the invalidity of his conviction and sentence. Dade\u2019s conviction was not reversed on direct appeal, and there is no indication in the record that it was expunged by an executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such a determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, Dade has failed to state a claim for a \u00a7 1983 constitutional violation. <em>See Johnson v. McElveen, </em>101 F.3d 423, 424 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Although the district court\u2019s dismissal was based on other grounds, we may dismiss this appeal on the alternate grounds of immunity and failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in <em>Heck. See Sojourner T. v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992) (court may affirm judgment on any basis supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The appeal is frivolous and is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Dade is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes he may not proceed <em>in forma pau-peris </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
