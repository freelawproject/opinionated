The immigration judge rejected the petition on the basis of an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-24\">Factual findings of adverse credibility are reviewed under the deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). In making an adverse credibility finding, the Board must state a legitimate basis to question the petitioner\u2019s credibility and must offer specific, cogent reasons for disbelief. <em>See Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-25\">In this case, the immigration judge offered specific, cogent reasons for doubting Valiyandiyil\u2019s credibility. Discrepancies in Valiyandiyil\u2019s testimony go to the heart of his past persecution claim. There were major inconsistencies in his testimony regarding an alleged attack suffered at the hands of Hindu nationalists on April 10, 1995, especially regarding the nature of the assailants, the status of Valiyandiyil\u2019s car after the attack, and the nature of Valiyandiyil\u2019s subsequent hospitalization. Despite his claimed unfamiliarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Hindi language, Valiyandiyil had ample opportunity to review and reassess the content of his testimony given in Hindi.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">We AFFIRM the judgment of the Board of Immigration Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b996-26\"> phis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
