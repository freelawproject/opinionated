Kasongo, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, appeals from the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ) denying asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Kasongo contends that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion; that the IJ erred by denying her application for asylum and withholding of deportation because she established past persecution based on her political views, and that she established her eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture because she presented evidence of past torture by government forces.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">We have approved of the BIA\u2019s use of summary-affirmance procedures. <em>Soad-jede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). The use of those procedures was appropriate in Kasongo\u2019s case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">We do not disturb the IJ\u2019s finding that Kasongo was not credible. <em>See Chun v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number><em>INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The record indicated that Kasongo\u2019s political activity, and that of her husband, was not sufficient to raise a well-founded fear of persecution by the Congolese government. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, Kasongo has not shown that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured by anybody acting in an official capacity upon return to the DROC. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
