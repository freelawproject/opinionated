This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">White was notified by the Commissioner on July 7, 1995, that her benefits would be terminated after September 1995. \"White appealed the termination of her eligibility. The termination was affirmed by an administrative law judge (ALJ) on March 14, 1997. During the appeal, \"White continued to receive benefits. From October 1995 until May 1997, \"White was overpaid benefits totaling $12,123.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">White then attempted to have the recovery of overpayment waived. After a hearing, an ALJ denied the waiver request on December 22, 1999. On July 26, 2001, the Appeals Council denied \"White\u2019s request to review the ALJ\u2019s decision. In the Appeals Council\u2019s decision, White was specifically notified that she had sixty days from the receipt of the Council\u2019s decision to file a civil action with the appropriate United States District Court. White did not file her civil complaint until January 22, 2002, long past the sixty day filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">The district court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. A subsequent motion for reconsideration was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">In her timely appeal, White argues that equitable tolling should have permitted her to proceed with her complaint; that the district court\u2019s order, without factual findings, was insufficient; and that because she was misled by the Social Security Administration, equitable tolling applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">The court reviews de novo an order dismissing a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ang v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>932 F.2d 540, 544 (6th Cir. 1991). The plaintiff has the burden of establishing jurisdiction after the defendant adequately challenges subject matter jurisdiction by a motion to dismiss. <em>See Moir v. Greater Cleveland Reg\u2019l Transit Auth., </em>895 F.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">The district court properly dismissed White\u2019s complaint. There is no dispute that the complaint was filed nearly six months after the Appeals Council\u2019s decision and thus nearly four months after the expiration of the statutory sixty day review period provided for in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). This court has consistently up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>held the proper application by a district court of the limitation period contained in \u00a7 405(g). <em>See Day v. Shalala, </em>23 F.3d 1052, 1058 (6th Cir.1994). Only in cases where equity favors extending the filing period should the courts extend the time allowed for commencing a civil action. <em>See Bowen v. City of New York, </em>476 U.S. 467, 480-81, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986). In this case, although White claimed she was misled by the Social Security Administration and that she had been granted sufficient extensions of time, her argument is insufficient to extend the sixty day filing period of \u00a7 405(g). <em>See Day, </em>23 F.3d at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The following five factors are to be considered in determining the appropriateness in tolling a statute of limitations: 1) the plaintiff\u2019s lack of notice of the filing requirement; 2) the plaintiffs lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement; 3) diligence in pursuing one\u2019s rights; 4) an absence of prejudice to the defendant; and 5) the plaintiffs reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing the claim. <em>See Dunlap v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 1001, 1008 (6th Cir.2001). Although White attempts to blame her failure to file a timely appeal on the Social Security Administration, White has not established that she lacked notice of the filing requirements of \u00a7 405(g). To the contrary, the Appeals Council\u2019s notice specifically warns White of the sixty day filing requirement. Further, there is no evidence that White attempted to diligently pursue her application with the Appeals Council. Thus, White is not entitled to equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">White also contends that the district court\u2019s order dismissing her case is insufficient. However, the district court\u2019s order states that based on the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, the motion was granted. The motion and the facts of the case are very clear. White\u2019s complaint is untimely under \u00a7 405(g). Therefore, the district court did not commit reversible error in not providing a lengthy opinion, with findings of fact, before concluding that White\u2019s complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
