Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging the use of excessive force and the denial of medical care in connection with a beating incident. He appeals the denial of his Fed. R. Crv. P. 60(b) motion and the final judgment dismissing his complaint. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\u201c[T]he decision to grant or deny relief under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 995 (5th Cir.l996)(en banc). Gross carelessness, ignorance of the rules, or ignorance of the law are insufficient bases for Rule 60(b)(1) relief. <em>Edward H. Bohlin Co., Inc. v. Banning Co., Inc., </em>6 F.3d 350, 356 (5th Cir.1993). Masterson has made no argument demonstrating good cause for his failure to complete service on the individual defendants or for his failure to correctly serve the United States. <em>See Systems Signs Supplies v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>903 F.2d 1011, 1013 (5th Cir.1990). Nor do his arguments demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion by denying him relief under Rule 60(b). <em>See Edwards, </em>78 F.3d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Masterson also argues that the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his remaining claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. \u201c[Fjederal prisoners suing under <em>Bivens </em>must first exhaust inmate grievance procedures just as state prisoners must exhaust administrative processes prior to instituting a \u00a7 1983 suit.\u201d <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 524, 122 S.Ct. 983,152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">Masterson is correct in his assertion that other circuits have held that exhaustion is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded. <em>See Ray v. Kertes, </em>285 F.3d 287, 293-94 (3d Cir.2002) (citations therein). However, Masterson failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s determination that he had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Masterson\u2019s argument is thus limited to review upon grounds of plain error. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415,1417 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc). We perceive no plain error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Highlands Ins. Co. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>27 F.3d 1027, 1032 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing such claims is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
