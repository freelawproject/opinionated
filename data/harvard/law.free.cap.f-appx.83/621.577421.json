Ball argues that he is entitled to relief under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that his counsel was ineffective for failure to object to his lengthy sentence. Ball further argues that the \u201crule of lenity\u201d should have been applied to determine the appropriate sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">This court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and that an <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>305 F.3d 304, 309 (5th Cir.2002). Additionally, Ball\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause. The claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes Ball\u2019s innocence. Furthermore, the claim could have been raised on direct appeal or in Ball\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Ball\u2019s \u201crule of lenity\u201d argument is raised for the first time on appeal and consequently is unreviewable. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ball\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
