The district court concluded his complaints were legally frivolous and dismissed them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). He appeals, pro se.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Like the original complaints, the appeal is frivolous and we dismiss it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Relying on <em>Rivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80, Fluker claims: 1) he was denied access to the courts because the prison does not have Colorado legal research materials, which he needs to pursue a medical malpractice claim, and 2) one defendant refused to photocopy certain documents for him. He also raises claims asserting he was retaliated against by various defendants when they filed fraudulent incident reports against him in violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We conclude Mr. Fluker\u2019s appeal is frivolous. We adopt the reasoning of the district court and DISMISS the appeal as frivolous. The dismissal of this appeal, combined with the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous, means Mr. Fluker has accumulated two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">.
