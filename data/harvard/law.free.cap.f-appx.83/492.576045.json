Enterprises, Inc. $64,950.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees that were expended in pursuing (and ultimately settling) a copyright infringement suit. We conclude that the District Court was correct and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">Because the facts are well-known to the parties, we note only a general outline. This dispute arises out of an agreement between Williams and Daniel Yeaney in which Yeaney agreed to write a musical \u201cjingle\u201d to advertise Williams\u2019s collision repair business, Todd\u2019s Auto Body. The jingle was aired on radio stations in the Williamsport and Lock Haven, Pennsylvania areas. Shortly after the jingle began running, Williams was called by one of T.D.D.\u2019s clients, Troy Nihart of Pool Doctor, who alleged that the jingle Yeaney had composed was substantially similar to one in which T.D.D. holds intellectual property rights and which it had licensed to Pool Doctor. (TJD.D.\u2019s primary source of revenue is fees from licensing its catalogue of jingles to businesses for use in their advertisements.) Williams initially refused to discontinue use of the allegedly infringing jingle, but approximately twenty days after first being alerted to the potential infringement \u2014 and about six weeks after the advertisement first aired \u2014 agreed to remove the ad.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">T.D.D. requested damages for the unauthorized use of its intellectual property. When Williams and Yeaney refused, T.D.D. filed suit. After approximately a year and a half, the parties entered into a settlement agreement in which Williams and Yeaney admitted the validity of T.DJD.\u2019s copyright and that they had infringed that copyright, agreed to pay $5,000 in damages, and agreed to be enjoined from further use of Yeaney\u2019s infringing jingle. However, because the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ties could not decide whether or in what amount Williams and Yeaney would compensate T.D.D. for its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs expended in defending its copyright, the settlement stated that \u201cit is understood that any party may petition the Court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to the Copyright Act of 1976 or other applicable law as a prevailing party....\u201d T.D.D. subsequently petitioned the District Court for $64,950.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and both parties agreed to allow the Court to decide the issue without a hearing. The Court awarded T.D.D. the fees. Williams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We review the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Lieb v. Topstone Indus., </em>788 F.2d 151, 154 (3d Cir.1986); <em>see also Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 522-24, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994). In making the award, the District Court considered the factors \u2014 including deterrence, compensation, the parties\u2019 relative financial strength, and the defendants\u2019 good faith\u2014 discussed in <em>Lieb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion here. As the Court noted, from the outset of the underlying copyright dispute Yeaney and Williams lacked an objectively reasonable or good-faith basis to believe that the jingle did not infringe T-D.D.\u2019s copyrighted work. Yet both Yeaney and Williams steadfastly maintained that their work did not infringe the copyright, necessitating that T.D.D. hire two music experts, file a complaint in the District Court, take depositions, and otherwise prepare for litigation. While Yeaney and Williams challenge the reasonableness of T.D.D.\u2019s hiring both California copyright counsel and local Pennsylvania litigation counsel, we do not believe that decision is unreasonable under the circumstances. T.D.D. is a California corporation and understandably first attempted to resolve the issue using its local counsel who specialized in copyright. However, when Yeaney and Williams refused to settle and it seemed that litigation in Pennsylvania was imminent, T.D.D. sensibly hired counsel familiar with Pennsylvania practice and who was admitted to practice in Pennsylvania (which T.D.D.\u2019s California counsel was not). As Yeaney and Williams do not challenge any specific expenditures, we have no basis to conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by reimbursing any particular expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the District Court properly exercised its discretion awarding T.D.D. attorneys\u2019 fees. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">. T.D.D. later sought $16,560.41 in supplemental attorneys\u2019 fees. The Court awarded approximately 20% of the supplemental fees T.D.D. requested. No appeal was taken from this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
