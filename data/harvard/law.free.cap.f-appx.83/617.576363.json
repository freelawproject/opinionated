Nixon argues that the district court prematurely dismissed his claim against Judge Green based on qualified immunity. Nixon additionally contends that his claim falls under the <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), exception to the State of Texas\u2019 sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-21\">\u201cJudicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). \u201cJudicial immunity can be overcome only by showing that the actions complained of were nonjudicial in nature or by showing that the actions were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Because Nixon does not complain of any actions by Judge Green that were nonjudicial in nature or taken completely without jurisdiction, the district court properly dismissed any claim against her as frivolous based on her judicial immunity. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-22\">\u201cTo meet the <em>Ex Parte Young </em>exception, a plaintiff\u2019s suit alleging a violation of federal law must be brought against individual persons in their official capacities as agents of the state, and the relief sought must be declaratory or injunctive in nature and prospective in effect.\u201d <em>Aguilar v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>160 F.3d 1052,1054 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). Athough Nixon\u2019s claim is brought against an individual, Judge Green, as an agent of the state, Nixon is seeking damages for past actions. Therefore, Nixon\u2019s claim does not meet the <em>Ex parte Young </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
