He argues that his prior Texas felony conviction for indecency with a child was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d warranting the 16-level increase under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2 and that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional. He states that the former issue is raised for the purpose of seeking <em>en bane </em>review and that both issues are raised on appeal to preserve Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-21\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level increase when the defendant has a prior felony conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (Nov. 2002). A crime of violence is defined to include \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at comment, n. l(B)(ii)(II). The Texas crime of indecency with a child, <em>see </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 21.11, constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>United States v. Zavala-Sus-taita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir.2002). Molina\u2019s 16-level increase was warranted by his prior conviction for indecency with a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-22\">A panel of this court cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999). No decision overruling <em>Rayo-Valdez </em>exists, and, to the extent Molina is requesting initial <em>en banc </em>review of this issue, his request is DENIED. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 35(c); 5th Cir. R. 35.2; <em>Point Landing, Inc. v. Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>795 F.2d 415, 419 (5th Cir.1986) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-23\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. Molina acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but asserts that Supreme Court cases decided after <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>including <em>Jones v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000), <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), and <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), raise a question about the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion seeking summary affirmance, dismissal of the appeal, or an extension of time to file a brief on the merits is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b48-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
