R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Clark Brady, a prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights suit. The district court dismissed Brady\u2019s suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) on the ground that Brady had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. As was true below, Brady does not contend on appeal that he had exhausted his administrative remedies at the time he filed his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Instead, he asserts that he need not exhaust because (1) the administrative remedies available in Colorado are insufficient and (2) \u00a7 1997e(a) does not apply to his claims. As noted by the district court, Brady\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). According to <em>Porter,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">Once within the discretion of the district court, exhaustion in cases covered by \u00a7 1997e(a) is now mandatory. All \u201cavailable\u201d remedies must now be exhausted; those remedies need not meet federal standards, nor must they be \u201cplain, speedy, and effective.\u201d Even when the prisoner seeks relief not available in grievance proceedings, notably money damages, exhaustion is a prerequisite to suit. And unlike the previous provision, which encompassed only \u00a7 1983 suits, exhaustion is now required for all \u201caetion[s] ... brought with respect to prison conditions,\u201d whether under \u00a7 1983 or \u201cany other Federal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 524; <em>see also id. </em>at 532 (\u201c[W]e hold that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">The district court was clearly correct in concluding that Brady could not proceed with his \u00a7 1983 claim because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any ... correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d). Having so concluded, however, the district court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>have dismissed without prejudice. <em>See Yousef v. Reno, </em>254 F.3d 1214,1216 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 1222-23 (10th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the district court to vacate its entry of judgment in favor of the defendants and to, instead, dismiss Brady\u2019s claims without prejudice to allow exhaustion of his administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>Larry Gordon\u2019s Motion Requesting Leave of the Court to File Amicus Curiae Brief is hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
