He contends that the district court erred by failing to depart downward for over-representation of Vera-Figueroa\u2019s criminal history. Because the record conclusively shows that the district court was aware of its authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>depart from the sentencing guidelines on this ground, we have no jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s discretionary refusal to do so. <em>United States v. GutierrezCer-vantes, </em>132 F.3d 460, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Vera-Figueroa also contends that the district court erred under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l) by departing downward only two levels for Vera-Figueroa\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, denying him the third level solely because he did not plead guilty until the day before trial. The government concedes remand is required on this issue under <em>United States v. Blanco-Galle-gos, </em>188 F.3d 1072, 1077 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing to enable the district court to comply with Guideline \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">DISMISSED, in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b957-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
