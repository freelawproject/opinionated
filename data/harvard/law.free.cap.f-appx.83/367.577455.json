In computing the defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court increased his offense level (1) three levels pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2J1.7 because it found that Jacobs committed the instant offenses while on release for another crime, and (2) two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because the court found that Jacobs obstructed justice by failing to appear for a hearing in a related offense. Jacobs appeals these enhancements to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Jacobs challenges his sentence on appeal arguing for the first time that (1) the instant offenses did not occur while he was on release under an earlier indictment against him for international transportation of currency and (2) the district court should have made specific findings of fact to support its determination that Jacobs willfully obstructed justice in a related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">Although the events underlying the instant offense of money laundering are the same as those that supported the earlier indictment, the instant indictment also charges Jacobs with conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The conspiracy may have begun before his release under the earlier indictment, but the stipulated facts accompanying the plea agreement demonstrate that Jacobs\u2019s actions after his release inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>pendently satisfy the elements of conspiring to distribute marijuana. Defendant Jacobs thus \u201ccommitted [a crime] while on release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The defendant also has not demonstrated that the district court erred in increasing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 without making particularized findings of fact that he \u201cwillfully\u201d obstructed justice in \u201ca closely related offense.\u201d \u201c[Particularized findings are unnecessary where the sentencing court speaks generally to the pertinent considerations and the specific facts are apparent from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Manas, </em>272 F.3d 159, 167 (2d Cir.2001). However, \u201c[w]hen the sentencing court resolves a <em>disputed </em>issue of fact, it is required to state its findings with sufficient clarity to permit appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>49 F.3d 895, 900-901 (2d Cir.1995) (emphasis added). At sentencing, Jacobs did not dispute the district court\u2019s general findings of willful obstruction of justice in a closely related offense, and the record adequately supports the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court was therefore not required to make particularized findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
