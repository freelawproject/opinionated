After receiving notice that her claim had been denied, plaintiff requested a hearing, and appeared with counsel before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The ALJ denied her claim, finding that she was not disabled because she retained the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of activities within the sedentary work category. He reached this conclusion after weighing the opinions of the many physicians who had treated her, and discounting her subjective complaints of constant pain. After the Appeals Council denied Taylor\u2019s request for review, she filed a petition for review in the district court, which held that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">On appeal from the district court\u2019s review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, \u201c[w]e review the administrative record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether there is substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standard.\u201d Mac<em>hadio v. Apfel, </em>276 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir.2002). Taylor first argues that the ALJ improperly discounted the findings of her treating physician, Dr. Desai, who opined that Taylor was unable to bend, lift, or sit for long periods, and that she was therefore \u201ctemporarily totally disabled.\u201d Although Dr. Desai found plaintiff unable to perform the full range of tasks necessary for sedentary work, other physicians treating her found to the contrary. For example, Dr. Storrs reported after a 1995 examination that \u201cno objective findings whatsoever\u201d supported Taylor\u2019s allegations of pain. Similarly, in 1996, the same year as Dr. Desai\u2019s determination to the contrary, Dr. Deluca reported Taylor\u2019s \u201cdisability to be partial, temporary, and moderate,\u201d and opined that home physical therapy was the only necessary treatment. Although the ALJ is normally obligated to give the treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight, where that opinion is contradicted by other substantial evidence in the record, the ALJ is entitled to use discretion in weighing the medical evidence as a whole. <em>See Veino v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 578, 587-88 (2d Cir.2002). Moreover, Dr. Desai\u2019s opinion that Taylor was \u201ctemporarily totally disabled\u201d is not entitled to any weight, since the ultimate issue of disability is reserved for the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1); <em>Snell v. Apfel, </em>177 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir. 1999). Accordingly, we find no error in the ALJ\u2019s decision not to accord controlling weight to Dr. Desai\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Taylor next argues that, taking the medical record as a whole, there is no substantial medical evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that she is able to perform a full range of sedentary work. We disagree. \u201cSedentary work is defined as involving only occasional standing and walking, the lifting of no more than ten pounds at a time, and the occasional lifting and carrying of light objects.\u201d <em>Schaal v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 501 n. 6 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a). Although plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians generally opined that the impairment limited her functional capabilities somewhat, the record is replete with medical findings by Taylor\u2019s own doctors that demonstrate her ability to function within the full range. Drs. Powell, Storrs, and Desai cautioned her only against heavy or repetitive lifting, rather than all lifting, and Drs. Powell and Deluca indicated that she was able to sit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>stand, and walk comfortably. We find that the totality of the evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Taylor could perform sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Plaintiff also argues that the ALJ improperly discounted her allegations of constant and severe pain. Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and that upon making his decision, he failed to articulate a legally sufficient basis for discrediting her allegations. We find these arguments without merit. Plaintiff must demonstrate by medical signs or findings that she has a condition that could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(a)-(b). While \u201csubjective pain may serve as the basis for establishing disability, even if such pain is unaccompanied by positive clinical findings,\u201d the ALJ is nonetheless empowered to exercise discretion to \u201carrive at an independent judgment, in light of medical findings and other evidence, regarding the true extent of the pain alleged by the claimant.\u201d <em>Marcus v. Califano, </em>615 F.2d 23, 27 (2d Cir.1979) (emphasis omitted). When the claimant alleges pain that exceeds the objectively verifiable evidence, the ALJ must consider several evaluative factors, including daily activities, medication, and causes of the pain, in order to determine the extent to which the pain affects the claimant\u2019s functional capabilities. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i)-(iv). Here, the ALJ first found, in accordance with the bulk of the medical evidence, that Taylor\u2019s complaints of pain exceeded her objectively verifiable condition, and then considered Taylor\u2019s allegations of pain in light of her actual capabilities. He determined that Taylor is able to cook, clean, do laundry, attend class, drive, shop, and swim, and that her pain is often mitigated with only non-prescription medication. Thus, the ALJ properly considered the evaluative factors set forth in the regulations, and his determination that plaintiffs subjective complaints of pain should be discounted is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Aponte v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>728 F.2d 588, 591 (2d Cir.1984). The ALJ also adequately set forth the basis for his findings in his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Finally, Taylor contends that the ALJ improperly relied solely on the medical vocational guidelines (the \u201cgrids\u201d), without a vocational expert\u2019s testimony, in determining that she could perform work which exists in significant numbers in the national economy. Although the grids are \u201cgenerally dispositive,\u201d when they do not fully account for the claimant\u2019s limitations, the Commissioner must utilize other evidence, such as the testimony of a vocational expert, to demonstrate that the claimant is capable of performing some type of work. <em>See Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir.1999). Taylor argues that her pain creates a nonexertional impairment unrelated to her ability to meet the strength requirements of employment, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1569a(c), and therefore the ALJ should have sought the testimony of a vocational expert. A vocational expert is only necessary, however, where there is evidence that the claimant\u2019s nonexertional limitations \u201cso narrow[ ] [her] possible range of work as to deprive [her] of a meaningful employment opportunity.\u201d <em>Bapp v. Bowen, </em>802 F.2d 601, 605-06 (2d Cir.1986). As discussed above, the ALJ properly found that Taylor\u2019s pain is not disabling, and he was therefore entitled to rely on the grids. Finally, Taylor\u2019s argument that a vocational expert was necessary because her exertional capabilities fell short of that required for sedentary work is foreclosed by the ALJ\u2019s well-supported finding that the medical evidence indicated that Taylor was physically capable of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>forming sedentary work. We therefore find that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the grids was appropriate, and agree with his conclusion that plaintiff retains the residual functional capacity necessary for sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
