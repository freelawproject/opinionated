This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Nicholson sued the Commissioner of Social Security regarding the suspension of her supplemental security income benefits prior to a final decision by the Commissioner. Upon <em>de novo </em>review of two magistrate judge\u2019s reports, the district court denied Nicholson a temporary restraining order and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction as the Commissioner had not issued a final decision regarding Nicholson\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In her timely appeal, Nicholson argues that the Commissioner\u2019s suspension violates her due process rights and that the administrative process is misleading. She has moved for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. See Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 866 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the denial of social security benefits is provided for under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). <em>See Willis v. Sullivan, </em>931 F.2d 390, 396 (6th Cir.1991). In order to obtain judicial review, an initial determination must be made by the Commissioner. Following the initial determination, a dissatisfied claimant may seek reconsideration. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.909, 404.920. After reconsideration, a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) may be requested. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.933, 404.936, 404.955. After the ALJ has issued a decision, further review may be sought before the Appeals Council. Only after the Appeals Council has issued a decision is there a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Commissioner within the meaning of \u00a7 405(g). Once a final decision is made, the claimant may then file an action for review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision before the appropriate federal district court. <em>See Willis, </em>931 F.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">The record before the court indicates that Nicholson is awaiting an administrative hearing before an ALJ. As an ALJ has yet to issue a decision and as further review has yet to be sought before the Appeals Council, Nicholson\u2019s complaint is premature. Therefore, the district court did not err in dismissing Nicholson\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">Nicholson contends that the Commissioner\u2019s suspension of her benefits prior to a hearing violates the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). In <em>Goldberg, </em>the Supreme Court held that welfare benefits may not be terminated without first affording the claimant a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 266-71, 90 S.Ct. 1011. However, in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), the Supreme Court declined to extend <em>Goldberg </em>to claimants of social security disability benefits. The Court distinguished <em>Goldberg </em>as having been based on a welfare recipient\u2019s extreme financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>need and held that since eligibility for disability benefits is not based on need and since the beneficiaries might have other means of subsistence, the claimants are not entitled to a pre-determination hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 340-41, 96 S.Ct. 893; <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175,178 (11th Cir.1994). Therefore, contrary to Nicholson\u2019s arguments, her due process rights were not violated as the Commissioner may suspend her supplemental security income benefits prior to her hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Accordingly, we deny the request for counsel and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
