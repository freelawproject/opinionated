Villegas also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of class certification, and dismissal of claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. We review de novo. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000) (Section 1915A dismissals); <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (summary judgment). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-23\">The district court properly denied class certification because Villegas, a non-attorney representing himself, cannot represent others. <em>See Cato v. United States, </em>70 F.3d 1103,1105 n. 1 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-24\">Dismissal of Villegas\u2019 claim against High Desert State Prison was proper because Villegas failed to exhaust his administra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>five remedies. <em>See McKinney v. Carey, </em>311 F.3d 1198, 1199-1200 (9th Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Dismissal of Villegas\u2019 deliberate indifference to medical needs, due process, and retaliation claims was proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A because Villegas failed to state a claim as to these causes of action. <em>See Shapley v. Nevada Bd. of State Prison Comm\u2019rs, </em>766 F.2d 404, 407 (9th Cir.1985) (medical deliberate indifference); <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556-57, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (due process); <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d at 815-16 (retaliation).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Summary judgment on Villegas\u2019 deliberate indifference claim naming prison officials of Salinas Valley State Prison was proper because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether these defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his safety. <em>See Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir.2001) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b958-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
