We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-21\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1110 (9th Cir.2003). Summary judgment on Nuffer\u2019s First Amendment claim was appropriate because she failed to prove that the District\u2019s decision to terminate her was substantially motivated by her speech regarding charter school status and funding issues at Molalla Alternative Options School. <em>See Pool v. Van-Rheen, </em>297 F.3d 899, 906 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-22\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Nuffer\u2019s claim for retaliation under the Rehabilitation Act. Because Nuffer failed to establish any causal connection between her advocacy for disabled students and her subsequent termination for neglect of duty, summary judgment on her Rehabilitation Act claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-23\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of Nuffer\u2019s state law whistleblower claim de novo. <em>See Dorr v. County of Butte, </em>795 F.2d 875, 876-77 (9th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). Nuffer\u2019s claim fails because she did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the District discharged her in response to her complaints about possible funding or charter school status violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1006-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
