The motion is denied. Young has appealed the dismissal of his <em>in forma pauperis </em>(IFP) civil rights complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) (2) (B) (ii). The district court held that Young\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted because his claims are barred by the doctrine of by <em>Heck v. Humphrey.</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Young has failed to show that the district court erred in determining that a judgment in Young\u2019s favor would necessarily implicate the validity of his conviction and sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-22\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and this court\u2019s affirmance of the dismissal count as one strike against Young for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Young is warned that, should he accumulate three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
