R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b234-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">Richard Cacayurin Gonzales appeals his sentence after pleading guilty to importation of methamphetamine hydrochloride in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">We review a district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>323 F.3d 1161, 1164 (9th Cir.2003). \u201cThe issue of whether a defendant is a minor or minimal participant in a criminal offense under the particular facts of the offense is reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Zweber, </em>913 F.2d 705, 708 (9th Cir.1990) (citing <em>United States v. Gillock, </em>886 F.2d 220, 222 (9th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">Gonzales argues that the district court erred in limiting his eligibility for a minor participant downward adjustment under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.2 to his role in the offense to which he pleaded guilty. Because the district court acknowledged conduct of other participants in the criminal scheme beyond the conduct for which Gonzales was charged, it did not clearly err in finding Gonzales\u2019s participation to have been more than that of a \u201cmere courier.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 472 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">Gonzales also argues that the district court erred because it failed to compare his conduct to that of \u201cactual co-participants\u201d as opposed to \u201chypothetical average\u201d participants. <em>See United States v. Petti </em>973 F.2d 1441, 1447 (9th Cir.1992). By acknowledging the larger context of the criminal scheme, the district court \u201cconsidered [Gonzales\u2019s] culpability relative to the involvement of other likely actors\u201d in the criminal scheme. <em>Rojas-Milan, </em>234 F.3d at 473-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-21\">Because Gonzales has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in determining that he was not a minor participant in the offense, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentencing on the role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Ap47\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
