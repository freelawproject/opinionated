He argues that the district court should have enjoined a pending state criminal prosecution of assault against him because the assault charge was brought in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-20\">A federal court may not interfere with a pending state criminal proceeding absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 43, 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Cabello has not shown such circumstances. <em>See id.; Perez v. Ledesma, </em>401 U.S. 82, 85, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971); <em>Ballard v. Wilson, </em>856 F.2d 1568, 1570-71 (5th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-21\">Cabello\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of his district court complaint and of this appeal as frivolous each count as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of the three-strikes bar under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Cabello is warned that, should he accumulate three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
