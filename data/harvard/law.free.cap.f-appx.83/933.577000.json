We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">Ward contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) required the district court to adjust his sentence for time previously served on his undischarged period of state incarceration. However, because Ward\u2019s current state convictions were not taken into account in the calculation of the offense level for the instant offense, the district court was not obligated to adjust his federal sentence for time previously served on the state convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-22\">We reject Ward\u2019s contention that he is entitled, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to a sentence adjustment for time served on the three predicate convictions used to establish his armed career criminal status. <em>See id. </em>at 490 (holding that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b963-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
