After careful review of the record and submissions, we conclude Snyder\u2019s arguments are clearly meritless and do not require extended discussion. Specifically, we find that this appeal is not timely as to any of the orders filed before May 31, 2002; we reject Snyder\u2019s finality challenges to the bankruptcy court and BAP orders, as well as to the BAP\u2019s and this count's jurisdiction; we find no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on his motions to extend the time to appeal; we conclude his challenge to the 180-day bar from filing a new bankruptcy petition is now moot, because the prohibition period has long since passed; and we reject his wholly conclusory bias claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-23\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-20\">. The Honorable David P.
