Villella requested damages, a declaration that defendants infringed his \u201cland patent,\u201d and sought to enjoin the pending state criminal cases. The district court sua sponte dismissed Villella\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the case neither involved diversity of citizenship, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, nor raised a federal question, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The court found Villella\u2019s assertion of an infringed \u201cland patent\u201d to be \u201cso insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of [the United States Supreme Court], or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.\u201d District Court\u2019s Order of Feb. 7, 2003 (quoting <em>Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. Oneida County, </em>414 U.S. 661, 666-67, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">On appeal Villella renews his argument that federal patent law provides jurisdiction for his claims. He cites <em>State of Wisconsin v. Baker, </em>698 F.2d 1323, 1327 (7th Cir.1983), for the proposition that both a patent for an invention and a land patent confer property rights. That prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>osition may be true, but it is irrelevant here. Villella has not alleged that a patented invention has been infringed, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1838; 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 100(a), 271, and his assertion of a \u201cland patent\u201d being infringed is plainly insubstantial. <em>Cf. Baker, </em>698 F.2d at 1327 (holding that federal jurisdiction for property rights actions exists only when federal law continues to govern the rights, or if the suit is to decide whether the United States originally conveyed the land).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Villella also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint because he raised a constitutional claim-namely, one of trespass. This contention is frivolous. The possibility that the defendants committed trespass when they entered Villella\u2019s property does not allege a violation of the Constitution. <em>See Andree v. Ashland County, </em>818 F.2d 1306, 1314-15 (7th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">For the foregoing reasons the dismissal of Villella\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
