This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">In 1997, Szabo was charged with four counts of bank robbery in the Central District of Illinois, three counts of bank robbery in the Southern District of Illinois, and two counts of bank robbery in the Eastern District of Missouri. Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 20, the latter two cases were transferred to the Central District. After Szabo pleaded guilty to the Central District charges pursuant to a written plea agreement and entered a blind guilty plea as to the other charges, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 97 months in prison. The Seventh Circuit dismissed Sza-bo\u2019s appeal as to the Central District charges because he had waived his right to appeal in the plea agreement, but remanded the action for re-sentencing on the charges from the other districts because the Central District had misinterpreted USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. <em>United States v. Szabo, </em>147 F.3d 559 (7th Cir.1998). On remand, Szabo was re-sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 87 months on the charges from the other districts. His sentences were then affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Szabo, </em>176 F.3d 930 (7th Cir.1999). Prior to his instant \u00a7 2241 petition, Szabo unsuccessfully pursued post-conviction relief by filing a motion to vacate in 1999, a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in 2000, and a motion for an order authorizing a second or successive motion to vacate in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Szabo asserted that the district court erred by departing upward four offense levels on the basis that only five of his bank robbery convictions were taken into account in calculating his offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3D1.4. Upon a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and over Szabo\u2019s objections, the district court dismissed Szabo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">On appeal, Szabo argues that the district court erred by dismissing his petition. He moves for pauper status and for miscellaneous relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">Upon de novo review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Sza-bo\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-19\">If a petitioner seeks to challenge the execution of his sentence, he may file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>jurisdiction over his custodian. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1008, 122 S.Ct. 493,151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001). But a federal prisoner may not challenge his conviction and sentence under \u00a7 2241, \u201cif it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by [\u00a7 2255] motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (last clause in fifth paragraph, the \u201csavings clause\u201d); <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56; <em>Capaldi v. Pontesso, </em>135 F.3d 1122, 1123 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Szabo has failed to show that his \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. A prisoner\u2019s remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the prisoner is time-barred or otherwise procedurally barred from seeking relief under \u00a7 2255, because the prisoner has already filed one motion to vacate, or because the prisoner has been denied permission to file a second or successive motion to vacate. <em>Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461. Although this court has not determined the exact scope of the savings clause, it appears that a prisoner must show an intervening change in the law that establishes his actual innocence. <em>See id.; Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The savings clause does not apply to the instant case. Szabo cannot show an applicable intervening change in the law or any extraordinary circumstances which reflect that he may be actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed, the motion for pauper status is granted, and all other pending motions are denied.
