We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over Salman\u2019s contention that he is a national of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Salman\u2019s contention that he cannot be removed because he is a national of the United States is foreclosed by <em>Perdomo-Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 964, 965 (9th Cir.2003) (holding a person may become a \u201cnational of the United States\u201d only through birth or naturalization).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">To the extent Salman contends his order of removal violates due process, we dismiss the petition for review because we lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">We deny Salman\u2019s motion for bond and motion for reconsideration of stay pending review, filed November 10, 2003, as moot. We deny Salman\u2019s motion for the status of a prior motion, filed November 17, 2003, as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED, in part, and DISMISSED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1000-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
