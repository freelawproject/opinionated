Shotsberger argues that a court may not infer evasion and apply the enhancement based merely on the commission of fraud offenses in multiple jurisdictions. The Government, conversely, contends that the District Court\u2019s decision was based on a factual finding supported by the record. Because we find that the District Court\u2019s characterization of its reasoning was at worst harmless error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">From November 7, 2001 to March 9, 2002, Shotsberger, his co-defendant Dennis Stokes, and an umndicted co-conspirator orchestrated a bank fraud scheme in Florida, Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The conspirators produced counterfeit payroll checks and deposited them in savings and checking accounts at various banks in these states. They then wrote checks to fictitious individuals, for whom they had false identification cards, and cashed the checks at branch offices of the banks on which they were drawn. Over the course of the scheme, the conspirators cashed or attempted to cash 107 checks at nine victim banks, amounting to a total loss of approximately $95,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">In March 2002, Shotsberger, Stokes, and Shotsberger\u2019s son, Nathaniel, were arrested in Camden, New Jersey. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents interviewed all three on March 11, 2002. Nathaniel informed the agents that his father and Stokes had been involved in counterfeit check schemes since 1993. He also stated that Shotsberger and Stokes would conduct the bank fraud in a particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>lar area until \u201cproblems\u201d developed, and then would move on to another area.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Shotsberger pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Prior to sentencing, Shotsber-ger\u2019s probation officer recommended a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(A), which applies to defendants who \u201crelocated, or participated in relocating, a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials.\u201d The recommendation was based on \u201cdefendant\u2019s <em>apparent </em>relocation of a fraudulent scheme to various jurisdictions to evade law enforcement\u201d (emphasis added). Shotsberger objected to the enhancement, citing the lack of evidence indicating that the defendants moved between states for the <em>purpose </em>of evading law enforcement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor responded to Shotsberger\u2019s objection, by arguing that one could make a \u201creasonable inference\u201d that the defendants had moved among states in order \u201cto commit crimes and to avoid law enforcement.\u201d The District Court (per Judge Rambo) granted the enhancement. In so doing, it both purported to make a factual finding and attributed significance to the Second Circuit\u2019s unpublished opinion in <em>Warner v. United States, </em>21 Fed.Appx. 43, 2001 WL 1203066 (2nd Cir.2001). Judge Rambo explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">I am going to follow the <em>Warner </em>case, plus the facts of this case clearly show there is an intent to avoid law enforcement. Officials-I don\u2019t know what-I guess it was Mr. Shotsberger who said that problems developed before moving on. Whether these problems were that the banks caught on to them and closed the accounts, or by inference that they were there long enough that they had to move to avoid apprehension, I am going to affirm the presentence report in that enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Shotsberger\u2019s counsel noted that Nathaniel Shotsberger was not before the Court and was thus unable \u201cto testify as to what he meant by problems.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt is our position that the reason [the defendants] moved on is because the banks would close their accounts and not because there was any evidence that they were running from the Police or thought the Police were on to them.\u201d Additionally, Shotsberger\u2019s counsel clarified that it was Nathaniel Shotsberger, rather than defendant Kerry Shotsberger, who had made the statement regarding \u201cproblems.\u201d The District Court acknowledged its error but did not reconsider its decision. Shotsber-ger was sentenced to 41 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release, $45,046.71 in restitution, and a $100 special assessment. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">The United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania had jurisdiction over the federal criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We recently decided the issue raised in this appeal in our not-precedential opinion in <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>75 Fed.Appx. 888, 2003 WL 22214164 (3d Cir.2003). In <em>Stokes, </em>the panel affirmed the sentence imposed by the District Court on Dennis Stokes, Shotsberger\u2019s co-defendant. The central issue on appeal in that case was whether the defendants\u2019 travel <em>among </em>states (in other words, the fact that they \u201cbounced back and forth\u201d) foreclosed a finding that they had left each state to avoid law enforcement. We held that a finding of evasion was permissible despite the defendants\u2019 unconventional travel patterns. In addition, we concluded that \u201cthe District Court\u2019s finding that the co-conspirators moved to evade law enforcement was supported by Nathaniel Shotsberger\u2019s statement as reported in the Pre-Sentence Report and was not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892. This latter question-whether the District Court\u2019s application of the sentence enhancement was supported by the record-is the principal issue raised by Shotsberger on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">He asserts that the District Court\u2019s application of the enhancement was based on an impermissible inference, citing the Court\u2019s intention to rely on <em>Warner. </em>According to Shotsberger, we should uphold the District Court\u2019s decision only if it meets the standard set out in <em>Edward J. Sweeney &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Texaco, </em>637 F.2d 105, 116 (3d Cir.1980). <em>Sweeney </em>provides, \u201cInferred factual conclusions based on circumstantial evidence are permitted only when, and to the extent that, human experience indicates a probability that certain consequences can and do follow from the basic circumstantial facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Because we find that Nathaniel Shots-berger\u2019s statement was an alternative, reasonable basis for the District Court\u2019s decision, we need not decide here whether <em>Sweeney </em>would otherwise operate to prohibit an inference on these facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The most appellant-friendly reading of the District Court\u2019s statement is that it identified two bases for applying the sentence enhancement: first, Nathaniel Shotsberger\u2019s statement, and secondly, an inference based on the interstate nature of the defendants\u2019 crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Insofar as the former, factual finding was a sufficient independent ground of decision, we need not engage in discussion of the <em>Sweeney </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Shotsberger\u2019s counsel argued at the sentencing proceeding that the word \u201cproblems\u201d in Nathaniel Shotsberger\u2019s statement was insufficiently defined to permit a factual finding of evasion. She suggested, as already noted, that the defendants had instead \u201cmoved on ... because the banks would close their accounts.\u201d The District Court did not clearly err in rejecting this position. As the Government noted in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Brief, \u201c[S]omeone with defendant\u2019s extensive experience in the fraudulent uttering of checks well knows ... a bank\u2019s closing of an account involved in fraudulent activity ordinarily leads immediately to referral of the matter to law enforcement authorities for investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The fact that the Court may have been mistaken as to the issuer of Nathaniel Shotsberger\u2019s statement at the time of ruling on the objection does not alter our conclusion. The Court abided by its ruling despite being made aware of its factual error immediately thereafter. Given that the Court reached an identical decision with respect to defendant Stokes in the <em>same proceeding </em>-despite unequivocal knowledge that Stokes did <em>not </em>make the statement-it seems clear that the identity, or lack thereof, of the speaker and defendant was immaterial to the Court\u2019s factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">To the extent that the District Court erred in its identification of the speaker as Nathaniel rather than Kerry Dean Shots-berger, that error was harmless. Because the Court did not clearly err in finding that Nathaniel Shotsberger\u2019s statement furnished evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to evade law enforcement, we affirm Kerry Dean Shotsberger\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-7\">. In an addendum to the presentence report, the probation officer noted Stokes\u2019s and Shotsberger\u2019s \"extensive criminal histories in Florida for similar misconduct, and a history of supporting themselves with bad or counterfeit checks,\" and reasoned that the defendants <em>\"appear </em>to have left Florida for places where they were unknown\u201d (emphasis added). The report also relied on Nathaniel Shotsberger's indication, referred to above in part, that \"his father and Dennis Stokes had participated in counterfeit check schemes for years, and would commit frauds in a particular area until \u2018problems' developed before moving on.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-13\">. The appropriate standard of review is subject to dispute in this case. As noted below, Shotsberger argues that the District Court applied the sentence enhancement based on an inference. He suggests that we should therefore review the District Court\u2019s ruling <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>novo, </em>citing <em>Herskowitz v. Nutri/System, Inc., </em>857 F.2d 179, 183-84 (3rd Cir.1988). Because we conclude that the District Court applied the enhancement based at least in part on its factual findings, the relevant standard of review is clear error. See <em>United States v. Cianscewski, </em>894 F.2d 74, 82 (3d Cir. 1990) (\"[D]etermin[ing] whether the commission of some particular offense involved more than minimal planning is essentially factual, and therefore subject only to clearly erroneous review.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-11\">. Similarly, we need not decide the appropriate standard of review for evaluating allegedly inappropriate inferences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-12\">. The Government suggests that the District Court may not have intended to rely on <em>Warner </em>at all with respect to its inference holding. Instead, it might have cited <em>Warner, </em>a case which is remarkably on point, for its holdings that the enhancement applies to relocation across state borders and in bank fraud cases-issues that Shotsberger raised in the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">. Additional evidence supported the District Court's finding of intent to evade. For example, the defendants staging area was located at a Sheraton Hotel in Wilmington, Delaware-a state in which none of their crimes was committed-though a hotel in Cherry Hill or Philadelphia would have been more convenient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
