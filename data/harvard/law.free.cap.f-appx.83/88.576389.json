This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">On February 9, 1998, Shepherd stole $22,189.00 from a bank. A grand jury indicted him on one count of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) and one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to the robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Shepherd pleaded guilty to both counts and was then sentenced on November 13, 2000, pursuant to the 1998 edition of the Guidelines Manual, to consecutive prison terms of 68 months and 60 months. This court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in <em>United States v. Shepard </em>[sic], No. 00-6612, 2002 WL 1461752 (6th Cir. July 3, 2002) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">In his motion to modify, Shepherd asserted that he was entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendments 591 and 599 to the sentencing guidelines. Shepherd argued that the district court had erred in imposing consecutive sentences because both offenses arose from the same transaction. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>denied the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Shepherd\u2019s motion to modify. <em>See United States v. Ursery, </em>109 F.3d 1129, 1137 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">A court may reduce a term of imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and if a reduction would be consistent with the applicable policy statements in the guidelines. <em>See 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Dullen, </em>15 F.3d 68, 69-70 (6th Cir.1994). Amendments to the guidelines which retroactively lower sentencing ranges and which thus permit a defendant to seek relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) are listed at USSG \u00a7 1131.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Both Amendment 591 and 599 are given retroactive effect under \u00a7 1B1.10 and became effective on November 1, 2001, after Shepherd was sentenced. However, nothing in either amendment suggests that Shepherd should not have received consecutive sentences or that he was otherwise improperly sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Amendment 591 modified USSG \u00a7\u00a7 lBl.l(a), lB1.2(a), 2D1.2, and the Statutory Index\u2019s introductory commentary. The amendment resolved a circuit conflict concerning \u00a7 2D1.2 and also clarified that \u201cthe sentencing court must apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction unless the case falls within the limited \u2018stipulation\u2019 exception set forth in \u00a7 lB1.2(a).\u201d USSG App. C, p. 32 (Supp.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">This amendment does not affect Shepherd\u2019s sentence. First, Shepherd\u2019s offense level was not enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.2. Second, review of the Presen-tence Investigation Report indicates that Shepherd was sentenced in accordance with the appropriate offense guidelines. His base offense level for the bank robbery conviction was determined pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B3.1, as listed in the Statutory Index, and there was no base offense level for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction because \u00a7 924(c) carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years consecutive to the punishment for a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Amendment 599 provides for certain changes to the commentary to USSG \u00a7 2K2.4, which impacts the sentence of a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h), 924(c), or 929(a). In particular, the amendment clarifies \u201cunder what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses. The amendment directs that no guideline weapon enhancement should be applied____\u201d USSG App. C, p. 71 (Supp. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">This amendment does not affect Shepherd\u2019s sentence because \u00a7 2K2.4 was not used to enhance Shepherd\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
