Rollins appeals the district court\u2019s judgment revoking her supervised release and sentencing her to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rollins argues that the district court erred by not inquiring on the record whether she was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pleading true to the alleged supervised release violations. She contends that the protections afforded to criminal defendants by Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 and <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), should extend to supervised release revocation proceedings. Rollins concedes that this issue is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Johns, </em>625 F.2d 1175, 1176 (5th Cir.1980), and she states that she is raising the issue solely to preserve it for possible future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">Rollins did not object to the district court\u2019s noncompliance with the procedures in Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 and <em>Boykin. </em>Accordingly, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160,162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-17\">In <em>Johns, </em>this court held that Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 is inapplicable to probation revocation hearings. <em>See Johns, </em>625 F.2d at 1176. The issue whether the district court should have complied with Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 at Rollins\u2019 revocation hearing is foreclosed by <em>Johns. </em>Thus, Rollins fails to demonstrate that the district court erred by not complying with Fed. R.Crim. P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-18\">This court has not yet addressed the issue whether <em>Boykin </em>is applicable to probation revocation hearings. <em>See id. </em>Given the lack of controlling authority in this circuit on this issue, any error by the district court with regard to <em>Boykin </em>was not clear or obvious and, therefore, does not meet the plain-error standard. <em>See Calverley, </em>37 F.3d at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-19\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal or to summarily affirm the judgment without further briefing. In the alternative, the Government moves for an extension of time. The motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED. The motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
