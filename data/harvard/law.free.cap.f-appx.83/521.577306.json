(\u201cSears\u201d), and denying Lease\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-25\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the record and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders denying Lease\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, granting Sears\u2019 summary judgment motion, and denying Lease\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-26\"> Sears asserts that neither the denial of the motion to amend nor the district court's grant of summary judgment against Lease\u2019s claims are properly before this court for review. Because Lease filed his motion to alter or amend within ten days of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Sears, the motion tolls the running of the appeal period on the district court's underlying orders, and Lease's timely appeal of the order denying the motion for reconsideration automatically brings both that order and underlying order before this court.
