Hemp-stead\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the District Court should not have classified Hempstead as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because the relevant two prior felony convictions were for related drug offenses. We conclude that the District Court properly applied career-offender status to Hempstead because it is undisputed that the prior drug offenses were separated by an intervening arrest. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(c)(2) (\u201ctwo prior felony convictions\u201d means, in part, sentences for at least two qualifying convictions are counted separately in computing criminal history), \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) (prior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are counted separately) &amp; cmt. (n.3) (\u201cPrior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-24\">Upon our independent review under <em>Penson v.
