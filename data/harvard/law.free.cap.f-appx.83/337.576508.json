Paulino is correct. In <em>United States v. Melendez-Santana, </em>No. 01-2386 &amp; No. 01-2397, we recently vacated a nearly identical condition on delegation grounds, while noting that it would be permissible for the court to establish the range of drug tests to be performed, with probation officers exercising discretion on the exact number of drug tests to be performed within that range. We must VACATE the drug testing condition in the written sentencing order and REMAND to the district court for reconsideration of the drug testing requirement. That reconsideration must be done in a manner consistent with the Defendant\u2019s right to be present at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-26\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
