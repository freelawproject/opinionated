This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">Seeking injunctive relief, Strong, an African American, sued the Orkand Corporation (\u201cOrkand\u201d) alleging that Orkand terminated his employment based upon his race. The district court eventually granted summary judgment for Orkand, and this appeal followed. The parties have briefed the issues. Strong is proceeding without benefit of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>We review an order granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Smith v. Ameritech, </em>129 F.3d 857, 863 (6th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids discrimination because of an individual\u2019s race. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). A claimant may prove a prima facie case of racial discrimination by showing that: \u201c(1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the job; (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and (4) he was treated differently than similarly situated whites.\u201d <em>Thurman v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1160, 1166 (6th Cir.1996) (citations omitted), <em>amended on denial of reh\u2019g by </em>97 F.3d 833 (6th Cir.1996). \u201c[T]he plaintiff must prove that all of the relevant aspects of his employment situation are \u2018nearly identical\u2019 to those of the [white] employees who he alleges were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp., </em>964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir.1992). If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision. If the employer does so, the plaintiff must then show that the articulated reason is a mere pretext for discrimination. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Monette v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., </em>90 F.3d 1173, 1185 (6th Cir.1996). The burden of persuasion in discrimination cases remains at all times with the plaintiff. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. 1089; <em>Monette, </em>90 F.3d at 1186-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Orkand. Strong did not present a prima facie case of race discrimination within the meaning of Title VII. Orkand\u2019s affidavits and exhibits establish that Strong was not qualified for the position from which he was terminated. Strong was hired contingent upon his ability to obtain a background security clearance from the Postal Inspection Service and was specifically advised that without a favorable background check this offer of employment would be withdrawn. The condition of a favorable security clearance is a requirement of the United States Postal Service. The denial of Strong\u2019s security clearance rendered him unqualified for the job. Although Strong was advised that he would be eligible for rehire if he reversed the clearance denial, his appeal to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Strong also failed to establish that the individual he named as comparable was, in fact, treated differently in the manner of discipline issued or action taken. Although the identified comparable, Franklin Morris, received an interim security clearance in August, 1998, pending completion of the security clearance process, the security clearance was subsequently rescinded because of pending felony charges of aggravated rape and kidnapping. Orkand terminated Morris\u2019s employment the day after his security clearance was rescinded. Thus, upon the rescission of Morris\u2019s security clearance, Orkand responded with termination, the identical action taken against Strong for his inability to obtain security clearance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Accordingly, Strong has also failed to establish by affidavits or evidence of any kind that \u201cfor the same or similar conduct, he was treated differently than similarly-situated non-minority employees.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d at 582-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Strong also failed to demonstrate that Orkand made any materially adverse employment decision based upon his race. <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Mgmt., Inc., </em>97 F.3d 876, 883 (6th Cir.1996) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817). The failure to offer permanent employment constitutes only neutral action on the part of the defendant. <em>Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </em>85 F.3d 270, 273-74 (7th Cir.1996). Strong was required to obtain a favorable security clearance as a condition of employment. He was denied the security clearance and was unsuccessful in appealing that denial. Strong was terminated for his failure to meet a required condition for employment as a Technical Information Specialist. Orkand has articulated a legitimate, nondis criminatory reason for its decision to terminate Strong\u2019s employment, and Strong has completely failed to present any evidence discrediting that explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
