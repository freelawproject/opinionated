The sole issue he presents is whether the laws repealing INA \u00a7 212(c), AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) and IIRIRA \u00a7 304(b), imposed impermissible retroactive effects upon him. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 1331. This court has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">In <em>Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, </em>291 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2247, 156 L.Ed.2d 110 (2003), we held that application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) did not result in a retroactive effect to \u201cthose aliens who pleaded not guilty and elected a jury trial\u201d prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. </em>at 1121-22. Undertaking the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994), retroactivity analysis, we concluded that</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">Unlike aliens who pleaded guilty, aliens who elected a jury trial cannot plausibly claim that they would have acted any differently if they had known about \u00a7 440(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>Armendariz-Montoya, </em>291 F.3d at 1121. As the not guilty plea and decision to go to trial eliminated any reliance argument, we joined with other circuits in distinguishing the holding <em>o\u00ed INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 321-22, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\"><em>Armendariz-Montoya </em>directly control this appeal. Accordingly, the decision of the district court denying habeas relief and holding that Quinones did not qualify for \u00a7 212(c) relief because he pleaded not guilty and was convicted at a jury trial is</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b896-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-20\">. Quinones argues that <em>Armendariz-Montoya </em>should be overturned, and the similar decisions from other circuits should be ignored. A three-judge panel cannot reconsider or overrule the decision of a prior panel unless \u201can intervening Supreme Court decision undermines an existing precedent of the Ninth Circuit, and both cases are closely on point.\" <em>United States v. Gay, </em>967 F.2d 322, 327 (9th Cir. 1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 929, 113 S.Ct. 359, 121 L.Ed.2d 272 (1992). Quinones sites to no intervening Supreme Court decision allows us to reconsider <em>Armendariz-Montoya.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. In <em>St. Cyr, </em>the Supreme Court held that the application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) to those aliens who pleaded guilty prior to AEDPA's enactment resulted in a retroactive effect because, at the time of their pleas, those aliens had the possibility of obtaining a \u00a7 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility upon which they could justifiably rely. Cases following <em>St. Cyr </em>have carved out major exceptions to its reach. <em>See, e.g., Dias v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 456, 458 (1st Cir. 2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2574, 156 L.Ed.2d 603 (2003) (applying <em>St. Cyr </em>and holding that alien criminal defendants' pre-AEDPA decisions to plead not guilty were not in reliance on the state of immigration law, thus they did not suffer retroactive effects); <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>313 F.3d 732, 739 (2d Cir.2002) (applying <em>St. Cyr </em>and finding that an alien \u201cconvicted after a trial rather than on a guilty plea\" does not experience a retroactive effect from AEDPA); <em>Chambers v. Reno, </em>307 F.3d 284, 288 (4th Cir.2002) (finding under <em>St.Cyr </em>that any \u201cargument that an immigrant may go to trial in reliance on the availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief is flawed\"); <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1273 (11th Cir.2002) (finding under <em>St. Cyr </em>that an alien's argument of reliance on \u00a7 212(c) relief, despite conviction by a jury after a not guilty plea, \"misses the mark.\"). Even prior to the <em>St. Cyr </em>decision, we had held that laws restricting \u00a7 212(c)'s application did not result in retroactive effects on \u201cthose aliens who were convicted in a juiy trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000). We explained that \u201c[ujnlike aliens who pleaded guilty, aliens who elected a jury trial cannot plausibly claim that they would have acted any differently if they had known\" that \u00a7 212(c) would be restricted or repealed. <em>Id. </em>Our decision in <em>Armendariz-Montoya </em>followed and cited the <em>Herrera-Bianco </em>decision. 291 F.3d at 1121.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
