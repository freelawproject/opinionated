He was sentenced to a 30-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">Esquivel contends that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward on grounds of cultural assimilation. The record reflects that the downward departure was denied because the district court believed it was unwarranted. We lack jurisdiction to review this ruling. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Montelongo, </em>263 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.2001). The appeal is dismissed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-23\">Esquivel\u2019s offense level was raised by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) because he was convicted for an aggravated felony prior to deportation. Esquivel contends that the prior conviction constituted an element of the offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) and should not be regarded as a mere sentencing factor. Because the fact of the prior conviction was not alleged in the indictment, he contends, his maximum sentence should have been no more than 24 months under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almen-darez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but asserts that <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>has been called into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-24\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
