We disagree. The evidence before the district court showed that Lavino purchased the annuity on its own\u2014 without input or direction from MRC \u2014 to provide guaranteed funds to cover the compensation it owed to Frank Guthrie. There was no indication that Lavino or Crawford &amp; Company acted as MRC\u2019s agents. <em>See Mottola v. R.L. Kautz &amp; Co., </em>199 Cal.App.3d 98, 108, 244 Cal.Rptr. 737 (1988) (being an agent for a specific purpose does not make one an agent for all purposes). Instead, MRC first obtained the annuity in satisfaction of Lavino\u2019s debts when it settled as a creditor during Lavino\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. The transfer of this asset does not alter SNCC\u2019s duty to reinsure those losses on the Guthrie claim that exceed its $750,000 attachment point. We affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment to MRC on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">SNCC also disputes its duty to reinsure the annual Department of Labor assessments MRC paid for many years pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(c)(2), because (1) the assessments are not the type of loss covered by SNCC\u2019s reinsurance certificates and (2) MRC improperly aggregated the assessments so they would fall within SNCC\u2019s level of indemnity. We hold that the assessments are covered by SNCC\u2019s reinsurance certificates, but that MRC\u2019s aggregation method is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">Contrary to SNCC\u2019s assertion, these assessments are not uninsurable \u201cknown losses\u201d under California law. <em>See Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>10 Cal.4th 645, 690, 42 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d 878 (1995) (holding that even expected or inevitable risks can still be \u201cunknown\u201d and thus insurable if the ultimate amount of the risk is uncertain). MRC did not know whether it would have to pay assessments in any given year, or in what amount, so these assessments were not uninsurable risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">SNCC\u2019s certificates FRC-126 and FRC-140 both purport to reinsure <em>all </em>of MRC\u2019s statutory liability to Lavino under the LHWCA. The certificates \u201cfollow the form\u201d of the underlying Lavino policy, which specifically obligated MRC to pay for assessments into any special funds required by the LHWCA. We agree with the district court that the coverage provisions and the insuring clauses in SNCC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>certificates pass this statutory liability on to SNCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">However, we do not agree MRC may aggregate these annual assessments into one \u201cclaim\u201d in order to receive reinsurance. In the cases cited by the district court, claims by multiple injured parties arising out of one common cause or incident were aggregated so that a single deductible would apply and more insurance could be recovered. <em>See, e.g., Int\u2019l Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Certain Underwriters &amp; Underwriting Syndicates at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>868 F.Supp. 917 (S.D.Ohio 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">This case is different, because the assessments \u2014 unlike injured worker claims \u2014 do not arise out of <em>one </em>single common cause. The duty to pay assessments is triggered each time by a <em>different </em>cause: the government\u2019s yearly calculation of the amount an insurer must pay. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(c). This calculation and the assessment fees that result are separate events that occur once per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In the face of a contract\u2019s silence on an issue like this, we may imply reasonable terms to give effect to the expectations of the parties at the time they entered the contract. <em>See Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>75 Cal.App.4th 832, 852, 89 Cal.Rptr.2d 540 (1999) (citing <em>Cotran v. Rollins Hudig Hall Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>17 Cal.4th 93, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 900, 948 P.2d 412 (1998)) (reasonable meaning supplied when there was no specific evidence of intended agreement to the contrary). But in this case, MRC\u2019s proposed aggregation method contradicts its own long-standing accounting practices and its expectations at the time it entered into this reinsurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">For a little over twenty years, MRC allocated the assessments to Lavino and other insureds\u2019 policies in an amount proportionate to the insurance it provided on those policies each year. MRC was then reimbursed in full for these assessments by its lower-level reinsurers and insureds like Lavino. This system worked without complaint by MRC, Lavino, the lower-level reinsurers, or SNCC from 1979 until Lavi-no\u2019s bankruptcy and Eastport\u2019s liquidation in the early 1990s. Given the lengthy course of dealing between MRC and SNCC, MRC cannot now aggregate twenty years\u2019 worth of past assessments into a single \u201cclaim\u201d to make the total amount exceed $750,000. Our decision to deny use of this aggregation method cannot be said to violate MRC\u2019s reasonable expectations as a contracting party when MRC itself only began aggregating the assessments in this manner during the course of litigation in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">We hold that SNCC\u2019s duty to reinsure is only triggered if a single year\u2019s worth of assessments paid by MRC exceeds $750,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting MRC\u2019s expert testimony about insurance industry contract drafting custom and practice. We have implicitly accepted a district court\u2019s admission of expert testimony on industry custom and usage regarding contract clauses in facultative reinsurance agreements. <em>See Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>93 F.3d 529, 537 (9th Cir.1996). In this case, MRC\u2019s expert was properly qualified through his past work experience, and he did not improperly testify about the legal interpretation of contract clauses. The district court did not abuse its discretion by crediting this expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">AFFIRMED in part.
