The immigration judge (IJ) denied Gwag\u2019s application for adjustment of status because he lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the application following the death of Gwag\u2019s brother, who had filed an 1-130 petition on Gwag\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Under applicable regulations, the death of Gwag\u2019s brother resulted in the automatic revocation of the previously-approved 1-130 petition absent a discretionary determination by the Attorney General that revocation would be inappropriate for humanitarian reasons. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.1(a)(3)(i)(C). The death certificate for Gwag\u2019s brother, viewed in conjunction with Gwag\u2019s admission that his brother passed away before he had interviewed with the INS and the Notice of Automatic Revocation (\u201cthe Notice\u201d) introduced by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) provided substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determination that approval of the 1-130 petition had been revoked. <em>See Omagah v. Ashcroft, </em>288 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2002). Gwag\u2019s contention that the Notice was not properly authenticated is inadequately briefed and hence will not be considered by this court. Arguments must be properly briefed in order to be preserved. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). The appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument, which in turn must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Given the revocation of the 1-130 petition, we cannot agree with Gwag\u2019s contention that the IJ abused his discretion in determining that he lacked authority to adjudicate Gwag\u2019s application for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1154, 1255. Nor can we agree with Gwag\u2019s contention that this matter should be remanded for consideration of his eligibility for relief under the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2002 (\u201cFSIA\u201d). <em>See </em>Pub. L. No. 107-150, 116 Stat. 75. Under the provisions of the FSIA, any request for consideration under that act must first be presented to the INS. <em>See id. </em>We therefore decline to remand the matter to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Gwag\u2019s remaining contention is that he was denied due process before the IJ because he was not allowed to present certain evidence. He submits that equity and due process require reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision. Because the IJ was without authority to adjudicate Gwag\u2019s application for adjustment of status, the evidence described by Gwag was not probative and the IJ\u2019s refusal to admit such evidence did not violate Gwag\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Bustos-Torres v. INS, </em>898 F.2d 1053, 1055 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Gwag\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
