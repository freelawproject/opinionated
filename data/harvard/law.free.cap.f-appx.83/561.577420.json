We conclude that it does and that the applicable sentencing guidelines require this whenever intended loss can be determined and is greater than the amount of actual loss. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Howard K Baxley pled guilty to four counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (2000). The guilty plea arises from fifteen life insurance policies with a combined face value of $501,340, which Baxley obtained without revealing his infection with the human immune deficiency virus (\u201cHIV\u201d). Baxley viaticated most of these policies and received immediate payouts totaling $38,866. In essence, Baxley lied on his applications for life insurance to secure policies that, in light of his HIV positive status, the insurers likely would not have issued. He then sold these fraudulently obtained policies to third party investors, who accepted the obligation to pay the policy premiums and became the beneficiaries under the policies, and, in return, gave Baxley ten to fifteen percent of a policy\u2019s face value.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that the offense level for a fraud offense increases by increments based on the total dollar amount of loss associated with the offense. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2F.l(b)(l). In its final Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the probation office calculated the total dollar amount of loss in Baxley\u2019s case by looking to the amount of loss that Bax-ley <em>intended </em>and found that\u201d[a]s a result of BAXLEY\u2019s conduct, the loss for guideline purposes is $ 501,340,\u201d or the face value of the life insurance policies. Although the probation office did not explain its reasoning in detail, it appears to have determined that, by fraudulently obtaining life insurance policies that insurers would not have otherwise granted to an HIV positive individual, Baxley rendered the insurers liable for the face value of the policies upon his death and that Baxley therefore intended to create this \u201closs\u201d to the insurers as a necessary step to receive his viatication payouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Baxley objected to the loss calculation set forth in the PSR on the ground that, under <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>975 F.2d 1028 (4th Cir.1992), the sentencing court could include intended loss only when calculating loss for attempt offenses, <em>not </em>completed fraud offenses, like those he committed. According to Baxley, our holding in <em>Bailey </em>limits the loss in this case, involving a completed fraud offense, to actual loss, or the amounts received by Baxley through viatication. Baxley also moved for a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1, Application Note 10, which provides that \u201c[i]n a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense,\u201d such that \u201ca downward departure may be warranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">The district court declined to follow <em>Bailey </em>and accepted the loss calculation (which included intended loss) set forth in the PSR \u2014 $501,340. Accordingly, the court assigned Baxley an offense level of 18, which, in conjunction with his criminal history category of III, resulted in a guideline range of 33 to 41 months. The district court further determined, however, to grant Baxley\u2019s motion for a downward departure because the court found \u201cthat the $ 501,000 is a bit of an over-statement, when the actual was only $ 36,000. I believe the legal theory is correct for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>intended loss to be calculated but I find that over-states [sic] the seriousness of the offense and ... that the more appropriate finding is that the loss was $ 250,000.\u201d Based on a total loss amount of $ 250,000 (which reduced Baxley\u2019s offense level to 16 with a guideline range of 27 to 33 months), the district court sentenced Baxley to 27 months on each count, to be served concurrently, and a term of supervised release of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On appeal, Baxley argues once again that <em>Bailey </em>bars the inclusion of intended loss in the total loss amount for completed fraud offenses and controls in this case because there is \u201cno decision explicitly overruling\u201d <em>Bailey. </em>Brief of Appellant at 8 and 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In <em>Bailey, </em>975 F.2d at 1031, issued in 1992, we held that \u201c[a] close reading of\u2019 the then-applicable commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 \u201creveals that the Sentencing Commission meant to limit\u201d intended loss \u201cto attempt crimes.\u201d Baxley acknowledges, as he must, that four years later in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>81 F.3d 1321, 1328 (4th Cir.1996), we concluded that \u00a7 2F.1 required a court to calculate loss to include \u201cnot just actual loss but intended loss <em>whenever </em>the later can be determined,\u201d including when the loss \u201cis attributable to a completed fraud.\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See also United States v. Miller, </em>316 F.3d 495, 499 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Loayza, </em>107 F.3d 257, 266 (4th Cir.1997). Baxley contends, however, that we must follow <em>Bailey, </em>because \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court.\u201d <em>Mentavlos v. Anderson, </em>249 F.3d 301, 312 n. 4 (4th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">The <em>Mentavlos </em>principle does not apply here. Although <em>Bailey </em>and <em>Williams </em>reached different conclusions as to whether intended loss should be calculated in calculating the loss resulting from a completed fraud offense, they did so based on very different guideline commentary. They do not, therefore, constitute \u201cirreconcilable\u201d precedent as Baxley suggests, but merely interpretation and application of different underlying guideline commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\"><em>Bailey </em>apparently interpreted and applied the 1990 Sentencing Guidelines, while <em>Williams </em>interpreted and applied the Guidelines amended as of November 1, 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court sentenced Baxley under the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines, which were, in relevant part, substantively the same as those applicable in <em>Williams. </em>After we decided <em>Bailey </em>and before we decided <em>Williams, </em>the Sentencing Commission amended the commentary to \u00a7 2F1.1 and that of an accompanying interrelated guideline section at issue here, \u00a7 2B1.1, in such a way as to clarify that intended loss is to be included in calculating the loss amount for all fraud offenses \u2014 completed or attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The Supreme Court has directed that \u201ccommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>L.Ed.2d 598 (1998). A change in commentary can change the law of the circuit by indicating that the circuit\u2019s prior interpretation of a guideline does not accord with the Commission\u2019s intent. <em>United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1110-1113 (4th Cir. 1995). When a change in the commentary mandates an interpretation different than that previously employed, courts may apply a guideline in accord with the new commentary without overruling any prior, contrary circuit precedent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Although the amendments to the commentary made after <em>Bailey </em>and prior to <em>Williams </em>do not expressly state that intended loss applies to completed offenses, they do make that principle significantly more evident. When interpreted in <em>Bailey, </em>application note 7 in the commentary to \u00a7 2F1.1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\"><em>In keeping with the Commission\u2019s policy on attempts, </em>if a <em>probable or intended loss </em>that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, that figure would be used if it was larger than the actual loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\"><em>See Bailey, </em>975 F.2d at 1031 (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original). Similarly, when we decided <em>Bailey, </em>Application Note 2 to \u00a7 2B1.1 stated that \u201c[i]n cases of partially completed conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"avb-dedup-0\">In 1991, the Commission removed the sentence in Application Note 7 to \u00a7 2F1.1, set forth above, which we had quoted and relied on in <em>Bailey, </em>and added a sentence that provides: \u201cConsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\u201d The Commission also revised the discussion of partially completed offenses and moved it out of the primary paragraph of Application Note 2 to \u00a7 2B1.1 placing it apart and further down in a separate paragraph. And in 1992, the Commission added the following sentence to Application Note 7 to \u00a7 2F1.1: \u201cAs in theft cases, loss is the value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken; it does not, for example, include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had the offense not occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Cumulatively, these and other changes clarified that loss resulting from fraud in all cases should include intended loss, if that loss can be determined. As the probation office explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">Note 7 clearly defers to the Commentary of 2B1.1 for discussion of the valuation of loss.... In Application Note 7, it goes on to note that, <em>consistent </em>with the provisions of 2X1.1, if an intended loss the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, that amount is to be used for loss purposes if it is greater than the actual loss. Application Note 7 does not indicate that like 2X1.1, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>crime itself must be an attempt for intended loss to apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">PSR Addendum at 2 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The best evidence of the import of the amendments to the commentary can be found in the Commission\u2019s explanation of its amendments. Most significantly, when the Commission amended Application Note 7 to \u00a7 2F1.1 in 1992 it explained: \u201cThis amendment clarifies that interest is not included in the determination of loss. In addition, it clarifies that in fraudulent loan application cases, <em>as in other types of fraud, if the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is used.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G., Appendix C, amend. 470 (effective November 1, 1992) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The Commission also generally described its amendments as designed to remove ambiguity about the calculation of loss under \u00a7 2F1.1. Thus, with regard to the relevant 1991 amendments, the Commission explained that they were effected to \u201cprovide! ] a more precise reference in the commentary of these guidelines to the discussion in \u00a7 2X1.1 that applies in the case of a partially completed offense\u201d and \u201creorder! ] the material in these notes, and divide! ] them into separate paragraphs for greater clarity.\u201d U.S.S.G., Appendix C, amend. 393 (effective November 1, 1991). The Commission further noted that the amendments \u201cconform! ] the working of Application Note 7 of the commentary to \u00a7 2F1.1 to Application Note 2 of the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 to make clear that the treatment of attempts in cases of fraud and theft is identical,\u201d and \u201cprovide! ] additional guidance with respect to the determination of loss.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In holding that, because in <em>Williams </em>we relied on a different version of the Guidelines commentary than in <em>Bailey, </em>the former did not overrule the latter <em>sub silen-tio, </em>we do not suggest that every time the Commission amends the guideline commentary prior precedent interpreting earlier commentary is defunct or open to wholesale reinterpretation. Rather, we reach our holding only because of the unusual circumstances present here. In this case, the Commission not only amended the commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 and \u00a7 2F1.1 in a way that clarified that intended loss should be calculated for completed offenses, but expressly stated in the course of doing so that \u201cin ... fraud, if the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is used.\u201d Further, in <em>Bailey </em>we relied on a \u201cclose reading of the Commentary\u201d and quoted the sentence in the former Application Note 7 that would most suggest that intended loss is limited to attempt crimes \u2014 \u201cIn keeping with the Commission\u2019s policy on attempts, if a <em>probable or intended loss </em>that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, that figure would be used if it was larger than the actual loss.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>975 F.2d at 1031 (emphasis added by the <em>Bailey </em>court). The Commission had significantly altered this sentence by the time we decided <em>Williams. </em>And, after <em>Williams, </em>the Commission made its intent on this point even more explicit\u2014 \u00a7 2B1.1 now encompasses both theft and fraud and expressly provides in commentary that \u201closs is the greater of actual or intended loss\u201d and intended loss \u201cmeans the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G., \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 2 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Finally, we note that at oral argument, Baxley contended that, even if a sentencing court could consider intended loss in calculating loss for a completed fraud offense, the district court erred in this case by setting the loss amount as the face value of the insurance policies, and that we must remand for the district court to recalculate the amount of loss. Baxley suggested a number of theories in support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>of remand, <em>e.g., </em>that the face value of an insurance policy does not represent loss, but lost profit such that it falls within the rule that \u201closs ... does not ... include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had the offense not occurred,\u201d \u00a7 2F1.1, cmt. n. 7; that intended loss cannot be calculated in this case because the amount of intended loss cannot \u201cbe determined\u201d with sufficient certainty, \u00a7 2F1.1, cmt. n. 7 (providing that \u201cif an intended loss <em>can be determined, </em>this figure will be used\u201d) (emphasis added); and that the district court incorrectly determined that Baxley \u201cintended\u201d the loss to include the amounts of the face values of the policies. Baxley, however, failed to raise these alternative arguments in his appellate brief and therefore waived them. <em>See 11126 Balt. Blvd. Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>58 F.3d 988, 993 n. 74 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In any event, a district court\u2019s factual determinations as to the amount of intended loss could only be reversed if clearly erroneous. <em>Miller, </em>316 F.3d at 503. Bax-ley conceded at the sentencing hearing that the amount of the \u201cpotential intended loss\u201d is $501,340. The district court granted a downward departure, holding Baxley accountable for only $250,000 of loss. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201cthe loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d \u00a7 2F1.1, cmt. n. 8 (1997). Given Baxley\u2019s concession, the district court\u2019s final determination of loss amount, and the governing law, we would be hard pressed to conclude that the district court clearly erred in its factual determinations. <em>See generally United States v. Lorefice, </em>192 F.3d 647, 655 (7th Cir.1999) (upholding district court\u2019s factual finding that the face value of life insurance policies constituted intended loss under \u00a7 2F1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. Neither <em>Bailey </em>nor <em>Williams </em>identify the year of the Sentencing Guidelines applied. However, the sentencing in <em>Bailey </em>took place sometime after April 1990 and the court relied on language in the Guidelines that no longer existed by November 1, 1991. 975 F.2d at 1030, 1031. In <em>Williams, </em>it appears that the sentencing took place after December 16, 1994, 81 F.3d at 1323-24, and the court references a provision that did not take effect until November 1, 1991, 81 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">. Baxley recognizes some of the differences in commentaiy text, but argues that \"[distinguishing <em>Bailey </em>from <em>Williams </em>on the basis that the cases involved different versions of Application Note 7 ... is not very convincing]\u201d because <em>\u201cBailey\u2019s </em>logic, that intended losses are counted only when the crime is an attempt, should seemingly have applied in <em>Williams.\u201d </em>Brief of Appellant at 13. We do not here attempt to distinguish the holdings of <em>Bailey </em>and <em>Williams </em>(we find the Government's attempt to do so by characterizing the reference to attempts in Bailey as <em>dicta </em>unavailing), but rather to ascertain the commentary text underlying the holdings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\">. Section 2X1.1 remained in relevant part the same from <em>Bailey </em>to <em>Williams </em>and specified the calculation of offense level for attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy; its commentary discusses the addition of offense characteristics for \"actually intended\u201d actions and the computation of offense level for a partially completed offense. \u00a7 2X1.1, cmt. n. 2, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
