We do not agree. In order to show that the Hospital regarded Burnett as substantially limited with respect to the major life activity of lifting, Burnett would have to show that the Hospital regarded her as unable to lift 10 pounds, <em>Marinetti v. City of Erie, </em>216 F.3d 354, 364 (3d Cir.2000), and there is no evidence to that effect. On the contrary, the evidence merely shows that the Hospital regarded her as unable to meet the 50-pound lifting requirement that it set for nursing positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">The record is also insufficient to show that the Hospital regarded her as substantially limited in the major life activity of working. The record shows no more than that the Hospital regarded her as unable to meet its own requirements for nursing positions. Burnett has not identified any evidence in the record that other hospitals had similar requirements or that the Hospital believed that other hospitals and other employers of nurses had such a job requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The testimony of Burnett\u2019s vocational expert does not show that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of working. The expert answered in the affirmative when asked whether Burnett would be disqualified from a broad range of jobs if she could not work full time in \u201clifting positions\u201d and if the only full-time jobs she could perform were \u201cnon-lifting\u201d jobs. This testimony is insufficient because, among other things, it does not take into account Burnett\u2019s specific lifting restriction, i.e., between 20 and 40 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Finally, the remark that Burnett attributes to Hudson is insufficient. Burnett claims that Hudson \u201ctold\u201d her to apply for Social Security disability benefits. Hudson, on the other hand, says Burnett asked if she would qualify for such benefits and that Hudson replied that she did not know but would investigate if Burnett wished. We must of course view the record in the light most favorable to Burnett, but even when we do so, the record is inadequate. Hudson\u2019s statement that Burnett asked whether she was qualified is not controverted; nor is there any evidence that Hudson knew the requirements for receiving disability benefits. Under these circumstances, \u201ctelling\u201d Burnett to apply does not reasonably show more than that Hudson thought that if Burnett wished to pursue such benefits, she should apply. Hudson\u2019s statement cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean that Hudson felt that Burnett was in fact qualified for such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Burnett suggests that the Hospital discharged her in retaliation for filing worker\u2019s compensation claims. However, the only legal claims asserted in this appeal concern discrimination based on disability, and therefore no issue regarding worker\u2019s compensation is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We heard argument on this appeal, and we have carefully considered all of Burnett\u2019s arguments. We find no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">For these reasons, the order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
