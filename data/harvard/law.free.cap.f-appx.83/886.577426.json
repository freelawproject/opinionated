Melchor contends that the district court (1) violated <em>Batson </em>by permitting the prosecutor to exercise a peremptory challenge on the basis of race; (2) denied him a fair trial by admitting prejudicial prior bad acts into evidence; (3) gave the jury improper and misleading <em>Pinkerton </em>instructions; (4) erroneously applied a two-level vulnerable victim enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l); and (5) refused to grant him a two-level downward departure for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">Co-defendant Ignacio Garcia-Rebollar (\u201cGarcia\u201d) challenges his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by refusing to depart downward to conform his sentence to those of two of his co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">A. Batson <em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">Melchor contends the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to strike potential juror Guillermo Zepeda because he is Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-21\"><em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 96-98, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), outlines a three-step process for evaluating claims that a prosecutor has used peremptory challenges in a manner violating the Equal Protection Clause. First, the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race. Second, if the requisite showing has been made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. Third, the court must determine whether the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>dant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358, 111 S.Ct. 1859,114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Here, the prosecutor explained that she struck Zepeda because \u201cit\u2019s my policy to pick people who listen and understand what is asked without it being repeated because that\u2019s not usually \u2014 they don\u2019t usually have that opportunity during the trial.\u201d Because the prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for striking Zepe-da, the issue of whether Melchor made a prima facie showing is moot. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s ultimate finding that the prosecutor did not purposefully discriminate. <em>Stubbs v. Gomez, </em>189 F.3d 1099, 1105 (9th Cir. 1999). We accord great deference to a trial court\u2019s findings on the issue of discriminatory intent. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">We conclude that the district court did not err in finding there was no purposeful discrimination. The record reflects that the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking Zepeda was her real reason for doing so. Zepeda had misunderstood the court\u2019s question regarding whether he or his family had been victims of crime and had to ask the court to repeat the question. When explaining to the court why she struck Zepeda, the prosecutor correctly noted that the juror questioned after Zepe-da also failed to understand the question but was challenged for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">B. <em>Prior Bad Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Melchor argues that the district court denied him a fair trial by admitting into evidence testimony by one of the hostages that he overheard either Melchor or Garcia talk about having previously killed a Panamanian and shot a security guard. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">The evidence was not admitted for a purpose prohibited by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)- \u2014 i.e., to \u201cprove the character of a person in order to action in conformity therewith.\u201d Rather, as explained by the district court, the evidence was admitted for the purpose of showing intimidation of the hostages.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Although the district court did not explicitly determine whether the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, we assume that the court performed the necessary balancing because Melchor\u2019s attorney referred to Federal Rule of Evidence 403 in both his motion in limine and at sidebar. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Jiminez, </em>967 F.2d 1321, 1326 (9th Cir. 1992) (explaining that while the trial court failed to make an explicit finding under Rule 403, the court implicitly made the necessary finding because the government\u2019s trial memorandum reminded the judge of the necessity of weighing probative value and prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">We need not determine whether the court properly balanced the probative value of the evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice, because even if the evidence was erroneously admitted, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">\u201c[H] armless error analysis applies to the improper admission of evidence, and reversal is proper only if the government cannot show that the error was more probably than not harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckman, </em>298 F.3d 788, 793 (9th Cir.2002). To establish that the prejudice resulting from the error was more probably than not harmless, the government must show a \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the verdict was not \u201csubstantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>United States v. Bauer, </em>132 F.3d 504, 510 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">The admission of the disputed evidence was more probably than not harmless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>even in the absence of a limiting instruction, because there was overwhelming evidence of Melchor\u2019s guilt. At trial, the testimony of Melchor\u2019s co-conspirators and victims firmly established his participation in the hostage taking scheme, including the use of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">C. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Melchor contends that Jury Instructions 25, 26, and 27 were misleading and inadequate. Melchor\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">First, Melchor points to the court\u2019s use of the word \u201coffenses\u201d instead of \u201coffense\u201d during the oral charge. However, the jury had the correct written instructions before them during deliberations. Although written instructions do not necessarily repair an error in oral instructions (see <em>United States v. Ancheta, </em>38 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.1994)), here, the error was slight, and we have no reason to believe that any juror was confused by the minor difference in wording between the oral and written instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Second, Melchor objects to the court\u2019s repetition of the <em>Pinkerton </em>charges\u2019 introductory language that explains what a conspiracy is and when a member of a conspiracy is responsible for the actions of co-conspirators. Although the repetition of this language was not necessary, it was not misleading or confusing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Finally, Melchor argues that the district court erred by faffing to define the word \u201coffense\u201d as used in the fifth element of the <em>Pinkerton </em>charges. Melchor argues that the jury could have interpreted \u201coffense\u201d to mean an over act as opposed to the crime charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Melchor\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. The <em>Pinkerton </em>charges track the language of Ninth Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction 8.20 and <em>United States v. Alvarez-Valenzuela, </em>231 F.3d 1198, 1202-03 (9th Cir.2000). Moreover, the fourth element makes it clear that the word \u201coffense,\u201d as used in the instructions, refers to the crime charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">D. <em>Vulnerable Victim Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Melchor challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level vulnerable victim enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). He argues that the adjustment was improper because (1) it amounted to double-counting and (2) the enhancement should not apply to illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">Both of Melchor\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Sierra-Velasquez, </em>310 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir. 2002). In <em>Sierra-Velasquez, </em>we upheld the district court\u2019s application of the two-level vulnerable victim enhancement in sentencing the defendants who were convicted of hostage taking and conspiracy. We rejected the defendants\u2019 double-counting argument and explained that illegal aliens are more vulnerable than other categories of persons who may be held hostage for ransom.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">E. <em>Acceptance of Responsibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">The district court did not err in refusing to grant Melchor a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility in connection with Count 6, to which he pleaded guilty before trial. In <em>United States v. Ginn, </em>87 F.3d 367 (9th Cir.1996), we held that a \u201cdefendant is not entitled to an adjustment when he does not accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>responsibility for <em>all of the counts of which he is convicted.\u201d Id. </em>at 370 (emphasis added). Melchor did not accept responsibility for all of the counts of which he was convicted; he is not entitled to the two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">F. <em>Downward Departure Due to Sentencing Disparity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Garcia argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant him a downward departure to conform his sentence to those of co-conspirators Jaime Melchor-Duarte and Pablo Ramirez-Melchor, who were sentenced to terms of 151 months and 138 months, respectively. Garcia\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Young, </em>988 F.2d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir.1993). The decision whether to depart based on sentence disparity among defendants is properly left within \u201cthe sound discretion of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Caperna, </em>251 F.3d 827, 832 (9th Cir.2001). The district court entertained argument regarding a downward departure due to sentencing disparity but, in its discretion, declined to depart downward.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-22\">. In an opinion filed concurrently with this memorandum disposition, we affirm the district court's division of the 23 victims of the hostage-taking conspiracy into 23 separate count groups.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-10\">. In his briefs on appeal, Melchor argues that the court erroneously repeated the definition of conspiracy in Count 1 (Jury Instruction 23) and Count 3 (Jury Instruction 28). However, Counts 1 and 3 are conspiracy counts. It is clear from the record that Melchor intended to challenge the repetition of the introductory language in the <em>Pinkerton </em>charges (Jury Instructions 25, 26, and 27).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
