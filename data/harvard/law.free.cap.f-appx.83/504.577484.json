The Board adopted the decision of the IJ that Maran failed to present credible evidence establishing past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). We have reviewed the administrative record and the Id\u2019s decision, and find that substantial evidence supports the Id\u2019s ruling that Maran failed to establish her refugee status. The Id\u2019s credibility determinations are supported by specific, cogent reasoning, and therefore are entitled to substantial deference. <em>Figeroa v. U.S. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We conclude as well that Maran is not entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000), or under the U.N. Convention Against Torture. The Id did not err in finding that Maran failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>See Rusu v. U.S. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d). Nor did Maran establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would face torture if she returned to Indonesia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2003) (to qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, an alien must show \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
