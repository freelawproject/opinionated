Pursuant to a written plea agreement, the government and Chalas stipulated that: (1) the applicable sentencing guideline was \u00a7 2D1.1, and the amount of crack-cocaine attributable to Chalas was at least 50 grams but not more than 150 grams, carrying a base offense level of 32; (2) Chalas did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm in connection with the offense; (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to another person; (4) Chalas was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others, and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; (5) Chalas would be eligible for a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 if he continued to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility; and (6) neither party would argue at sentencing for a downward or upward departure or adjustment, except that Chalas reserved the right to seek a two-level reduction in his offense level for his alleged minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) concurred with the stipulations set forth in the plea agreement, and also recommended a two-level reduction in the offense level because Chalas satisfied the \u201csafety-valve\u201d criteria under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. (PSR H1122, 62.) Moreover, according to the PSR and as relevant here, Chalas\u2019 participation in the offense did not warrant a mitigating role adjustment because he (1) arranged for the undercover agent to purchase the drugs, (2) negotiated the purchase price and accompanied the undercover agent and the cooperating witness to a location in order to meet the supplier, and (3) understood the scope of the conspiracy. (PSR 1\u00cd15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">At the sentencing hearing on January 27, 2003, Chalas argued for a two-level reduction in his offense level under U.S.S.G. 3B1.2(b) based on his purported minor role. The District Court rejected this argument, finding that: (1) Chalas was a \u201cfacilitator between parties who had no prior knowledge of each other\u201d; (2) his \u201cactions were critical to the success of the venture\u201d; and (3) he was fully aware of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise, as demonstrated by his \u201ctransfer of a certain amount of crack cocaine for a certain price\u201d and his expectation to be paid \u201csomewhere in the neighborhood of ten percent of the purchase price.\u201d (App. at 39A-40A.) Thus, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>concluded, Chalas failed to prove that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant in this transaction,\u201d and sentenced him to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (App. at 40A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Chalas filed a timely appeal and argues that he is entitled to a minor role adjustment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">A sentencing court\u2019s factual findings with respect to whether a role adjustment is warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318 (3d Cir.2002). Courts are afforded broad discretion in applying \u00a7 3B1.2, and \u201ctheir rulings are left largely undisturbed by the courts of appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 allows a two-level reduction in the offense level of a defendant whose role was minor. A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Application Note 5; <em>United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir.2001). In assessing whether a defendant played a minor role, the following factors are considered: \u201cthe nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (quoting <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d Cir. 1991)) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Chalas introduced the undercover agent to the drug supplier, knew the price of the drugs and relayed that information to the buyer, personally turned the drugs over to the undercover agent and received money from him, and expected to be paid $200 to $250 for the transaction. He played an instrumental role in the transaction which, it is clear, could not have taken place without him. The District Court\u2019s findings that Chalas\u2019 actions were critical to the success of the venture, and that he was fully aware of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise, were not clearly erroneous. <em>See also United States v. Edwards, </em>98 F.3d 1364, 1371 (D.C.Cir.1996) (determining that defendant did not play a minor role in the offense because she \u201chandled the drugs and exchanged them for money,\u201d and \u201crequested payment in drugs for her services in arranging the deal\u201d). Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-8\">. Chalas' total offense level was 27, and his criminal history category was I. The resulting guideline imprisonment range was 70 to 87 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
