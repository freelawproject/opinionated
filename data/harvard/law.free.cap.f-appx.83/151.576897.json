Police found the drugs, along with five guns, ammunition, magazines, and gun silencers or suppressors, when they searched Malave\u2019s apartment, which he shared with his child and the child\u2019s mother. The methamphetamine was found in Malave\u2019s bedroom closet, and the guns were found in an armoire about five feet from the closet. Police also found surgical masks, gloves, and a knife in the armoire, and surveillance equipment in a crawl space in Malave\u2019s bedroom. One pinhole camera was mounted to Malave\u2019s bedroom window, and another was mounted to an exterior garage light. Police found the cocaine in the child\u2019s bedroom and in a computer room. In the kitchen, police found a stun gun, a police scanner, and written police radio frequencies. Police arrested Malave and found about $1,000 on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">Malave pleaded guilty to the cocaine offense, and litigated at sentencing whether he was entitled to a mitigating-role adjustment, and whether a two-point enhancement applied for his possession of firearms in connection with a controlled-substance offense. Having heard testimony from an investigator and Malave\u2019s girlfriend and mother, the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> found insufficient evidence that Malave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>was \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, n. 3. The district court also rejected Ma-lave\u2019s claim that the guns were not used in connection with the distribution of drugs but were used merely for target practice, given the number and types of guns and ammunition found in his bedroom and their proximity to a significant amount of drugs, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The district court sentenced Malave to 108 months in prison, and he appeals, repeating his sentencing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual finding concerning Ma-lave\u2019s role in the offense, <em>see United States v. Lopez-Arce, </em>267 F.3d 775, 784 (8th Cir. 2001), and find none. The nature of the items found at his residence show Malave was \u201cdeeply involved\u201d in the criminal acts, see <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>60 F.3d 514, 518 (8th Cir.1995); and do not support his contention that he merely operated a storage facility for drugs. Likewise, the district court did not commit clear error in applying a two-level enhancement to Ma-lave\u2019s offense level based on his possession of the guns. <em>See United States v. Betz, </em>82 F.3d 205, 210 (8th Cir.1996) (standard of review; concerning application of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, government has burden to show by preponderance of evidence dangerous weapon was present and it was not clearly improbable that weapon had nexus with criminal activity). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-12\"> The Honorable David S.
