Thigpen with making false statements relating to health care matters, health care fraud, and money laundering. The Government brought the charges after an investigation revealed Thigpen sought reimbursement from Medicaid for transportation services allegedly provided by his company, New Life Transportation, and some of the billed services had not been provided. A jury convicted Thigpen of 41 of the counts, and the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sentenced him to 51 months confinement followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay a $4,100 assessment and restitution of $412,438.41. Thigpen appeals his money-laundering convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae, arguing the government failed to prove the proceeds of the unlawful activity were used to further his unlawful scheme. Rather, Thigpen argues he paid his drivers\u2019 salaries and his company\u2019s rent from an account into which he had deposited tainted and untainted funds. According to Thigpen\u2019s appeal brief, during the time he' received $800,000 from his fraudulent scheme, he received over $200,000 from legitimate business operations, and he was convicted of laundering or \u201creinvesting\u201d some $4,195, an amount that could have been paid out of lawfully obtained funds. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8-9, 13-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-22\">To sustain a conviction under section 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae, the Government needed to prove Thigpen \u201cengaged in financial transactions with the knowing use of the proceeds of illegal activities\u201d and with the \u201cintent to promote the carrying on\u201d of unlawful activity. <em>See United States v. Jolivet, </em>224 F.3d 902, 909 (8th Cir.2000) (quoting \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae). In general the Government is not required to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <em>See id. </em>at 907. Contrary to Thigpen\u2019s position, the Government was not required to prove no untainted funds were involved to sustain his conviction. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>States v. Moore, </em>27 F.3d 969, 977 (4th Cir.) (\u201cA requirement that the government trace each dollar of the transaction to the criminal, as opposed to the non-criminal activity, would allow individuals effectively to defeat prosecution for money laundering by simply commingling legitimate funds with criminal proceeds.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 979, 115 S.Ct. 459, 130 L.Ed.2d 367 (1994). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">LAY, Circuit Judge, concurs only in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-20\"> The Honorable David S.
