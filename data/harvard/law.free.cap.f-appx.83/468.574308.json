Trenkler is serving concurrent life sentences in the United States Penitentiary at Allenwood for convictions under the federal arson statute and other statutes. He petitioned the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania for relief from this sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), the conduct for which he was convicted is no longer criminal. Because <em>Jones v. United States </em>does not decriminalize the conduct at issue in this case, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Trenk-ler\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Facts and Procedural Posture</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">In October 1991, an explosion at the Roslindale, Massachusetts home of Thomas Shay, Sr. killed one Boston Police Bomb Squad Officer and severely maimed another. The police officers had been investigating a suspicious object in Shay Sr.\u2019s driveway, which he reported finding after hearing noises coming from the floorboards of his 1986 Buick Century. Police later arrested two suspects, Trenkler and Thomas Shay, Jr., for their respective roles in the explosion. The two men were indicted by a grand jury and tried separately. At Trenkler\u2019s trial, the Government\u2019s case was that Trenkler had built the bomb for Shay Jr. to use against his father. <em>See United States v. Trenkler, </em>61 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir.1995). In 1994, Trenk-ler was convicted of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; receipt of explosive materials in interstate commerce with the intent to kill, injure, and intimidate Shay Sr. and cause damage to his property, in violation 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(d); and attempting to damage and destroy maliciously, by means of an explosive, Shay Sr.\u2019s car, which was used in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i). Trenkler was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment for the \u00a7 844 convictions and one concurrent sixty month term for the conspiracy conviction. (Shay Jr., in contrast, received a 12 year sentence following a plea agreement.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Since the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed Trenkler\u2019s sentence on direct appeal in 1995, Trenkler has made several unsuccessful post-conviction motions (including a motion for collateral relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was denied as untimely). <em>See Trenkler v. United States, </em>268 F.3d 16 (1st Cir.2001). In October 2002, Trenkler filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, on the ground that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones v. United States </em>decriminalized the conduct for which he was convicted and sentenced. In an order dated March 7, 2003, the District Court denied this petition for lack of jurisdiction. We consider Trenkler\u2019s appeal from this decision pursuant to our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">AEDPA Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>prisoner may collaterally attack his or her sentence as unconstitutional or otherwise flawed by filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A prisoner may not, however, file a second or successive petition unless the court of appeals first certifies that it contains either (1) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish by clear or convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would find the petitioner guilty of the offense, or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review, that was previously unavailable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. But under \u00a7 2255\u2019s so-called \u201csavings clause,\u201d a prisoner may attempt to bypass the gatekeeping provisions that otherwise preclude successive \u00a7 2255 petitions. The savings clause allows a petitioner to seek a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 when a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Trenkler concedes that the arguments contained in his current petition do not qualify for successive petition certification under \u00a7 2255 because they do not involve new evidence or a new rule of constitutional law. Thus he may raise these arguments only in a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241. But to do this, he must first establish that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Mere inability to satisfy \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for successive petitions does not establish that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective. <em>In Re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). A \u00a7 2255 petition is inadequate and ineffective \u201conly if it can be shown that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a Section 2255 proceeding from affording the prisoner a full hearing and adjudication of his claim of wrongful detention.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>230 F.3d 643, 648 (3d Cir.2000). We recognized in <em>Dorsainvil, </em>however, that \u201ca prisoner who had no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law may negate\u201d exemplifies the \u201cuncommon situation\u201d in which the \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective and in which a \u00a7 2241 petition is cognizable. <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251. Put another way, \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of a conviction when: \u201c(1) at the time of conviction, settled law of this circuit or the Supreme Court established the legality of the conviction; (2) subsequent to the prisoner\u2019s direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion, the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal; and (3) the prisoner cannot satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2255 because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.\u201d <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-334 (4th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Analysis of \u201cIntervening Change in Substantive Law\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">A. <em>Jones </em>does not negate Trenkler\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Trenkler argues that <em>Jones v. United States </em>is an intervening change in substantive law that negates his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i). Section 844(i) criminalizes the malicious destruction (or attempted destruction) of a building or vehicle \u201cused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce\u201d by means of an explosive or fire. Trenkler argues that <em>Jones </em>heightened the statute\u2019s interstate commerce requirements, thereby removing the conduct for which he was convicted from federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Subsequent to Trenkler\u2019s direct appeal to the First Circuit, the Supreme Court decided <em>Jones, </em>and held that the federal arson statute did not apply to the burning of a private residence that was not \u201cused in ... any activity affecting interstate ... commerce,\u201d as \u00a7 844(i) requires. <em>Id. </em>at 859. There the state argued that the homeowner \u201cused\u201d the residence in an activity affecting interstate commerce by (1) pledging it as collateral to obtain a mortgage from an out-of-state lender, (2) obtaining a casualty insurance policy from an out-of-state insurer, and (3) receiving natural gas from sources outside the state. <em>Id. </em>at 855. The Court held that these \u201cpassive, passing, or past connections to commerce\u201d did not satisfy the statute\u2019s requirement that the house be \u201cused\u201d-ie., \u201cactively employ[ed]\u201d-in commercial activity. <em>Id. </em>at 855, 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Thus, the only issue the Supreme Court addressed in <em>Jones </em>was whether the building was \u201cused\u201d commercially. Deciding that it was not, the Court did not need to decide, nor did it suggest, whether the building\u2019s commercial function sufficiently affected interstate commerce-a distinct second step in the jurisdictional inquiry under \u00a7 844(i). <em>Id. </em>at 854 (\u201cThe proper inquiry, we agree, 'is into the function of the building itself, and then a determination of whether that function affects interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>(citing United States v. Ryan, </em>9 F.3d 660, 675 (8th Cir.1993) (R. Arnold, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part))). <em>Jones </em>did not address-let alone change the law regarding-the degree to which a building\u2019s (or vehicle\u2019s) function must affect interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>299 F.3d 250, 258 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1065, 123 S.Ct. 614, 154 L.Ed.2d 552 (2002) (rejecting that <em>Jones </em>requires trial courts to instruct juries that a substantial connection to interstate commerce is required); <em>United States v. Grassie, </em>237 F.3d 1199, 1208 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe Court [in <em>Jones </em>] expressed no view on the <em>\u2018de min-imis\u2019 </em>standard for effects on interstate commerce. Its focus was on the active use versus passive or passing relationship to commerce. The Court required only \u201cactive employment\u201d which affects commerce, not a particular quantum of effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In this case, as the District Court found, there is uneontroverted evidence that Shay Sr. actively used the Buick for commercial activity, his part-time auto body repair business. Shay, Sr. drove the Buick to auto body parts stores to purchase parts manufactured for foreign and domestic cars. He drove it to the offices of insurance companies with whom he had dealings. Sometimes, and as recently as two weeks before the bombing, he loaned it to customers while he repaired their cars. Shay Sr. thus \u201cactively employed\u201d the Buick in commercial activity, and thus it had more than a \u201cpassive, passing, or past connection\u201d to commerce. So read, <em>Jones </em>does not negate Trenkler\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 844(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">This conclusion does not contradict our decision in <em>United States v. McGuire, </em>178 F.3d 203 (3d Cir.1999). There we held that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), local commerce with merely an \u201cinconsequential\u201d or <em>\u201cde minimis\u201d </em>effect on interstate commerce could not satisfy the jurisdictional nexus of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i). Otherwise, we cautioned, federal jurisdiction \u201ccould be stretched to include driving one\u2019s daughter to a neighbor\u2019s house to deliver a single box of Girl Scout cookies.\u201d 178 F.3d at 210. In <em>McGuire, </em>a pipe bomb exploded inside a vehicle that was sometimes used in connection with a local catering firm. We rejected the state\u2019s argument that the presence of a bottle of Florida orange juice in the vehicle\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>truck -the only evidence presented to support federal jurisdiction-was a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce for the purposes of \u00a7 844(i). In contrast, the evidence of Shay Sr.\u2019s auto repair business\u2019s effect on interstate commerce was more than a bottle of orange juice or a single box of Girl Scout cookies. Shay Sr. serviced customers from out of state and he worked on both foreign and domestic cars. This is more than a <em>de minimis </em>affect on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">B. <em>Jones </em>does not negate Trenkler\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 844(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Trenkler also argues that <em>Jones </em>is an intervening change in substantive law that negates his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(d). Under that subsection, it is a crime to \u201ctransport or receive, or attempt to transport or receive, in interstate or foreign commerce, any explosive with the knowledge or intent that it will be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or unlawfully damage or destroy any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property.\u201d Although <em>Jones </em>does not directly address \u00a7 844(d), Trenkler argues that \u201cthe broader holding of Jones is that <em>de minimis </em>links to interstate commerce are no longer sufficient to establish federal jurisdiction over traditionally local concerns.\u201d Br. at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">As explained above, <em>Jones </em>did not so hold. It considered whether a building (or by implication, a vehicle) was actively \u201cused in\u201d commercial activity, not whether that activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce. See <em>Williams, </em>299 F.3d at 258; <em>Grassie, </em>237 F.3d at 1208. Because the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 844(d) does not require that a building or vehicle be used in activity affecting interstate commerce, <em>Jones </em>is not an intervening change in substantive law that undermines Trenkler\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 844(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\"><em>Jones </em>does not decriminalize the conduct for which Trenkler was convicted. Thus the District Court properly held that there was not an intervening change in substantive law that entitled Trenkler to rely on the savings clause provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to challenge the validity of his conviction pursuant to a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Trenkler\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\">.
