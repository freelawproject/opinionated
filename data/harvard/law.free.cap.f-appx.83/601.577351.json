She argues that because the BIA summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (IJ), the court does not owe any special deference to the IJ\u2019s decision. We have rejected the argument that a less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>deferential standard of review applies to an IJ\u2019s decision which has been summarily affirmed by the BIA. <em>See Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Kassa argues that the IJ erred in giving more weight to the United States State Department Country Report on conditions in Ethiopia than to reports of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Reuters News Service which she submitted. Sources such as the United States State Department are the \u201cmost appropriate and perhaps the best resource ... to obtain information on political situations in foreign nations.\u201d <em>Rojas v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 186, 190 n. 1 (5th Cir.1991). We will not reverse the BIA\u2019s finding merely because we disagree with the BIA\u2019s evaluation of the facts or weighing of the evidence. <em>See Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Kassa argues that the IJ\u2019s decision that she did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution is not supported by substantial evidence. Kassa has not established that the evidence of her fear of future persecution was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder would conclude against such a finding. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
