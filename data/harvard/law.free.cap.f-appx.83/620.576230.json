He argues further that because his indictment did not allege the fact of his prior aggravated felony conviction as a separate element of the offense, the indictment charged him only with an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) rather than 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), and his maximum punishment is limited to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Trejo-Segura acknowledges that his arguments are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but wishes to preserve the issues for Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Thus, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Accordingly, Trejo-Segura\u2019s arguments are foreclosed, and his conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
