The district court, however, has not issued any final orders in Edwards\u2019s case since entry of the judgment of conviction and sentence on December 18, 2000, which we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>30 Fed.Appx. 293 (4th Cir.2002) (unpublished). In this court, Edwards has filed a \u201cmotion for correction of sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d We dismiss the motion because we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-22\">A motion for correction of sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2255 must be filed in \u201cthe court which imposed the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). The statute further provides that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Edwards\u2019s motion is not properly brought in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-23\">Accordingly, we dismiss Edwards\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
