Banning, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b136-20\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">Richard Billy Gunter, a federal prisoner proceeding through counsel, appeals the sentence imposed upon his convictions. The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-22\">On July 19, 2000, Gunter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute in excess of 5 kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and theft of government funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. Out of a total of eleven defendants charged in the conspiracy, the presentence report ranked Gunter as fourth in regard to relative culpability. Gunter objected to this ranking and further argued that he was entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he was a minimal participant in the conspiracy. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(a). The district court conducted hearings on the matter, but ultimately overruled Gun-ter\u2019s objection and sentenced Gunter to 188 months in prison on the conspiracy charge and 120 months in prison on the theft charge, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>In his timely appeal, Gunter contends that the district court erred by not granting him a reduction for a minimal role and that a sentencing court must make a finding for each contested fact in a PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Traditionally, this court has reviewed a district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating role adjustment for clear error. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>228 F.3d 377, 379-80 (6th Cir. 2000). But this court also has stated that the standard of review should be the same as that for an aggravating role adjustment, such that the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a mitigating role adjustment are reviewed for clear error, while its legal conclusions are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Regardless of which standard is applied in the instant case, we conclude that the district court made proper findings of fact and properly denied the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Review of the record shows that the district court made findings concerning Gunter\u2019s objections. At sentencing, the district court found that Gunter was properly ranked within the hierarchy and expressly overruled Gunter\u2019s objection, reasoning that Gunter admitted to facts at the plea hearing which made him ineligible for a mitigating role reduction and that the government had successfully attacked Gunter\u2019s credibility at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The district court\u2019s findings concerning Gunter\u2019s role in the offense are not clearly erroneous. Gunter\u2019s minimization of his role in the conspiracy conflicted with the facts to which he admitted at his plea hearing. As this court defers to a district court\u2019s assessment of credibility, the district court\u2019s finding that Gunter was not credible at sentencing will not be disturbed. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>195 F.3d 258, 264-65 (6th Cir.1999). Additionally, the facts adduced at the plea hearing did not merit a mitigating role adjustment. At the plea hearing, Gunter confirmed that his roles in the conspiracy were that of cocaine processor, distributor, and facilitator, that he had received and pressed cocaine at his own home, that he processed a total of 48 kilograms over three years, that he and a co-conspirator had purchased a press used at the co-conspirator\u2019s house, and that he had rented vehicles so that his co-conspirators could travel to purchase cocaine and conduct business. Based on these facts, Gunter was not plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the offense. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.4). Moreover, he was only held accountable for the amount of cocaine he processed for purposes of determining his base offense level. Thus, he is not entitled to a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Salgado, </em>250 F.3d 438, 458 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
