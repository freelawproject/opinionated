Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Kimbrell argues that he alleged facts sufficient to support his claims of deliberate indifference, <em>i.e., </em>that each de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>fendant was aware of the importance of Kimbrell taking as prescribed his medication for his cardiac condition but deliberately disregarded that need.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The district court dismissed Kimbrell\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous upon determining that, even after answering the district court\u2019s questionnaire, he failed to allege specific instances supporting his claims. Our review of the record reveals either that (1) the grievances and documents attached to Kimbrell\u2019s complaint stated specific instances to support his deliberate-indifference claims or (2) Kimbrell might be able to allege specific instances of deliberate indifference if provided with certain prison records. <em>See Parker v. Fort Worth Police Dept., </em>980 F.2d 1023, 1026 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 793 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>see also Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). A review of the record also reveals that Kimbrell may be able sufficiently to allege valid 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims with respect to his other claims. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 353 (5th Cir.1999). Kimbrell should be given an opportunity to further develop his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Kimbrell\u2019s motion to proceed IFF is GRANTED. The district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith is VACATED. The dismissal of Kimbrell\u2019s complaint as frivolous is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
