I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 301-04 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b617-12\">PER CURIAM.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Libay Fanta Woldeyes (Woldeyes) seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s (BIA) summary affirmance of an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of Wol-deyes\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). Woldeyes also contends that the BIA violated his right to due process by summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2001). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-20\">We review factual findings of the BIA to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We may reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only when \u201cthe evidence is \u2018so compelling that no reasonable factfin-der could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, as the BIA did here, we review the IJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-21\">Woldeyes alleged that, in retaliation for his medical papers that criticize Ethiopia\u2019s approach to the AIDS epidemic, he was subjected to psychological torture for 48 hours in a dark room with poor sanitary conditions and provided with only bread and water. He alleges he was questioned in a similar fashion on three other occasions. There is no evidence of physical abuse. Finally, he alleges that two other doctors were taken for questioning and have not been seen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-22\">Based on these facts, we cannot say that \u201cno reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brief detentions similar to Woldeyes\u2019 have been found not to establish persecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Woldeyes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>provided no evidence corroborating his testimony, which was contradictory at times, that others similar to him were persecuted. There is no evidence of systematic persecution by the government of medical professionals. Accordingly, Woldeyes\u2019s petition for review of the denial of asylum and protection under the CAT is denied because the Id\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Woldeyes contends that the Id\u2019s order should be reversed because the BIA gave no reasons for denying Woldeyes\u2019s request for withholding of deportation. Eligibility for withholding of deportation requires proof of a higher objective likelihood that one would be persecuted than is required to establish one\u2019s eligibility for asylum. Consequently, the alien\u2019s inability to establish that he is entitled to asylum necessarily results in his inability to demonstrate that he is entitled to withholding of deportation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of the Id\u2019s findings regarding asylum, therefore, there was no need for the Id to state reasons for the denial of Woldeyes\u2019s request for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Finally, Woldeyes contends that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the Id\u2019s decision by a single Board member pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2001) violated his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This contention lacks merit. The BIA decided Woldeyes\u2019s appeal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (2003), which authorizes a single Board member to issue a brief order affirming, modifying, or remanding the Id\u2019s decision. Insofar as the BIA\u2019s opinion relies on the reasons set forth in the Id\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the Id\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Woldeyes was provided due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
