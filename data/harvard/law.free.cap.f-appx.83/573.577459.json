Daniels appeals her sentence of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">Daniels asserts the district court erred in its failure to award her an adjustment for a mitigating role in the offense, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2002). A defendant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that she had a mitigating role in the offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999). A defendant may receive a four-level reduction for being a minimal participant if she is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(a), comment, (n.4). This level of culpability is shown by the defendant\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>of the activities of others....\u201d <em>Id. </em>A two-level reduction may be made when a defendant is a minor participant, that is, one who \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5). The \u201ccritical inquiry is thus not just whether the defendant has done fewer \u2018bad acts\u2019 than his codefen-dants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 646 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted). Role adjustments are determined on the basis of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Fells, </em>920 F.2d 1179, 1183-84 (4th Cir.1990). The district court\u2019s determination concerning the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). The district court found Daniels was not entitled to a mitigating role adjustment because she was involved in handling heroin, bundled money from drug proceeds, knew she was living among drugs and guns, paid rent for a residence where drugs were manufactured with her acquiescence and large quantities of drugs were stored in her bedroom. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Daniels was not a minimal or minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Daniels also contends that it was error when the Probation Officer first recommended an adjustment for a mitigating role and then revised the presentence report after Daniels\u2019 objections pointed out that the base offense level was properly reduced to thirty, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3). The district court, however, was not bound by the Probation Officer\u2019s recommendation in the presentence report. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>895 F.2d 932, 936 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Daniels\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
