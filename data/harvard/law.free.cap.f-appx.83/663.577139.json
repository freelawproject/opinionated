R. Crv. P. 12(b)(1) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Because the relief Thomas seeks is. available under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>she is subject to its exhaustion requirement. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(1); <em>Gardner v. School Bd. Caddo Parish, </em>958 F.2d 108, 112 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Thomas\u2019 argument that Conroe Independent School District\u2019s (CISD\u2019s) alleged violation of the \u201cstay-put\u201d provision of IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j), is a basis for bypassing the exhaustion requirement is without merit, as there was no administrative or judicial proceeding pending when the alleged stay-put violation occurred. The stay-put provision is therefore inapplicable. Thomas\u2019 argument that the district court should have issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants\u2019 changing Shelby\u2019s educational placement and/or services in violation of IDEA safeguards does not address the exhaustion requirement and is therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-18\">Thomas has failed to demonstrate error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of her case without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. That dismissal is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-19\">CISD\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal and for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-20\">AFFIRMED. MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
