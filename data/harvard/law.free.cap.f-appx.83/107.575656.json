This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, Young filed an action against Michigan Department of Corrections Officials Bill Martin, Bruce Curtis, and Dan Bolden. Young alleged that prison staff: (1) violated his Eighth Amendment rights by using excessive force against him; and (2) violated his First Amendment rights by interfering with his incoming and outgoing mail. Young requested a transfer to another prison. The district court granted Young in forma pauperis status, screened the complaint, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Although Young invoked 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the court construed the action as a civil rights case because Young\u2019s claims concerned the conditions of his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">On appeal, Young argues that: (1) he did exhaust his administrative remedies; and (2) he is entitled to habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 and <em>Coffin v. Reichard, </em>143 F.2d 443 (6th Cir.1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. <em>Burton v. Jones, </em>321 F.3d 569, 573 (6th Cir.2003). The Prison Litigation Reform Act requires prisoners bringing actions concerning prison conditions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or other federal law to exhaust all available administrative remedies before suing in federal court. When a prisoner fails to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing a civil rights complaint, dismissal of the complaint is appropriate. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c); <em>White v. McGinnis, </em>131 F.3d 593, 595 (6th Cir.1997) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Young\u2019s complaint. Young failed to allege or show that he exhausted his administrative remedies by raising his claims through the prison\u2019s grievance procedure. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). His complaint makes passing reference to a grievance he filed concerning his First Amendment claim, and also mentions a complaint he sent to the state police, the Justice Department, and an attorney. This falls far short of describing with specificity the administrative proceeding and its outcome. <em>See Knuckles El v. Toombs, </em>215 F.3d 640, 642 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Young\u2019s argument that the documents he attached to his notice of appeal show that he exhausted his remedies is without merit. Young was required to attach proof of exhaustion to his complaint, not in a later pleading or on appeal. <em>See Baxter v. Rose, </em>305 F.3d 486, 488-89 (6th Cir. 2002). If he has exhausted his administrative remedies, he may refile his complaint and plead exhaustion, assuming that the statute of limitations has not expired. <em>See id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Finally, Young\u2019s argument that he is entitled to habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 and <em>Coffin </em>is also without merit. It is clear under current law that a prisoner complaining about the conditions of his confinement should bring suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e.g., Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 498-99, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (drawing distinction between prisoner civil rights suits challenging conditions of confinement under \u00a7 1983 and habeas actions challenging the fact or duration of the confinement).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
