We find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Tadesse failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Huarman-Cornelio v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992). Tadesse\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel claim is pending before the Board in a motion to reopen and reconsider, and we decline to address its merits before the Board has disposed of the motion to reopen. <em>See Stewart v. U.S. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 596 (4th Cir.1999), <em>Figeroa v. U.S. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 77 n. 1 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We grant Tadesse\u2019s motion for leave to file an attachment to her reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
