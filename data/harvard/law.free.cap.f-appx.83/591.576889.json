McKinley, federal inmate # 08043-035, appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. McKinley pleaded guilty to a charge of felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. The sentence was ordered to run consecutively to McKinley\u2019s 15-year sentence for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-30\">McKinley asserts that he was entitled to credit towards his federal sentence for time served from June 5, 1991, to October 14,1992. He argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 authorized credit against his federal sentence because the armed robbery was taken into account in the computation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>offense level in the felon in possession case. He argues that the Bureau Of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) lacks authority to issue credit against his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998). The Attorney General, through the BOP, determines what credit, if any, will be awarded to a prisoner for time spent in custody prior to the commencement of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Time spent by a prisoner in federal custody for the purpose of appearing in federal court via a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum is not counted towards the federal sentence if that time was credited towards his state sentence. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>753 F.2d 455, 456 (5th Cir.1985). McKinley is not entitled to the credit that he seeks because the time was credited against his state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>Vignera v. Attorney General, </em>455 F.2d 637, 638 (5th Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">McKinley\u2019s argument under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 that his federal sentence should have been ordered to run concurrently concerns an alleged error that occurred at sentencing and does not arise under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
