In sentencing Gillette, the district court counted a similar offense committed in April 2001, seven months before the instant offense, as a \u201cprior sentence,\u201d thereby increasing Gillette\u2019s base offense level and placing him in criminal history category III. This rendered Gillette ineligible for \u201csafety valve\u201d relief, resulting in a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. See United States v. Garcia, </em>323 F.3d 1161, 1164 (9th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Brickey, </em>289 F.3d 1144, 1153 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that court\u2019s conclusion that prior conviction may be used for purposes of sentencing enhancement is reviewed <em>de novo). </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-25\">Gillette argues that the district court erred by counting his April 2001 offense as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>a \u201cprior sentence\u201d instead of as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under Sentencing Guideline section 1B1.3. Under Chapter 4 of the sentencing guidelines, a prior sentence scores for criminal history purposes, while relevant conduct does not. 18 U.S.C. appx. \u00a7 4A1.2. \u201cPrior sentence\u201d is defined to include \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contende-re, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. appx. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). As here applicable, \u201crelevant conduct\u201d is defined as \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. appx. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Gillette argues that his April 2001 offense is properly characterized as relevant conduct because it and the instant offense occurred only seven months apart and both involved the same drug traffickers, the same goal, and the same modus oper-andi. However, section lB1.3\u2019s application note 8 makes clear that Gillette\u2019s earlier offense may not be counted as relevant conduct to the instant offense because it was separated by an intervening sentence. As note 8 explains, \u201c[fjor the purposes of subsection (a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. appx. \u00a7 1B1.3 n. 8. Gillette pled guilty and was sentenced to 110 days and three years summary probation in California state court for possession of marijuana for the April 2001 offense. It was after his release from that sentence, that Gillette was apprehended and charged in the instant offense. Because Gillette\u2019s instant offense occurred after he was sentenced for his April offense, section lB1.3(a)(2) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">There is no contradiction between note 8 and section 4A1.2(a)(l) for two reasons: First, note 8 pertains only to conduct that is relevant under section lB1.3(a)(2), not conduct that is relevant under section lB1.3(a)(l). So all conduct relevant under section IB 1.3(a)(1) remains covered by section 4A1.2(a)(l). Second, note 8 precludes counting conduct as relevant where the sentence is imposed not just before the current <em>sentence, </em>the situation addressed by section 4A1.2(a)(l), but before the current offense was committed. Note 8 therefore leaves section 4A1.2(a)(l) applicable to sentences imposed prior to the current one but after the commencement of the conduct giving rise to the current sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Because we find that section lB1.3(a)(2) does not apply, the district court did not err in counting Gillette\u2019s April 2001 offense as a prior sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the 120 month sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b894-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
