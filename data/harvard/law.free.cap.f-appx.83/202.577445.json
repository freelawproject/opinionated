We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-24\">Bert relies on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in his contention that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence based on a prior conviction not charged in an indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. However, as Bert concedes, we rejected the same argument in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zapeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-25\">Bert also contends that the district court erred in imposing ten-year periods of supervised release for counts two and three. He contends that the required \u201cterm of supervised release of at least 6 years\u201d for count two, and \u201cat least 8 years\u201d for count three, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), are limited by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b), which reads: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>term of supervised release imposed shall not be less than any statutorily required term of supervised release.\u201d Bert contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b) only permits imposition of the shortest possible terms allowable for counts two and three under \u00a7 841(b)(1). However, the \u201cstatutorily required term\u201d is \u201cat least 6 years\u201d for count two and \u201cat least 8 years\u201d for count three. We will not read U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b) in a way that removes the words \u201cat least\u201d from \u00a7 841(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>112 F.3d 395, 398 (9th Cir.1997) (adopting <em>United States v. Eng, </em>14 F.3d 165, 172-73 (2d Cir.1994), to hold that the required supervised release term of \u201cat least three years\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) was not limited to <em>only </em>three years by the general maximum term of supervised release imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b232-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
