Both the Pem-America and Sunham products are made of velvet and plain cotton fabric, and present floral motifs on sage green velvet blocks that are divided by ivory \u201cground\u201d cloth and surrounded by ivory borders decorated with floral patterns. Both also apply a technique known as \u201ctack-down\u201d embroidery, in which wide embroidery ribbon is sewn to, rather than through, the fabric. The district court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Sunham to cease selling and distributing the Sunham products, and to recall these products from the inventory of the retailers to which they had already been distributed. Sunham now appeals this injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, and \u201c[t]hat court abuses its discretion only if it applies an incorrect legal standard, bases the preliminary injunction on a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or issues an injunction that contains an error in its form or substance.\u201d <em>Fun-Damental Too, Ltd. v. Gemmy Indus. Corp., </em>111 F.3d 993, 999 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cTo obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show (1) irreparable harm and (2) either (a) that it is likely to succeed on the merits or (b) sufficiently serious questions regarding the merits of the claim to make them fairly litigable, with the balance of hardship tipping decidedly in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 998-99 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Pem-America\u2019s certificate of copyright registration generates a presumption that the copyright is valid. <em>Boisson v. Banian Ltd., </em>273 F.3d 262, 267 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)). It also creates a presumption that all of the facts stated in the registration are true, <em>hangman Fabrics v. Graff Californiawear, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 106, 111 (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)), <em>amended by </em>169 F.3d 782 (2d Cir.1998). Pem-America concedes that Velvet Garden was developed from a design provided to it by Best Eastern Home Textile Co., Ltd. (\u201cBest Eastern\u201d). The parties dispute whether this earlier design was a \u201cwork-for-hire,\u201d but the issue is irrelevant: Pem-America offered into evidence a contract with Best Eastern that transferred to Pem-America all rights, title, and interest, including copyrights, in all works relating to Velvet Garden. Best Eastern does not dispute this transfer, and Sunham cannot raise such a dispute in a third-party infringement action. <em>See Eden Toys, Inc. v. Florelee Undergarment Co., Inc., </em>697 F.2d 27, 36 (2d Cir.1982) (superseded on other grounds by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)). As the record stands before us, we therefore find that Pem-America has \u201cmade a sufficient <em>prima facie </em>showing that it owns the copyright to support the preliminary injunction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Merkos L\u2019inyo-nei Chinuch, Inc. v. Otsar Sifrei Lubav-itch, Inc., </em>312 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">A prima facie case of infringement can be made out if a plaintiff establishes (1) that the work in question was \u201cactually copied,\u201d and (2) that there was \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d between the protected expression and the alleged infringing work. <em>Tufenkian Import/Export Ventures, Inc. v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., </em>338 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2003). In the instant case, the \u201cactual copying\u201d requirement is met by undisputed evidence that Sunham had a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of access to the Velvet Garden quilt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Gaste v. Kaiserman, </em>863 F.2d 1061, 1066 (2d Cir.1988). Because Velvet Garden is derivative of the \u201cbasic block\u201d quilt design which has long been in the public domain,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d is conducted from the hypothetical perspective of a \u201cmore discerning\u201d observer. <em>Boisson, </em>273 F.3d at 272. This observer is concerned only with those elements that \u201cprovide copyrightability to the allegedly infringed compilation,\u201d <em>Key Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Chinatown Today Publ\u2019g Enters., Inc., </em>945 F.2d 509, 514 (2d Cir.1991), but is guided, finally, by the \u201ctotal concept and feel\u201d of the compared works. <em>Boisson, </em>273 F.3d at 272 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court conducted the appropriate \u201cmore discerning observer\u201d test, factoring out the block pattern and finding substantial similarities between the color choices, floral motifs, and the tack-down embroidery of the quilts in question. Given the \u201cenormous amount of sameness\u201d between the quilts, <em>id. </em>at 274, this finding was in no way an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Pem-Ameriea has thus shown a likelihood of success on the merits, and \u201cgenerally when a copyright plaintiff makes out a <em>prima facie </em>showing of infringement, irreparable harm may be presumed.\u201d <em>AB-KCO Music, Inc. v. Stellar Records, Inc., </em>96 F.3d 60, 64 (2d Cir.1996) (citations omitted). Furthermore, for good measure, the balance of hardships tips in favor of Pem-America. We have considered all of the defendant\u2019s claims and find them merit-less. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction in favor of Pem-Ameriea.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-15\">. The defendant attempts to construe the recall order issued in this case as a \"mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>injunction,\" and take advantage of the higher standard that applies to such injunctions. <em>See Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 27, 34-35 (2d Cir. 1995). We have, however, upheld preliminary injunctions including recall orders under a plain preliminary injunction analysis before, <em>see Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc., </em>191 F.3d 208, 212 (2d Cir.1999), and see no reason to apply a mandatory injunction analysis in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. Sunham contends that Best Eastern did not create the underlying designs, and that these designs have long been in the public domain. Pem-America, however, is \"entitled to a statutory presumption of the validity of the facts stated in its copyright registration.\u201d <em>Langman Fabrics, </em>160 F.3d at 111. Pem-America's copyright certificate states that Velvet Garden is derivative only of a \"basic block design,\u201d and Sunham has not met its burden to disprove this.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Sunham also contends that the district court abused its discretion when it disbelieved</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">the testimony of a former Pem-America employee who claimed to be the actual creator of the Velvet Garden design. The district court cited specific reasons for discrediting this testimony, including that the employee harbored hostility against Pem-America and had substantial interest concerning the subject of her testimony. The defendant's claim therefore is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-12\">. The district court also was within its authority to disbelieve the defendant's proffered evidence of \"independent creation,\u201d <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>199 F.3d 74, 77 (2d Cir.1999), because the products are highly similar, and Sunham failed to offer adequate explanations for differences between its draft designs and the final Sunham products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b401-13\">. The defendant claims that Velvet Garden is \"derivative\u201d of the underlying Best Eastern designs, but because the district court was within its authority to conclude that Pem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>America actually held the copyright to those preliminary designs, the work cannot properly be considered \"derivative\u201d of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
