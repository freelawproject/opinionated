At sentencing, the court departed downward from a total offense level of 30 to an offense level of 10 based on Peterson\u2019s family responsibilities, his \u201cbackground and naive status,\u201d and the fact that Peterson would not likely reoffend. The court then sentenced Peterson to 3 years probation with the condition that he serve 6 months in home confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-27\">On appeal, the government argues that the district court erred in granting a downward departure and that the court abused its discretion in granting a 20-offense-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-28\">After careful de novo review of the record, we conclude that the district court erred in granting Mr. Peterson a downward departure. <em>See </em>PROTECT Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(d), 117 Stat. 650, 670 (2003) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Gonzales-Ortega, </em>346 F.3d 800 (8th Cir. Oct.10, 2003) (PROTECT Act standard of review applies to defendant\u2019s pending appeal even though defendant was sentenced before Act became law). First, the district court erred in relying on the low likelihood that Mr. Peterson would reoffend as a basis for departure. <em>Cf. United States v. Wong, </em>127 F.3d 725, 728 (8th Cir.1997) (whether length of sentence imposed by Guidelines was necessary to prevent future criminal activity was factor already taken into account by Guidelines, and thus district court\u2019s belief that length of sentence was unnecessary could not justify departure from Guidelines range). The district court also erred in granting Mr. Peterson a downward departure based on family responsibility and susceptibility to abuse in prison because the departure was not justified by the facts of this case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6 (family ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether sentence should be outside applicable Guidelines range); <em>cf. United States v. Pereira, </em>272 F.3d 76, 80-83 (1st Cir.2001) (district court must find that defendant is irreplaceable before granting downward departure under Guidelines based on discouraged factor of family obligations); <em>United States v. Drew, </em>131 F.3d 1269, 1271 (8th Cir.1997) (naive defendant\u2019s alleged vulnerability to abuse in prison, based on his status as child pornographer, did not support downward departure from Guidelines, given defendant\u2019s average size and good health); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>87 F.3d 1224,1225-26 (11th Cir.1996) (5-level downward departure was not warranted where defendant was primary caretaker of parent with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases; defendant established nothing more than that imposition of prison sentences normally disrupts family relationships); <em>United States v. Maddox, </em>48 F.3d 791, 797-98 n. 10 (4th Cir.1995) (that defendant was found to be easily led, susceptible to misuse by others, and meek and cautious in demeanor, and that he possessed borderline intelligence and suffered from dependent personality disorder, did not justify downward departure from Sentencing Guidelines on theory of extreme vulnerability to victimization in prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
