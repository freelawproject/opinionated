The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">In May 2002, Holt pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiring to distribute marijuana and marijuana distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1). Further, pursuant to a written plea agreement, Holt pleaded guilty to possessing firearms as an unlawful user of a controlled substance in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3). The district court sentenced him to concurrent 30-month terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Holt has filed timely notices of appeal, arguing that the district court erred when it enhanced his offense level for possessing weapons and ammunition in connection with another felony offense, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly enhanced Holt\u2019s offense level. This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a sentencing decision for clear error and gives due deference to the district court\u2019s application of a sentencing guideline to a factual situation. <em>United States v. Ennenga, </em>263 F.3d 499, 502 (6th Cir.2001). Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) provides that a defendant\u2019s base offense level should be enhanced by 4 levels \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d In interpreting the \u201cin connection with\u201d clause of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), this court has adopted a \u201cfortress theory\u201d which concludes that a sufficient connection is established \u201cif it reasonably appears that the firearms found on the premises controlled or owned by a defendant and in his actual or constructive possession are to be used to protect the drugs or otherwise facilitate a drug transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Henry, </em>878 F.2d 937, 944 (6th Cir.1989)); <em>see also United States v. Covert, </em>117 F.3d 940, 948-49 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that the fortress theory still applies to \u00a7 2K2.1). The government has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a nexus between the firearms and the other felony offense. <em>Ennenga, </em>263 F.3d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The government has met its burden in this case. A review of the record reflects that the police executed a search warrant at Holt\u2019s residence. During the search, the police found 2.69 kilograms of marijuana, an unloaded .22-caliber rifle, and a loaded .38-caliber pistol in Holt\u2019s bedroom closet. The police also confiscated various items which they suspected contained marijuana residue, including a triple beam scale, $3,147 in cash, marijuana seeds, rolling paper, and suspected marijuana stalks. Holt was present during the search, and the police discovered $1,350 and five rounds of .38-caliber ammunition in one of his pockets. The police also discovered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>unloaded shotgun in the living room. Moreover, Holt acknowledged that he was \u201cresponsible\u201d for the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">This evidence establishes a sufficient connection between the firearms, ammunition, and the marijuana distribution offense. Holt stored the weapons and the marijuana in the same location, which supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that he intended to use the weapons to protect the marijuana operation or to facilitate drug transactions. Although Holt maintains that he did not have access to the .38-caliber weapon locked in the file cabinet, the police discovered that he possessed five five rounds of ammunition for the weapon. In addition, he clearly had access to the other weapons because they were not locked away. Contrary to Holt\u2019s argument, the government was not required to produce evidence that he actively used the firearms to prove that he possessed the firearms and ammunition \u201cin connection with\u201d the marijuana offense. <em>See United States v. Hardin, </em>248 F.3d 489, 492 (6th Cir.2001). Finally, the district court\u2019s conclusion that a connection existed is supported by Holt\u2019s failure to provide any other reason for having the firearms. <em>En-nenga, </em>263 F.3d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
