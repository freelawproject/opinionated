We deny the certificate of appealability and dismiss Cashwell\u2019s appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. We also find that Cash-well\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is properly characterized as an attempt to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We deny Cashwell authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and, because the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter its order, we vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Cashwell has not satisfied either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Cashwell\u2019s attempted motion for reconsideration, brought pursuant to Rule 60(b), is best characterized as an attempt to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. A prisoner wishing to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion must first gain authorization from the circuit court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(2000). Without such authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear the claims. <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200 (4th Cir.2003). Because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim, we must construe Cashwell\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief on appeal as an application to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. In order to obtain authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a movant must assert claims based on either: (1) a new rule of constitutional law, previously unavailable, made retroactive by the Supreme Court to cases on collateral review; or (2) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) (2000). Cashwell does not satisfy either of these conditions. Therefore, we decline to authorize Cashwell to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We also vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss the motion. <em>Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Cashwell authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, vacate the order of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED; VACATED AND REMANDED; AUTHORIZATION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
