The district court sentenced him to fifty-one months of incarceration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $138,996.61. Mr. Erickson appeals, claiming the restitution order is illegal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">The amount the district court ordered Mr. Erickson to pay derives from the costs borne by the State of Wyoming in its care for the minor victim of Mr. Erickson\u2019s crime. The district court made Mr. Erickson jointly and severally liable for these costs with the other perpetrators of sex crimes against the victim. The district court gave Mr. Erickson seven years and three months to pay the full amount in monthly installments of no less than fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Mr. Erickson\u2019s first allegation as to the illegality of the restitution order is that the government failed to prove the amount of the state\u2019s loss, and the sentencing court failed to make findings as to loss. The court clearly drew from the presentence report in ordering restitution because the amount it ordered Mr. Erickson to pay is identical to the amount recommended there. According to that report, the $138,996.61 includes $59,091.61 already expended by the state for the victim\u2019s care and $105 per day for the cost of future treatment. The report also notes that due to the severity of her psychological damage, the victim will remain a ward of the state until she reaches the age of eighteen. Mr. Erickson lodged no objection to the report. \u201cAbsent such a challenge, the sentencing court can rely on any uncontested facts contained in the presentence report without requiring production of evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Patty, </em>992 F.2d 1045,1051 n. 5 (10th Cir.1993). Consequently, the state was not required to present additional evidence as to the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Mr. Erickson\u2019s quarrel with the district court\u2019s failure to make specific findings is meritless because \u201cthe sentencing court need not make specific factual findings unless the restitution amount is disputed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gabriele, </em>24 F.3d 68, 72 (10th Cir.1994) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)). Mr. Erickson never objected to paying restitution for the costs the state had already expended on the victim\u2019s behalf, so the court\u2019s order as to that amount will only be reversed for plain error. <em>United States v. Herndon, </em>982 F.2d 1411, 1420 (10th Cir.1992). He did object to the \u201camount over and above that already incurred by the state.\u201d Sent. Tr. at 68. This court reviews \u201cthe amount of the restitution order for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Rogat, </em>924 F.2d 983, 985 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">The presentence report adopted by the court indicated the victim would be in the state\u2019s care until the age of majority. At the sentencing hearing, the district court found \u201c[t]he impairment of this child\u2019s intellectual, psychological, emotional and behavioral functioning is unquestioned and severe beyond any that I have seen as a sentencing judge.... Based on the testimony of [psychologists attending the victim], the Court is satisfied, beyond any possible doubt, that this child\u2019s condition bespeaks severe sexual and physical abuse which will have long-lasting impact.\u201d Sent. Tr. at 55. Ordering Mr. Erickson to pay costs already expended to treat this severe trauma was not error, much less plain error. Moreover, we cannot hold that including in its restitution order the costs of the victim\u2019s uncontested long-term care needs was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">Mr. Erickson also asserts his restitution order is illegal because it includes losses attributable to other defendants. He raises this argument for the first time on appeal, so we review it for plain error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number><em>Herndon, </em>982 F.2d at 1420. We first note the statute under which Mr. Erickson received his restitution sentence states that \u201c[i]f the court finds that more than 1 defendant has contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each defendant liable for payment of the full amount of restitution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(h). In addition, Dr. Lindberg, who treated the victim, testified at Mr. Erickson\u2019s sentencing hearing that the severe, collaborative abuse of this child was cumulative in effect and could not be apportioned to individual perpetrators of crimes against her. <em>See </em>Sent. Tr. at 29-32. In relation to Mr. Erickson\u2019s crimes, the district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-4\">It is no defense for this defendant to say there were other partners; that there were other people who are complicit. He knowingly preyed upon this child, exacerbating the extent of her victimization. He knew that others were abusing her; and he knew some of the manner and means by which they were accomplishing this abuse. He used that for his own purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 55-56. The district court did not commit plain error in making Mr. Erickson jointly and severally liable for the full cost of this victim\u2019s treatment and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Finally, Mr. Erickson argues \u201cthe district court\u2019s failure to make any inquiry or finding regarding his financial condition mandates reversal.\u201d Once again, Mr. Erickson did not make this argument to the district court, so our review is for plain error. The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA) mandates that a court \u201corder [restitution paid] in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). This court has previously addressed the same claim brought by a defendant who pleaded guilty to the same crime as Mr. Erickson. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>183 F.3d 1175, 1178-79 (10th Cir.1999). We held then and reiterate now that \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(A)(i) of the MVRA \u201crequires federal district courts to order restitution to the victim of [a crime of violence] regardless of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>183 F.3d at 1179. The district court need not make findings concerning a matter it has been instructed not to consider. Mr. Erickson has not demonstrated plain error as to the district court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1028-10\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
