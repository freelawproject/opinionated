The BIA affirmed a decision of the IJ that both denied Zeng\u2019s application for asylum in the exercise of its discretion, and yet granted her application for withholding of removal, on the basis of her claim that she had been persecuted by the Chinese government in 1991 for violating the \u201cOne Child Per Family\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">Only final orders of removal are subject to direct review in the Courts of Appeals under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). <em>Lopez-Ruiz v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 886, 887 (9th Cir. 2002). Because Zeng was granted withholding of removal, she is not subject to a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d We therefore deny her petition for review for lack of jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">Because we lack jurisdiction in this matter, we do not reach Zeng\u2019s claims that the BIA abused its discretion by considering improper factors in denying Zeng\u2019s application for asylum. The issues raised in this petition for review are nevertheless subject to later judicial review, in the event a final order of removal is ever issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-22\">PETITION DENIED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b294-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
