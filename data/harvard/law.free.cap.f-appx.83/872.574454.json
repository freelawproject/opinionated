We affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Peralta-Romero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and its judgment resentencing Peralta-Romero to forty-six months in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The government argues that Peralta-Romero\u2019s failure to raise a claim under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>on direct review proeedurally defaulted the claim. The claim was not proeedurally defaulted. <em>See English v. United States, </em>42 F.3d 473, 477-478 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We have held that the sentencing range for a defendant found guilty of a crime involving an unspecified amount of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846 is zero to five years pursuant to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) and that exposure to the imposition of five to forty years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) amounts to <em>Apprendi </em>error. <em>United States v. Velasco-Heredia, </em>319 F.3d 1080, 1085 (9th Cir.2003). The district court noted that Peralta-Romero\u2019s co-defendant was convicted under essentially the same circumstances as PeraltaRomero, except that the co-defendant was resentenced in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>The sentencing range for Peralta-Romero\u2019s co-defendant was thirty-seven to forty-six months. Because Peralta-Romero was sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), rather than \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), he received a sentence of sixty months. This error was harmful. The district court properly granted Peralta-Romero\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to resentence on the basis of the <em>Apprendi </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The government contends that the district court does not possess the inherent power to grant a new sentencing hearing. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a prisoner can move the sentencing court to set aside or correct a sentence which \u201cwas imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or ... in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d After the district court determined that PeraltaRomero\u2019s motion successfully met \u00a7 2255\u2019s standards the district court\u2019s inherent authority to sentence was broad and flexible. <em>See United States v. Handa, </em>122 F.3d 690, 691 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment reducing Peralta-Romero\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b903-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-25\">.
