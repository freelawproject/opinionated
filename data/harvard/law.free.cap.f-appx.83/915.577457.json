Gonzalez-Garcia argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his sentence was illegal under the Sentencing Guidelines. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Gonzalez-Garcia contends that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to argue at sentencing the applicability of <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) and <em>United States v. Parker, </em>5 F.3d 1322 (9th Cir. 1993). <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Parker </em>both involved interpretations of the sentencing enhancement provisions of \u00a7 1402 of Subtitle I (the Career Criminals Amendment Act of 1986) (\u201cCCAA\u201d) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). In <em>Taylor, </em>the Supreme Court held that the term \u201cburglary\u201d as it is used under the CCAA, incorporates a generic definition of the crime of burglary, not one dependent on an individual state\u2019s statutory definition. 495 U.S. at 598. In <em>Parker, </em>we addressed the limited question under the CCAA whether a court may resort to the charging papers alone in determining whether a prior conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for enhancement purposes. 5 F.3d at 1325-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">By contrast, Gonzalez-Garcia was convicted for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). Although we eventually held that <em>Taylor* </em>s generic burglary definition should also be applied to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) of the INA, we did not do so for approximately nine months after Gonzalez-Garcia\u2019s sentencing. <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2000). Counsel\u2019s decision not to raise an argument based on <em>Taylor </em>or <em>Parker, </em>neither of which was controlling, was not objectively unreasonable. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see also Summerlin v. Stewart, </em>341 F.3d 1082, 1094 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cIn assessing an attorney\u2019s performance, a reviewing court must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689) (internal quotations omitted). Counsel\u2019s chosen strategy was reasonable and effective, resulting in a two-point reduction of Gonzalez-Garcia\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b946-19\">Petitioner waived his claim that his sentence is illegal by fading to raise it on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>direct appeal. <em>United States v. McMullen, </em>98 F.3d 1155,1157 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"agp-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b946-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
