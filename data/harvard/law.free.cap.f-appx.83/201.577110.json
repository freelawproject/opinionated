We review de novo claims of due process violations. <em>Colme-nar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir. 2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">Carrasco-Herrera contends the IJ violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process when it denied a fourth continuance to permit Carrasco-Herrera to review official conviction documents produced twelve days prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-25\">Due process requires that aliens receive a \u201cfull and fair hearing\u201d in the immigration context. <em>Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1998). We will only reverse the BIA\u2019s decision on due process grounds \u201cif the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971 (internal quotations and citations omitted). An alien must also demonstrate that the challenged conduct affected the outcome of the removal proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-26\">Carrasco-Herrera\u2019s contention that the IJ denied him due process of law by refusing to continue the December 22, 1998 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>removal hearing is unpersuasive. The IJ had previously granted three continuances and advised Carrasco-Herrera to be prepared to argue the merits on December 22. Over a period of three and a half months, the IJ conducted four hearings, all of which Carrasco-Herrera attended with counsel. Further, the IJ issued a thorough six-page order explaining that Car-rasco-Herrera is \u201csimply not eligible\u201d for cancellation of removal as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Carrasco-Herrera has failed to demonstrate that he was \u201cprevented from reasonably presenting his case,\u201d or that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different if the IJ had granted a fourth continuance. Consequently, the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of Carrasco-Herrera\u2019s motion for a continuance was not a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b231-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
