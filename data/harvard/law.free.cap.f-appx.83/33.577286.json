Petitioner is currently serving a life sentence for his August 1996, jury trial conviction for first-degree felony murder. For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-20\">In August of 1996, a Michigan trial court jury found Petitioner guilty of first-degree felony murder and home invasion. Petitioner received life imprisonment for the murder conviction and ten to fifteen years for home invasion. Petitioner appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which, in an unpublished opinion, affirmed the conviction and sentence for felony murder and reversed the conviction for home invasion. <em>See People v. Billingslea, </em>No. 199124 (Mich.Ct.App. June 23, 1998) (per curiam). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The Michigan Supreme Court denied Petitioner\u2019s request for leave to appeal the conviction for felony murder, in an unpublished order. <em>See People v. Billingslea, </em>No. 112585 (Mich. Mar.30,1999). Petitioner then petitioned for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which the district court denied on February 7, 2002. (J.A. at 131.) This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The substantive facts are described in the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals. (J.A. at 86-93.) On June 9, 1995, Walter Norfolk, an elderly man, was in his home in Detroit, Michigan. Petitioner\u2019s confession to the police, read into the record at trial, states that Petitioner kicked in Norfolk\u2019s door and entered the residence. An alcoholic, intoxicated at the time, Petitioner entered in search of money to buy more alcohol. When Petitioner came upon Norfolk inside the house, Petitioner \u201csmacked him in the cheek area, and he fell down.\u201d Petitioner then took a shotgun and ammunition from Norfolk\u2019s home and drove away in Norfolk\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The next day, Detroit police stopped Petitioner, subduing him with pepper gas after a struggle. Petitioner received <em>Miranda </em>warnings and did not immediately make any statement to police. Two days later, though, Petitioner confessed to the account of the encounter with Norfolk, as described above. Meanwhile, on June 11, 1995, several of Norfolk\u2019s relatives became concerned about his safety when they noticed that his door was not securely closed. Upon entering the house, Norfolk\u2019s relatives found him lying unconscious. Norfolk remained unconscious in a coma until his death, approximately two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">At trial, the government offered expert testimony indicating that Norfolk died from complications related to his head injury, stating that a blow or blunt force impact to Norfolk\u2019s head caused bleeding and blood clotting in his brain and a normally irreversible coma. The experts testified that the immediate cause of death might have been serious bedsores that developed while Norfolk was in the hospital and may have resulted from his coma, age and circulatory problems, and may have been aggravated by his preexisting heart condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a habeas writ <em>de novo. Lucas v. O\u2019Dea, </em>179 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Fair v. United, States, </em>157 F.3d 427, 430 (6th Cir.1998)); <em>Harpster v. Ohio, </em>128 F.3d 322, 326 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Federal courts evaluate habeas petitions according to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104AL32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (Supp.2002) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d)). <em>Harpster, </em>128 F.3d at 326. AEDPA\u2019s objective is \u201cto prevent federal habeas \u2018retrials\u2019 and to ensure that state-court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 693, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (citations omitted). The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-13\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-14\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tion of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362,120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), a state court\u2019s legal decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>see also McGhee v. Yukins, </em>229 F.3d 506, 510 (6th Cir.2000). An \u201cunreasonable application\u201d occurs when \u201cthe state court identifies the correct legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413,120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Under this standard, a state court decision is not unreasonable simply because the federal court concludes that the decision is erroneous or incorrect. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Rather, the federal court must determine that the state court\u2019s decision applies federal law in an objectively unreasonable manner. <em>Id. </em>at 410-12, 120 S.Ct. 1495; <em>see also McGhee, </em>229 F.3d at 510. Finally, the <em>Williams </em>Court emphasized that \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d refers to \u201cthe holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-court decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412,120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Petitioner raises five arguments: judicial bias, violation of <em>Miranda </em>rights, insufficient evidence, improper jury instructions, and cumulative error. We take these issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Petitioner claims judicial bias. Judicial bias \u201cis a structural error\u201d that, if found on habeas, \u201crequires automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Maurino v. Johnson, </em>210 F.3d 638, 644 (6th Cir.2000). Thus, we do not review judicial bias for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Petitioner points to several instances which, he claims, demonstrate the trial court\u2019s bias. Petitioner points to the following statement, during <em>voir dire:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">COURT: Ms. Madden [defense counsel], nobody can ask any question like that. Who knows. This stuff comes, you make a judgment. Don\u2019t drive people into places they don\u2019t want to go in order for you to make an assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Petitioner points to the trial court\u2019s rejection of some of defense counsel\u2019s objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">COURT: Ms. Madden, everybody can testify to the state of health, because people notice different things. There is nothing wrong with that question. We are not asking him about in-depth disease or fundamental illness. She is asking how the disease seemed to be getting along.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Petitioner cites to points at which the trial judge interrupted defense counsel <em>sua sponte:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-15\">COURT: Ms. Madden?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">MADDEN: Yes, judge. I\u2019ll just ask one question and move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-17\">COURT: I am curious of the materiality of this case. What materiality does it have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-18\">MADDEN: Well, as to the extent of the situation in the house, the ransacking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-19\">COURT: What is the materiality?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-20\">MADDEN: I think it is material, I think I can tie it in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>COURT: I know you wouldn\u2019t be asking these questions if you didn\u2019t think it was material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">MADDEN: I will move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Petitioner claims the trial court engaged in unnecessary dialogue with defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">COURT: That\u2019s why sometimes we take up a whole lot of time on things which are not material to the issue. You say the issue is what his intent was. There are a whole lot of questions which you ask which take up hours and hours and there is no necessity for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">COURT: I am saying some of the things, I think, just simply were not material. I was just trying to determine if that was noi&gt;-I might be mistaken, but I wanted to be sure that\u2019s what you said to the jury, and that he acknowledges that he did attack the deceased. Is that correct or not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">MADDEN: Judge, my concern in terms of my sum of my cross-examination was the implication that the house was gone through and ransacked by [Petitioner], which is inconsistent with his statement, which I think also enables me to argue he hadn\u2019t beaten him and gone through his house. That\u2019s not what we want the jury to think. That\u2019s why I asked him some questions about the house being ransacked, about the two-day time lag, and I think I did limit the questions to what was material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Finally, Petitioner claims the court hindered counsel\u2019s ability to ask certain witnesses allegedly relevant medical questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">MADDEN: But one thing I am concerned about, I wanted the record to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">reflect, that when the medical examiner testified yesterday, I felt the court did unduly restrict my ability to cross-examine. I am quite concerned about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">COURT: In what respect, ma\u2019am? In what respect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">MADDEN: Well, there was testimony from Dr. Cassin who performed the medical exam that I thought was contradictory to the testimony that was given by Dr. Kanluen. When I attempted to cross-examine the doctor on that issue the court would not allow me. And I think it is important, particularly given this case where the cause of death-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-16\">COURT: You see, you know one thing that really presents difficulty, Dr. Kanluen said that you gave, I think the word he used was thrust the examination transcript at him when he came in. He said he had been here only moments; he had not read it. I don\u2019t think anyone, maybe Ms. Carter knew-I didn\u2019t have a clue as to what you were doing. Didn\u2019t have a clue as to what you were doing. If you want to call him back, call him back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-17\">MADDEN: Well, I may do that then if the court will allow me to cross-examine on the issues. I would like the record to reflect I gave him the exam transcript when he came in, some fifteen or twenty minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-18\">MADDEN: Well, I think the court restricted his testimony to the extent he answered that the heart condition would have been the cause of death which was contrary to what he said initially. I think that the court\u2019s interjection at that time was detrimen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tal to [Petitioner].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">An impartial judge is a necessary component of a fair trial. <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955); <em>Turney v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 532, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927). The Supreme Court explained, \u201c[i]t is obvious that under any system of jury trials the influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and that his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 302, 101 S.Ct. 1112, 67 L.Ed.2d 241 n. 20 (1981) (quoting <em>Starr v. United States, </em>153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 38 L.Ed. 841 (1894)). As this Court noted in another recent habeas appeal, when considering judicial bias claims, this Court \u201clooks to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Liteky v. United States </em>to provide the standard.\u201d <em>Alley v. Bell, </em>307 F.3d 380, 386 (6th Cir.2002) (applying <em>Liteky </em>under AEDPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In <em>Liteky, </em>the Court cautioned that a \u201cjudge\u2019s ordinary efforts at courtroom administration-even a stern and short tempered judge\u2019s ordinary efforts at courtroom administration-remain immune.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 556, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). \u201cExpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having been confirmed as federal judges, sometimes display do not establish bias or partiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555-56,114 S.Ct. 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In the present case, the trial judge did display some abruptness toward defense counsel, but the Michigan Court of Appeals found that the trial court\u2019s occasional comments did not permeate the trial. (J.A. at 108.) The Michigan Court of Appeals also noted that the trial court remained courteous and did not confine its criticism to the defense counsel. (J.A. at 108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Additionally, some of the trial court\u2019s interruptions were reasonable. When the trial court called defense counsel\u2019s questions about the ransacking \u201cimmaterial,\u201d the court was correct. Petitioner admitted breaking into the victim\u2019s home, striking him, and stealing things. The question before the jury was Petitioner\u2019s intent when he struck the victim and whether that blow caused his death, not whether someone else broke into the house and beat the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Moreover, the trial court was not unreasonable in limiting defense counsel\u2019s ability to cross-examine the medical examiner about a report he had not read, particularly when the court offered to let the defense recall him later. Although the trial judge stopped defense counsel from claiming in her closing argument that the victim\u2019s bedsores caused his death, Petitioner never offered any evidence that grossly negligent hospital care caused the bedsores. Under Michigan law, any lesser showing would not absolve Petitioner of full responsibility for Norfolk\u2019s death. <em>See People v. Bailey, </em>451 Mich. 657, 549 N.W.2d 325, 334-35 (1996). Defense counsel questioned the victim\u2019s attending physician about bedsores, but failed to produce any evidence of gross negligence. (J.A. at 109.) In contrast, Dr. Ljubisa Jovan Dra-govic, Chief Forensic Pathologist of Oakland County, testified that the victim\u2019s bedsores were a direct result of his being rendered comatose and thus unable to move. (J.A. at 110.) The trial court acted appropriately by limiting inquiry and argument related to the victim\u2019s bedsores.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>None of the judge\u2019s behavior fell beyond the bounds, articulated in <em>Liteky, </em>of a judge\u2019s ordinary efforts at courtroom administration. The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to overturn the conviction on the basis of judicial bias was not contrary to clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Petitioner claims a violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. When examining the arresting officer, the prosecutor elicited testimony indicating that Petitioner chose to remain silent after his arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">PROSECUTOR: Was there anything remarkable about the arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">OFFICER: A struggle ensued. He didn\u2019t wish to be arrested, obviously. We had to struggle for awhile, and I believe my Lieutenant had to spray him with pepper gas to subdue him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">PROSECUTOR: Did you read him his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">OFFICER: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">PROSECUTOR: As a result of reading him his rights, did he say or do anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">OFFICER: Other than I asked him, I read him his rights and asked him if he understood; other than that, nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">No objection to this was raised by Defendant at trial, but none was needed under Michigan law to preserve the issue on appeal. The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated. The district court ruled that Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were violated but that it was harmless error. We agree with the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">In <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), the Supreme Court explained that \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d Petitioner claims that the officer\u2019s testimony violated <em>Doyle. </em>A footnote in <em>Doyle </em>stated that in certain instances, a defendant might open the door for post-arrest silence to be introduced as evidence by the government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-16\">It goes almost without saying that the fact of post-arrest silence could be used by the prosecution to contradict a defendant who testifies to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same version upon arrest. In that situation the fact of earlier silence would not be used to impeach the exculpatory story, but rather to challenge the defendant\u2019s testimony as to his behavior following arrest. Cf. <em>United States v. Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d 1378, 1383 (C.A.5 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 620 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2240. As it is stated in this footnote, the <em>Doyle </em>exception has three requirements: (1) a defendant must have testified (2) to an exculpatory version of events (3) that the defendant told police at the time of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">The present case does not fit within <em>Doyle\u2019s </em>opening-the-door exception. In her opening statement. Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-19\">[A]s we explained to you specifically in voir dire, and the Judge will explain to you, felony murder not only requires a felony and requires a death, but it requires a certain degree of what the Courts commonly call malice; that you intend your act to either cause death or great bodily harm or knowing that it will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-20\">Why is that important? Because if Mr. Billingslea did strike Mr. Norfolk, and he admitted that to the police, and he also discussed his alcohol problem, his remorse, he was cooperative, and unfortunately Mr. Norfolk did languish and ultimately pass.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Also, as the Michigan Court of Appeals stated, \u201cdefense counsel later elicited testimony from a police investigator to the effect that defendant, the day after his arrest, was both cooperative and concerned for the well-being of the victim.\u201d (J.A. at 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Without deciding if the first requirement of <em>Doyle </em>is a <em>per se </em>requirement-i.e., without deciding whether the exception can ever apply in cases, such as the present one, in which the defendant did not testify-we rule that the <em>Doyle </em>exception was inapplicable, on the grounds that none of the requirements were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The second requirement of the <em>Doyle </em>exception is that the defense stated at trial that the defendant presented \u201can exculpatory version of events\u201d to the police. \u201cRemorse\u201d is a mental state. A person may be remorseful without making a statement to the police, as to an exculpatory version of events. A person can be \u201ccooperative\u201d by merely not resisting arrest,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or by behaving in other ways that do not involve telling police an exculpatory version of events. The <em>Doyle </em>exception can be invoked by the government \u201cto contradict a defendant.\u201d 426 U.S. at 620 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2240. Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest silence was not contradictory to counsel\u2019s statements that Petitioner had been remorseful and cooperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The third requirement of the <em>Doyle </em>exception is that a defense \u201cclaims [a defendant] ... told the police the same version upon arrest.\u201d In the present case, the statement elicited by defense counsel from the police investigator was that Petitioner was remorseful and cooperative \u201cthe day after his arrest.\u201d This does not fall within the requirement that the defense introduces evidence that a defendant told the police an exculpatory version of events \u201cupon arrest.\u201d The <em>Doyle </em>exception allows the government \u201cto contradict a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner\u2019s silence immediately following his arrest was not contradictory to evidence relating to Petitioner\u2019s behaving the day after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Although the <em>Doyle </em>exception was inapplicable, the government\u2019s violation of Defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights was not sufficient error to reverse the conviction. The Supreme Court distinguishes between two types of constitutional errors: structural error and trial error. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminate, </em>499 U.S. 279, 306-10, 111 S.Ct. 1246,113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). \u201cA structural error is a defect in the trial mechanism itself, affecting the entire trial process, and is <em>per se </em>prejudicial,\u201d whereas \u201ctrial error occurs during the presentation of the case to the jury, and may be quantitatively assessed in the context of all other evidence.\u201d <em>Yohn v. Love, </em>76 F.3d 508, 522 (3d Cir.1996) (citations omitted). The Supreme Court explained that <em>\u201cDoyle </em>error fits squarely into the category of constitutional violations which we have characterized as trial error.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 629, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). The <em>Brecht </em>rule applies even when the \u201cfederal habeas court is the first to review for harmless error.\u201d <em>Gilliam v. Mitchell, </em>179 F.3d 990, 995 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Under <em>Brecht, </em>a <em>Doyle </em>error only warrants reversal if the mistake \u201chad substantial or injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637,113 S.Ct. 1710. A \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the error influenced the outcome is not enough to warrant relief. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the error af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>fected the verdict. <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). The present case is not distinguishable on its facts from <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (holding that the state\u2019s improper use of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to impeach the defendant\u2019s claim that shooting was accidental did not have substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining jury\u2019s verdict and thus was harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">There is no reasonable probability that Petitioner\u2019s silence following his arrest influenced the jury\u2019s decision. It is highly improbable that Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest silence was a factor in the jury\u2019s decision to find that Defendant had the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for felony murder. Petitioner admitted that he struck Norfolk on the head, knocking him to the floor, and then left Norfolk lying unconscious. Without being aware of his post-silence arrest, the jury easily could have concluded that Defendant knew that his acts would cause death or great bodily harm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is not a reasonable probability that the Fifth Amendment violation affected the verdict. The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s allowing the conviction to stand was not inconsistent with established federal law, and thus does not provide grounds for our reversing the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Under <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (emphasis in original). This Court may not re-weigh evidence or redetermine witness credibility. <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 434, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983). A reviewing court \u201cfaced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume-even if it does not affirmatively appear on the reeord-that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u201d <em>Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 296-97, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Petitioner argues that he did not intend to Mil the victim. Being in superior physical condition to Norfolk, Petitioner claims he could have killed him immediately had he intended to murder. According to Petitioner, he acted only to get money for more liquor and not to do violence. Second, Petitioner claims that Norfolk could have died from some other cause. Norfolk had difficulty walMng and could have fallen on his own.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Even if Petitioner lacked the specific intent for first-degree murder, under Michigan law, \u201c[flelony murder only re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>quires the general intent necessary for second-degree murder, this including the intent to place the victim in a great risk of death or serious bodily injury with a reckless indifference to the probability that death or serious injury will result.\u201d <em>Bil-lingslea, </em>No. 199124, slip op. at 6. <em>See also </em>note 3, <em>supra. </em>The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably conclude that striking the victim, knocking him over, and leaving him unconscious qualifies as behavior that exhibits \u201ca reckless indifference to the probability that death or serious injury will result.\u201d <em>Billingslea, </em>No. 199124, slip op. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Regarding causation, Petitioner conceded that he struck the victim in the head and left him unconscious. It is possible that Norfolk got up, then fell again on his own, but Petitioner offered no evidence to that effect. Even if the defense presented conflicting evidence as to the cause of Norfolk\u2019s coma, this Court would still draw the necessary inference in the jury\u2019s favor. <em>See Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. at 296-97, 112 S.Ct. 2482.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply established Supreme Court precedent to conclude that sufficient evidence supports Petitioner\u2019s felony murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Petitioner contends that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury regarding intervening inadequate medical treatment that allegedly was one of the causes of Norfolk\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">A criminal defendant does not have an absolute right to present evidence on his behalf. <em>Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. 37, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (1996) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 410, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988)) (\u201cThe accused does not have an unfettered right to offer [evidence] that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\u201d). Where the trial court excludes evidence not relevant to any defense accepted by state law, no Sixth Amendment violation occurs. <em>See Wong v. Money, </em>142 F.3d 313, 324 (6th Cir.1998) (finding proper the exclusion of expert testimony regarding diminished capacity when state law did not recognize a diminished capacity defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">The trial court refused a requested jury instruction on the role of negligent medical care. Under Michigan law, medical errors less than gross negligence will not mitigate Petitioner\u2019s responsibility. In <em>Bailey, </em>549 N.W.2d at 334-35, the Michigan Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">In assessing criminal liability for some harm, it is not necessary that the party convicted of a crime be the sole cause of that harm, only that he be a contributory cause that was a substantial factor in producing the harm. The criminal law does not require that there be but one proximate cause of harm found. Quite the contrary, all acts that proximately cause the harm are recognized by the law.... [I]t is only where there is evidence that the medical treatment was grossly negligent that such treatment may be considered as an intervening cause of death, cutting off the defendant\u2019s liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">None of the parties sets forth a definition of \u201cgross negligence\u201d under Michigan law. In the context of manslaughter, <em>People v. Sealy, </em>136 Mich.App. 168, 172-73, 356 N.W.2d 614 (Mich.Ct.App.1984) states that \u201cgross negligence\u201d requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-15\">1. Knowledge of a situation requiring the exercise of ordinary care and diligence to avert injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>2. Ability to avoid the resulting harm by ordinary care and diligence in the use of the means at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">3. The omission to use such care and diligence to avert the threatened danger when to the ordinary mind it must be apparent that the result is likely to prove disastrous to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Elsewhere, the term appears to evade easy definition but clearly constitutes more than simple negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Petitioner did not introduce evidence supporting a theory of the hospital\u2019s gross negligence. Petitioner sought to elicit expert testimony that would have attempted to establish that usually, when head injuries cause death, the death occurs quickly. <em>Billingslea, </em>No. 199124, slip op. at 7. This evidence alone does not appear sufficient to support a finding of simple negligence, much less gross negligence. Furthermore, according to the Michigan Court of Appeals, \u201cEven defendant\u2019s own expert unequivocally stated, \u2018The manner of death in this case was homicide.... Bedsore infection would be one of the complications ... in the realm of the causation of death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner does not contest this statement by the Michigan court, nor does Petitioner bring to our attention any evidence in the record that would suggest gross negligence on the part of the hospital. (Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 31-32.) Consequently, we cannot conclude that the Michigan Supreme Court violated clearly established federal law in refusing to overturn the conviction on the basis of the trial court\u2019s refusing to give the requested jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Petitioner argues that cumulative error provides a basis for relief. Cumulative error is not a basis for granting habeas relief in non-capital cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, in the present case, a state court\u2019s decision to reject a defendant\u2019s cumulative error claim cannot be \u201ccontrary to Supreme Court decision[s] so as to warrant habeas relief under the AEDPA.\u201d <em>Lorraine v. Coyle, </em>291 F.3d at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Based upon the foregoing, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">. Defense counsel is complaining about her ability to attribute the victim's death to infected bedsores, as opposed to Petitioner's assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">. That Petitioner in the present case did in fact resist arrest does not allow testimony that he remained silent after the arrest, to impeach Defense counsel's account of his having been \"cooperative.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">. Under Michigan law, felony murder (Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.316(l)(b)) requires an intent to either kill or cause great bodily harm, or a knowledge that the act will probably cause death or great bodily harm. <em>See, e.g., People v. Herndon, </em>246 Mich.App. 371, 386, 633 N.W.2d 376 (Mich.Ct.App.2001) (\"Second-degree murder is a general intent crime, which mandates proof that the killing was \u2018done with an intent to kill, an intent to inflict great bodily harm, or an intent to create a very high risk of death with the knowledge that the act probably will cause death or great bodily harm.\u2019 Felony-murder is also a general intent crime, requiring evidence of one of the three intents necessary to prove second-degree murder.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\">. Petitioner evidently does not argue that subsequent poor medical care caused Norfolk's death. Even if he had raised this issue, only a showing of gross negligence would shift the blame to medical personnel. <em>See People v. Bailey, </em>451 Mich. 657, 549 N.W.2d 325, 334-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>35 (1996).

Coyle, </em>291 F.3d 416, 447 (6th Cir.2002) (\"[t]he Supreme Court has not held that distinct constitutional claims can be cu-mulated to grant habeas relief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">A different rule applies to capital cases. In <em>DePew v. Anderson, </em>Constitutional errors that</p>\n<p id=\"b73-24\">might have been harmless, taken individually, were cumulated by this Court, leading to a reversal of a death sentence. 311 F.3d 742, 751 (6th Cir.2002) (distinguishing cases in which a death sentence was imposed from other cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
