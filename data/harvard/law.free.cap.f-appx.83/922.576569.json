We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">Perez-Reyes contends that the district court erred by failing to dismiss the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>ment or suppress all evidence seized, including his identity, as a result of his unlawful arrest. Reviewing de novo, we affirm the district court. <em>See United States v. Guzman-Bruno, </em>27 F.3d 420, 421 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s identity need not be suppressed merely because it is discovered as the result of an illegal arrest or search\u201d). We also decline Perez-Reyes\u2019s request that we recommend that the Ninth Circuit reconsider its holding in <em>Guzman-Bruno </em>en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 35 and 40; <em>see also United States v. Wylie, </em>625 F.2d 1371, 1378 n. 10 (9th Cir.1980) (noting \u201cthat en banc hearings are disfavored and generally are only ordered when there is (1) an intracircuit conflict, or (2) a question of exceptional importance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Perez-Reyes also contends that the district court erred by failing to dismiss the petition for revocation of his supervised release based on a lack of jurisdiction because the supervision period had elapsed, and the court\u2019s delay was not reasonably necessary. We review de novo the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>253 F.3d 443, 446 (9th Cir.2001). Because the district court extended the period only to adjudicate pending supervised release revocation issues, we conclude it did not err. <em>See id. </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b952-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
