On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On appeal, counsel argues that the sentence imposed was too harsh, because Lavariego-Diego\u2019s domestic-abuse history-which was the reason the District Court gave for sentencing him at the top of the applicable Guidelines range-was fully accounted for in his criminal history score and in the 16-level increase to his base offense level. This argument fails. Lavariega-Diego\u2019s sentence falls within 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s 20-year maximum, it is within the appropriate Guidelines range, and we will not review the sentence merely because it is at the top of the range. <em>See United States v. Smotherman, </em>326 F.3d 988, 989 (8th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 293, 157 L.Ed.2d 203 (2003) (sentence at top of correct range does not create constitutional infirmity allowing appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. The Honorable Mark W. Bennett, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
