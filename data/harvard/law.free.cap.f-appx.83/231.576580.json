The fact that his hearings were conducted in Armenian rather than Russian does not appear to have violated Mr. Moousaelian\u2019s right to due process. However, a review of the record reveals significant circumstantial evidence of incompetent translation. <em>See Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 778 (9th Cir.2000). The translation difficulties at the hearing before the immigration judge resulted in an inadequate and confusing record. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 598 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cEven when there is no due process violation, faulty or unreliable translations can undermine the evidence on which an adverse credibility determination is based.\u201d). We therefore remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals with instructions to hold a new hearing on the asylum and withholding issues raised by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-21\">PETITION GRANTED.
