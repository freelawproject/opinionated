Singh\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>See Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.2003). Because the BIA summarily affirmed without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for our review. <em>Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 831-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">This court will \u201creview the BIA\u2019s decision \u2018procedural!/ to ensure that the complaining alien has received full and fan-consideration of all circumstances that give rise to his or her claims.\u201d <em>Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotations and citations omitted). This court must affirm the decision \u201cif there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the decision\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Howard v. INS, </em>930 F.2d 432, 434 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-17\">The petitioner argues that the IJ\u2019s opinion improperly relies on <em>Matter of R-, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. 621 (BIA 1992). As noted by the IJ, to show that he has suffered past persecution an alien must do more than simply show physical abuse or civil rights violations by the police. <em>Matter of R-, </em>20 I &amp; N Dec. at 626. Mere \u201charassment\u201d does not amount to persecution for purposes of establishing asylum eligibility. <em>See Bastanipour v. INS, </em>980 F.2d 1129, 1133 (7th Cir.1992). At most, petitioner\u2019s testimony shows that he was harassed by the police because of his suspected involvement with Sikh separatists.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-18\">Finally, the petitioner argues that the IJ erred in not placing the burden of proving the reasonableness of internal relocation within India on the government. Where a petitioner has not shown past persecution, he must show a well-founded fear of future persecution in order to be eligible for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b). A petitioner does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution if he could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii). The petitioner bears the burden of proving that internal relocation would be unreasonable. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(i). However, where \u201ca party seeking asylum demonstrates that a <em>national government </em>is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>\u2018persecutor,\u2019 the burden [shifts to] the INS\u201d to show that internal relocation would be reasonable because the persecution is not country-wide. <em>Abdel-Masieh v. I.N.S., </em>73 F.3d 579, 586-87 (5th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Singh v. Moschorak, </em>53 F.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir.1995) (emphasis added)); <em>codified in </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The petitioner\u2019s uncorroborated claim that the alleged persecution was sponsored by the national government of India is not sufficient to meet his initial burden of \u201cdemonstrating\u201d that the persecution is government sponsored. Aside from this testimony, there is no evidence in the record which suggests that any persecution of Sikhs in Punjab was sponsored by the national government of India. Therefore, the burden of proving that internal relocation is unreasonable remains with the petitioner. The petitioner has not met this burden. In fact, reports offered by petitioner from the Danish Refugee Counsel and the United States Department of State, both conducted in 2000, support the Id\u2019s finding that Sikhs in other parts of India are not subject to persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">For the reasons stated above, the BIA\u2019s summary affirmation of the Id\u2019s decision denying the petitioners application for asylum and withholding of removal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
