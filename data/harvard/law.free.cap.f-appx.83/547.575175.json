He was sentenced to a term of 144 months imprisonment for the bank robbery and a consecutive seven-year sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) offense. The whole sentence was made consecutive to the state sentence for second degree murder that Williams was serving. Williams appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erroneously relied on its having resolved a sentencing issue in Williams\u2019 favor when it decided to impose a sentence at the high end of the guideline range, and erred in making Williams\u2019 sentence consecutive to the state sentence he was serving. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">During the sentencing hearing, the district court granted Williams\u2019 objection to the presentence report concerning the correct enhancement for his use of a firearm during the robbery. The court determined that Williams had brandished the firearm but had not \u201cotherwise used\u201d it; the court thus reduced the recommended six-level enhancement to a five-level enhancement. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2). The court imposed a sentence of 144 months for the bank robbery; the guideline range was 120-150 months. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-17\">I have given you a sentence toward the high end of the guideline range for the reasons that I have indicated: the violent nature of the offense, other facts set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>out in the presentenee report, the fact that the Court could arguably have applied an even higher offense level to your conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Because Williams was already serving a state sentence of at least 114 months imprisonment for a second degree murder that he committed after the bank robbery, the district court had the option of making the federal sentence concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive to the undischarged state sentence. The court decided that a consecutive sentence was a \u201creasonable punishment\u201d under the facts and circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">On appeal, Williams first contends that his sentence for the bank robbery is illegal because the district court relied on the fact that it resolved the firearm enhancement issue in Williams\u2019 favor in deciding to impose a sentence at the high end of the guideline range. Williams made no objection to the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing sentence at the high end of the guideline range at the time sentence was imposed. Therefore, his claim of error is reviewed under the plain error standard. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (unpreserved error may be corrected only if error occurred, that was plain and affects substantial rights, and if failure to correct error would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">This court has held that the district court has \u201calmost limitless discretion\u201d to decide where to impose sentence within a correctly calculated guideline range. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>60 F.3d 1134, 1137 (4th Cir.1995). The court\u2019s discretion is limited only by the requirement that it not impose a sentence in violation of law, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e)(1) (West Supp. 2003), such as a sentence based on race or another \u201cunconstitutional classification.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>60 F.3d at 1137. Williams asserts that the fact that the district court ruled in his favor on the brandishing issue was an improper factor for the court to consider in determining where to impose sentence within the guideline range because it does not fall within any of the categories of factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">We disagree. The district court\u2019s consideration of the fact that it had ruled in Williams\u2019 favor on the firearm enhancement, which it considered a close issue, was well within its obligation to bear in mind the facts and circumstances of the offense when determining the sentence and to impose a sentence that reflected the seriousness of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). Williams has not shown that the court exceeded the bounds of its discretion in doing so. Therefore, we are satisfied that the sentence was not imposed in violation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Williams next argues that the court erred in making the sentence consecutive to his state sentence. Under USSG \u00a7 5G1.3(c), when a defendant is serving an undischarged sentence but (1) the instant offense was not committed while the defendant was serving the undischarged sentence, and (2) the conduct resulting in the undischarged sentence has not been taken into account in determining the offense level for the instant offense, the sentencing court may impose a sentence that is concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive to the undischarged sentence. The court is directed to consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3584 (referencing \u00a7 3553(a)), as well as the type of sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>being served and circumstances related to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Williams contends that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 5G1.3(c) when it imposed a sentence consecutive to the state sentence he was serving for second degree murder. A claim that the district court erred in applying a guideline is a legal issue and is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>200 F.3d 218, 221 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The court explained its decision to impose a consecutive sentence by noting the seriousness of Williams\u2019 conduct during the bank robbery and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">[T]he Court has already given the defendant a year and a half ... more or less than arguably could have been given had the Court adopted the presentence report calculations of the guidelines for count five. And to determine what is a reasonable punishment in this case, Mr. Williams, I have determined that [it] is a reasonable punishment in this case to run your 228-month sentence consecutively to the sentence that you are now serving in the state court. I think that is an appropriate sentence under the facts and circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABd\">Williams argues that the district court erred by considering the same improper factor as before and that his 228-month sentence, made consecutive to his state sentence, is \u201cmanifestly unjust and an abuse of discretion,\u201d in light of his co-defendants\u2019 lighter sentences for the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">As previously discussed, \u00a7 3553(a) does not forbid the district court to consider its own sentencing determinations when deciding what sentence to impose. With the enactment of Guideline Amendment 535, effective November 1, 1995, the district court was given \u201cadditional flexibility\u201d to decide whether the sentence for the instant offense should be concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive to an undischarged sentence so that \u201cthe instruction to the [Sentencing] Commission in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(Z )(1) to provide a reasonable incremental penalty for additional offenses\u201d could be implemented in all situations. USSG App. C at 535. Williams has not demonstrated any error on the part of the district court in the exercise of the considerable discretion afforded it under the guidelines to decide what the \u201creasonable incremental penalty\u201d may be in a given case. Therefore, we conclude that district court did not err in deciding to make the sentence consecutive.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\"> Williams contends that the issue was preserved for review under Fed.R.Crim.P. 51 when his attorney asked for a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. However, his attorney did not suggest below that the sentence imposed was illegal or that the district court relied on an improper factor, as he now contends.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
