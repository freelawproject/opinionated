On July 24,1998, appellee gave birth to a son.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">{\u00b6 2} On November 16, 2000, the parties filed a complaint with the juvenile court for Franklin County, Ohio, for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities of the minor child. On November 17, 2000, the parties entered into an agreed entry wherein they agreed to share custody of the child. Both appellant and appellee were deemed to be legal custodians of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">{\u00b6 3} Approximately five years later, the parties separated. On April 28, 2005, appellant filed a motion in Franklin County requesting a specific companionship schedule with the child. By order filed July 5, 2005, a temporary visitation schedule was established. On January 23, 2007, the case was transferred to Richland County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">{\u00b6 4} On May 21, 2007, appellee filed a declaratory judgment action for a determination on the trial court\u2019s authority to enforce the 2000 agreed entry. Hearings before a magistrate were held on August 27 and September 21, 2007. By decision filed October 9, 2007, the magistrate found that the agreed entry was unenforceable. Appellant filed objections. By judgment entry filed January 3, 2008, the trial court agreed that the agreed entry was unenforceable, finding that it violated appellee\u2019s fundamental right to parental autonomy, failed to find that appellant was a suitable co-custodian, and appellee believed the agreed entry would end if the parties separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-11\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in declaring the agreed entry unenforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cBrenda\u2019s claim that she believed the agreed entry would be unenforceable if she ended her relationship with Mary Joe is not credible and in any event does not constitute a basis for invalidating the agreed entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant claims that the trial court erred in finding that the agreed entry was unenforceable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">{\u00b6 9} On November 16, 2000, appellee filed a complaint for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities of the minor child, wherein she affirmatively alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c1. Petitioner Brenda Sue Morris alleges that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">{\u00b611} \u00ab* =1= *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cb. She is willing and desires to share as co-custodians the legal parenting rights and responsibilities for the minor child with Mary Jo Hawk;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cc. At all times since the conception and birth of the minor child, Mary Jo Hawk has acted as a second parent to him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cd. The parties desire to share as co-custodians the day to day and financial responsibility of parenting and in all ways provide for the minor child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-14\">{\u00b6 15} \u201ce. As the child\u2019s co-custodians, the petitioners or either of them will be able to provide health insurance and other benefits for the minor child in the most economically feasible manner and in a way that reflects the parties\u2019 actual family structure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-15\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cf. She desires to establish shared legal rights and responsibilities for the minor child in a manner that reflects the parties\u2019 actual family structure as co-parents and co-custodians of their child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-16\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cg. All of the foregoing are in the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">{\u00b6 18} In the agreed order filed November 17, 2000, attached to appellant\u2019s brief as Exhibit A, appellee and appellant agreed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-18\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c2. That each Petitioner is willing to and desires to share all parenting rights and responsibilities for the child, and has the financial capacity to provide for the minor child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-19\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c3. As the children\u2019s co-custodian, Mary Jo Hawk will at present be able to provide health insurance for the minor child through her employment at significant savings to the parties, which reflects the parties\u2019 actual family structure and is in the child\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201c5. Both Petitioners agree to accept the legal obligation of support for the minor child, pursuant to RC 2151.23(B)(4), and both Petitioners agree to accept the jurisdiction of this Court at this time in awarding them co-custodial status as to the child, and as to any dispute that may in the future arise between the parties regarding the custody of and companionship with the minor child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c6. This Court has jurisdiction to determine custody of the minor child pursuant to RC 2151.23(A)(2), and to determine support of the minor child pursuant to RC 2151.23(B)(4), and it is in the best interest of the minor child that the custody, visitation, and support rights of the parties and the child be determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, that: Brenda Sue Morris and Mary Jo Hawk shall each be considered legal custodians of the minor child * * *, and Petitioner Mary Jo Hawk is hereby ORDERED to provide health insurance coverage for the minor child for so long as the same is available to her at reasonable cost through her employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">{\u00b6 24} In determining the enforceability of the agreed entry, the trial court, via the magistrate\u2019s decision filed October 9, 2007, found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe prior Judgment Entry does not contain a provision stating that the parties have considered all relevant factors in the best interests of the child, or a judicial determination that the Defendant, as a non-parent, is a \u2018proper person to have the care, training, and education of the child.\u2019 The prior court did not examine the parties regarding the agreement at any time before or after approving the shared custody agreement and order. At the time the agreement was reached the parties believed it was in the best interests of the child, and that the Defendant was a proper person to have the care, training, and education of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">{\u00b6 26} We note that up to and including the time of the filing of the declaratory judgment action, neither party appealed nor challenged the agreed entry. Given the language of the agreed entry cited supra, we find that the doctrine of res judicata applies. Res judicata is defined as \u201c[a] valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u201d <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 653 N.E.2d 226, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">{\u00b6 27} We conclude that a collateral attack on the findings contained in the agreed entry is unavailable as a remedy. Furthermore, the agreed entry contains sufficient findings to affirmatively establish that appellant is a proper person for the care, training, and education of the child. The record in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Franklin County proceedings affirmatively demonstrates that appellee\u2019s consent and voluntary written waiver were not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">{\u00b6 28} Assignment of error I is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant claims that the trial court erred in determining that appellee intended the agreed entry to be in effect only as long as the parties continued their relationship. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">{\u00b6 30} On this issue, the trial court found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe Court finds credible, Plaintiffs assertion that she wanted to convey the status of co-custodian only for so long as the parties remained together, and further that she communicated her intention to Defendant\u2019s attorney who drafted the documents. The Court also finds credible, Plaintiffs testimony that she read the proposed Judgment Entry and believed that it did only convey co legal custody for as long as they remained in a relationship. In fact the Judgment Entry provided \u2018Further, this Order of co-custodial status is made subject to existing and ongoing companionship rights of both Petitioners-Custodians as has been established between each other with each other of the minor child.\u2019 This Court finds that the quoted language is confusing, at best, and caused the Plaintiff to believe that the grant of co custodial status was conditioned upon the ongoing relationship of the parties.\u201d See judgment entry filed January 3, 2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">{\u00b6 32} It is appellant\u2019s position that the agreed entry is clear and unambiguous. The trial court termed the cited provision as \u201cconfusing,\u201d but did not find the provision to be ambiguous. We find that the parol evidence rule precludes the introduction of evidence outside the four corners of the agreed entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cWhere the parties, following negotiations, make mutual promises which thereafter are integrated into an unambiguous written contract, duly signed by them, courts will give effect to the parties\u2019 expressed intentions.* * * Intentions not expressed in the writing are deemed to have no existence and may not be shown by parol evidence.\u201d <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 544 N.E.2d 920.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">{\u00b6 34} The agreed entry specifically states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-13\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c5. Both Petitioners agree to accept the legal obligation of support for the minor child, pursuant to RC 2151.23(B)(4), and both Petitioners agree to accept the jurisdiction of this Court at this time in awarding them co-custodial status as to the child, and <em>as to any dispute that may in the future arise between the parties regarding the custody of and companionship with the minor child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>{\u00b6 36} \u201cThis Court shall have continuing jurisdiction over the custody, companionship, and support of the minor child, if invoked by either Custodian, <em>until such time as the child attains age eighteen, or so long as the child continuously attends any recognized and accredited high school, whichever last occurs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">{\u00b6 37} In reviewing the provisions of the agreed entry, we do not find the agreed entry to be ambiguous. Clearly, the parties contemplated the agreed entry to be in effect until the child finished high school or turned 18, and the trial court would retain jurisdiction to resolve any future disputes. We agree that the cited provision is confusing, as more than likely, \u201cexisting and ongoing companionship rights of both Petitioners-Custodians\u201d refers to their relationship with the child, not each other. While the cited provision may be confusing, it does not deem the agreed entry ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">{\u00b6 38} Based upon the parol evidence rule, the trial court erred in considering appellee\u2019s testimony in determining appellee\u2019s intention to terminate co-custodial status if the parties separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">{\u00b6 39} Assignment of error II is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">{\u00b6 40} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio is hereby reversed, and the matter is remanded to that court to determine appellant\u2019s April 28, 2005 motion requesting a specific companionship schedule with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b881-9\">Hoffman, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b881-10\">Edwards, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b881-11\">Edwards, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALg\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">{\u00b6 41} I agree with the majority that this case should be reversed and remanded for the trial court to address appellant\u2019s motion for a specific companionship schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">{\u00b6 42} But I would also remand this matter to the trial court to dismiss the motion for declaratory judgment as a procedural nullity. <em>In re J.D.F., </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-922, 2008-Ohio-2793, 2008 WL 2350253, appeal not allowed, <em>In re J.D.F., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 1453, 2008-Ohio-6813, 898 N.E.2d 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">{\u00b6 43} Based on the rationale of <em>In re J.D.F., </em>I find that the trial court was without jurisdiction to act on the motion for declaratory judgment. Therefore, the ruling on that motion is a nullity and the motion should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
