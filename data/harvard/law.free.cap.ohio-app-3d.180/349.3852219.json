We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 2} Teresa lives in Madison, Ohio, with her flane\u00e9, Andrew, and their three children, Jillian, born September 19, 2002; Jayden, born July 3, 2005; and Jordan, born March 2, 2007. On Sunday, June 3, 2007, Teresa was nursing Jordan, when she felt an abnormality on the back of his head. Andrew agreed. They speculated that it might be caused by Jordan\u2019s favoring one side of his head as he slept, since Teresa\u2019s maternal nephew had experienced a similar problem. On Monday, June 4, 2007, Teresa met her sister and mother for lunch at a restaurant in Willoughby. Teresa\u2019s sister was concerned by the abnormality at the back of Jordan\u2019s skull. As a result, Teresa immediately took her son to a local pediatrician, who advised her to go to the emergency room at Lake West Hospital. Following an x-ray and CT scan of Jordan\u2019s skull, the Lake West doctors advised Teresa to take Jordan to Rainbow Babies and Children\u2019s Hospital for expert evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 3} At Rainbow, it was determined that Jordan had a skull fracture, a small fracture of the right femur, and multiple rib fractures. Officials at Rainbow contacted the Lake County Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cLCDJFS\u201d), which sent intake worker Gina Gaglione to the hospital. Before going, Ms. Gaglione contacted the Madison Township Police Department, which sent Detective John Doyle and Assistant Chief Glen DelCalzo to join her.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 4} Andrew joined Teresa at Rainbow, and Ms. Gaglione, Det. Doyle, and Assistant Chief DelCalzo questioned them as to possible causes for Jordan\u2019s injuries. They testified that Teresa was cooperative, concerned, and emotionally appropriate, but that Andrew was fidgety and overly emotional, frequently crying, and unable to answer questions. They discovered that Teresa had left Jordan in Andrew\u2019s care for several hours on Saturday, June 3, prior to her noticing the abnormality on Jordan\u2019s skull, and that all three children had been in his sole care for several hours that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 5} Teresa gave several potential explanations for Jordan\u2019s injuries. She noted the possibility that Jillian, his eldest sister, may have jumped on him while he was in his \u201cbouncy chair.\u201d She further noted that her mother, who suffers from mild dementia and who had a stroke disabling her right arm, might have dropped the baby while holding him. Ms. Gaglione and the police officers never inquired about the possibility of injuries caused by Jordan\u2019s difficult delivery. Teresa also told an attending physician that Andrew had been working very hard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>recently and was quite tired. She consequently speculated whether something may have happened while the two were alone the previous weekend. The record reveals that Teresa described Andrew as a \u201crough guy\u201d with a temper. Teresa had also spoken with Andrew about being too rough with Jordan.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 6} Ms. Gaglione had Jordan\u2019s sisters x-rayed for injuries. None were indicated, either by their x-rays or their medical records. With the help of the police, Ms. Gaglione took shelter care of the Savchuk children.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 7} Teresa and Andrew allowed Det. Doyle and Assistant Chief DelCalzo to inspect their home. The officers noted that Teresa and Andrew had taken measures to make the house safe for young children.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 8} On August 16, 2007, LCDJFS filed a complaint seeking to have Jordan adjudicated an abused child and Jillian and Jayden adjudicated dependent children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That same day, the trial court granted LCDJFS temporary custody of the Savchuk children, appointed counsel for Teresa and Andrew, and appointed a guardian ad litem for the children. On August 22, 2007, Teresa moved that Jordan be clinically evaluated by Dr. Michael Levine of the Pediatric Endocrinology Department at the Cleveland Clinic. The state acquiesced, and the evaluation was done. On September 12, 2007, Teresa and Andrew moved to have Dr. Kathy Keller appointed their expert, at state expense. The trial court granted this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 9} The parties exchanged discovery, including witness and exhibit lists on each side. On October 9, 2007, Teresa supplemented her witness and exhibit list with Dr. Patrick Barnes and his report relating to Jordan\u2019s head trauma. Trial commenced on October 10, 2007. On October 12, 2007, the state moved to supplement its witness and exhibit lists with Dr. Levine and his report. Teresa opposed. The trial court excluded Dr. Levine\u2019s report, but allowed his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 10} Trial occurred over several days between October 10, 2007, and October 26, 2007. In addition to Teresa, Ms. Gaglione, Det. Doyle, and Assistant Chief DelCalzo, the parties placed the testimony of five physicians on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Lolita McDavid, a professor of pediatric medicine and Medical Director of Child Advocacy and Protection at Rainbow, testified for the state. She stated that she found that Jordan had a \u201cmildly displaced fracture of the occipital bone with soft tissue swelling noted posterior to the fracture\u201d and \u201cmultiple bilateral rib fractures,\u201d \u201cincluding right fifth and six lateral rib, fourth fifth, sixth lateral rib, and multiple bilateral rib fractures on the fifth and sixth posterior rib.\u201d Dr. McDavid testified that these injuries were consistent with squeezing. She opined that the injuries were sustained at different times. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>did not believe that the skull fracture could be a result of birth trauma, three months after the event. She opined that Jordan\u2019s injuries could not have been caused by his sister jumping on him in his bouncy chair and that there were no signs of bone disease, such as rickets or osteogenesis imperfecta. She considered Jordan\u2019s injuries consistent with child abuse, given the nature of the injuiies and the lack of explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 12} Also testifying for the state was Dr. Carlos Sivit, Director of Pediatric Radiology at Rainbow. Dr. Sivit testified that he reviews between 16,000 and 20,000 x-rays, MRIs, and CT examinations of children each year, of which approximately four or five a month involve child-abuse cases. Dr. Sivit testified that Jordan\u2019s rib injuries were of different dates, due to the callus growth on some of the fractures and the lack of it on others. He testified that the pattern of rib injuries indicated abuse. He further noted a small fracture spotted on Jordan\u2019s right femur, referred to as a distal metaphyseal injury. According to Dr. Sivit\u2019s testimony, such a fracture is highly specific for abuse in that \u201cof all the fractures [seen] in children with varying mechanisms, almost exclusively this fracture is seen only in abused children.\u201d He found no evidence of rickets or other bone disease; rather, Dr. Sivit testified that Jordan\u2019s bones appeared normal as opposed to the \u201cwidened, irregular, and frayed long bones\u201d consistent with rickets. He opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Jordan\u2019s injuries were not caused by an underlying metabolic bone disease. He further opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the injuries were caused by intentional trauma consistent with a squeezing motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 13} The final physician testifying for the state was Dr. Levine, who had examined Jordan on his parents\u2019 motion. Dr. Levine is the Director of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology at the Cleveland Clinic and an expert in metabolic bone diseases. Based upon his extensive evaluation of Jordan, the family history, and examination results, Dr. Levine concluded that Jordan \u201chas none of the features on physical examination that * * * would point toward a diagnosis of either a metabolic bone disease or a bone fragility syndrome such as osteogenesis imperfecta. He has a completely normal biochemical profile related to mineral metabolism and his x-rays show no evidence of a metabolic bone disease or a skeletal dysplasia.\u201d Dr. Levine also concluded, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Jordan does not have any metabolic bone disease, but rather, Jordan has a \u201cnormal skeleton and a normal mineral metabolism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 14} Dr. Levine additionally concluded that there was no evidence of rickets in Jordan. He explained that rickets is a bone disease that causes an abnormality in bone mineralization, meaning that soft tissue is converted into hard tissue because of an inadequate supply of either calcium or phosphorus. Also, the long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>bones become weakened and tender because of a growth plate defect with rickets. However, according to Dr. Levine, Jordan \u201chad none of the clinical features of rickets in a symptomatic phase. His x-rays were not consistent with rickets in June when he first presented for evaluation. Further, Jordan\u2019s biochemical tests, conducted in both June and September, were not consistent with rickets.\u201d In Dr. Levine\u2019s medical opinion, Jordan\u2019s injuries were not caused by bone fragility or rickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 15} However, Dr. Levine commented that \u201cchildren who have fragile bones do not develop fractures spontaneously and that all fractures reflect some degree of application of force. And children who have very fragile bones will develop a fracture through application of less force than a child who has bones of normal strength.\u201d Thus, even if Jordan had a disease process that caused fragile bones, force would nevertheless be required to cause the fractures at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 16} In light of the foregoing, Dr. Levine testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe lack of a history of an injury occurring, the apparent delay in bringing in the child for medical attention relative to the injuries documented by the x-rays in June, the pattern of fractures that were documented on the x-rays in June, and then the absence of any additional fractures once the child was removed from his home following the evaluation in June all [led him] to conclude that this was not a bone fragility syndrome but non-accidental trauma.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 18} Dr. Patrick D. Barnes testified for Jordan\u2019s parents. He is a pediatric neuroradiologist at Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital at Stanford University Medical Center in California. He co-authored one chapter on head injuries and child abuse and another chapter on imaging technologies for child abuse in <em>Diagnostic Imaging of Child Abuse, </em>with Dr. Paul Kleinman. Dr. Barnes testified that Jordan\u2019s head injury was old and could have been caused by the use of vacuum devices at his delivery. He testified that the lack of recent hemorrhaging and the rounded and/or irregular edges of Jordan\u2019s skull fracture, as shown in the various images made of it in June 2007, indicated that the injury was old and should have alerted the doctors examining him in June 2007 to look into his medical history \u2014 which they did not. He testified that it was normal for such injuries to take several months to manifest themselves. He testified that there was evidence in the images of Jordan\u2019s skull of a bone disorder or nutritional problem, such as rickets. He testified that proper procedure when an infant like Jordan presents with such an injury is to check the child\u2019s medical history to rule out birth trauma. He warned that symptoms of various bone disorders mimic those of child abuse. Ultimately, he testified that he could not rule child abuse in or out as a cause of Jordan\u2019s injuries, because he believed the child also displayed symptoms of rickets or other bone disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Dr. Kathy Keller, a board-certified pediatric radiologist teaching at Stanford, also testified for Jordan\u2019s parents. Dr. Keller had considerable experience in pediatric imaging for child abuse. Dr. Keller opined that Jordan had suffered from rickets. She based this on the images of Jordan\u2019s skull, including the sutures and what she identified as \u201cfloating teeth\u201d; a ricketic rosary on his anterior ribs; evidence of metaphyseal lesions on both knees; and that his rib fractures were not healing normally. She noted that it is difficult to date a fracture in children with rickets, due to abnormal healing. She strongly disagreed with Dr. Levine\u2019s conclusion that lack of a vitamin D deficiency in September 2007 indicated that Jordan did not have such a deficiency in June 2007. She noted that the rib injuries were consistent with labor trauma, such as Jordan experienced, in a child with rickets. Indeed, she believed that all his injuries were consistent with rickets and could result from birth trauma or normal handling of a child so afflicted. Her ultimate opinion was that Jordan suffered from the disease in June 2007. She admitted that she could not rule out child abuse as the source of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 20} October 30, 2007, the trial court filed its judgment entry finding Jordan to be abused, pursuant to R.C. 2151.031(C). It further adjudicated Jillian and Jayden to be dependent pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(C), i.e., children whose guardianship by the state is justified by their condition or environment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 21} On November 26, 2007, Teresa timely filed three notices of appeal. Andrew followed suit on November 29, 2007. This court consolidated the matters for briefing and oral hearing. On appeal, each party asserts three assignments of error. Since Teresa\u2019s and Andrew\u2019s assignments of error track each other, we consider their assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 22} Teresa\u2019s first assignment of error alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of Jordan Savchuk as an abused child was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 24} Similarly, Andrew\u2019s first assignment of error contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found Jordan Savchuk an \u2018abused child\u2019 pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 2151.031(C).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">{\u00b6 26} By their first assignments of error, Jordan\u2019s parents assert that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Jordan was an abused child is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 27} In this case, the trial court determined both that Jordan\u2019s injuries were nonaccidental and that they varied from the history given.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 28} In juvenile proceedings, we apply the criminal standard for reviewing manifest-weight challenges. Cf. <em>In re Corey, </em>11th Dist. No. 2005-G-2649, 2006-Ohio-2013, 2006 WL 1062871, at \u00b6 17. Under this standard, when reviewing a claim that a judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh both the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether in resolving conflicts, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that a new trial must be ordered. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717; see also <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u201d <em>Martin </em>at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. The role of the appellate court is to engage in a limited weighing of the evidence introduced at trial in order to determine whether the state appropriately carried its burden of persuasion. <em>Thompkins </em>at 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring). The reviewing court must defer to the factual findings of the trier of fact as to the weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Indeed, \u201c[o]nce the clear and convincing standard has been met to the satisfaction of the [juvenile] court, the reviewing court must examine the record and determine if the trier of fact had sufficient evidence before it to satisfy this burden of proof.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 368, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 30} When assessing witness credibility, \u201cthe choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Awan </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 22 OBR 199, 489 N.E.2d 277. \u201cIndeed, the factfinder is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness appearing before it.\u201d <em>Warren v. Simpson </em>(Mar. 17, 2000), 11th Dist. No. 98-T-0183, 2000 WL 286594, *3. If the evidence is susceptible to more than one interpretation, a reviewing court must interpret it in a manner consistent with the verdict. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 31} Furthermore, this court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c \u2018In an adjudicatory hearing regarding a claim of dependency, neglect and/or abuse, the requisite burden of proof is by clear and convincing evidence\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>[In re </em>] <em>Anthony </em>[11th Dist. No. 2002-A-0096], 2003-Ohio-5712 [2003 WL 22429035], at \u00b6 16, citing Juv.R. 29(E)(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c \u2018Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d * * * and which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u2019 <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, at paragraph three of the syllabus. The state, as the party seeking the adjudication, \u2018has the burden of establishing * * * that a child is abused or neglected before the court may enter a finding of abuse or dependency.\u2019 <em>In re Stewart </em>(Mar. 20, 2000), 12th Dist. No. CA99-08-024, * * *, 2000 WL 290134, [at *3]. \u2018Requiring the state to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence is part of the protection afforded to parents in abuse and dependency cases.\u2019 [Stewart at *4].\u201d <em>In re Veccia, </em>11th Dist. No. 2005-T-0141, 2006-Ohio-6095, 2006 WL 3350706, at \u00b6 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 34} Jordan was adjudicated abused pursuant to R.C. 2151.031(C), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAs used in this chapter, an \u2018abused child\u2019 includes any child who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c(C) Exhibits evidence of any physical or mental injury or death, inflicted other than by accidental means, or an injury or death which is at variance with the history given of it. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, in a case charging abuse pursuant to R.C. 2151.031(C), the state must show, by clear and convincing evidence, two elements: (1) that the child sustained physical or mental injury and (2) the injury was inflicted by nonaccidental means, or was at variance with the history given.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">{\u00b6 40} In this case, there is no question that Jordan sustained physical injuries. The controversy concerns whether the state introduced clear and convincing evidence that these injuries were nonaccidental or were at variance with the history given. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the state met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">{\u00b6 41} The evidence demonstrated that Teresa and Andrew were the sole caregivers for Jordan since his birth. Teresa described Andrew as a \u201crough guy\u201d and, during his interview, Andrew appeared fidgety and overly emotional. When the couple was asked about episodes of domestic violence, both parents acknowledged a recent incident in which Teresa slapped Andrew. Moreover, Teresa described the couple\u2019s relationship as being rocky since Jordan was born and stated that they had had difficulty adjusting to the new baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>{\u00b6 42} Further, the parents related to Detective Doyle and Assistant Chief DelCalzo that their arguments occasionally led to physical contact between them. Teresa told the officers that she had a recent discussion with Andrew about being too rough with Jordan. Teresa also told the officers that Andrew had some anger issues, i.e., he had been known to strike objects, such as walls, when angry. Moreover, during the officers\u2019 interview, Andrew was notably emotional and had difficulty recalling the events of the weekend when Jordan was injured. In fact, Assistant Chief DelCalzo pointed out that whenever the officers sought specific information, Andrew invariably broke down and was unable to provide answers to questions. However, according to DelCalzo, Andrew\u2019s emotional upheavals were unaccompanied by tears. The officers found Andrew\u2019s behavior suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 43} Dr. McDavid, a professor of pediatric medicine, testified that Jordan\u2019s rib and chest injuries were a result of excessive squeezing. She also testified that her examinations revealed that the injuries had occurred at different times, but there was no documented history of the injuries. She testified that there was no evidence that Jordan had osteogenesis imperfecta and, after reviewing films with radiologists, determined that there was no concern for rickets. Given the severity of the multiple injuries and the lack of explanation, Dr. McDavid concluded that the injuries are consistent with child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 44} Dr. Sivit, a pediatric radiologist, reviewed several x-rays of Jordan\u2019s rib and chest areas and testified that the fractures in these regions had occurred at different times, given the presence or absence of callus formations. He asserted that the posterior and anterolateral rib fractures are relatively uncommon in children and thus highly specific for abuse and/or rarely occur in the absence of abuse. The doctor further pointed out that Jordan\u2019s femur fracture involved a distal metaphyseal injury, another injury highly specific for abuse. Dr. Sivit opined that skull fractures can be seen with any type of trauma. However, the fact that it was present with other injuries raised additional concerns that Jordan was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 45} Dr. Sivit found no evidence of osteogenesis imperfecta or any other bone deformities. Dr. Sivit further testified that he saw no evidence of rickets in Jordan because, other than the fractures, his bones looked normal. The doctor searched for radiographic signs of disease processes. Dr. Sivit testified, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the injuries were not a function of irregularities from an underlying metabolic process. He indicated that he always looks for such problems, irrespective of the history of the patient. If he observes abnormalities, he then attempts to establish a differential diagnosis; however, because he saw no abnormalities, save the fractures, he concluded, with a high degree of certainty, the injuries were indicative of intentional trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Finally, Dr. Levine, a specialist in metabolic bone diseases, testified that children who have fragile bones do not develop fractures spontaneously. In other words, all fractures reflect the use of some degree of force. After reviewing a battery of tests, Dr. Levine concluded that Jordan did not have a metabolic bone disease or any other bone-fragility syndrome such as osteogenesis imperfecta. Further, the doctor determined that Jordan did not exhibit any clinical features of rickets. In his medical opinion, Dr. Levine maintained that Jordan\u2019s bones had normal density and his injuries were not a result of bone fragility. Dr. Levine therefore concluded, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Jordan has a normal skeleton and normal mineral metabolism.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 47} Moreover, Dr. Levine distinguished accidental and nonaccidental trauma. He testified that the history of the trauma is the key to drawing the distinction. When an injury is accidental, there is generally a very clear preceding event that is the cause of the injury. By contrast, nonaccidental trauma typically occurs in the absence of a history of injury. In light of this foundation, Dr. Levine testified that Jordan was a victim of nonaccidental trauma because his injuries had no history. Further, given the evidence that there was an apparent delay in seeking medical attention and Jordan suffered no more trauma once he was removed, led Dr. Levine to conclude that the injuries were intentionally inflicted on the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 48} Although Andrew and Teresa put forth evidence from Doctors Barnes and Keller indicating that Jordan\u2019s injuries were the result of either metabolic bone disease or birth trauma, the court evidently concluded that the state\u2019s experts were more credible and persuasive. As indicated above, this court must defer to the trier of fact\u2019s factual findings regarding the credibility of witnesses, and we may not substitute our judgment on such matters for the trier of fact. Under the circumstances, there was clear and convincing evidence presented in the form of expert testimony that Jordan sustained multiple physical injuries of which no history was offered and these injuries were inflicted in a nonaccidental fashion. Given the evidence and testimony submitted by the state, we cannot conclude that the trial court clearly lost its way, thereby creating a manifest miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 49} Teresa\u2019s and Andrew\u2019s first assignments of error are thus overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 50} Teresa\u2019s second assignment of error asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of Jillian and Jayden Savchuk as dependent children was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">{\u00b6 52} Andrew\u2019s second assignment of error contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found Jayden and Jillian Savchuk are \u2018dependent children\u2019 pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 2151.04(C).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 54} Each of the foregoing assigned errors operates to attack the weight of the evidence on which the trial court based its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 55} R.C. 2151.04(C) provides that a dependent child is one \u201c[w]hose condition or environment is such as to warrant the state, in the interests of the child, in assuming the child\u2019s guardianship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">{\u00b6 56} In the case sub judice, the state sought a finding of dependency for Jillian and Jayden because of the injuries sustained by their younger brother Jordan. The state\u2019s complaint asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cThe Lake County Department of Job and Family Services is concerned for the welfare and safety of the children due to the unexplained injuries that Jordan has sustained. The Department feels that Jillian and Jayden\u2019s safety cannot be ensured because it is unknown what happened to Jordan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">{\u00b6 58} As neither parent could explain Jordan\u2019s injuries, LCDJFS was unable to ensure the children\u2019s safety in the parent\u2019s custody and care. Ultimately, Jordan was found to be an abused child, and his parents were unable to provide an adequate explanation for his serious injuries. The finding of abuse, while not an indication of fault on behalf of the parents, was sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Jillian\u2019s and Jayden\u2019s condition or environment warranted guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">{\u00b6 59} Appellants challenge the court\u2019s finding by pointing out that neither Jillian nor Jayden suffered any injuries. Although Jillian and Jayden were not found to be harmed or injured, a finding of dependency does not require a child to suffer from abuse. The state was only required to demonstrate that the children\u2019s condition or environment was such that their best interests warranted its involvement. Jordan was determined to be an abused child due to multiple, fairly severe injuries for which the parents could not definitively account. Under these circumstances, we hold that there was clear and convincing evidence to warrant the state\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">{\u00b6 60} Teresa\u2019s and Andrew\u2019s second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">{\u00b6 61} Teresa\u2019s third assignment of error claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cThe juvenile court abused its discretion by overruling Teresa Palkovie\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony and written report of Dr. Michael Levine from coming into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">{\u00b6 63} Likewise, Andrew\u2019s third assignment of error asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying Mother\u2019s Motion to exclude witness Dr. Levine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>{\u00b6 65} Under these assigned errors, appellants contend that the juvenile court erred when it permitted the testimony and report of Dr. Levine. With respect to the report, the court concluded that \u201cadmission of the medical report after a person has testified is not proper and will be excluded.\u201d Because the report was excluded, we need not address this component of their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 66} With respect to the doctor\u2019s testimony, the state failed to include Dr. Levine on its initial witness list. On September 28, 2007, the state provided appellants with a witness and exhibit list. However, Dr. Levine\u2019s report was not provided to the state until October 16, 2007, after the adjudication hearing had already commenced. Once the state learned of the contents of the doctor\u2019s report, a supplemental witness and exhibit list was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 67} Juv.R. 24(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cUpon written request, each party of whom discovery is requested shall, to the extent not privileged, produce promptly for inspection, copying, or photographing the following information, documents, and material in that party\u2019s custody, control, or possession:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c(1) The names and last known addresses of each witness to the occurrence that forms the basis of the charge or defense * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 70} The decision to have Dr. Levine testify occurred subsequent to the state\u2019s disclosure of witnesses. As such, the attempt to use his testimony was a technical discovery violation. However, a court may permit an undisclosed witness of the state to testify, notwithstanding a discovery violation, \u201c \u2018if the state\u2019s failure to provide discovery was not willful, foreknowledge of the testimony would not have benefitted the defendant in preparation of his defense, and the defendant was not prejudiced by admission of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Ballentine </em>(Nov. 29, 1996), 11th Dist. No. 95-L-076, 1996 WL 811866, *3, quoting <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 236, 553 N.E.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 71} Here, the record indicates the state\u2019s failure to list Dr. Levine was not a function of gamesmanship or ambush tactics. It did not receive the doctor\u2019s report until the hearing had commenced. We thus do not believe that the state acted willfully in failing to include Dr. Levine in the original list. Further, foreknowledge of Dr. Levine\u2019s testimony would not have clearly benefitted appellants\u2019 preparation. His testimony was similar to that of doctors McDavid and Sivit, and appellants had already enlisted their own experts to rebut the content of this testimony. Moreover, Teresa was aware of the nature of Dr. Levine\u2019s examination prior to trial, i.e., she filed a motion requesting that LCDJFS have Jordan clinically evaluated by Dr. Levine. Accordingly, we can surmise that Teresa was actually aware of the fundamental tenor and content of Dr. Levine\u2019s testimony. Finally, appellants were not prejudiced by the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of Dr. Levine\u2019s testimony. Teresa had some awareness of the nature of Dr. Levine\u2019s assessment and the substance of his conclusion. By virtue of Teresa\u2019s awareness and the similarity between Dr. Levine\u2019s testimony and the state\u2019s additional expert\u2019s testimony, appellants were therefore adequately prepared to cross examine the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">{\u00b6 72} Because the evidence indicates that each of the factors discussed in <em>Ballentine </em>et al. were met, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to allow Dr. Levine to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 73} Appellants\u2019 third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 74} For the reasons discussed in this opinion, appellants\u2019 six total assignments of error are without merit. Therefore, the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-8\">Cannon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b401-9\">O\u2019Toole, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\">. Evidently, the case had been previously filed, then dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-12\">. We note, however, that Jillian and Jayden were returned to their parents' custody, under protective supervision of LCDJFS, on the day after the trial court filed its judgment \u2014 October 31, 2007. Further, Jordan himself was returned to their custody under protective supervision on December 28, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b401-10\">Colleen Mary O\u2019Toole, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 75} Because I do not believe that the state carried its burden of showing either that Jordan was an abused child, pursuant to R.C. 2151.031(C), or that Jayden and Jillian were dependent children, pursuant to R.C. 2151.04(C), I would reverse and remand based on their parents\u2019 first and second assignments of error. In consequence of that, I would find the third assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 76} Under the statutes, findings of either abuse or dependency require the state to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence \u2014 evidence that \u201cwill produce in the mind of the trier of facts a <em>firm </em>belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cross, </em>161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, at paragraph three of the syllabus. As the majority notes, this high evidentiary standard is meant to protect parents\u2019 constitutional right to raise and nurture their offspring. Cf. <em>Veccia, </em>2006-Ohio-6095, 2006 WL 3350706, at \u00b6 31. The evidence presented by the state in this case is simply of insufficient quality to meet the standard required.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">{\u00b6 77} Five medical experts testified. The three distinguished physicians from Rainbow stated that Jordan\u2019s injuries correlated highly with child abuse. However, they admitted to not having checked into his medical history, and they were unaware of, or failed to take into account, his traumatic birth. Dr. Barnes testified that when a newborn presents with a skull fracture like Jordan\u2019s, determining whether the injury might have resulted from birth trauma is a requisite. In effect, there was a failure in the standard of care. And while we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>are required to defer to the trial court\u2019s determination of the credibility of witnesses, that court stated that all the physicians testifying before it were credible. It is further worth noting that Dr. Sivit admitted in his own testimony that Dr. Paul Kleinman, with whom Dr. Barnes coauthored two chapters in <em>Diagnostic Imaging of Child Abuse, </em>is the leading authority in the field of radiology and child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">{\u00b6 78} Further, both Dr. Barnes and Dr. Keller strongly opposed the testimony of all three of the state\u2019s medical witnesses that Jordan did not display symptoms of rickets or a metabolic bone disorder. Both asserted that babies with rickets often display injuries mimicking those typical of child abuse. Dr. Keller testified that all of Jordan\u2019s injuries might be the result of birth trauma and normal handling, if he did have rickets. The trial court specifically accepted her testimony was credible, and that Jordan did have rickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 79} Of course, both Dr. Barnes and Dr. Keller admitted that they could not rule out child abuse as the source of Jordan\u2019s injuries. But this was because no attempt was made by the attending physicians in June 2007 to rule out rickets as the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 80} I simply cannot see that the state presented <em>clear and convincing </em>evidence that Jordan was abused. I would not find that it presented a preponderance of evidence that he was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 81} Again, the state failed to present clear and convincing evidence that the environment of Jillian and Jayden rendered them dependent. X-rays taken at Rainbow at the time of their brother\u2019s examination in June 2007 failed to establish any injuries, and neither did their medical records. The police established that inspection of the Palkovic/Savchuk home revealed nothing to arouse suspicion. Indeed, Teresa and Andrew had taken measures to make the house safe for toddlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 82} Fundamentally, the findings of dependency appear to be based on suspicions regarding the demeanor and conduct of Andrew. He was alone with Jordan for several hours the day before Teresa noticed the skull fracture. Teresa admitted that Andrew is a rough man, who likes to roughhouse with his children. He has occasionally physically displayed anger towards her. He was distraught and uncommunicative the evening Jordan was brought to Rainbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 83} I do not think that these facts rise, as a matter of law, to clear and convincing evidence that Andrew\u2019s conduct renders his household an unfit environment for his daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 84} I further note that Jayden and Jillian were reunited with their parents at the dispositional hearing held October 31, <em>2007 </em>\u2014 one day following the entry of the judgment appealed. Jordan returned to his parents\u2019 household by the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>December 2007. There seems to have been no criminal investigation of Andrew. These facts strongly suggest that the authorities involved realized that these children were neither dependent nor abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 85} Under the majority\u2019s analysis, it is difficult to visualize any scenario under which an aggrieved parent could ever mount a manifest-weight challenge to a finding of dependency or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 86} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
