Appellee has filed a cross-appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 2} In 2003, appellee was the owner of property located at 15 Grandview Drive, Dublin. Appellee had entered into a management agreement with OPE, Inc., d.b.a. Complete Property Resources (\u201cCPR\u201d), granting CPR the authority to manage, lease, or rent the property at 15 Grandview Drive on behalf of appellee. In November 2003, appellee and appellant entered into a land installment contract, whereby appellant agreed to purchase the subject property for $209,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 3} On August 15, 2005, appellee filed a complaint in Franklin County Municipal Court for forcible entry and detainer, and to terminate the land installment contract. In the complaint, appellee alleged that appellant had violated the terms of the contract by failing to make monthly payments. The complaint requested that appellant\u2019s rights under the contract be forfeited, and that judgment be entered in favor of appellee for amounts due under the contract, as well as an amount for deterioration or destruction to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed a counterclaim and an amended counterclaim, alleging in part that appellee and CPR had negligently allowed a hazardous and/or defective condition to exist on the residential premises in the form of various toxins, including mold, and that such negligence subjected appellant to the hazardous exposure of mold. In addition to a negligence claim, appellant alleged causes of action for breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence per se, private nuisance, public nuisance, premises liability, failure to make repairs, failure to inspect, defects, trespass, battery, misrepresentations, and failure to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">{\u00b6 5} The action was subsequently transferred to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. On May 2, 2006, the trial court entered an order for appellant to deposit with the clerk of courts all funds currently being held on his behalf in his attorney\u2019s trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">{\u00b6 6} The matter came for trial before a jury beginning April 24, 2007. Following deliberations, the jury returned a verdict on appellee\u2019s forcible-entry- and-detainer claim, finding that appellee had \u201cfailed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that [appellant] defaulted under the land-installment contract by failing to make monthly payments on that contract, without legal justification.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>On appellant\u2019s counterclaim, the jury returned a verdict finding appellant \u201chas proven by a preponderance of the evidence that [appellee] breached the land-installment contract regarding the treatment of the mold in the attic, and hereby award [appellant] the sum of $0, as damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 7} On May 8, 2007, appellant filed a motion for damages. On May 22, 2007, appellee filed a memorandum contra appellant\u2019s motion for damages. On September 28, 2007, the trial court filed a decision and entry regarding \u201cdisposition of funds placed in escrow,\u201d holding in part that the money held in escrow \u201cshall be used to treat the mold problem.\u201d Also on that date, the trial court filed a judgment entry regarding the jury verdicts, entering judgment in favor of appellant on appellee\u2019s claim that appellant defaulted under the land installment contract, and further rendering judgment in favor of appellant on his counterclaim, \u201cbut with no damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following three assignments of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">I. Given the jury verdict in favor of the defendant on the counterclaim the award of zero dollars in damages contrary to law and against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">II. The trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to present evidence as to physical injury suffered by the defendant as a result of the mold on the premises to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">III. The trial court erred in purporting to issue an order allocating funds being paid into escrow pursuant to its order during the pendency of the case given the verdict of the jury finding that the defendant had not breached the terms of the land contract and the fact that the plaintiff had failed to properly maintain the premises, etc. With regard to the issue of mold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">{\u00b6 9} In his cross-appeal, appellee sets forth the following single assignment of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">The Court erred when it instructed the jury to find for the Plaintiff if Plaintiff proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Defendant defaulted under the land installment contract without legal justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">{\u00b6 10} We will initially address appellant\u2019s second assignment of error under which he argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of personal physical injury arising out of the presence of mold at the residence. Appellant maintains that while the core issue giving rise to liability was appellee\u2019s failure to remedy the mold condition in the premises, the presentation of evidence as to physical injury suffered by appellant as a result of exposure to the mold was an element of damages that should have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>{\u00b6 11} In response, appellee argues that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on the issue of appellant\u2019s physical injury, because appellant failed to introduce any expert testimony at trial that would prove that the particular mold found at the property actually caused his medical condition. In support of this argument, appellee relies upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Terry v. Caputo, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-5023, 875 N.E.2d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Caputo, </em>at paragraphs one, two, and three of the syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">1. To present a prima facie case involving an injury caused by exposure to mold or other toxic substance, a claimant must establish (1) that the toxin is capable of causing the medical condition or ailment (general causation), and (2) that the toxic substance in fact caused the claimant\u2019s medical condition (specific causation).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">2. Establishing general causation and specific causation in cases involving exposure to mold or other toxic substances involves a scientific inquiry, and thus causation must be established by the testimony of a medical expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">3. Without expert testimony to establish both general causation and specific causation, a claimant cannot establish a prima facie case of exposure to mold or other toxic substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">{\u00b6 13} Upon review of the record, we agree with appellee that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct as to the issue of personal injury arising out of the presence of mold. At trial, the evidence appellant primarily relied upon was his own testimony that he began suffering symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, and a runny nose. Appellant further testified he had been treated by an allergist, who informed him that he was allergic to mold, dust, and other irritants. However, there was no evidence in the form of expert testimony that appellant was allergic to the particular mold in the residence or that such mold was the cause of any of his symptoms. Having failed to present expert evidence as to a causal connection between appellant\u2019s alleged exposure to mold and any medical symptoms, appellant cannot demonstrate the trial court abused its discretion in not providing the instruction at issue. <em>Caputo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">{\u00b6 15} We will address appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error jointly. Under his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the jury\u2019s awarding no damages was contrary to law and against the manifest weight of the evidence. Under his third assignment of error, appellant argues that in light of the jury verdict finding in his favor on the counterclaim, the trial court erred in issuing an order allocating funds paid into escrow to be used for mold treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Appellant maintains that when a defendant has engaged in conduct that results in injury to a plaintiff, Ohio law requires an award of at least nominal damages. Appellant further argues that he presented expert testimony at trial establishing that it would cost between $46,000 and $50,000 to remove the mold from the attic area of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 17} In response, appellee maintains that because he initiated this action as one for forcible entry and detainer, the action is not, in and of itself, an action for damages. Appellee\u2019s argument does not address, however, the fact that appellant filed a counterclaim that included a claim for damages for breach of contract regarding the failure to treat the mold issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 18} Regarding appellant\u2019s counterclaim, the trial court instructed the jury as to the elements of breach of contract, and further instructed the jury: \u201cIf you find by the greater weight of the evidence that [appellant] proved his claim, then you must further decide whether * * * that breach caused [appellant] to suffer any damages, and if so, in what amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 19} The evidence at trial indicated the presence of mold in the attic, but the parties disputed the proper methods and expense necessary to remedy the problem. Appellee presented the testimony of Thomas Flood, a \u201cmold remediator,\u201d who had previously inspected the residence and prepared a document in which he provided an estimate for the removal of contaminated mold in the attic of the residence. Flood testified that he provided CPR with an estimate of $5,995 to treat the mold in the attic.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant presented the testimony of Diane Adams, a certified industrial hygienist, and James Luckino, an architect. Adams opined that there was mold growth on the joists in the attic, and she recommended that the roof be removed because it was \u201cprobably more efficient and more economical than trying to scrub the entire underneath of the sheathing.\u201d Adams further opined that she would not follow the recommendations contained in the report prepared by appellee\u2019s witness, Flood. Luckino similarly testified that the safest and most expeditious manner to treat the mold would be to replace the roof. He estimated that it would cost approximately $50,000 to remedy the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b621} Under Ohio law, \u201c[j]udgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Moms Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. Upon a finding of a breach of an agreement, \u201cthe law infers damages, and if none are proved, nominal can be recovered.\u201d <em>First Natl. Bank of Bamesville v. W. Union Tel. Co. </em>(1876), 30 Ohio St. 555, 568. See also <em>Woodrow v. McGuire </em>(June 27, 1989), Scioto App. No. 1740, 1989 WL 72799, quoting <em>Vanderpool v. Waddell </em>(Nov. 12, 1987), Lawrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>App. No. 1822, 1987 WL 19853 (\u201c \u2018Where there is a breach of a contract, the law infers damages and if actual damages are not proved, nominal damages may be recovered\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 22} As noted, the jury returned a verdict finding that appellee failed to prove, in the forcible-entry-and-detainer action, that appellant had defaulted under the land installment contract. The jury further returned a verdict against appellee on appellant\u2019s counterclaim, finding that appellee had breached the land installment contract regarding the treatment of mold, but the verdict awarded appellant no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant, noting that the jury was made aware during the trial that appellant had paid certain monies into a court escrow account, suggests that the jury\u2019s verdict, finding in his favor on the counterclaim but awarding no damages, may have been the result of the jurors\u2019 speculating on the assumption that the money escrowed by court order would be eventually returned to appellant. The record indicates that, during deliberations, the jury submitted the following inquiries to the court: (1) \u201cWhat happens to the money in court escrow?\u201d (2) \u201cDoes the money in the court escrow, paid by [appellant] go to CPR no matter the outcome of this trial?\u201d and (3) \u201cCan the Jury award the money, paid by [appellant] into the court escrow to [appellant]?\u201d The trial court\u2019s response to the jury was that \u201c[t]he money in the escrow account will be dealt with by the Court after your service in this case has concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 24} Following the jury verdict, the trial court conducted a hearing with the parties on May 8, 2007. At that hearing, counsel for appellant argued that the verdicts were the result of confusion by the jurors regarding what they could award in relation to funds held in escrow. The parties also discussed the issue whether funds from the escrow account could be used to treat the mold. The trial court informed the parties during the hearing: \u201cI\u2019m not going to award any funds to treat the mold,\u201d noting that such an award \u201cwould be clearly contravening of the jury verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 25} However, the trial court\u2019s subsequent order of September 28, 2007, regarding \u201cdisposition of funds placed in escrow,\u201d specifically included the use of escrow funds deposited by appellant for mold treatment. While noting that appellant was not awarded any damages for breach of contract, the trial court nevertheless deemed it \u201cclear to this Court that the parties will remain at an impasse until the mold issue is dealt with,\u201d and the court determined that \u201cthe money held in escrow shall be used to treat the mold problem.\u201d The court\u2019s order further held that the money in the escrow account would be released by the clerk of courts only to treat the mold problem \u201cuntil such time as that problem has been taken care of,\u201d and \u201c[i]f there are any funds remaining from the escrow account they shall be paid to [appellee] since they are * * * funds that were deposited for payments on the land contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>{\u00b6 26} While we decline to speculate on whether the jury\u2019s verdict may have been a compromise based upon an assumption that appellant would ultimately receive escrow amounts, we agree with appellant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to recover, at minimum, nominal damages, and we find that the portion of the verdict awarding no damages was inconsistent with the finding of liability for breach of contract, and against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error and remand this matter for a new trial as to damages on appellant\u2019s counterclaim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 27} The focus of appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is the trial court\u2019s order regarding \u201cdisposition of funds,\u201d in which the court addressed treatment of the mold problem with escrow funds. While we view the trial court\u2019s order as an honest attempt to reconcile the jury verdict and to fashion an equitable remedy as a result, in part, of the jury\u2019s awarding no damages, we find the issues raised under the third assignment of error to be rendered moot in light of our disposition of the first assignment of error remanding this matter for a new trial as to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 28} We next address appellee\u2019s cross-assignment of error, in which he asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on his claim for forcible entry and detainer. Specifically, appellee argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury to find for appellee if he had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant had defaulted under the land installment contract by failing to pay required monthly installments, and that appellant \u201chad no legal justification\u201d for nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 29} A trial court has a duty to instruct the jury as to \u201cthe applicable law on all issues raised by the pleadings and evidence.\u201d <em>Booth v. Duffy Homes, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-680, 2008-Ohio-5261, 2008 WL 4517808, at \u00b6 14. Further, \u201c[w]hether jury instructions correctly state the law is a question of law that an appellate court reviews de novo.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. Chapter 1923 governs actions for forcible entry and detainer. R.C.1923.061(A) provides that \u201c[a]ny defense in an action under this chapter may be asserted at trial.\u201d Thus, under R.C.1923.061, any defense to forcible entry and detainer may be asserted at trial, and a counterclaim may be interposed based upon nonpayment. <em>Jemo Assoc., Inc. v. Garman </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 267, 270, 436 N.E.2d 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 31} In the instant case, prior to closing arguments, the trial court informed counsel for appellee that the \u201cno legal justification\u201d language would be included in the instructions because it \u201ctakes into account the nature of the defense.\u201d More specifically, the court explained that \u201cif the jury were to find that [appellant] had a legitimate reason for not making the payment, then there\u2019s no right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>immediate restitution.\u201d Id. Here, because appellee\u2019s complaint alleged that appellant failed to make payments under the contract, and, in light of the defenses and counterclaim raised by appellant, we find no error with the court\u2019s instruction encompassing whether there was legal justification for nonpayment. Accordingly, appellee\u2019s single cross-assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, appellee has filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, arguing that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the jury\u2019s verdicts, and the court\u2019s disposition of escrow funds, did not fully address amounts due to appellee \u201cfollowing successful mold treatment.\u201d The trial court\u2019s attempt to fashion a remedy regarding the issue of mold treatment, following the jury\u2019s verdicts, has been addressed above, and appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 33} Based upon the foregoing, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is rendered moot, appellee\u2019s cross-assignment of error is overruled, and appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied. Accordingly, the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Motion to dismiss denied; judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-7\">Klatt and Kline, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b124-8\">Kline, J., of the Fourth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
