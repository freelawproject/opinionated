Gilmour seeks an order from this court requiring the city of Mayfield Heights (\u201cMayfield\u201d) and the City of Mayfield Heights Planning Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) to commence appropriation proceedings in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, in order to determine the alleged damages that resulted from the passage of a rezoning ordinance. May-field and the commission originally filed a joint motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, a motion to dismiss, which we treated solely as a joint motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>to dismiss. We shall now consider the motion for summary judgment jointly filed by Mayfield and the commission as well as the motion for summary judgment filed by Gilmour. For the following reasons, we grant the joint motion for summary judgment and deny Gilmour\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 2} Gilmour has owned and operated a mortgage-brokerage business and a title agency at 5747 Mayfield Road in Mayfield Heights since 1999. In need of additional office space, Gilmour purchased two surrounding parcels of property: (1) 1461 Eastwood Avenue in Mayfield Heights (permanent parcel no. 861-01-082); and (2) 1455 Eastwood Avenue in Mayfield Heights (permanent parcel no. 861-01-080) (\u201cthe two parcels\u201d). The two parcels were originally zoned U-4 Local Retail/Wholesale District, which permitted commercial use and could be converted into expanded office space.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 3} On March 8, 2004, Mayfield passed Ordinance No. 2004-04, which rezoned the two parcels from U-4 Local Retail/Wholesale District to U-l/Single Family House District and prohibited any commercial development or use. On October 19, 2007, Gilmour filed its complaint for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 4} Following an extended briefing schedule, this court granted a joint motion to dismiss on behalf of Mayfield and the commission on the basis that a pending complaint for a declaratory judgment, filed in common pleas court, constituted an adequate remedy at law that prevented the granting of a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Gilmour Realty, Inc. v. Mayfield Hts., </em>174 Ohio App.3d 113, 2007-Ohio-6480, 881 N.E.2d 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 5} Gilmour appealed our decision to the Supreme Court of Ohio. On July 2, 2008, the Supreme Court reversed our judgment. See <em>State ex rel. Gilmour Realty, Inc. v. Mayfield Hts., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 11, 2008-Ohio-3181, 891 N.E.2d 320. The cause was remanded to this court for further proceedings with the specific instruction that \u201cthe parties shall be given the opportunity to introduce evidence and argument on Gilmour\u2019s partial regulatory-takings claim.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 6} On August 22, 2008, this court issued an order that provided (1) the original action for a writ of mandamus was reinstated to the active docket, (2) the parties were granted leave to file supplemental briefs, and (3) disposition of the writ of mandamus was to be based upon all previously filed briefs and motions as well as any supplemental briefs. Pursuant to this order, the parties filed additional supplemental briefs with attached exhibits and documents. It must also be noted that neither party, following this order, has requested oral argument with regard to the pending motions for summary judgment, nor have they requested the appointment of a magistrate to receive and report evidence and provide this court with findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Gilmour\u2019s Complaint for a Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 7} In the case sub judice, Gilmour argues that the act of rezoning the two parcels from commercial to residential usage resulted in an uncompensated taking. Specifically, Gilmour argues that the act of rezoning the two parcels from commercial to residential usage resulted in the inability to exploit a property interest and market-value loss. Gilmore argues that its loss requires that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering Mayfield and the commission to commence appropriation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Partial Regulatory Taking</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 8} The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is often referred to as the \u201cJust Compensation Clause,\u201d provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without compensation. <em>Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith </em>(1980), 449 U.S. 155, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358. Section 19, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution also provides that private property shall not be taken for public use, unless just compensation is provided. <em>State ex rel. Trafalgar Corp. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-6406, 819 N.E.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 9} Two separate actions on the part of the government constitute a per se taking, which requires compensation under the Fifth Amendment: (1) permanent physical invasion of property, and (2) government regulations that completely divest a property owner of all economically beneficial uses of the property. <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp. </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868. See also <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798. A third basis for compensation involves a claim of partial regulatory taking under the test established by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 10} The Supreme Court of Ohio, in applying the holding of <em>Penn Cent, </em>established that <em>\u201cPenn Cent, </em>recognizes an ad hoc, factual inquiry that requires the examination of the following three factors to determine whether a regulatory taking occurred in cases in which there is no physical invasion and the regulation deprives the property of less than 100 percent of its economically viable use: (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant, (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of the governmental action.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Shelly Materials, Inc. v. Clark Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 337, 2007-Ohio-5022, 875 N.E.2d 59, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 11} In the instant case, Gilmour alleges that the rezoning of the two properties \u201cfrom Commercial to Residential denied the Plaintiff the economical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>viable use of the properties as they planned and interfered with the Relator\u2019s investment backed expectations,\u201d which mandates that this court issue a writ of mandamus in order to allow for the commencement of appropriation proceedings in the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Elements Required to Establish Writ of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 12} Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, \u201cto be issued with great caution and discretion and only when the way is quite clear.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kriss v. Richards </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 455, 457, 132 N.E. 23. See also <em>State ex rel. Skinner Engine Co. v. Kouri </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 343,16 O.O. 492, 25 N.E.2d 940. Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel a public entity to commence an appropriation action when an involuntary taking of private property is alleged. <em>State ex rel. Preschool Dev., Ltd. v. Springboro, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 347, 2003-Ohio-3999, 792 N.E.2d 721. However, before this court will issue a writ of mandamus requiring Mayfield or the commission to commence an appropriation action in the probate court, Gilmour must demonstrate that (1) Gilmour possesses a clear legal right to compel Mayfield and the commission to commence an appropriation action, (2) Mayfield and the commission possess a clear legal duty to institute the appropriation action, and (3) there exists no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Savage v. Caltrider, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 363, 2003-Ohio-6806, 800 N.E.2d 358. The Supreme Court of Ohio has already determined that Gilmour possesses no other adequate remedy at law. Thus, we must determine whether Gilmour has met the first and second prongs of the aforesaid three-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to Civ.R.56(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 13} Mayfield and the commission, through their joint motion for summary judgment, argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Specifically, Mayfield and the commission argue that the rezoning of the two parcels did not effect a taking pursuant to the holding of <em>Penn Cent, </em>and thus they are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 14} Summary judgment, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), shall be rendered on behalf of the moving party when (1) there exists no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence submitted to the court that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267. Accord <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In addition, Civ.R. 56(C) delineates the different kinds of evidence that may be considered in a motion for summary judgment. This court may only consider the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact. Finally, this court, in <em>State ex rel. Martinelli v. Corrigan </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 243, 593 N.E.2d 364, held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTo respond properly to a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts which are based on personal knowledge and would be admissible as evidence. Civ.R. 56(E). <em>Tomlinson v. Cincinnati </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 66, 4 OBR 155, 446 N.E.2d 454. A court may not consider inadmissible statements, such as hearsay or speculation, which are inserted into an opposing affidavit. If the opposing affidavits, disregarding the inadmissible statements, do not create a genuine issue of material fact, then the court may grant summary judgment, if the moving party is otherwise entitled to judgment. <em>Pond v. Carey Corp. </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 109, 517 N.E.2d 928; <em>Penwell v. Taft Broadcasting Co. </em>(1984), 13 Ohio App.3d 382,13 OBR 466, 469 N.E.2d 1025.\u201d Id. at 248, 71 Ohio App.3d 243, 593 N.E.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 17} Mayfield and the commission, through their motion for summary judgment, argue that Gilmour has failed to establish that the zoning change applicable to the two parcels from U-4 Local Retail/Wholesale District to U-1/Single Family House District has resulted in a partial regulatory taking. We shall now examine in detail the pleadings, motions, and attached exhibits that were filed with this court in order to determine whether Gilmour has established the existence of a compensable partial regulatory taking vis-a-vis the economic impact of the rezoning on Gilmour, the extent to which the rezoning has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action.

The only two exhibits that potentially establish Gilmour\u2019s claims that the rezoning of the two parcels resulted in a detrimental economic impact and further interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations cannot be considered by this court. The appraiser\u2019s reports of Julian Vanni, which are attached as exhibits to the supplemental brief and attachments in support of relator\u2019s complaint for writ of mandamus, and the relator\u2019s notice of filing of supplemental authority and evidence potentially support Gilmour\u2019s claim of partial regulatory taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 19} The appraiser\u2019s reports, however, may not be considered by this court because they do not constitute \u201cpleadingfs], depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact.\u201d <em>Biskupich v.

In addition, the two appraiser\u2019s reports cannot be considered by this court because neither report was accompanied by a properly framed affidavit as required by Civ.R. 56(E). <em>State ex rel. Anderson v. Obetz, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-1030, 2008-Ohio-4064, 2008 WL 3319285, \u00b6 30. The remaining exhibits attached to the pleadings and motions fail to demonstrate that the rezoning of the two parcels resulted in any cognizable detrimental economic impact or further interfered with any distinct investment-backed expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 20} It must also be noted that the averments of Peter Moran, president of Gilmour Realty, with regard to the claims that the rezoning of the two parcels interfered with the planned economic use of the land and interfered with investment-backed expectations, without more, do not establish a taking. <em>State ex rel. BSW Dev. Group v. Dayton </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 338, 699 N.E.2d 1271. Finally, Gilmour has failed to demonstrate that the rezoning of the two properties did not relate to promoting the general welfare of the citizens of Mayfield, which prevents us from concluding that the rezoning constituted a governmental taking. Cf. <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 302, 122 S.Ct. 1465, 152 L.Ed.2d 517; <em>Goldblatt v. Hempstead </em>(1962), 369 U.S. 590, 82 S.Ct. 987, 8 L.Ed.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">{\u00b6 21} As a matter of law, Gilmour has failed to establish that the rezoning of the two parcels effected a partial regulatory taking of Gilmour\u2019s private property. Therefore, we find that Gilmour has failed to demonstrate that (1) it possesses a clear legal right to appropriation proceedings, and (2) Mayfield and the commission possess a clear legal duty to initiate appropriation proceedings. The failure of Gilmour to establish right and duty prevents this court from granting the requested writ of mandamus. Cf. <em>Clifton v. Blanchester, </em>Clinton App. No. CA2007-09-040, 2008-Ohio-4434, 2008 WL 4058098; <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Middlefield, </em>Lake App. No. 2005-L-140, 2008-Ohio-1891, 2008 WL 1777844; see also <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Middlefield, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 313, 2008-Ohio-6200, 898 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we grant the joint motion for summary judgment filed by Mayfield and the commission and deny Gilmour\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Costs to Gilmour. It is further ordered that the Clerk of the Eighth District Court of Appeals serve notice of this judgment upon all parties as required by Civ.R. 58(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">Calabrese and Rocco, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
