For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand the matter to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">I. The Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 2} On February 26, 2007, an Athens County Grand Jury indicted appellant on two counts of aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), felonies of the first degree, with gun specifications, and one count of failing to comply with an order of a police officer, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B), a felony of the third degree. Appellant initially entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant to R.C. 2943.03(E) and Crim.R. 11(A). The trial court ordered appellant to undergo a forensic psychiatric examination to determine his mental condition at the time of the commission of the offense. After this first evaluation was completed, appellant filed a notice of intent to obtain a second evaluation and a request for an indigency determination. After conducting a hearing, the court ordered a second evaluation and found appellant to be indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 3} At a change-of-plea hearing on September 25, 2007, appellant pleaded guilty to the offenses set forth in the indictment. The state gave a statement of the facts, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">As far as the statement of facts, on February 13, 2007, * * * the defendant initially held up, * * * went to the, was traveling in his vehicle, wrecked it, and * * * crashed it. He went to the Gillogly, he was at the Gillogly residence and Mr. Casto came over to the residence to assist the Gilloglys, who had seen the defendant there. While Mr. Casto was there, he held Mr., he held a gun on Mr. Casto and stole his vehicle. This occurred in Meigs County. He proceed * * * and that was on 689. He proceeded on * * * with Mr. Casto\u2019s vehicle until he wrecked near the Albany fairgrounds in Athens County. At that time Mrs. Lonas, went to provide assistance to the defendant, thinking that he had wrecked and would need some assistance. Instead at that time, he then held a gun to Mrs. Lonas, chambering a round, and stole her 2001 silver Monte Carlo. After stealing the Monte Carlo, he drove off at a high rate of speed. A number of deputies were in * * * pursuit. And eventually Deputy Sheridan was able, the defendant actually swerved off the road and * * * came to a stop and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Deputy Sheridan was able to approach the vehicle or keep him at bay until other deputies could * * * respond. During the time he was able to respond to commands, * * * Sergeant Childs indicated that he had asked him to unlock the door, the defendant was able to do that. And he was able to speak and to walk and had, had the ability to commit all of these crimes, that he has, * * *, had done and which brings him before the Court today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 4} Pursuant to a plea agreement, the state recommended that appellant be sentenced to a 21-year prison term. After the court ordered a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), it conducted a sentencing hearing, where it adopted the state\u2019s recommendation. Specifically, the court sentenced appellant to a seven-year prison term for each count of aggravated robbery, along with a mandatory three-year prison term for each of the gun specifications. The court also sentenced appellant to a one-year prison term for the charge of failure to comply with an order of a police officer. The court ordered all counts to be served consecutive to each other for a total of 21 years. Moreover, the court ordered appellant to pay restitution to the victims, Mr. Casto and Mrs. Lonas, in the amount of $140 and $8,689.00 respectively, and to pay restitution to the victims\u2019 insurance companies, State Farm and Western Reserve, in the amount of $4,300 and $1,810.79 respectively. Appellant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"AQN\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant presents six assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">Assignment of Error I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">The trial court erred by ordering Mr. Haney to pay $14,939.79 in restitution without considering Mr. Haney\u2019s present and future ability to pay as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">Assignment of Error II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">Trial counsel provided ineffective assistance, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s imposition of $14,939.79 in restitution without considering whether Mr. Haney had the present and future ability to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">Assignment of Error III</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">The trial court committed plain error and denied Mr. Haney due process of law by imposing $14,939.79 in restitution without considering whether Mr. Haney had the present and future ability to pay the amount. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">Assignment of Error IV</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The trial court erred when it ordered Mr. Haney to pay restitution to the victim\u2019s insurance carriers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">Assignment of Error V</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Mr. Haney\u2019s indictment was defective as it failed to charge the culpable mental state that was required in order for the State to convict Mr. Haney for aggravated robbery. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 7(B). Assignment of Error VI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">The trial [sic] erred when it sentenced Mr. Haney to a cumulative prison term of twenty-one years. Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">III. Sufficiency of the Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 6} We begin our analysis by addressing appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, in which appellant contends that his indictment was defective because it failed to charge the culpable mental state for the offense of aggravated robbery. Relying on the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>(\u201cColon </em>7\u201d), he contends that his aggravated-robbery convictions must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>Colon I, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held: \u2018When an indictment fails to charge a mens rea element of a crime and the defendant fails to raise that defect in the trial court, the defendant has not waived the defect in the indictment.\u201d Id. at syllabus. In <em>Colon </em>7, the defendant had been charged with robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). His indictment stated that defendant \u201cin attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in Section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense upon [the victim, the defendant did] inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on [the victim].\u201d Id. at \u00b6 2. The court in <em>Colon I </em>found that the indictment failed to contain a mens rea for the actus reus element stated in subsection (2), i.e., \u201c[i]nflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another.\u201d The court reasoned that because R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) does not specify a particular degree of culpability for the act of \u201cinflict[ing], attempting], to inflict, or threatening] to inflict physical harm\u201d and because the statute does not plainly indicate that strict liability is the mental standard, the catchall culpable mental state of \u201crecklessness\u201d applied. The court concluded that because the mens rea \u201crecklessness\u201d was missing from the indictment, the indictment was defective because it failed to charge an essential element of the offense. Id. at \u00b6 19. The court also concluded that the defective indictment resulted in a lack of notice to the defendant of the mens rea required to commit the offense, and that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the defect clearly permeated the entire criminal proceeding, the defect resulted in structural error. Id. at \u00b6 32. The <em>Colon I </em>court then reversed the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 8} On reconsideration, the Supreme Court of Ohio declared that <em>Colon I </em>was prospective and \u201capplies only to those cases pending on the date <em>Colon I </em>was announced.\u201d <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169, \u00b6 5 <em>(\u201cColon II\u201d). </em>The court in <em>Colon II </em>also stated that \u201cthe facts that led to our opinion in <em>Colon I </em>are unique[,]\u201d noting that the defective indictment was not the only error that had occurred, but that the defective indictment resulted in several other violations of the defendant\u2019s rights. Id. at \u00b6 6. Specifically, the court noted the following: (1) there was no evidence to show that the defendant had notice that recklessness was an element of the crime of robbery; (2) there was no evidence that the state argued that the defendant\u2019s conduct was reckless; (3) the trial court did not include recklessness as an element of the crime when it instructed the jury; and (4) in closing argument, the prosecuting attorney treated robbery as a strict-liability offense. Id. at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 9} The court in <em>Colon II </em>went on to conclude that the structural-error analysis for defective indictments is \u201cappropriate only in rare cases * * * in which multiple errors at the trial follow the defective indictment.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8. The court then stated, \u201cSeldom will a defective indictment have this effect, and therefore, in most defective indictment cases, the court may analyze the error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B) plain-error analysis. Consistent with our discussion herein, we emphasize that the syllabus in <em>Colon I </em>is confined to the facts in that case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 10} As set forth above, appellant was charged with two counts of aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913. 01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">(1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control <em>and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">(\u00b6 11} Appellant argues that in the absence of any statutory language as to the requisite degree of culpability associated with the requirement that the offender <em>either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it, </em>the catchall mental state of recklessness should apply. Appellant maintains that the indictment was defective because it failed to include this material element of mens rea and that pursuant to <em>Colon I, </em>his case is laden with structural errors that require us to reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Recently, the Tenth District Court of Appeals concluded that the holding of <em>Colon I </em>was inapplicable to a conviction for aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). See <em>State v. Hill, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-889, 2008-Ohio-4257, 2008 WL 3878363. In <em>Hill, </em>the court initially noted that it was \u201creluctant to expansively construe <em>Colon I\u2019s </em>holding to statutes not considered by <em>Colon I, </em>especially since <em>Colon II </em>emphasized that the syllabus in <em>Colon I </em>is confined to the facts in that case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 34. The court in <em>Hill </em>ultimately concluded that <em>Colon I </em>was inapplicable to aggravated-robbery convictions under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) based upon its prior opinion in <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-640, 2008-Ohio-3827, 2008 WL 2932005. We adopt the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Ferguson </em>and conclude that <em>Colon I </em>does not require reversal of appellant\u2019s aggravated-robbery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 13} As noted in <em>Ferguson, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio has previously addressed whether recklessness is an element of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Wharf </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172. In <em>Wharf, </em>the defendant was indicted for aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). The trial court later amended the indictment to robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1). At trial, the defendant proposed a jury instruction that before the jury could find him guilty of robbery, it must find that he acted <em>recklessly </em>in having a deadly weapon on or about his person. Id. at 376, 715 N.E.2d 172. The trial court declined to give the proposed jury instruction, and the defendant was convicted. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that \u201crecklessly\u201d was the required mental state for the deadly-weapon element of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1). The appellate court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument and affirmed, but entered an order certifying a conflict with judgments of other courts of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Wharf </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \u201cthe General Assembly intended that a theft offense, committed while an offender was in possession or control of a deadly weapon, is robbery and no intent beyond that required for the theft offense must be proven.\u201d Id. at 377, 715 N.E.2d 172. Further, the court held that \u201cby employing language making mere possession or control of a deadly weapon, as opposed to actual use or intent to use, a violation, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) be a strict liability offense.\u201d Id. at 378, 715 N.E.2d 172. Thus, the Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) is a strict-liability offense and that the deadly-weapon element does not require the mens rea of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Here, appellant argues that robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) is a lesser-included offense of aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and that the additional element under the aggravated-robbery statute, i.e., that the offender display, brandish, use, or indicate that he or she has a weapon, requires the mens rea of recklessness. He relies on dicta in <em>Wharf </em>that arguably suggests that this additional element may distinguish the offenses for purposes of analyzing the requisite criminal intent. See <em>Ferguson, </em>2008-Ohio-3827, 2008 WL 2932005, at \u00b645, quoting <em>Wharf, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 379, 715 N.E.2d 172 (\u201cA violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) will also be found if the offender has a deadly weapon on or about his person, or under his control, while fleeing after such offense or attempt. Thus, no use, display, or brandishing of a weapon, or intent to do any of the aforementioned acts, is necessary according to the plain language of the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 16} We note, however, that other courts have applied the holding in <em>Wharf </em>to aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). See <em>Ferguson </em>at \u00b6 46, citing <em>State v. Kimble, </em>Mahoning App. No. 06MA190, 2008-Ohio-1539, 2008 WL 852074, at \u00b6 29 (relying on <em>Wharf </em>for the proposition that the only mens rea the state must prove is that required for theft in finding evidence sufficient to prove complicity to commit aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1)). See also <em>State v. Thompson, </em>Ashland App. No. 08COA018, 2008-Ohio-5332, 2008 WL 4572520, \u00b6 31; <em>State v. Peterson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90263, 2008-Ohio-4239, 2008 WL 3870695, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 17} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the holding in <em>Wharf </em>\u2014 that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) requires no mens rea other than that required for the theft offense \u2014 is analogous to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). Here, appellant was charged with aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), and because a violation of that provision requires no intent beyond that required for the theft offense, his indictment was not defective for its failure to include the mens rea of recklessness. Accordingly, we find the holding in <em>Colon I </em>to be inapplicable to appellant\u2019s convictions for aggravated robbery under R.C. 2911.01(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 18} Nonetheless, even if we found that <em>Colon I </em>applies to this case, we conclude that in light of <em>Colon II, </em>reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction is not required. Initially, we note that <em>Colon II </em>is distinguishable because here appellant failed to raise the issue of the defective indictment with the trial court and then later entered a guilty plea to the offenses charged in the indictment, including both counts of aggravated robbery. Generally, a defendant who pleads guilty or no contest waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings. See Crim.R. 11(B)(1); see also <em>United States v. Broce </em>(1989), 488 U.S. 563, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927; <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, at \u00b6 78, quoting <em>Menna v. New York </em>(1975), 423 U.S. 61, 62, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195, fn. 2. (\u201c \u2018a guilty plea * * * renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt and which do not stand in the way of conviction if factual guilt is validly established\u2019 \u201d). Thus, appellant\u2019s guilty plea waived his right to challenge any alleged defect in the indictment. See <em>State v. Davis, </em>Highland App. No. 06CA21, 2007-Ohio-3944, 2007 WL 2216367, \u00b6 18, citing <em>Stacy v. Van Coren </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St.2d 188, 47 O.O.2d 397, 248 N.E.2d 603; see also <em>State v. Salter, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82488, 2003-Ohio-5652, 2003 WL 22413518. His \u201cguilty plea broke the chain of events which preceded it in the criminal process.\u201d See <em>Davis </em>at \u00b6 18, citing <em>State v. Miller, </em>Meigs App. No. 95CA10, 1996 WL 571488. As we stated in <em>Miller, </em>\u201cBy pleading guilty * * *, appellant waived any right in questioning the validity of his indictment on appeal. In effect, appellant induced the prosecution and the court to proceed upon the * * * indictment upon the basis that it was sufficient to charge an offense * * Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 19} Even if <em>Colon II </em>applies to this case, and appellant did not waive his right to challenge any defect in the indictment, we find that this case is not one of the rare defective-indictment cases that resulted in \u201cmultiple errors that are inextricably linked to the flawed indictment such as those that occurred in <em>Colon I.\u201d </em>As such, plain-error analysis, pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), is appropriate. For there to be plain error, there must be a plain or obvious error that \u201caffect[s] \u2018substantial rights,\u2019 which the court has interpreted to mean but for the error, \u2018the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Litreal, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 670, 2006-Ohio-5416, 868 N.E.2d 1018, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. We take notice of plain error with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-2787, 889 N.E.2d 995, \u00b6 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant argues that his mental state was at issue and points to the fact that he received two psychological evaluations. He also notes that defense counsel indicated at the sentencing hearing that appellant was \u201csuicidal\u201d on the day that the crimes were committed. He argues that had he received notice that the state had to prove the mens rea of recklessness, he <em>may not </em>have pleaded guilty. While appellant originally entered pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity, which prompted the psychological evaluations, he later pleaded guilty to the indictment. At the plea hearing, the state provided a statement of the facts, which we set forth previously. Defense counsel took no exception to the facts as given and stated, \u201cI think it is a factual statement that is supported by evidence that could have been brought before the Court.\u201d Based on our review of the record, we find no plain error in the proceedings below. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>IV. Consideration of the Ability to Pay Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 21} Because appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error raise related arguments, we address them together. In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay $14,939.79 in restitution without considering his present and future ability to pay as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(6). In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because he failed to object to the court\u2019s imposition of restitution without considering whether he had the present and future ability to pay. In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with R.C. 2929.19(B)(6) constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 22} As a financial sanction, R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) allows the court to order a felony offender to make restitution to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. Before ordering an offender to pay a financial sanction such as restitution, R.C. 2929.19(B)(6) requires the court to \u201cconsider the offender\u2019s present and future ability to pay the amount of the sanction or fine.\u201d \u201c[Wjhen a trial court has imposed a financial sanction without even a cursory inquiry into the offender\u2019s present and future means to pay the amount imposed, the failure to make the requisite inquiry is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson, </em>Vinton App. No. 07CA659, 2008-Ohio-2063, 2008 WL 1914805, \u00b6 5, citing <em>State v. Bemmes, </em>(Apr. 5, 2002) Hamilton App. No. C-010522, 2002 WL 507337, <em>*2. </em>In other words, courts have no discretion to apply an improper analysis or process in deciding an issue even where they may have discretion in the ultimate decision on the merits. Id., citing <em>State v. Nayar, </em>Lawrence App. No. 07CA6, 2007-Ohio-6092, 2007 WL 3407169, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant argues that there is no evidence in the record showing that the trial court considered his present and future ability to pay restitution. We have consistently held that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[although preferable for appellate review, a trial court need not explicitly state in its judgment entry that it considered a defendant\u2019s ability to pay a financial sanction. Rather, courts look to the totality of the record to see if this requirement has been satisfied.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rickett, </em>Adams App. No. 07CA846, 2008-Ohio-1637, 2008 WL 901480, \u00b6 6, quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>Ross App. No. 06CA2893, 2007-Ohio-1884, 2007 WL 1165822, \u00b6 42, quoting <em>State v. Ray, </em>Scioto App. No. 04CA2965, 2006-Ohio-853, 2006 WL 439291, \u00b6 26. We have explained that the trial court complies with R.C. 2929.19(B)(6) when the record shows that the court considered a PSI that provides pertinent financial information regarding the offender\u2019s ability to pay restitution. <em>Rickett </em>at \u00b6 6, citing <em>Smith </em>at \u00b6 42. Although the trial court did not explicitly state in its restitution order that it had considered appellant\u2019s present and future ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>pay, it did state that it had considered the record and the PSI. On appellant counsel\u2019s motion, we ordered supplementation of the record with the PSI, which is properly part of the record on appeal in this case. See <em>State v. Martin </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 326, 327, 747 N.E.2d 318 (\u201cAlthough the PSI report is not part of the public record, it is part of the appellate record for our review\u201d). That report contains information regarding appellant\u2019s age, education, physical and mental health, military service, and employment history. It also describes his \u201cfinancial condition,\u201d detailing his assets and debts. Therefore, the record supports the conclusion that the trial court sufficiently considered appellant\u2019s present and future ability to pay restitution. See <em>Martin </em>at 327-328 (holding that consideration of a PSI that contains information about the offender\u2019s age, health, education, and work history satisfies the requirements of R.C. 2929.19(B)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 24} Furthermore, our review of the record shows that the trial court was fully aware of appellant\u2019s financial situation prior to ordering appellant to pay restitution. As appellant correctly points out, the trial court had previously conducted a hearing on whether appellant was indigent for purposes of receiving a psychological evaluation at public expense. While the court ultimately found appellant to be indigent for purposes of receiving the evaluation and then later for purposes of appeal, this finding does not necessarily mean that the trial court failed to consider appellant\u2019s present and future ability to pay. See <em>Rickett </em>at \u00b6 7 (noting that the fact that the trial court found defendant to be indigent for purposes of appeal did not necessarily mean that the trial court failed to consider his present and future ability to pay). Appellant was 27 years old at the time of sentencing and if he serves his full 21-year sentence, he will leave prison at age 48. Given his age, the information provided in the PSI, and the information obtained during the indigency hearing, the trial court could reasonably conclude that appellant would have the ability to pay the financial sanction in the future. Therefore, we cannot conclude that appellant\u2019s current financial position necessarily means that the trial court did not consider appellant\u2019s present and future ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 25} Because we conclude that the court committed no error, plain or otherwise, in failing to consider appellant\u2019s present and future ability to pay $14,939.79 in restitution, we overrule appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 26} We also reject appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>323, 327, 731 N.E.2d 645, citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. To establish prejudice, appellant must show that there exists a reasonable probability that were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>State v. White </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 23, 693 N.E.2d 772; <em>Bradley </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. When considering whether trial counsel\u2019s representation amounts to a deficient performance, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Thus, \u201cthe defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 27} Because we conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to consider appellant\u2019s present and future ability to pay, appellant fails to demonstrate any deficient performance on the part of trial counsel in failing to object on that basis or any resulting prejudice. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">V. Restitution to Third Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant argues that the trial court committed plain error when it ordered him to pay restitution to State Farm and Western Reserve, the victims\u2019 insurance carriers. Specifically, he argues that R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) does not authorize the trial court to award restitution to third parties. The state concedes error on this point, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 29} We have previously held that under the current version of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), \u201ctrial courts are no longer permitted to award restitution in criminal cases to third parties, including insurance carriers.\u201d <em>State v. Baltzer, </em>Washington App. No. 06CA76, 2007-Ohio-6719, 2007 WL 4374407, \u00b6 41; see also <em>State v. Smith, </em>Washington App. No. 07CA25, 2008-Ohio-142, 2008 WL 160922, \u00b6 4. As we noted in <em>Baltzer, </em>the version of R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) in effect until June 1, 2004, specifically provided for restitution to the victim of the crime or \u201cto \u2018third parties for amounts paid to or on behalf of the victim.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting former R.C. 2929.18(A)(1)). However, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) to delete the provision allowing trial courts to award restitution to third parties. \u201cIn the General Assembly\u2019s final analysis of 125 Sub. H.B. 52, it noted that the bill <em>\u2018repeals </em>all of the language that pertains to the restitution order requiring that reimbursement be made to third parties, including governmental agencies or persons other than governmental agencies, for amounts paid to or on behalf of the victim or any survivor of the victim for economic loss * * \u201d <em>State v. Didion, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 130, 2007-Ohio-4494, 877 N.E.2d 725, \u00b6 27 (quoting 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Am.Sub.H.B. No. 52). See also <em>State v. Kreischer, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 391, 2006-Ohio-2706, 848 N.E.2d 496, \u00b6 1 (suggesting that trial courts may no longer award restitution to third parties for payments made to or on behalf of the victim because \u201cthe legislature amended R.C. 2929.18 to delete all references to restitution for third parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 30} In light of the state\u2019s concession and our holding in <em>Baltzer, </em>we conclude that the trial court committed plain error in ordering appellant to pay restitution to State Farm and Western Reserve. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">VI. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 31} In his sixth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it sentenced him to a cumulative prison term of 21 years. He argues that the facts presented during the sentencing hearing do not support any sentence above three-year, concurrent prison terms for each of the aggravated-robbery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">{\u00b6 32} Recently, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed the issue of the proper standard of review when reviewing a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision and set forth a two-step process. See <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124. In this plurality decision, the court determined that an appellate court must first \u201cexamine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. If this first prong is satisfied, the trial court\u2019s decision shall be reviewed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 4. An abuse of discretion is \u201cmore than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">{\u00b6 33} Trial courts \u201chave full discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing maximum, consecutive, or more than the minimum sentences.\u201d <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 100. However, in sentencing a felony offender, the sentencing court must still consider the general guidance factors contained in R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12. <em>Kalish </em>at \u00b6 13; <em>Foster </em>at \u00b6 42. As we noted in <em>State v. Ward, </em>Meigs App. No. 07CA9, 2008-Ohio-2222, 2008 WL 1991614, the court must impose a sentence that is reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of felony sentencing, i.e., protecting the public from future crime by the offender and others and punishing the offender. Id. at \u00b6 19; R.C. 2929.11(A). The court must also consider the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12(B) and (C) relating to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and those set forth in R.C. 2929.12(D) and (E) relating to the likelihood of the offender\u2019s recidivism. Id.; R.C. 2929.12(A). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Additionally, the court may consider any other factor that it deems relevant to achieving the principles and purposes of sentencing. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">(\u00b6 34} Here, appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), felonies of the first degree, with three-year mandatory gun specifications, and one count of failing to comply with an order of a police officer, in violation of R.C. 2921.331(B), a felony of the third degree. Under R.C. 2929.14, the statutory range for a first-degree felony is three to ten years, and the statutory range for a third-degree felony is one to five years. The court sentenced appellant to a seven-year prison term for each count of aggravated robbery, along with a mandatory three-year prison term for each of the gun specifications. The court also sentenced appellant to a one-year prison term for the charge of failure to comply with an order of a police officer. Thus, the trial court\u2019s sentence is within the permissible statutory range. Moreover, our review of the record shows that the trial court considered the principles and purposes of R.C. 2929.11, as well as the \u201cseriousness\u201d and \u201crecidivism\u201d factors under R.C. 2929.12. Accordingly, the sentence is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 35} We must next determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. At the sentencing hearing, the court expressly considered the \u201cvery serious\u201d nature of the offenses and incorporated the PSI by reference. The court also considered the victims\u2019 impact statements, which detailed the psychological effect the offenses had on both victims. The court noted that the two victims were \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d who stopped to assist appellant. The court also noted that during the offense, appellant pointed a loaded weapon at one of the victim\u2019s heads and then chambered a round. The court also referred to appellant\u2019s claim that at the time he committed these offenses, he was on his way to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house to commit suicide in front of her. The ex-girlfriend was a daycare provider for children. The court also specifically considered appellant\u2019s likelihood of recidivism and referred to his prior operation-while-intoxicated conviction. After considering these factors, the court sentenced appellant to the sentence the state originally recommended pursuant to the plea agreement. We find nothing in the record indicating that the court\u2019s decision to do so was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 36} Based on the foregoing, we affirm in part and reverse in part and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b606-9\">Abele, P.J., and McFarland, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Judith L.
