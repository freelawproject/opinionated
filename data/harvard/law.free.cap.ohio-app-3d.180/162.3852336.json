Longworth entered the hospital on September 22, 2005. After her discharge, Longworth was admitted to a nursing home. While Longworth was at the nursing home, she gave Childers a power of attorney to handle her finances. Childers had access to Longworth\u2019s bank accounts, and according to Childers, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>also set up a bank account to pay her mother\u2019s bills. It is undisputed that Childers used some of Longworth\u2019s money to pay Longworth\u2019s bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 3} Longworth died on April 7, 2006. Her son, Damon, was appointed executor of Longworth\u2019s estate. Damon determined that between $8,000 and $16,000 of Longworth\u2019s funds was unaccounted for. On September 20, 2006, Damon commenced an action against Childers pursuant to R.C. 2109.50 for concealment of assets. The complaint alleged that Childers confiscated $2,500 in cash belonging to Longworth from the house of Longworth\u2019s grandson and removed personal property from Longworth\u2019s house. Damon further alleged that Childers systematically and unlawfully removed cash from Longworth\u2019s bank accounts. According to Damon, approximately $16,100 disappeared as a result of Childers\u2019s unlawful actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 4} An evidentiary hearing was held on November 15, 2006. On March 27, 2007, the probate court found Childers guilty of concealing assets of the estate of Joan Longworth and ordered her to pay Damon, as executor of Longworth\u2019s estate, $8,020.79, plus ten percent penalty and costs as required by R.C. 2109.52. Childers filed a motion for relief from judgment, arguing that the trial court erred in its calculations and should have ordered her to pay no more than $5,020.79. On April 25, 2007, Childers filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in deciding that defendant/appellant Paula Childers ignored all requests for the return of the money belonging to the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred in assuming that plaintiff/appellee requested that Paula Childers return funds to the estate, when plaintiff/appellee admitted on the record that he made no such request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">{\u00b6 <em>rjy </em>\u00a3r-aj cour|- erre(j jin assessing the ten percent penalty pursuant to R.C. 2109.52, where counsel for the fiduciary refused two attempts by the defendant/appellant to turn over the cash belonging to the estate and then filed the concealment of assets action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">{\u00b6 8} The first, second, and fourth assignments of error are interrelated and will be addressed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court found Childers guilty of concealing assets from the estate of Joan Longworth. The trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-15\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cPaula opened a checking account at Liberty Bank in her own name in which she deposited sums withdrawn from her mother\u2019s account. Paula used these funds to pay for her mother\u2019s care, expenses to maintain the home, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>a few funeral expenses when the mother died. The balance on hand is $5,020.79 and the defendant admitted to having $3,000 in cash that belongs to the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe complaint alleges that the defendant concealed, embezzled or conveyed away assets belonging to the estate and plaintiff seeks to recover them pursuant to R.C. 2109.50. Plaintiff failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Paula took, sold, or gave away any other items of value belonging to the estate other than the money. Apparently, plaintiff requested that Paula return the funds to the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cDue to the strained relationships between the parties, Paula ignored all requests for the return of the money belonging to the estate. Unnecessary expenditures and a needless hearing occurred as a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Court therefore finds the defendant, Paula Childers GUILTY of concealing assets of the estate of Joan Longworth. The Court renders Judgment in favor of Damon Longworth, Executor of the estate of Joan Longworth. The Court hereby ORDERS Paula to deliver to Damon Longworth, Executor, the sum of $8,020.79 plus 10% penalty as required by R.C. 2109.52. The Court further orders Paula Childers to pay all costs of this proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 14} Childers argues that the trial court erred in finding her guilty of concealing assets of her mother\u2019s estate. Childers concedes that she does possess some money that belongs to Longworth\u2019s estate. According to Childers, she has been open and honest from the beginning about any money in her possession that belongs to Joan Longworth\u2019s estate. Childers testified that the executor of her mother\u2019s estate never demanded the return of any money and that she always has been willing to return any money that belongs to her mother\u2019s estate. Childers explained at the evidentiary hearing that she met with Damon\u2019s attorney after the initiation of the lawsuit but that she did not sufficiently trust Damon\u2019s attorney to turn the money over at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2109.52 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWhen passing on a complaint made under section 2109.50 of the Revised Code, the probate court shall determine, by the verdict of a jury if either party requires it or without if not required, whether the person accused is <em>guilty of having concealed, embezzled, conveyed away, or been in the possession of moneys, </em>chattels, or choses in action of the trust estate. If such person is found guilty, the probate court shall assess the amount of damages to be recovered or the court may order the return of the specific thing concealed or embezzled or may order restoration in kind. * * * In all cases, except when the person found guilty is the fiduciary, the probate court shall forthwith render judgment in favor of the fiduciary or if there is no fiduciary in this state, the probate court shall render judgment in favor of the state, against the person found guilty, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>amount of the moneys or the value of the chattels or choses in action concealed, embezzled, conveyed away, or held in possession, together with ten per cent penalty and all costs of such proceedings or complaint; except that such judgment shall be reduced to the extent of the value of any thing specifically restored or returned in kind as provided in this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">{\u00b6 17} The probate court found Childers guilty of concealing estate assets. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) 306 defines \u201cConcealment\u201d as \u201cThe act of refraining from disclosure; esp., an act by which one prevents or hinders the discovery of something; a cover-up.\u201d The probate court did not make a finding that Childers intentionally hindered the discovery of assets or that she engaged in a cover-up regarding assets of the estate. Rather, the court found Childers guilty of concealing assets based solely on her possession of the assets in question. We believe this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 18} As the Ninth District explained in <em>Ukrainiec v. Batz </em>(1982), 24 Ohio App.3d 200, 202, 24 OBR 323, 493 N.E.2d 1368:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cR.C. 2109.50 is a quasi-criminal statute. It requires a finding of guilty or not guilty and mandates that certain sanctions be imposed on a guilty defendant, including assessment of a ten percent penalty. See R.C. 2109.52. Thus, to prove concealment, complainant must show more than possession of estate assets. If such were the only proof necessary, all questions of disputed title could be brought under the concealment statute thereby making the statutory provisions for declaratory judgment (R.C. 2721.05) and exceptions to the inventory (R.C. 2109.33) superfluous. Further, the estate would be enriched by ten percent of each claim however innocent the possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTo the contrary, a violation of R.C. 2109.50 involves wrongful or culpable conduct on the part of the person accused. <em>In re Estate of Black </em>[ (1945), 145 Ohio St. 405, 31 O.O. 31, 62 N.E.2d 90] paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>In re Estate of Johnson </em>(1943), 38 Ohio Law Abs. 372, 50 N.E.2d 273; <em>Gregg v. Kent </em>(1938), 27 Ohio Law Abs. 628.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 21} As the <em>Batz </em>court noted, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that a complaint filed under R.C. 2109.52 \u201cinvolves a charge of wrongful or criminal conduct on the part of the person accused.\u201d <em>In re Black\u2019s Estate </em>(1945), 145 Ohio St. 405, 31 O.O. 31, 62 N.E.2d 90, paragraph two of the syllabus. Further, \u201c[t]he word \u2018guilty\u2019 * * * implies wrongful possession. The provision for penalty implies that the person wrongfully in possession is kindred to the ones who \u2018conceal, embezzle or convey it away.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gregg v. Kent </em>(July 21, 1938), Madison App. No. 137, 1938 WL 6739. Therefore, mere possession, by itself, is an insufficient basis on which to make a finding of guilt under R.C. 2109.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The testimony at the evidentiary hearing did not establish that Childers ignored requests for the return of money to Joan Longworth\u2019s estate or that Childers tried to cover up the fact that she possessed money belonging to Longworth\u2019s estate. Rather, it appears that the tensions between Childers and Damon were so high that they could not effectively communicate regarding what amount of money Childers possessed that belonged to Longworth\u2019s estate. The trial court found that unnecessary expenditures and a needless hearing occurred as a result of Childers ignoring all requests for the return of the money to Longworth\u2019s estate. On this record, we cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that Childers ignored any requests to return the money to Longworth\u2019s estate or with the trial court\u2019s decision to place the entirety of the blame on Childers. While Childers should be ordered to return the amount that rightfully belongs to Longworth\u2019s estate, we do not believe the facts of this case warrant a finding of concealment of assets and the imposition of the ten percent penalty pursuant to R.C. 2109.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 23} Damon argues in footnote one of his brief that numerous requests were made to Childers for cash and estate documents. However, no evidence of these \u201cnumerous\u201d requests was offered at the evidentiary hearing. What is in the record is Damon\u2019s testimony that he personally did not ask Childers for any money that belonged to his mother\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 24} The first, second, and fourth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the * * Balance on hand is $5,020.79 and the defendant admitted to having $3,000 cash that belongs to the estate\u2019, when all the evidence indicates that the funds owing to the estate were actually $3,742.62.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 26} Childers argues that the trial court erred in finding that she concealed assets totaling $8,020.79 from the estate of Joan Longworth. Damon argues that the trial court\u2019s finding was reasonable because the testimony at the evidentiary hearing established that Childers possesses $5,020.79 in a bank account plus $3,000 in cash, all of which belong to the estate of Joan Longworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">{\u00b6 27} The testimony and exhibits presented at the evidentiary hearing are not a model of clarity. When asked on cross-examination about the money that she still possessed, Childers testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. Are there any assets you wish to return back to the estate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. I would like to turn all of that over. I like to do that from the start.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. What assets are you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. It\u2019s in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. Tell me. I don\u2019t have the records. Is there still cash in those accounts? Do you still need the accounts? Do you have documents to show each month to what you want to turn back over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. I want to turn over what I have been forced to handle. That I never wanted to be a part of in the beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. These accounts, bank accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. There are monies in this account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. Do you know how much money is in these accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA. I don\u2019t know exactly. I think maybe about five thousand in one. {\u00b6 40} \u201cQ. Might be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have the number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">{\u00b6 42} On direct examination, Childers then testified regarding cash that she had in her possession at the evidentiary hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. Okay. Do you have any money left in that account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-15\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. I have $3,000.00 in this account, well, it\u2019s not in the account, it\u2019s here. {\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. You have $3,000 in cash?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-16\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-17\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ. And you showed that to me during our break?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-18\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-19\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ. And that\u2019s in bundles of 500, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-20\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-21\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ. And there\u2019s a receipt wrapped around each little bundle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-22\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. Yes, there is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-23\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. Is that because that\u2019s the receipt you got from the teller machine? {\u00b6 54} \u201cA. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-24\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cQ. So, you have six bundles of 500 dollars still sitting in a plastic sack. {\u00b6 56} \u201cA. $3,500.00, I\u2019m sorry, $3,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-25\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cQ. The last statement in that account it says there is a balance of 5,000 and some dollars, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-26\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA. Yes. Let me make sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>{\u00b6 59} \u201cQ. Okay. Just so we disclose everything. I know you wrote me a check from that account when you engaged me within the last 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cQ. Okay. So, other than that check, all the money is there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cA. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 63} The last page of Defendant\u2019s Exhibit B from the evidentiary hearing is an October 10, 2006 bank statement concerning a Liberty Savings Bank checking account that shows a balance of $5,020.79. The trial court determined that Childers owed the estate $8,020.79 by totaling the sum of the $5,020.79 remaining in the Liberty Savings Bank checking account and the $3,000 that Childers testified she had in cash. The problem with this math, however, is that it is unclear from the testimony whether the full $5,020.79 in the bank account belonged to Longworth\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 64} In her motion for relief from judgment, Childers argued that $3,000 of her own funds were included in the $5,020.79 in the checking account and therefore that the trial court should have ordered her to reimburse a total of only $5,020.79, consisting of the $3,000 in cash she had plus the $2,020.79 in the bank account that was the property of Longworth\u2019s estate. There is testimony that supports Childers\u2019s position that she spent $3,000 of her own money in setting up a bank account from which she paid her mother\u2019s bills. The motion for relief from judgment was pending when Childers filed her notice of appeal, so the trial court never decided the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 65} Inexplicably, Childers now argues on appeal that she owes Longworth\u2019s estate less than $5,020.79. Specifically, Childers argues that she obtained a total of $12,500 from Longworth and spent $9,294 on Longworth\u2019s behalf, leaving a balance owed to the estate of $3,742.62. She attaches two exhibits to her appellate brief listing the withdrawals and checks paid. It does not appear that these two exhibits were ever presented to the trial court, and we decline to consider them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">{\u00b6 66} The parties presented a very murky picture to the trial court regarding the amount of money possessed by Childers that belonged to Long-worth\u2019s estate. It is clear that Childers withdrew sums of money from Long-worth\u2019s accounts and used part of this money to pay Longworth\u2019s bills. What is not clear is how much of the money withdrawn by Childers was not spent on Longworth\u2019s expenses, and how much remains. On this confused record, we cannot determine as a matter of law the exact amount that Childers owes to Longworth\u2019s estate. But we are able to determine that the evidence on which the trial court relied in finding that Longworth owed $8,020.79 was not competent, credible evidence. Therefore, this assignment of error is sustained, and we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>forced to remand this matter for the limited purpose of determining the amount of funds Childers possesses that belongs to Longworth\u2019s estate. The trial court most likely will need to take additional evidence from the parties in order to get to the bottom of this financial morass.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">{\u00b6 67} The assignments of error are sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-7\">Wolff, P.J., and Fain, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
