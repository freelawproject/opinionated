Ingle raises one assignment of error on appeal, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that Farmers had not waived his late premium payment and in concluding that his policy was out of force at the time of the accident. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">{\u00b6 2} On December 14, 2004, Ingle was involved in an automobile accident with Jeffrey Dross. A day or two after the accident, Ingle contacted his Farmers insurance agent, William Krauss, to report the claim. On December 20, 2004, Ingle received a letter from Farmers asking him to participate with the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>in resolving the claim. Ingle\u2019s claim was ultimately denied on the ground that his policy was not in force on the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2005, Dross brought suit against Ingle in the Miami County Municipal Court under case No. 2005 CVE 1603, alleging that Ingle\u2019s negligence had caused the automobile accident and seeking damages. Ingle filed a third-party complaint against Farmers, seeking a declaratory judgment that he was covered by a policy of insurance with Farmers at the time of the accident. Farmers counterclaimed and requested a declaratory judgment that the policy did not require the company to defend, indemnify, or provide coverage to Ingle for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 4} In December 2006, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, Dross\u2019s automobile insurer, filed suit against Ingle in Licking County, Ohio, under case No. 06 CV 1863 JRS. The case was transferred to the Miami County Court of Common Pleas as case No. CV 07-106, and the parties sought consolidation of the common pleas and municipal court cases. In April 2007, the municipal court case was transferred to the court of common pleas under case No. CV 07-354, and the two cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 5} On November 8, 2007, the court held a trial on Ingle\u2019s and Farmers\u2019 declaratory-judgment claims. After posttrial briefing, the trial court made the following findings of fact, which we find are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c1) Defendant Ingle received a renewal notice from Defendant Farmers for his auto insurance policy but did not pay it immediately. See Exhibit 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c2) Defendant Ingle received a cancellation notice from Defendant Farmers that his insurance would be cancelled unless he paid the premium of $372.40 by December 7, 2004. See Exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c3) Defendant Ingle had been insured by [Farmers] for over twenty years but his policy had been cancelled in the past due to the lack of timely premium payments. See Exhibit F.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c4) The cancellation note received by Defendant Ingle gave him the option of dropping off the payment at his agent\u2019s office in Troy or mailing it to Kansas. The Defendant elected to mail in the premium. See Exhibit 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c5) On December 2, 2004 Defendant Ingle wrote a check for $372.40 and placed the check in the mail the same day. See Exhibit D.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c6) On December 14, 2004, Defendant Ingle was involved in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c7) The Defendant\u2019s check for $372.40 was not received in [Farmers\u2019] Shawnee Mission, Kansas office until December 20, 2004, and cleared the Defendant\u2019s bank on December 22, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201c8) [Farmers] reissued the Defendant\u2019s insurance policy effective December 20, 2004, the date they received his check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">{\u00b6 14} Upon considering the facts, the trial court concluded that the cancellation notice to Ingle placed the burden on him to ensure that Farmers received the premium payment prior to the cancellation date, and the mailbox rule was inapplicable. The court further stated that \u201c[t]here also is no waiver under the facts of this case.\u201d The court noted that Krauss had denied that he had told Ingle that he would be covered for the accident, there was no evidence of chicanery to avoid Ingle\u2019s claim, and there was no evidence that Farmers\u2019 acceptance of the late premium constituted an implicit acceptance of responsibility for providing coverage for the accident. The trial court thus agreed with Farmers that the policy was out of force at the time of the accident due to Farmers\u2019 not having timely received the premium due, and it granted judgment to Farmers on its declaratory-judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 15} The court subsequently found that Ingle was liable to State Farm for $17,886.67 plus interest and court costs in case No. 07-106 and to Dross for $1,277.50 plus interest and court costs in case No. 07-354.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 16} Ingle\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found that the defendant-appellant James Ingle did not have automobile liability insurance coverage with defendantappellee Farmers Insurance Group on December 14, 2004, the date of the accident herein even though James Ingle had submitted payment of the premium due for the time in question and after becoming aware of the Ingle claim, Farmers cashed the premium check and deposited the check to its account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">{\u00b6 18} In his assignment of error, Ingle claims that Farmers waived timely payment of the premium by accepting the premium payment on December 20, 2004. Upon review of the record, we find no fault with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Farmers did not waive timely payment by accepting Ingle\u2019s check after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 3937.31(A) requires all automobile insurance policies to be issued for a period of not less than two years or guaranteed renewable for successive policy periods totaling not less than two years. Where renewability is mandatory, as was the case with Ingle\u2019s policy, the refusal to renew a policy is treated as a cancellation. Id. Nonpayment of premium is grounds for the cancellation of a policy. R.C. 3937.31(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 20} In order for an insurer to cancel an auto insurance policy, the insurer must provide written notice of cancellation to the insured. R.C. 3937.32. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>notice must include, among other things, the policy number, the date of the notice, and the effective date of the cancellation. Id. \u201cWhere cancellation is for nonpayment of premium[,] at least ten days notice from the date of mailing of cancellation accompanied by the reason therefor[ ] shall be given.\u201d R.C. 3937.32(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 21} In addition to the cancellation requirements set forth by the General Assembly, the cancellation must also comport with the terms of the policy. R.C. 3937.31(A). In general, the policy \u201cis cancelled on the effective date stated in the notice of cancellation.\u201d R.C. 3937.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 22} Consistent with the statutory requirements, paragraph 8(a)(3)(a) of Part V of Ingle\u2019s policy with Farmers provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(3) When this policy is in effect 90 days or more or is a renewal, we may cancel only for one or more of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(a) Nonpayment of premium. If we cancel for this reason, we will mail you at least 10 days notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 25} Paragraph 8(c) further indicated that the policy would terminate automatically at the end of the policy period if the insured did not accept Farmers\u2019 offer to renew. Am insured\u2019s failure to pay the required renewal premium would mean that the insured declined the offer to renew.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 26} Farmers sent a renewal premium notice to Ingle, indicating that the policy would renew on November 20, 2004, and showing a premium due of $372.40. Ingle admitted that he did not pay the invoice immediately. On November 23, 2004, Farmers sent an \u201cavoid cancellation notice,\u201d which stated that the payment required to keep the policy in force had not been received. The notice indicated that the policy would be cancelled effective at noon on December 7, 2004 (the cancellation date), if full payment was not received in the company offices or by an authorized sales representative before that date. Although Ingle wrote a check on December 2, the check was not received by Farmers until December 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">{\u00b6 27} On December 15, 2004, Farmers sent a notice to Ingle indicating that the policy had been cancelled on December 7, 2004, and seeking payment of $33.53 for the time period that the policy had been in force between November 20 and December 7, 2004. The notice further stated, \u201cThis is a reminder that your policy was canceled for non-payment on the cancellation date shown above as reflected by the prior cancellation notice mailed to you. If you would like to reinstate this policy we suggest that you send the full amount of the premium payment now. You will be informed whether your policy has been reinstated, and if so, the exact date and time of reinstatement.\u201d Farmers\u2019 documentation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>indicates that Ingle\u2019s policy was reinstated effective December 20, 2004, when it received Ingle\u2019s premium payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">{\u00b6 28} Ingle claims that Farmers\u2019 acceptance of his late premium payment after being informed of the accident and the resulting loss constituted a waiver of its right to cancel his policy. He argues: \u201cIt has been the law of Ohio forever that acceptance of a premium by an insurance company after knowledge of a loss occurring while premium was in default waives forfeiture, and does not merely revive the policy as to the future.\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 29} Farmers responds that this case is governed by R.C. 3937.31(D), which states: \u201cRenewal of a policy does not constitute a waiver or estoppel with respect to grounds for cancellation that existed before the effective date of such renewal.\u201d Farmers further claims that the evidence indicates that the company did not waive Ingle\u2019s nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 30} As an initial matter, we disagree with Farmers that R.C. 3937.31(D) is dispositive. R.C. 3937.31(D) concerns renewals, not reinstatements after cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 31} As for Ingle\u2019s argument, Ingle overstates the Ohio case law in his favor. The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that when an insurance policy provides that acceptance of a delinquent payment will reinstate the policy, the acceptance of the late premium creates a new contract and does not revive the original policy. <em>Schwer v. Benefit Assn. of Ry. Emps. </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 312, 41 O.O. 303, 91 N.E.2d 523, paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201c[T]o effectuate such reinstatement of the insurance contract it must be shown that the receipt of the payment was knowingly accepted by the insurer or its agent for the purpose of reinstatement of the policy and not as a payment of overdue premiums on the original contract of insurance.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Morey v. Educator &amp; Executive Insurers, Inc. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 196, 74 O.O.2d 305, 342 N.E.2d 691 (noting that payment of delinquent premium did not reinstate coverage retroactively), overruled on other grounds by <em>DeBose v. Travelers Ins. Cos. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 65, 6 OBR 108, 451 N.E.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 32} In determining whether an insurer\u2019s acceptance of late premiums results in continued coverage without interruption, the issue is whether the insurer\u2019s acts are consistent with a theory of waiver or estoppel. <em>Starcher v. Res. Ins. Co. </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 176, 179, 22 O.O.3d 276, 428 N.E.2d 461. \u201cWaiver is mainly, or essentially, a matter of intention. Thus, a prerequisite ingredient of the waiver of a right or privilege consists of an intention to relinquish it. Indeed, the essence of a waiver, as indicated by the definition, is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, claim, or privilege. Whether an alleged waiver is express or implied, it must be intentional. Mere negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>oversight, or thoughtlessness does not create a waiver.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Estate of Mulvaney, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22721, 2008-Ohio-4391, 2008 WL 3990811, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Russell v. Dayton </em>(May 18, 1984), Montgomery App. No. 8520, 1984 WL 4896, at *3. \u201cBy contrast, the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes a party from asserting certain facts where the party, by his conduct, has induced another to change his position in good faith reliance upon the party\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Turner Liquidating Co. v. St. Paul Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 292, 295, 638 N.E.2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 33} As noted by Ingle, in cases where a loss has occurred prior to acceptance of the late payment, the insurer must have knowledge of the prior loss in order to apply the doctrine of waiver. See <em>Miraldi v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia </em>(1971), 48 Ohio App.2d 278, 2 O.O.3d 235, 356 N.E.2d 1234. However, acceptance of a late payment after loss does not, by itself, result in waiver. Id.; <em>Permanent Gen. Ins. Co. v. Bedwell </em>(2001), 111 Ohio Misc.2d 8, 13, 747 N.E.2d 333 (the depositing of a check in the ordinary course of business does not, by itself, result in waiver). Rather, the conduct of the insurer must indicate that it intended to waive the lateness of the payment. Such conduct might include retention of the portion of the premium for the period of time that the policy had been cancelled. Cf. <em>Vaughn v. State Farm Ins. Co. </em>(1979), Lucas App. No. L-78-145, 1979 WL 207023 (no waiver where insurer specifically excluded and refunded to the insured the amount of the overdue premium that would be used to cover the time period when the policy had been cancelled); <em>Petersilge v. Crawford Cty. Farmers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 385, 4 O.O. 521,199 N.E. 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 34} The insurer also may forego its right to cancel the contract when it misleads the insured into believing that he will have coverage for an accident by belatedly paying his premium. See <em>Messerly v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1995), 69 Ohio Misc.2d 10, 647 N.E.2d 890. Although some courts have considered whether the insurer sought cooperation from the insured regarding the claim, the supreme court concluded in <em>Petersilge </em>that an insurer\u2019s conduct did not constitute waiver when an adjuster went to the insured\u2019s premises and ascertained the amount of loss but the adjuster made no statement or promise relating to payment for the loss. <em>Petersilge, </em>130 Ohio St. at 389, 4 O.O. 521, 199 N.E. 845; see also <em>Gologram v. West &amp; Knox Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), Columbiana App. No. 86-C-43, 1987 WL 12889.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 35} Insurers may also be precluded from cancelling a policy due to untimely payment of premiums when the parties had established a course of conduct that late payments would be accepted without causing a lapse in coverage. <em>Schwer, </em>153 Ohio St. 312, 41 O.O. 303, 91 N.E.2d 523, at paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Clarke v. Smith </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 337, 690 N.E.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>{\u00b6 36} In his reply brief, Ingle relies upon <em>West &amp; Knox Twp. Farmers\u2019 Aid Soc. v. Burkhart </em>(1931), 13 Ohio Law Abs. 385, in which the Seventh District held that a mutual aid fire insurer waived the forfeiture of the insured\u2019s policy for nonpayment when it accepted a delinquent premium payment after a loss, with knowledge of the loss, and used the loss as a basis for calculating future premiums. In <em>Gologram, </em>the Seventh District distinguished <em>Burkhart, </em>indicating that the critical fact in <em>Burkhart </em>was that the mutual aid insurer had included the fire loss at issue when it made further assessments. <em>Gologram, </em>Columbiana App. No. 86-C-43, 1987 WL 12889. Because the mutual aid insurer in <em>Gologram </em>had not included the charge for the fire when it made further assessments, the <em>Gologram </em>court found that no waiver had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">{\u00b6 37} With these standards in mind, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Farmers did not waive its right to cancel the policy due to Ingle\u2019s failure to timely pay his premium. Farmers\u2019 notices to Ingle indicated that the company would cancel his policy if the premium was not paid by the cancellation date of December 7, 2004. The December 15, 2004 notice informed Ingle that his policy had been cancelled, and it indicated that the policy could be \u201creinstated\u201d at a date and time to be determined by Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 38} When Ingle\u2019s policy had been cancelled in the past due to nonpayment of premiums, the policy was reinstated as of the date of the late payment. The premium payment was not applied retroactively to avoid a gap in coverage. Instead, the reinstatement date began a new six-month policy term.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 39} Consistent with this past approach, the policy issued after Farmers received the late premium payment on December 20, 2004, showed an effective date of December 20, 2004. The new declarations page indicated that $33.53 had been applied to the balance due for the cancellation grace period (the period between November 20 and December 7, 2004). The remaining premium was applied for the period of December 20, 2004, through June 2, 2005. The June 2, 2005 renewal date reflects a six-month period ending June 20, 2005, minus the number of days charged for the grace period. The record thus indicates that Farmers did not apply any of the late premium payment to the period of time between December 7, 2004, and December 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 40} Nancy Simpson, policy resolution specialist for Farmers, testified that Ingle\u2019s December 2004 payment was sent to a \u201czoned remittance center\u201d in Overland Park, Kansas. The center\u2019s sole function is to enter payments in the computer system and deposit the checks. Ingle\u2019s check was cashed in the ordinary course of business. The billing department did not determine Ingle\u2019s coverage, and it was not involved in the processing of Ingle\u2019s accident claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 41} Ingle reported his claim to Krauss within a few days of the accident. Although Ingle testified that Krauss had told him that he was \u201ccovered through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the accident,\u201d Krauss denied making that statement, and the trial court credited Krauss\u2019s testimony. Krauss further testified that he would not check to see whether the policy was cancelled before filing a claim. He stated that his responsibility \u201cis to file an insurance claim regardless of the policy status. * * * I don\u2019t have the authority to determine if a claim will be paid or not paid. It\u2019s my responsibility * * * if a customer requests a claim be filed we file it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 42} Ingle presented correspondence from Claims Representative Jarrod Mount, which stated that Farmers had been unable to contact Ingle regarding the accident and asked Ingle to complete and return an application-of-benefits form and to contact Mount directly. Although this documentation arguably could suggest that Farmers was processing his claim under his policy, it is more reasonably construed as indicating that Farmers\u2019 claim department was merely conducting an initial good-faith review of the claim. Farmers\u2019 claim department ultimately denied Ingle\u2019s claim because his policy had lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 43} Upon review of the record, the record amply supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Farmers did not waive its right to cancel Ingle\u2019s policy due to nonpayment of premiums, even though it accepted Ingle\u2019s late premium payment with knowledge of a loss. Because the record indicates that Ingle\u2019s policy was cancelled on December 7, 2004, and was reinstated on December 20, 2004, the trial court properly concluded that Ingle\u2019s policy was not in force at the time of the accident on December 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 44} The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 45} Having overruled the assignment of error, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-11\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
