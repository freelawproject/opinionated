Smith argues that her plea of no contest should have been refused because it was involuntarily made. Absolutely.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">\n<em>I. Hobson\u2019s Choice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">{\u00b6 3} Smith was charged with violating probation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and soliciting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both charges were set for trial, and at the time, Smith had not been jailed on either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>charge. The soliciting case was set for a jury trial. On that day, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cMr. Prouty [defense counsel]: On the other, the probation violation, I think the \u2014 it\u2019s for payment of fines and costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Court: Okay. And then she\u2019s got a soliciting. That\u2019s the one for jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cMr. Prouty: Yes. It\u2019s going to be a jury, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe Court: So that\u2019s today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMr. Prouty: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Court: Okay. Let me find \u2014 what did you want to do with the probation violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMr. Prouty: Your Honor, plea would be no contest. She\u2019s on EMD right now and she can\u2019t work. That\u2019s the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Court: It\u2019s a little bit more than fines and costs. She failed to submit for drug test and she faded to report. Do you want to approach?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 12} (Off-the-record discussion.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMr. Prouty: Is this an or else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Court: If she wants to take responsibility for the soliciting, I probably would continue her probation with some additional conditions. But if she doesn\u2019t want to do that, I think the way to go now, given that she\u2019s got all these other new charges that have come up \u2014 just charges, I realize; it\u2019s a long history on this theft, going back to 2006; there\u2019s a long history of failing to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-16\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cI think she\u2019s had prior \u2014 prior issues. This is a probation violation. I see one that\u2019s been going on since March, and she was at the Drop-Inn Center. She capiased, she capiased, and then she picked up new charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cShe\u2019s already pled to the probation violation. So, I mean, she already pled no contest. This is here for sentencing today. She, yeah, I mean, if she \u2014 if she wants to accept responsibility for this new charge, I am actually willing to continue the whole thing out for sentence on everything and wait and see what happens with the assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cBut otherwise, I think I am done with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cMr. Prouty: She wants to plead not guilty and she doesn\u2019t want to plead to anything</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-20\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe Court: She already pled to the probation violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-21\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cMr. Prouty: Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe Court: All right. So let\u2019s just do sentencing on the probation violation. I will hear mitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cMr. Prouty: Your Honor, with respect to my client, she has been on EMD for several months now. What we are asking for is that she is supposed to have a baby within the next 30 days; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cShe has been going to school. Is there anything else you want to say, Melissa?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019m due to graduate in June, and I was \u2014 and I would just like the opportunity, if you see fit, to complete my sentence on EMD, if that\u2019s okay with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe Court: It\u2019s not. Commit 180 days. If you want to rethink your other trial that\u2019s coming up; terminate probation, remit fines, commit 180 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 26} (Other cases heard.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cMr. Prouty: Your Honor, this is Melissa Smith. We are going to enter a plea of no contest or guilty to the charges as charged. We will waive the jury. I have provided a copy.\u201d (Boldface added throughout.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">{\u00b6 28} So before summoning a prospective jury panel, the trial court indicated that \u201cif [Smith] want[ed] to take responsibility for the soliciting [charge], it probably would continue her probation with some additional conditions.\u201d Smith indicated, though, that she had planned on trying the soliciting charge before a jury, but that she wanted to plead no contest to violating her probation. With the jury trial on the soliciting charge pending, the court found Smith guilty of violating her probation and proceeded to sentencing. Following mitigation, the court indicated that Smith\u2019s sentence would be 180 days\u2019 incarceration, and it added that \u201cif [Smith] want[ed] to rethink [the soliciting charge]: terminate probation, remit fines, commit 180 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">{\u00b6 29} The court then heard other cases, giving Smith time to think about her demand for a jury. Prouty aptly characterized the court\u2019s threat of 180 days as an \u201cor else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">{\u00b6 30} Smith had two choices: (1) to spend 180 days in jail on the probation violation and to have a jury trial on the solicitation charge \u2014 for which she could be sentenced to a maximum of 60 days; or (2) to waive the jury trial and get zero days on the probation violation and a possible 60 days on the solicitation charge. Not much of a choice. So even if she was not guilty on the new charge, Smith could not \u201cafford\u201d to avail herself of the right to jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">{\u00b6 31} After the other cases had been heard, Smith entered a no-contest plea to soliciting. The trial court then resentenced her for the probation violation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Rather than the 180 days\u2019 incarceration, the court continued Smith\u2019s probation for six months with additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>II. Ultimatum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 32} Rarely does a record so vividly reflect grounds for reversal. In fact, the trial court\u2019s action was so wrong that the prosecution has filed the following on appeal: \u201cThe City of Cincinnati, State of Ohio, hereby gives notice that it has reviewed the record, the transcript, and the brief of the Defendant-Appellant. The City elects not to file an appellate brief in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 33} This is a textbook example of an involuntary plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court gave Smith an ultimatum: (1) try the soliciting charge to a jury and go to jail for 180 days for the probation violation or (2) plead no contest to soliciting and remain on probation. In essence, the trial court punished Smith for pleading not guilty to solicitation and for indicating her desire to try the case to a jury. When faced with 180 days in jail, Smith folded and pleaded no contest to solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\n<em>III. Unconstitutional</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 34} The involuntary plea is reversible error regardless of whether it involved giving up the right to jury trial. But additionally, this case involved the right to a jury \u2014 sacrosanct in Anglo-American jurisprudence since at least 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 35} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed * * And Section 5, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution states, \u201cThe right of trial by jury shall be inviolate, except that, in civil cases, laws may be passed to authorize the rendering of a verdict by the concurrence of not less than three-fourths of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 36} A jury waiver must be voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith\u2019s no-contest plea to the solicitation charge was involuntary. She was threatened with a much harsher sentence in a different case for exercising a fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>{\u00b6 37} And though the point has not been raised, we also note that Smith at no time acknowledged the jury waiver in open court, as required by R.C. 2945.05.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 38} Because Smith\u2019s no-contest plea was involuntary, her conviction for solicitation is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings before a different judge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b630-6\">Sundermann, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-20\">.
