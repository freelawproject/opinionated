On appeal, Wiley contends that the trial court erred when it considered its blanket policy of sending everyone who violates R.C. 2921.36(A)(2) to prison, instead of considering the proper sentencing statutes. Because, based on the record, we are left to guess as to whether the trial court properly considered one of the sentencing statutes, i.e., R.C. 2929.12, before it sentenced Wiley, we hold that Wiley\u2019s sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. Accordingly, we vacate Wiley\u2019s sentence and remand this cause to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 2} Based on an anonymous tip, the Pickaway Correctional Institution began monitoring inmate Terr\u00f3n Hairston. Investigators soon uncovered a plot involving Wiley\u2019s attempt to smuggle drugs into the prison. Hairston told Wiley to drop the drugs in a dumpster during one of her visits. The investigators placed the dumpster under observation and saw Wiley drive up to it. They then watched as her passenger got out of the car and threw a bag into the dumpster. The officers recovered the bag from the dumpster and determined that it contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 3} A Pickaway County Grand Jury indicted Wiley for illegal conveyance of marijuana onto the grounds of a detention facility, a felony of the third degree, in violation of R.C. 2921.36(A)(2). Wiley entered a not guilty plea, and the case proceeded to a jury trial. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 4} At sentencing, Wiley (through her counsel) informed the court that she did not have a prior criminal record and was a first-time offender. She requested a presentence investigation, which the court denied. However, before pronouncing sentence, the court afforded Wiley the opportunity to speak on her own behalf and present mitigating evidence. The court then imposed a two-year prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">{\u00b6 5} Wiley appeals her sentence and asserts the following two assignments of error: I. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s application of a blanket policy in sentencing Ms. Wiley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>is an abuse of discretion and an impermissible infringement of her right to due process of law. II. The trial court violated Ms. Wiley\u2019s substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution when it imposed more than the minimum sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 6} The gravamen of Wiley\u2019s argument is that the trial court erred when it imposed her sentence. Specifically, Wiley asserts that the court considered its personal blanket policy of sending everyone to prison for violating R.C. 2921.36(A)(2), instead of considering the proper sentencing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 7} We first set forth our standard of review. Appellate courts \u201capply a two-step approach [to review a sentence]. First, [we] must examine the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with all applicable rules and statutes in imposing the sentence to determine whether the sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. If this first prong is satisfied, the trial court\u2019s decision shall be reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 8} Here, after applying the first prong of the above two-step approach, we find that Wiley\u2019s sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, the Supreme Court of Ohio eliminated mandatory judicial fact-finding prior to imposing maximum, nonminimum, or consecutive sentences in felony cases. Nevertheless, trial courts are still required to consider R.C. 2929.11, R.C. 2929.12, and any statute specific to that case. See, e.g., <em>Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Mathis, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 10} Here, at the sentencing hearing, the trial court never mentioned R.C. 2929.11 or R.C. 2929.12. The judgment entry states that the trial court considered R.C. 2929.11, but it does not state that the court considered R.C. 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">{\u00b6 11} At the sentencing hearing, the court stated that it has been \u201cthis court\u2019s policy for thirteen years [that] people convicted of this offense go to prison.\u201d However, some of the court\u2019s statements seem to indicate that it might have considered some of the seriousness factors contained in R.C. 2929.12. The court concluded that because Wiley took her young child to the prison with her to deliver the drugs, and because she was delivering the drugs to a convicted murderer while incarcerated, her crime was serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">{\u00b6 12} Although the record is devoid of any discussion of R.C. 2929.11, the judgment entry, which should reflect what occurred at the sentencing hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>states, \u201cThe Court finds that a prison term is consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing under ORC Section 2929.11.\u201d It is silent as to the seriousness and recidivism factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">{\u00b6 13} Therefore, based on the above record, we are left to guess whether the trial court properly considered R.C. 2929.12 prior to imposing the sentence. Consequently, we hold that Wiley\u2019s sentence is clearly and convincingly contrary to law. As a result, we do not need to consider the second prong of the above \u201ctwo-step approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we sustain the parts of Wiley\u2019s assignments of error that involve the court\u2019s failure to properly consider R.C. 2929.12. We find Wiley\u2019s remaining arguments moot. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). We vacate Wiley\u2019s sentence and remand this cause to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-7\">Abele and McFarland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
