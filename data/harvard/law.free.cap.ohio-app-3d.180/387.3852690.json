Both the Wagoners and the Oberts appealed the jury\u2019s verdict and the trial court\u2019s denial of their motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative, motions for new trial. Additional appellees are Winona Donnall and Home Connection Realty and Martin and Rosemary Kellenbarger.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 2} The facts and procedural history of the matter are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 3} This appeal concerns a dispute over approximately two acres of land located in Fairfield County, Ohio. The two-acre parcel in dispute was originally a portion of a 14-acre tract of land owned by Mr. and Mrs. Hill. In 1975, the Hills hired George Better to survey and split their 14-acre tract of land. As part of the survey protocol, Better used half-inch iron survey pipes to mark the boundary lines of the property. Better also prepared a legal description of the property and filed it with the Fairfield County Engineer\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 4} On May 17, 1975, appellees Martin and Rosemary Kellenbarger purchased 6.05 acres of the unimproved 14 acres of property from the Hills. Thereafter, Jeff McCandish purchased the remaining 7.96 acres of the original 14 acres owned by the Hills. In 1977, appellants, Donald and Glenna Wagoner, purchased the 7.96 acreage from McCandish. The 7.96 acres of property initially purchased by McCandish and later transferred to the Wagoners is located just north of the Kellenbargers\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 5} In 1975 and 1976, the Kellenbargers cleared the property, erected a house and shed, and fenced off what they believed to be the boundary of their property, which included the two acres in dispute. The address of the property is 7920 Dupler Road, Sugar Grove, Fairfield County, Ohio. As part of the home construction, the Kellenbargers paid for a septic tank for their home and believed that a septic tank had been installed, but they had no documentation of a related construction expense. Furthermore, the Fairfield County Department of Health has no record relative to any application being made by the Kellenbargers to install a private septic system or any record of a septic system being inspected by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 6} From 1975 until 2004, the Kellenbargers claimed that they made exclusive use of the land that they believed they had purchased from the Hills, including the approximately two acres in dispute. The Kellenbargers stated that they built a wood shed, raised goats, and built a dog kennel with a concrete pad on the two adjacent acres. Mr. Kellenbarger also stated that he hunted the entire property on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 7} On July 11, 2003, the Kellenbargers purchased a new residence in Fairfield County, Ohio, vacated the home at 7920 Dupler Road, and hired realtor Leanne Henry to list the now vacant property. On September 23, 2003, as part of the listing procedures, Henry reviewed, and the Kellenbargers executed, a form published by the Fairfield County Health Department stating the requirements for septic inspections. The septic-inspection form informs the home owner that if a home is being sold, an inspection of the septic system may be required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>by the lending institution and/or the health department. The form further states that if the septic system has not been pumped within the last four years, \u201cit must be pumped by a licensed septic pumper.\u201d Finally, the form advised the Kellenbargers that pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 3701-29-07, a minimum capacity septic tank for a three-bedroom home must be 1,500 gallons in one- or two-tank compartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 8} The Kellenbargers also completed a residential property disclosure form in which they stated that the septic system servicing the property consisted of a leach field, that they did not know the date of the last septic-system inspection, and that they were unaware of any current leaks, backups, or other material problems with the septic system servicing the property. The Kellenbargers did not check the boxes on the residential disclosure form that would have indicated that their property was serviced with a septic tank or a private sewer, or that they had a general knowledge of the type of septic system that serviced the property. Finally, on the form, the Kellenbargers certified that there were no boundary disputes involving the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 9} The Kellenbargers\u2019 property at 7920 Dupler Road remained vacant for approximately a year. In April 2004, the Kellenbargers hired a new realtor, Winona Donnall of Home Connection Realty. Donnall asked the Kellenbargers to complete a new residential property disclosure form. On the new form, the Kellenbargers indicated that they had a private septic and filtration bed on the property and that they were not aware of any leaks, backups, or other material problems with the septic system. The Kellenbargers also left the box marked \u201cseptic tank\u201d blank. Finally, the Kellenbargers certified that they were not aware of any boundary disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 10} Appellees and cross-appellants, Michael and Rebecca Obert, began looking for acreage in Fairfield, Ohio. On July 17, 2004, the Oberts and the Kellenbargers executed a real estate purchase contract for the 6.05 tract of land located at 7920 Dupler Road. The purchase agreement gave the Oberts a 20-day inspection grace period.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 11} On August 1, 2004, Mr. Obert and Mr. Kellenbarger walked the property. Mr. Kellenbarger stated that he used red spray paint to mark the northernmost boundary of the property. Mr. Kellenbarger also showed Mr. Obert the supposed location of the underground septic system. Mr. Kellenbarger advised Mr. Obert that the septic tank was buried between the garage/pole barn and a large poplar tree. Mr. Kellenbarger also told Mr. Obert that the line to the leach field ran down the hill behind the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 12} After the purchase contract was executed, realtor Winona Donnall contacted Independent Health Services (\u201cIHS\u201d) to perform the necessary inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>tions. Donnall requested an inspection of the water well and the septic/aeration system, and a termite inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 13} On August 3, 2004, Bruce Carpenter, a licensed sanitarian, conducted the requested inspections. Carpenter followed inspection protocols for water, sewer, and termite inspections. In a subsequent report, he stated that he was unable to find any septic tank risers and that he could not verify the size and/or type of the property\u2019s septic tank or leaching system. He further noted that the septic tank would need to be pumped and risers installed per Fairfield County regulations. In the report, he also stated that he did not locate any problems with the septic system, but that problems might not become apparent until daily operation of the system was resumed. Donnall received Carpenter\u2019s report but did not notify the Oberts of the septic concerns and/or insure that the septic tank was pumped and that risers were installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 14} On August 11, 2004, a mortgage survey was performed on the property pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4733-38-01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The mortgage survey showed the true boundary of the 6.05-acre property. The true boundaries did not include the two acres of property in dispute. Instead, the mortgage survey showed that two acres of property in dispute along the northern boundary belonged to the Wagoners. The Oberts denied ever seeing the mortgage survey prior to the closing on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 15} On August 13, 2004, the property closed. At the property closing, both the Oberts and the Kellenbargers initialed Carpenter\u2019s report. The Oberts paid the Kellenbargers $180,000 for the property and took immediate possession. The Oberts proceeded to maintain and use the two acres in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 16} On March 4, 2005, the Oberts received a $40 bill from the Fairfield County Health Department, advising them that they had not renewed their private-septic-system operation permit. The Oberts had never been advised that a septic-system permit was necessary for their property and contacted the Fairfield County Health Department for more information. Steve Deeter, a registered sanitarian employed by the health department, responded to the Oberts\u2019 property to conduct a septic-system inspection. Upon inspection, Deeter discovered that the property\u2019s sewage was being dumped at the end of a pipe approximately 150 feet from the Oberts\u2019 house into a ravine. Deeter did not find any septic system for the property and advised the Oberts that it was against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>county health regulations to live in a house that is not serviced by an approved septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 17} The Oberts then worked with the Fairfield County Health Department to install a septic system. The leach system for the septic system was installed underground on the two-acre parcel of property that is in dispute, which the Oberts believed they owned, but which was legally titled to the Wagoners. They chose the two acres because it was the only other level area of land on which they could install a leach bed for the septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 18} The excavation and other work for the septic system took place in May and June 2005. The cost of the new septic system was approximately $7,738.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 19} During this time, Mrs. Wagoner became aware that an area of property was being excavated by the Oberts. The Wagoners were concerned that the excavation was being done on their land. On or about June 15, 2005, the Wagoners hired surveyor Vince Evans to determine the extent, if any, of the encroachment. Evans\u2019s survey revealed an encroachment of 0.432 acres on the Wagoners\u2019 property by the Oberts\u2019 underground leach bed for the septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 20} On or about June 29, 2005, after the septic system had been completely installed, the Wagoners informed the Oberts that the septic system\u2019s leach bed was encroaching on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 21} After their conversation with the Wagoners, the Oberts hired George Beiter to come to the property and advise them as to the location of the boundary line between their property and the Wagoners\u2019 property. Beiter discovered that the original iron pins that he had set in 1970 along the boundary line had been moved north without his authority. Better\u2019s survey concurred with the survey completed by Evans that the two acres in dispute were within the property boundaries for the Wagoners\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">{\u00b6 22} Having verified the boundary error, the parties tried to cure the problem and resolve the dispute through a sale of the encroached area, but the attempts at resolution were unsuccessful, and the Oberts did not move the leach bed. As a result, on October 6, 2005, the Wagoners filed an action for trespass, ejectment, and quiet title. In the first count of the complaint, the Wagoners stated that the Oberts had committed trespass by physically invading their real property when the Oberts built a leach field across the property line and onto their 7.96 acres of adjoining real estate. The relief sought by the Wagoners for the trespass included damages for trespass, a fair rental value for the use of the property, and an order of ejectment. In the second count, the Wagoners set forth a cause of action for quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">{\u00b6 23} On November 3, 2005, the Oberts filed a timely answer and set forth the affirmative defenses of failure to state a cause upon which relief can be granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>estoppel, laches, and waiver. The Oberts also filed a third-party complaint against the Kellenbargers for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and fraud. The Oberts sought relief from the Kellenbargers in part for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 24} On February 2, 2006, pursuant to a scheduling order, the matter was set for trial on October 24, 2006. On April 4, 2006, depositions were held for the Kellenbargers, Oberts, and Wagoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 25} On April 19, 2006, the Oberts amended their third-party complaint to include realtor Winona Donnall and Home Connection Realty on the theory of professional negligence. Donnall filed a timely answer and filed a cross-claim against the Kellenbargers.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 26} On April 19, 2006, the Oberts also responded to the fourth interrogatory of the Wagoners\u2019 written discovery request, stating that the Wagoners had done nothing to assert ownership of the property at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 27} On August 18, 2006, the Wagoners moved for partial summary judgment, requesting the trial court to find that the Oberts had trespassed on their property by installing an underground leach bed and requesting an order of ejectment. The motion was supported by affidavits that asserted that there was no dispute about the location of the property line and argued that no landowner may acquire rights against a neighboring property for an encroaching septic system under the theories of prescriptive easement or adverse possession. In response, the Oberts stated that the Kellenbargers\u2019 adverse use for many years of the two acres in dispute, and continued use of the two acres, gave them the right to assert the affirmative defense of adverse possession against the Wagoners\u2019 trespass claim and to assert their right to have the leach bed remain on the two acres in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 28} On August 31, 2006, pursuant to Civ.R. 15(A), the Oberts and Kellenbargers filed a joint motion to amend the pleadings to assert a counterclaim against the Wagoners for adverse possession and quiet title. The Oberts and Kellenbargers also attached an \u201cAction for Declaratory Judgment for Adverse Possession and Quiet Title\u201d to the motion to amend, in which they moved to seek a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>declaration by the court, pursuant to the doctrine of adverse possession, that they are the owners of the property in dispute. On September 27, the Wagoners filed a response in opposition, arguing that the motion was made 60 days before trial, was untimely, and should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 29} On October 4, 2006, the trial court denied the Oberts\u2019 and Kellenbargers\u2019 joint motion to amend the pleadings. In support of the denial, the trial court stated that the motion had been filed less than 60 days prior to trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 30} On October 19, 2006, the Oberts filed a motion in limine for an order barring any adverse party from commenting about, or attempting to use in any way, shape, or form, or attempting to enter into evidence a certain document known as a mortgage survey conducted in connection with the closing on the real estate at issue. In support, the Oberts argued that \u201cgiven the specific definition of a mortgage survey given by the Ohio Administrative Code Section 4733-38-01, that a mortgage location survey is solely for the intent and use by the mortgagee and/or title insurer, it is improper to advance an argument that the buyers (Oberts) should have relied in any way, shape or form upon the representations made by the mortgage survey since they are not the mortgagee or the title insurer.\u201d The Kellenbargers filed a response in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 31} On October 20, 2006, the parties filed a joint motion for continuance of the trial date. That same date, the trial court granted the joint motion for continuance based upon the joint motion of the parties, the parties\u2019 agreement that mediation would be helpful in resolving the case, and the fact that a criminal case, <em>State v. Wiggins, </em>was set to be tried on that same date. The Oberts did not renew their motion to amend their counterclaim to include a cause of action for adverse possession after the continuance was granted. Furthermore, it appears that the Oberts never considered a claim for a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 32} On November 17, 2006, the matter was rescheduled for jury trial on February 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 33} On January 24, 2007, the trial court considered and denied the Wagoners\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and the Oberts\u2019 motion in limine. The trial court held that as to the Wagoners\u2019 claim of legal ownership of the disputed land, summary judgment was not appropriate as \u201creasonable minds cannot come to but one conclusion regarding the issues in the matter.\u201d The trial court further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>held that the evidence concerning the mortgage survey was not incompetent or improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">{\u00b6 34} On February 2, 2007, prior to trial, the Wagoners filed a motion in limine to preclude any party from placing any evidence on the record relating to the theory of adverse possession. The trial court denied the motion and ruled that adverse possession could be presented as a defense to the Wagoners\u2019 claims but not as a counter or cross-claim of the Oberts or the Kellenbargers to establish ownership. After the presentation of evidence and prior to the jury deliberations, the trial court found that the property line as shown on the surveys established that the Wagoners held legal title to the area of property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 35} After due deliberations, the jury found as follows. The Oberts did not commit a trespass against the Wagoners. The Kellenbargers were not responsible to the Oberts for any negligence claims. The Kellenbargers committed fraud against the Oberts. The jury awarded the Oberts the sum of $6,800 in compensatory damages and $0 in punitive damages and recommended an award of attorney fees. Finally, the jury found in favor of the Oberts against Donnall for the negligence claim and awarded the Oberts $1,197.97 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 36} Both the Wagoners and the Oberts filed timely motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) and for a new trial. In their motion, the Oberts argued that the jury\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence and inconsistent as a matter of law. Specifically, the Oberts argued that the jury\u2019s verdict on the fraud claim granting $0 in punitive damages but recommending that the trial court grant attorney fees to the Oberts was inconsistent and indicated that the jury clearly lost its way. The Wagoners also argued that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 37} On April 18, 2007, the trial court entered judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c1.

In order to establish adverse possession, there must have been an intention on the part of the person in possession to claim title, \u201cso manifested by his declarations or his acts, that a failure of the owner to prosecute within the time limited, raises a presumption of an extinguishment or a surrender of his claim.\u201d <em>Grace v.

Balliett, </em>65 Ohio St. 451, 63 N.E. 86, and <em>Moms v. Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147. We do not find these cases to be persuasive because the affirmative defense asserted in the case sub judice was based on the adverse use by the Kellenbargers and the Oberts for daily recreational activities, the construction of a storage shed, the construction of a dog kennel, and, in part, sewage disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 70} In <em>Mansfield v. Balliett, </em>Balliett brought an action against the city of Mansfield to recover damages for an alleged nuisance caused by the drainage of the city\u2019s sewage from a population of approximately 18,000 people into a natural watercourse, known as \u201cRocky Fork of the Mohican River,\u201d that ran through Balliett\u2019s property. Balliett argued that prior to the construction of the city\u2019s sewage drainage system, the stream came from natural springs of water and was pure and wholesome and of great continuing value to Balliett for the purpose of watering his stock. Balliett argued that the sewage emptied into the stream poisoned, polluted, and rendered the water unwholesome and unfit for ordinary use. The city argued that \u201c[t]he right of [Balliett] to have the water descend on him in its pristine clearness must yield to the demands of a denser population and the march of civilization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 71} Upon review, the Supreme Court found that the issue in <em>Mansfield v. Balliett </em>pertained to a property owner\u2019s riparian rights and the constitutional right to compensation for damages caused by a municipality\u2019s \u201ctaking\u201d of the private property for public use. The court found that pursuant to the doctrine of eminent domain, private property such as a waterway may be acquired for public use. However, the court reasoned that once vested, these riparian rights can be taken for public use only when just compensation is made. The court further reasoned that \u201c \u2018[t]he pollution of water by artificial drainage which causes sewage to flow into a stream, spring or well, whether done by a municipal corporation or an individual, constitutes a nuisance which entitles the owner to damages therefor, the rule being that a municipal corporation has no more right to injure the waters of a stream or the premises of an individual than a natural person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mansfield v. Balliett, </em>65 Ohio St. at 467, 63 N.E. 86, quoting Wood, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Nuisances (1875) Section 427. The court adopted the reasoning that \u201cwhen in the lawful exercise of these powers private property must be injured for the common benefit of all, all should be held liable to make reparation.\u201d <em>Mansfield v. Balliett </em>at 478, 63 N.E. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>{\u00b6 72} In <em>Morris v. Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, James Morris and his wife filed a declaratory judgment action against Edward Andros and his wife for trespass, ejectment, and nuisance abatement. The controversy involved a shared property boundary. Morris complained that Andros had constructed a septic system whereby a septic line that originated on Andros\u2019s property protruded through a hillside located on Morris\u2019s property and deposited septic waste on Morris\u2019s property. Morris argued that he had not given Andros permission to install the septic system and that the septic system was unreasonably altering the drainage across his property. In a posthearing brief, Andros raised a claim for a prescriptive easement for his septic-discharge system and asserted ownership by adverse possession to the disputed one-half acre of property. The trial court ruled that Andros was entitled to a prescriptive easement but had failed to state a claim to take title by way of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">{\u00b6 73} On appeal, Andros argued that the trial court erred in ruling that he had failed to establish a claim for adverse possession. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision, finding in part that Andros had failed to prove exclusive use of the property for 21 years. The court found that the evidence established that a prior owner had run a septic system on Morris\u2019s property. However, the evidence also established that the prior owner was not trying to take the property. Therefore, the appellate court found that Andros was the first person who had tried to take the property for septic purposes and, therefore, had failed to establish an adverse use for 21 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">(\u00b6 74} On cross-appeal, Morris argued that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted Andros a prescriptive easement for the purpose of allowing Andros to dump his septic discharge onto Morris\u2019s land. Specifically, Morris argued that the prescriptive easement was contrary to the rule of law set forth in <em>Vian v. Sheffield Bldg. &amp; Dev. Co. </em>(1948), 85 Ohio App. 191, 40 O.O. 144, 88 N.E.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 75} The court applied the prior holding in <em>Vian. </em>In <em>Vian, </em>the court held that \u201cone may not obtain by prescription, or otherwise than by purchase, a right to cast sewage upon the lands of another without his consent.\u201d <em>Vian, </em>85 Ohio App. at 198, 40 O.O. 144, 88 N.E.2d 410. In <em>Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, the court reaffirmed the <em>Vian </em>decision and held that the trial court\u2019s decision granting Andros a prescriptive easement to discharge septic waste onto Morris\u2019s property was improperly granted and that such an easement is unobtainable as a matter of law. See also <em>Bey v. Wright Place Inc. </em>(1956), 108 Ohio App. 10, 9 O.O.2d 90, 160 N.E.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 76} We find that neither <em>Mansfield v. Balliett, </em>65 Ohio St. 451, 63 N.E. 86, nor <em>Moms v. Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>persuasive in the case sub judice. The evidence presented in response to appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and at trial established that both the Oberts and the Kellenbargers had used the property for sewage disposal and had posted fencing, erected both a storage building and a dog kennel, and had maintained and used the property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 77} Accordingly, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the Oberts to assert the defense of adverse possession to the trespass claim. We further find that the trial court did not err as a matter of law in denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and/or JNOY.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 78} Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is not well taken and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 79} In the second assignment of error, the Wagoners argue that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to find that public policy as stated in the regulations of the Ohio Department of Health prohibit the use of prescription, adverse possession, and similar doctrines to obtain land for sewage disposal. The Wagoners further argue that as such, the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying their motions for summary judgment and JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 80} Specifically, the Wagoners argue that the Ohio Department of Health regulations in effect when the Oberts installed their leach bed on their property \u201cmake it clear that leach fields which go over property lines must be the subject of recorded easement and/or written consent obtained on a voluntary basis from the adjoining property owner\u201d citing Ohio Adm.Code 3701-29-02. The Wagoners further argue that by allowing the Oberts\u2019 adverse-possession defense to stand, the lower court countenanced an act by the county health department that was clearly ultra vires, i.e., the county health department\u2019s issuance of the permit to the Oberts to install their leach field occurred without enforcing the requirement for an easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 81} In response, the Oberts argue that Ohio Adm.Code 3701-29-02, entitled \u201cEasement Requirement,\u201d does not apply to this situation. In the alternative, the Oberts argue that if the Ohio Administrative Code does not apply, the county health department could grant a variance upon a showing of practical difficulties. Finally, the Oberts argue that the Wagoners\u2019 failure to timely object to the excavation effectively estopped them from complaining about the location of the leach bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">{\u00b6 82} Ohio Adm.Code 3701-29-02(E) prohibits the discharge of raw sewage onto open ground and states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>{\u00b6 83} \u201c(E) No person shall discharge, or permit to be discharged, treated or untreated sewage, the overflow drainage or contents of a sewage tank, or other putrescible, impure, or offensive waste into an abandoned water supply, well, spring, or cistern or into a natural or artificial well, sink hole, crevice, or other opening extending into limestone, sandstone, shale, or other rock formation, or normal ground water table.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 84} Ohio Adm.Code 3701-29-02(G), entitled \u201cEasement Requirements,\u201d states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c(G) Off-lot disposal of sewage effluent shall not be permitted except where the installation of an on-lot system is not possible, as specified in paragraph (A) of rule 3701-29-10, paragraph (B) of rule 3701-29-10, and paragraph (B) of rule 3701-29-11 of the Administrative Code, and the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 86} \u201c(1) When off-lot disposal of sewage effluent requires the crossing of adjacent properties to reach the point of discharge a recorded easement or the use of a legally established, publicly maintained drainage improvement from the dwelling lot line to the point of discharge shall be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 87} \u201c(2) Written permission to discharge sewage effluent from the person or persons in control of the property or properties at the point of discharge shall be required * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 88} Ohio AdmuCode 3701-29-01 defines the point of discharge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 89} \u201c(T) \u2018Point of Discharge\u2019 means the point at which the effluent from a household sewage disposal system or curtain drain enters a public ditch or discharges to the surface of the ground or to a body of water.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">{\u00b6 90} Ohio Adm.Code 3701-29-20, entitled \u201cVariance,\u201d states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cThe board of health may grant a variance from the requirements of rules 3701-29-01 to 3701-29-21 of the Administrative Code (Ohio Sanitary Code) as will not be contrary to the public interest, where a person shows that because of practical difficulties or other special conditions their strict application will cause unusual and unnecessary hardship. However, no variance shall be granted that will defeat the spirit and general intent of said rules, or be otherwise contrary to the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">{\u00b6 92} Essentially, appellants argue that by permitting the use of adverse possession as an affirmative defense to trespass, the trial court negates the administrative requirement that the health department, prior to the issuance of a permit, must first determine whether there is an existing easement, a necessary public drainage use, or written permission from the adjacent property owner. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 93} Upon a review of the record, it does not appear that the Oberts have requested a variance from the board of health. It also does not appear that the Oberts have been served with a notice of violation of the Ohio Administrative Code. However, it does appear that a variance is required or a violation has occurred because the Ohio Revised Code regulation at issue strictly applies to the discharge of effluent in three specific circumstances including discharge onto the surface of the ground, discharge into a public ditch, or discharge into a body of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 94} In the case sub judice, the evidence established that the Oberts\u2019 leach bed was installed underground and cured a waste-disposal system that was discharging sewage into a ravine on the Wagoners\u2019 adjacent private land. Therefore, the leach bed itself, which is the origin of the alleged trespass, does not appear to violate the OAC regulation. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the Oberts to assert adverse possession as an affirmative defense to the installation of an underground leach bed that does not appear to violate nor negate the administrative regulations of the OAC. Accordingly, the trial court did not err as a matter of law in overruling the Wagoners\u2019 motion for summary judgment and motion for JNOY.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 95} For these reasons, we do not find appellants\u2019 argument well taken and hereby overrule the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 96} In the third assignment of error, the Wagoners argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion for JNOV based on their argument that existing adverse possession and prescriptive case law should be modified to conform with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115. The Wagoners argue that eminent-domain law is analogous to adverse-possession law.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 97} In response, the Oberts state that the Wagoners are attempting to advance a public-policy argument that adverse possession should be abandoned in Ohio. Appellees urge this court to disregard this argument based on the decision by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Houck v. Bd. of Park Commrs. of Huron Cty. Park Disk, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 98} In <em>Norwood v. Homey, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, the city of Norwood filed an eminent-domain action against a private landowner to appropriate their property for just compensation and transfer the property to a private developer as part of an urban-redevelopment plan for a deteriorating area. Judgment was entered for the city, and the landowner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>{\u00b6 99} The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution addresses eminent domain and states that \u201c[n]o person shall be * * * deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d The amendment confirms the sovereign\u2019s authority to take, but conditions the exercise of that authority upon satisfaction of two conjunctive standards: that the taking is for \u201cpublic use\u201d and that \u201cjust compensation\u201d for the taking is given to the property owner. <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 100} In <em>Norwood, </em>the court addressed in part whether economic or financial benefit alone is sufficient to satisfy the \u201cpublic use\u201d requirement. The Supreme Court held that an economic or financial benefit alone is insufficient to satisfy the public-use requirement of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and that any taking based solely on financial gain is void as a matter of law, and the courts owe no deference to a legislative finding that the proposed taking will provide financial benefit to the community. <em>Norwood v. Horney, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-3799, 853 N.E.2d 1115, \u00b6 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 101} In <em>Houck, </em>landowners brought an action against the county park district to quiet title based on adverse possession of abandoned railroad property. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the park districts, and the landowners appealed. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether x-eal property owned by a park district established under R.C. Chapter 1545 can be acquired by adverse possession. The court reaffirmed the decision in <em>Heddleston v. Hendricks </em>(1895), 52 Ohio St. 460, 40 N.E. 408, recognizing that a government entity should not be expected to be as vigilant in monitoring its property for trespassers as a private property owner. <em>Heddleston </em>at 465, 40 N.E. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 102} The <em>Houck </em>court also recognized that \u201c \u2018[a]dverse [possession represents the forced infringement of a landowner\u2019 rights, a decrease in value of the servient estate, the encouraged exploitation and development of land, the generation of animosity between neighbors, a source of damage to land or loss of land ownership, the creation of forced, involuntary legal battles, and uncertainty and perhaps the loss of property rights to landowners with seisin. \u2019 \u201d <em>Houck, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 29, quoting <em>Grace v. Koch </em>(Oct. 9, 1996), Hamilton App. No. C-950802, 1996 WL 577843, *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 103} Ultimately, the <em>Houck </em>court held that \u201cpermitting adverse possession of park-district property is against public policy and the legal principles underlying adverse possession.\u201d <em>Houck, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 30. Accordingly, the court held that property owned by a park district established pursuant to R.C. 1545 is not subject to adverse possession. Id. (Pfeifer, J., dissenting.) Although presented with the opportunity, the Supreme Court did not disregard adverse possession altogether as being against public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>policy.

The Oberts argue that the trial court\u2019s ruling has left the parties in a \u201clegal quagmire as to what their respective rights are to control the two acres that are at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 106} A trial court\u2019s determination whether to grant a motion for leave to amend a complaint will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Darulis v. Ayers </em>(Feb. 2, 1999), 5th Dist. No. 1996CA00398, 1999 WL 669240, citing <em>Csejpes v. Cleveland Catholic Diocese </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 533, 541, 672 N.E.2d 724. To demonstrate abuse of discretion in denying a motion for leave to amend a complaint, an appellant must demonstrate more than error of law and that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.

Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party. Leave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires. A party shall plead in response to an amended pleading within the time remaining for response to the original pleading or within fourteen days after service of the amended pleading, whichever period may be the longer, unless the court otherwise orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>{\u00b6 109} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]t is an abuse of discretion for a court to deny a motion, timely filed, * * *, where it is possible that plaintiff may state a claim upon which relief may be granted and no reason otherwise justifying denial of the motion is disclosed.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 63 O.O.2d 262, 297 N.E.2d 113, paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 110} The Ohio Supreme Court refined the holding in <em>Peterson </em>by adopting the test found in <em>Solowitch v. Bennett </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 115,117, 8 OBR 169, 456 N.E.2d 562, that \u201c \u2018there must be at least a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the movant can marshal support for the new matters sought to be pleaded, and that the amendment is not simply a delaying tactic, nor one which would cause prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilmington Steel Prods., Inc. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum.

Sumlin </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 1, 12 OBR 1, 465 N.E.2d 377, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Turner v. Cent. Local School Dist. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 95, 99, 706 N.E.2d 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 112} In this case, on February 2, 2006, pursuant to a scheduling order, the matter was set for trial on October 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 113} On April 4, 2006, depositions were held for the Kellenbargers, Oberts, and Wagoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">{\u00b6 114} On April 19, 2006, the Oberts amended their third-party complaint to include realtor Winona Donnall and Home Connection Realty on the theory of professional negligence. Donnall filed a timely answer and filed a cross-claim against the Kellenbargers.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">{\u00b6 115} On April 19, 2006, the Oberts also responded to the fourth interrogatory of the Wagoners\u2019 written discovery request stating that the Wagoners had done nothing to assert ownership of the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">{\u00b6 116} On August 31, 2006, pursuant to Civ.R. 15(A), the Oberts and Kellenbargers filed a joint motion to amend the pleadings to assert a counterclaim against the Wagoners for adverse possession and quiet title. The Oberts and Kellenbargers also attached an \u201cAction for Declaratory Judgment for Adverse Possession and Quiet Title\u201d to the motion to amend in which they moved to seek a declaration by the court, pursuant to the doctrine of adverse possession, that they were the owners of the property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">{\u00b6 117} On September 27, 2006, the Wagoners filed a response in opposition, arguing that the motion had been filed 60 days before trial and that the Oberts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>could not support their claim for adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence. In conclusion, the Wagoners argued that \u201cgiven the late filing and the doubtfulness that the exacting evidentiary standard could be met the court should deny leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 118} On October 4, 2006, the trial court denied the Oberts\u2019 and Kellenbargers\u2019 joint motion to amend the pleadings. In support of the denial, the trial court stated that the motion had been filed less than 60 days prior to a trial that had been scheduled back on February 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 119} The trial date was subsequently continued by the court so that the parties could engage in mediation. The Oberts did not renew their request to amend the complaint to include a cause of action for adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 120} In the case sub judice, appellants moved to amend them complaint on August 31, 2006, less than 60 days before the scheduled trial date. This short notice gave the opposing party limited time to prepare for the presentation of a defense that potentially created undue prejudice to the opposing party. Accordingly, we do not find the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to amend to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 121} Accordingly, we do not find the Oberts\u2019 first assignment of error on the cross-appeal to be well taken. Cross-appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 122} In the second assignment of error in the cross-appeal, the Oberts argue that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion for JNOV relative to the issue of the Kellenbargers\u2019 liability for punitive damages. The Oberts argue that the practical effect of the trial court\u2019s decision is to bar the Oberts from recovering their attorney fees from the Kellenbargers.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">{\u00b6 123} The standard of review for a JNOV is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">{\u00b6 124} The decision to grant or deny a Civ.R. 50(B) motion for JNOV is reviewed de novo. <em>Osler v. Lorain </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 345, 347, 28 OBR 410, 504 N.E.2d 19 (equating the test regarding review of a JNOV to the test applied to review a directed verdict); directed verdict is reviewed de novo. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 512, 2002-Ohio-2842, 769 N.E.2d 835, at \u00b6 4 (setting forth the standard for directed verdict). JNOV is proper if upon viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and presuming any doubt to favor the nonmoving party, reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion, that being in favor of the moving party. Civ.R. 50(B); <em>Goodyear </em>at \u00b6 3. Such a decision does not determine factual issues, but only questions of law, even though it is necessary to review and consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>evidence in deciding the motion. <em>Goodyear </em>at \u00b6 4. \u201c \u2018Neither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination in ruling upon [JNOV].\u2019 \u201d <em>Osler, </em>28 Ohio St.3d at 347, 28 OBR 410, 504 N.E.2d 19, quoting <em>Posin v. A.B.C. Motor Court Hotel </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d at 271, 275, 74 O.O.2d 427, 344 N.E.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 125} In the motion for JNOV, the Oberts moved the trial court to reopen the jury\u2019s judgment and change the jury\u2019s award of $0 in punitive damages to a nominal award of $10 in punitive damages, thereby making the Oberts eligible for an award of attorney fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 126} In support, the Oberts made several arguments. First, the Oberts argued that the verdicts and jury interrogatories established that a unanimous jury rejected the Oberts\u2019 claim of negligence against the Kellenbargers and instead found in favor of the Oberts on the claim of fraud against the Kellenbargers. Second, they argued that testimony was presented that their damages included attorney fees. Third, they argued that the jury\u2019s verdict form and interrogatories establish that it was the jury\u2019s intention to award the Oberts attorney fees on the fraud claim, thereby supporting a nominal award of punitive damages. Finally, they argued that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding by the jury of malice, ill-will, or wrongdoing that was particularly gross or egregious on the part of the Kellenbargers for the imposition of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 127} In their first argument, the Oberts state that the verdicts and jury interrogatories established that a unanimous jury rejected the Oberts\u2019 claim of negligence against the Kellenbargers and instead found in favor of the Oberts on the claim of fraud against the Kellenbargers. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 128} The verdict filed by the trial court on April 18, 2006, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">{\u00b6 129} \u201c2. Eight of the jurors found in favor of the Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs Michael and Rebecca Obert on the claim of Fraud asserted by them against the Third Party Defendants Martin and Rosemary Kellenbarger. The jury awarded $6,800.00 in compensatory damages, $0 punitive damages, and circled that the Kellenbargers are liable for the Oberts attorney\u2019s fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">{\u00b6 130} \u201c3. Eight of the jurors found in favor of the Third-Party Defendants Martin and Rosemary Kellenbarger on the claim of Negligence asserted against them by the Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs Michael and Rebecca Obert.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>{\u00b6 131} We agree with the Oberts\u2019 statement. But, to obtain an award of punitive damages following a finding of fraud, additional findings must be made by the jury. Therefore, a finding of fraud, in and of itself, does not support the grant of a JNOV for an award of nominal punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 132} Second, the Oberts argue that they presented evidence that their damages included attorney fees. Third, they argue that the jury\u2019s verdict form and interrogatories that provide for the reimbursement of attorney fees support their motion for JNOV to award nominal punitive damages. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 133} In establishing a claim for punitive damages in an action for fraud, the plaintiff must demonstrate, in addition to proving the elements of the tort itself, \u201c \u2018that the fraud is aggravated by the existence of malice or ill will, or must demonstrate that the wrongdoing is particularly gross or egregious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Sun Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 42, 58, 671 N.E.2d 1049, quoting <em>Charles R. Combs Trucking, Inc. v. Internatl. Harvester Co. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 241, 12 OBR 322, 466 N.E.2d 883, paragraph three of the syllabus. Ohio law provides that when punitive damages are proper, an aggrieved party may also recover reasonable attorney fees. <em>Columbus Fin., Inc. v. Howard </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 178, 71 O.O.2d 174, 327 N.E.2d 654; see also <em>Maynard v. Eaton Corp., </em>Marion App. No. 9-03-48, 2004-Ohio-3025, 2004 WL 1302314. However, although a jury may be asked whether they would recommend an award of attorney fees when malicious acts have led to an award of punitive damages, it is the trial court that determines what, if any, amount shall be awarded. <em>Villella v. Waikem Motors, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 36, 41, 543 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">{\u00b6 134} During the trial, the court gave the following instruction with regard to punitive damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cIf you find that the Oberts have proven by clear and convincing evidence all of the elements of fraud, your verdict must be for them and you will then consider damages and whether or not the Kellenbargers should be responsible for the Oberts\u2019 punitive damages and attorney fees. However, if you find that the Oberts failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence any one or more of the elements of fraud, or if you are unable to determine what happened, your verdict for fraud must be for the Kellenbargers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">{\u00b6 136} \u201cAs previously explained, clear and convincing evidence must have more than simply a greater weight than the evidence opposed to it and must produce in your minds a firm belief or conviction about the truth of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">{\u00b6 137} \u201cIf you find for the Oberts, you will decide from the greater weight of the evidence what amount of money will compensate them for the actual damage directly caused by the fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>{\u00b6 138} \u201cIf you find for the Oberts and award actual damages against the Kellenbargers, you may consider whether you will separately award punitive damages. If you do not find actual damage, you cannot consider punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 139} \u201cPunitive damages may be awarded against a party to a lawsuit as a punishment to discourage others from committing similar wrongful acts. You are not required to award punitive damages to the Oberts, and you may not do so unless you find by clear and convincing evidence that the Kellenbargers acted with actual malice. Actual malice is a conscious disregard for the rights of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cIf you award punitive damages, the amount should be fair and reasonable under all the facts and circumstances. It should neither be excessive nor influenced by passion, sympathy or prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 141} \u201cSubstantial means major or of real importance, of great significance, and not trifling or small.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cIf you decide Kellenbargers are liable for punitive damages, you must also decide whether or not they are liable for the attorney\u2019s fees of counsel employed by the Oberts in the prosecution of this action. If you decide that the Kellenbargers are liable for those attorney\u2019s fees, the court will determine the amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 143} After being instructed that they must find actual malice before awarding punitive damages, the jury awarded $0 in punitive damages. The jury further circled \u201cyes\u201d to indicate their recommendation for an award of attorney fees. However, having determined that there were no punitive damages (and, thus, no actual malice), the trial court could not award attorney fees. Similarly, the trial court could not invade the province of the jury by awarding nominal punitive damages, which would in effect be a finding of actual malice, in order to permit the collection of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 144} Finally, the Oberts argue that although the jury awarded $0 in punitive damages, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding in favor of punitive damages. In response, the Kellenbargers argue that while there is evidence in the record to support a jury verdict for punitive damages, there is also evidence in the record upon which the jury could return a verdict not awarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">{\u00b6 145} As we previously stated, in establishing a claim for punitive damages in an action for fraud, the plaintiff must demonstrate, in addition to proving the elements of the tort itself, \u201c \u2018that the fraud is aggravated by the existence of malice or ill will, or must demonstrate that the wrongdoing is particularly gross or egregious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v. Sun Refining &amp; Marketing Co., </em>109 Ohio App.3d 42, 58, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>671 N.E.2d 1049, quoting <em>Charles R. Combs Trucking, Inc. v. Internatl. Harvester Co., </em>12 Ohio St.3d 241, 12 OBR 322, 466 N.E.2d 883, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 146} During the trial, Michael Obert testified that Martin Kellenbarger walked him around the property, showed him the iron pins for the property boundaries, and advised him that the property included the two acres in dispute. He testified that he hired George Better to perform a survey of the property and that Better advised him that the iron survey pins had been moved without his authorization. He testified that Mr. Kellenbarger showed him the location of the septic system and a y-box for the separation of the leach system. He testified that Mr. Kellenbarger said that the septic tank was located underground in the area between the barn and a large poplar tree. He testified that Mr. Kellenbarger told him that he had purchased the biggest septic tank he could buy and that it was a faultless septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 147} Additional evidence presented established that on two separate residential property forms, the Kellenbargers indicated that they had a septic system servicing the property, which included a leach field, that they did not know the date of the last septic-system inspection, and that they were unaware of any current leaks, backups, or other material problems with the septic system servicing the property. However, the Kellenbargers did not check the boxes on the residential disclosure forms that would have indicated that their property was serviced with a septic tank, a private sewer, or that they had a general knowledge of the type of septic system that serviced the property. Finally, on the forms, the Kellenbargers certified that there were no boundary disputes involving the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 148} Mr. Kellenbarger testified that he purchased the property in 1975 and that the iron pipes are in their original positions. He testified that he built a house on the property and applied for a well and septic-system permit. He testified that he paid for a septic system and believed that it had been installed by the builder, Mr. Henman, and inspected. He testified that he had no knowledge of sewage being pumped through a pipe onto the Wagoners\u2019 property. He testified that he and the prior adjacent property owners, Jeff and LuAnne McCandish, met and discussed the property line and mutually agreed on a location for a fence that was installed on the boundary in dispute in 1976. He testified that he built a shed and dog kennel and maintained and believed that he owned the property in dispute. He testified that the Wagoners visited his home and never claimed to own the area within the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 149} Based upon the record, we find that there was evidence presented upon which the jury could have reasonably found that the Kellenbargers did not act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>with malice or ill-will and/or commit wrongdoing that was particularly gross or egregious.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">{\u00b6 150} Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Oberts\u2019 request to reopen the judgment and award nominal punitive damages. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Oberts\u2019 motion for a JNOY.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 151} The Oberts\u2019 second assignment of error in the cross-appeal is not well taken and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 152} In the third assignment of error in the cross-appeal, the Oberts argue that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion for a new trial relative to the issue of the Kellenbargers\u2019 liability for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 153} The Oberts argued that they were entitled to a new trial based upon the provisions in \u201cCiv.R. 59(A)(5), (6), (7) and (9) and also based on the discretion of the court for good cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 154} Civ.R. 59(A) sets forth the grounds for a new trial and states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 155} \u201cA new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues upon any of the following grounds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 156} \u201c(5) Error in the amount of recovery, whether too large or too small, when the action is upon a contract or for injury or detention of property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">{\u00b6 157} \u201c(6) The judgment is not sustained by the weight of the evidence; however only one new trial may be granted on the weight of the evidence in the same case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">{\u00b6 158} \u201c(7) The judgment is contrary to law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-14\">{\u00b6 159} \u201c(9) Error of law occurring at the trial and brought to the attention of the trial court by the party making the application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-15\">{\u00b6 160} \u201cIn addition to the above grounds, a new trial may be granted in the sound discretion of the court for good cause shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">{\u00b6 161} Pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(6), the Oberts argue that the jury\u2019s award of $0 in punitive damages is against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion with regards to the Oberts\u2019 second assignment of error, we do not find the verdict to be against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">{\u00b6 162} Pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(5), the Oberts argue that the jury\u2019s decision granting $0 in punitive damages and recommending the grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>attorney fees, which can\u2019t be awarded without punitive damages, leads to an inadequate recovery because they are not able to recover attorney fees in this case, which were significant, i.e., in excess of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 163} Pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(7), the Oberts argue that the trial court\u2019s judgment award on the fraud claim is contrary to law based upon the inconsistency in the interrogatories. Specifically, the Oberts argue that pursuant to Civ.R. 49(B), there are essentially three remedies available when an answer to an interrogatory is inconsistent with the general verdict. The trial court may (1) return the jury for further consideration of its answer, (2) enter judgment in accordance with the answer, or (3) order a new trial. In response, the Kellenbargers argue that the verdict and the interrogatories are not inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 164} In the verdict form, the jury found in favor of the Oberts and against the Kellenbargers on the fraud claim. Additionally, in the verdict form, the jury awarded the Oberts $0 in punitive damages. In the jury interrogatory, the jury awarded the Oberts $0 in punitive damages. These findings are not inconsistent. Having denied an award of punitive damages, the trial court cannot proceed to award attorney fees. See <em>Columbus Fin., Inc. v. Howard </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 178, 71 O.O.2d 174, 327 N.E.2d 654; see also <em>Maynard v. Eaton Corp., </em>Marion App. No. 9-03-48, 2004-Ohio-3025, 2004 WL 1302314. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision is not contrary to law. Additionally, because the trial court is not permitted to award attorney fees, the verdict does not lead to an inadequate recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 165} Pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(9), the Oberts argue that the trial court erred and that they are entitled to a new trial because the trial court did not address the inconsistencies in the verdict at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 166} In the trial court\u2019s April 18, 2007 judgment entry, the trial court stated that \u201c[b]y answering the question on the interrogatory concerning the award of attorney fees in the affirmative, the Oberts claim that the jury\u2019s verdict is \u2018inconsistent\u2019 and that the Court should have addressed the \u2018inconsistency\u2019 with the jury. However, this court believes that to have done so would have invaded the province of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 167} As previously stated, the Supreme Court of Ohio has determined \u201cthat a litigant does not have a right to trial by jury to determine the amount of attorney fees.\u201d <em>Zoppo v. Homestead Ins. Co., </em>71 Ohio St.3d 552, 557, 644 N.E.2d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 168} Finally, the Oberts argue that the trial court abused its discretion in not granting a new trial for good cause shown, good cause being all the issues previously addressed. Specifically, the Oberts argue that \u201c[b]arring any directive for the issuance of a JNOV, the only way that legal uncertainty concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Oberts\u2019 right to use the two acres of land in dispute which are legally titled to the Wagoners, and to give any meaning to the jury\u2019s interrogatories and verdict statements that the Kellenbargers should be responsible for the Oberts\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees is through an order for new trial.\u201d For the reasons stated above, we do not find that good cause was shown for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">{\u00b6 169} For these reasons, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the Oberts\u2019 motion for a new trial. The Oberts\u2019 third assignment of error is not well taken and is hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 170} In the fourth assignment of error on cross appeal, the Oberts argue that the jury\u2019s verdict and the trial court\u2019s judgment filed on April 18, 2007, are against the manifest weight of the evidence. The Oberts incorporated by reference the arguments set forth in assignment of error number one. Essentially, the Oberts reiterate their argument that the denial of punitive damages and a recommendation that attorney fees be granted are inconsistent and that the decision with regard to punitive damages is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 171} For the reasons previously stated in the first, second, and third assignments of error, we do not find the verdict to be against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, the Oberts\u2019 fourth assignment of error is not well taken and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 172} In the fifth assignment of error in the cross-appeal, the Oberts argue that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the introduction of the mortgage survey. Specifically, the Oberts argue that pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4733-38-01, a mortgage survey is solely for the intent of and use by the mortgagee and/or the title insurer. Furthermore, the Oberts argue that there was no evidence presented at trial to establish that the Oberts ever saw the mortgage survey and/or that they were asked to initial it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 173} Decisions regarding the admission of evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial court and may not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 159, 163, 17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 174} In the case sub judice, the evidence established that the mortgage-survey costs appeared on the closing statement. Testimony was presented that generally buyers are requested to initial the mortgage survey. The Oberts testified that they never received or viewed the survey. Assuming arguendo that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of the mortgage survey, the appellants have failed to establish how the introduction of the mortgage survey affected the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the Oberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 175} For these reasons, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the mortgage survey into evidence. The Oberts\u2019 fifth assignment of error is not well taken and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 176} The judgment of the Fairfield County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-7\">Farmer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b457-8\">Hoffman, P.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">. The mortgage survey was completed by Surveyor Scott D. Grundei of Landmark Survey Group and is common to the mortgage-lending industry, providing proof to the mortgage lender and/or title insurer as to the buildings and land in the legal description. It is a document required in a standard residential real estate closing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\">. The interrogatory proposed by the Wagoners stated as follows: \"State any affirmative defense pled by you against the Plaintiffs [and] A.) If you want to pursue it; B.) If so, what do you believe are the operative facts that support such a defense; and C.) What witness and documents do you intend to produce to prove such facts.\u201d The Oberts responded to the interrogatory as follows: \"A.) Yes; B.) Wagoners have done nothing to assert their ownership of the property at issue for the past approximately 25 years. Wagoners only took action after the septic system was placed on the property. Wagoners have failed to timely exercise their rights relative to the real estate at issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\">. In the entry, the trial court stated as follows: \u201cThis matter comes before the Court upon the Joint Motion of Defendants Obert and Third-Party Defendants Kellenbarger to Amend Pleadings and to Assert a Counterclaim for Adverse Possession. Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition. Upon consideration, and in light of the fact that this matter was set for trial on October 24, 2006, in February 2006 and the Defendants filed the present motion on August 31, 2006, less than sixty days prior to trial, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Amend Pleadings is DENIED, This matter shall proceed accordingly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\">. Civ.R. 50(B) states as follows: (B) \u201cWhether or not a motion to direct a verdict has been made or overruled and not later than fourteen days after entry of judgment, a party may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion; or if a verdict was not returned such party, within fourteen days after the jury has been discharged, may move for judgment in accordance with his motion. A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was returned, the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment. If the judgment is reopened, the court shall either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment, but no judgment shall be rendered by the court on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment or may order a new trial.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\">. During the trial, cross-appellants' counsel asked the trial court to send the jury back to reconsider their award of $0 in punitive damages and the recommendation for attorney fees. The trial court declined to return the matter for further consideration. Although cross-appellants bring this to the attention of this court, the trial court's denial of cross-appellants' request to return the matter to the jury is not assigned as error on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b457-9\">Hoffman, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AkR\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 177} I concur in the majority\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned analysis and disposition of appellants and cross-appellees\u2019 three assignments of error. I further concur in the majority\u2019s analysis and disposition of appellees and cross-appellants\u2019 cross-appeal, except for its decision to deny the Oberts a new trial because of the inconsistency between the jury\u2019s $0 verdict on the Oberts\u2019 claim for punitive damages and its recommendation to award the Oberts attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">{\u00b6 178} Although I agree that a jury does not have the right to determine the amount of attorney fees, the jury does have a right to recommend an award of them. Having been instructed that attorney fees are allowable if it awards punitive damages, I believe the trial court erred in not implementing the remedies available under Civ.R. 49(B) to resolve the inconsistency. I find the proper remedy now to be a new trial under Civ.R. 59(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">{\u00b6 179} Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to overrule appellees and cross-appellants\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
