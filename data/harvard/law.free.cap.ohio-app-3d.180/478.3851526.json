The respondent employer, the Whetstone Gardens &amp; Care Center (\u201cWhetstone Gardens\u201d) has filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and the matter is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>before this court for an independent review. For the reasons that follow, we overrule the objections and adopt the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue the requested writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 3} Relator injured her back on June 30, 2006, during the course of her duties as a resident assistant for Whetstone Gardens. Her claim was initially accepted and then denied by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and she administratively appealed. On December 8, 2006, a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) heard the matter and issued an order allowing the claim for \u201clumbosacral sprain\u201d and awarding TTD compensation to commence on July 1, 2006, based upon emergency-room records and reports from an attending physician. The DHO also refused to accept the employer\u2019s contention that relator had voluntarily abandoned her employment. The employer based this contention on the assertion that relator had been terminated after repeated violations of employee work rules, culminating in an incident in which relator allegedly verbally abused a resident on the day relator was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 4} Whetstone Gardens administratively appealed the DHO\u2019s order, and a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) eventually issued an order vacating the DHO\u2019s order. The SHO again allowed the claim but denied TTD compensation, accepting the employer\u2019s contention that relator had voluntarily abandoned her employment due to her dismissal for violation of the employer\u2019s standards of employee conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 5} After assessing the evidence heard by the SHO, the magistrate in the present action has recommended that we issue the requested writ because, while the work rule relied upon by the employer did clearly define prohibited conduct, the SHO did not determine whether relator had actually violated the work rule by using an inappropriate tone of voice toward a resident. The magistrate notes that it is the employer\u2019s burden to present evidence upon which the commission can rely in determining that an employee has engaged in conduct warranting a discharge for cause. <em>State ex rel. Watkins v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-337, 2003-Ohio-3109, 2003 WL 21384850. The magistrate concludes that the SHO\u2019s order does not expressly make such a determination, nor is there \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 6} Whetstone Garden\u2019s objections in the present case essentially argue that in the absence of a hearing transcript, the magistrate had no basis to find that the suitable testimony was <em>not </em>offered at the hearing before the SHO. Respondent further argues that the documentary evidence presented regarding relator\u2019s purported employee conduct violations was sufficient to support the commission of the offense for which she was terminated and, thus, voluntary abandonment of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Respondent\u2019s objections, while cogent and clearly articulated, merely re-argue matters that were fully considered and addressed in the magistrate\u2019s decision. For the reasons set forth in the magistrate\u2019s decision, these objections are not well taken. The absence of \u201csome evidence\u201d before the SHO, as described in the magistrate\u2019s recitation of the evidence, as well as examination of the SHO\u2019s order, is supported. We agree with the magistrate\u2019s reasoning and conclusion that the SHO\u2019s order and the evidence before the SHO were insufficient to establish voluntary abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 8} After independent review, we find that respondent\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision in this matter are not well taken. We adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision as our own, including his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and grant the requested writ of mandamus, ordering the commission to vacate the SHO\u2019s order of January 23, 2007, and to enter a new order consistent with the present decision adjudicating the merits of relator\u2019s application for TTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Objections overruled; writ of mandamus granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-6\">Bryant and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b519-7\">Grey, J., retired, of the Fourth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO TENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT</p>\n<p id=\"Aj4\">State ex rel.

On June 30, 2006, relator sustained an industrial injury while employed as a resident assistant for respondent the Whetstone Gardens &amp; Care Center (\u201cWhetstone Gardens\u201d or \u201cemployer\u201d), a state-fund employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 11} 2. On July 1, 2006, relator presented to a hospital emergency room. According to the report of the emergency-room physician, relator stated that the previous day she felt something pull in her back as she was rolling a patient to change the patient\u2019s clothes. She did not have any pain initially, but upon awakening on the morning of July 1, 2006, her pain prompted her to go to the emergency room. The emergency-room physician diagnosed \u201c[ajcute low back strain\u201d and prescribed medication for pain. He placed her on \u201clight duty for the next 3 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 12} 3. On July 7, 2006, relator filed an application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Apparently, the employer refused to certify the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">{\u00b6 13} 4. Initially, on August 2, 2006, the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cbureau\u201d) mailed an order allowing the claim. However, on August 11, 2006, the bureau vacated its prior order and disallowed the claim. Relator administratively appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">{\u00b6 14} 5. Earlier, on February 15, 2006, some four and one-half months prior to the industrial injury, relator received a written warning, dated February 13, 2006, from her employer. The warning alleged that a patient \u201cpressure sensitive alarm\u201d was left unplugged. It also alleged that a patient had not been \u201cchanged\u201d during the last round. The written warning advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">We at Whetstone believe strongly that this kind of action towards our residents can not be tolerated and you are being given a FINAL warning. Any repeat of this or any type of resident neglect or mistreatment in any way will result in immediate termination. This warning is to be in place until the Director of Nurses or Administrator chooses to remove it, and that decision will only be based on significant improvement in your care and overall performance over the period of at least 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">(Capitalization sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">{\u00b6 15} Relator signed the written warning to indicate that she understood its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>{\u00b6 16} 6. On May 1, 2006, relator received another written warning that is dated April 25, 2006. The warning states: \u201cYour attendance record has been evaluated and at this time you have (7) Absences. Based on the Whetstone policy, this warrants corrective action and is a warning. Progressive disciplinary action will occur on an ongoing basis as needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">{\u00b6 17} 7. According to two employer documents described below, on June 30, 2006, the date of the industrial injury, relator\u2019s supervisor (unit manager of station two) overheard relator using \u201can inappropriate tone of voice\u201d towards a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 18} 8. The record contains the following employer-prepared document that on its face fails to indicate its author and the date of authorship. Apparently, the document was prepared after the employer was notified of the industrial injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Linda worked on June 30, 2006 from 6:53 a.m. to 7:47 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">On this day the Unit Manager of station two overheard Linda in a resident\u2019s room using an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident. The time was around 7:20 a.m. When the unit manager went into the room Linda was just starting personal care, none had been completed she also observed Linda quickly pull her arm back as if she didn\u2019t want her to see what she was doing. At this time this incident was reported to the Director of Nursing. Linda was put on suspension pending outcome of investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Linda did not complete a first report of injury nor was she drug tested which is WJietstone\u2019s policy for an injury requiring medical treatment. Nor did she mention at this time that there was any type of problem or injury sustained from this resident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 19} 9. At oral argument before the magistrate, employer\u2019s counsel informed the magistrate that the above-described document was prepared by a Ms. Wachalec who was the employer\u2019s human-resources director. The name of the unit manager has not been disclosed to this magistrate. Also, employer\u2019s counsel agreed that the unit manager did not appear at the administrative proceedings described below because he or she had left his or her employment at Whetstone Gardens at the time of the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 20} 10. The record also contains an employer document dated July 3, 2006, on a so-called \u201cWarning Form.\u201d Apparently, the July 3, 2006 document was prepared by relator\u2019s supervisor, Ms. Hennessey. On the form, Hennessey wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">On February 15, 2006 you received a final warning for resident care issues. The warning indicated that any future resident neglect or mistreatment would result in termination. On Friday June 30th you\u2019re [sic] supervisor heard/witness[ed] inappropriate tone of voice in a remark directed towards patient J.G.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkG\">{\u00b6 21} Under \u201cCorrective Actions Required,\u201d Hennessey wrote: \u201cTermination do [sic] to inappropriate tone of voice toward resident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The above-described document indicates that Hennessey signed it on July 3, 2006, and that relator refused to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 23} 11. The record also contains a portion of its employee handbook. The handbook states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Any employee involved in any of the following is subject to disciplinary action. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive; these are merely examples of unacceptable behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">18. Physical, mental, or verbal abuse/harassment of residents, visitors, families, or fellow employees; resident neglect/abuse, violation of patients\u2019 rights, or failure to report same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 24} 12. On December 8, 2006, relator\u2019s administrative appeal from the bureau\u2019s August 11, 2006 order was heard by a district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d). Following the hearing, the DHO issued an order allowing the claim for \u201clumbosacral sprain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 25} The DHO also awarded TTD compensation beginning July 1, 2006, based upon the July 1, 2006 emergency-room records and reports from attending physician Mary Ann Wynd, M.D., certifying that relator is temporarily and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 26} The DHO further addressed the employer\u2019s affirmative defense alleging that relator had voluntarily abandoned her employment at Whetstone Gardens. The DHO\u2019s order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">The District Hearing Officer finds that the employer has not met its burden of proving that the affirmative defense of voluntary abandonment applies in this case and that the standards of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s case <em>[State ex rel. Louisianar-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 401, 650 N.E.2d 469] have been met so as to foreclose the payment of temporary total disability compensation. There is on file a 07/03/2006 warning form from the employer stating that the [Ijnjured Worker would be terminated, a copy of the employer\u2019s applicable work rules (filed 08/25/2006), and a 10/05/2005 signature of the Injured [Wjorker signing for the employee handbook. However, the undated and unsigned statement filed 08/09/2006 from an unknown person with the employer states that the Injured Worker was just suspended. In addition, in response to a questionnaire from the managed care organization, on 07/11/2006 (which is after the alleged 07/03/2006 termination) the employer\u2019s human resources director states that the Injured Worker has not been terminated and that light duty is available to the Injured Worker. Therefore, the District Hearing Officer finds that the employer has not even proved that the Injured Worker has been terminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>{\u00b6 27} 13. The employer administratively appealed the DHO\u2019s order of December 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 28} 14. Following a January 23, 2007 hearing, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) issued an order vacating the DHO\u2019s order of December 8, 2006. The SHO\u2019s order indicates that besides counsel, Hennessey and Wachalec appeared for the employer. The SHO\u2019s order indicates that relator appeared with counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b629} The SHO\u2019s order allows the claim but denies TTD compensation, explaining:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">The claimant\u2019s request for temporary total disability compensation 06/30/2006 forward is specifically denied. The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the claimant is not entitled to receive temporary total disability compensation because she voluntarily abandoned her former position of employment as a convalescent worker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">The Staff Hearing Officer finds that the claimant was terminated from her employment on 07/03/2006 for the violation of a written work rule of the employer. The employer\u2019s work rule clearly defined the prohibited conduct. This finding is supported by the employer\u2019s written \u201cStandards of Employee Conduct.\u201d The violation of the written work rule had been previously identified by the employer as a dischargeable offense. This finding is supported by the \u201cStandards of Employee Conduct\u201d that indicates a violation of the standards of conduct can result in immediate dismissal from employer, regardless of the fact that it may be a \u201cfirst offense.\u201d In addition, the prohibited conduct was known to the claimant. This finding is supported by the claimant\u2019s 10/05/2005 signature that acknowledges that the claimant received the Staff Member Handbook that sets forth the \u201cStandards of Employee Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">The Staff Hearing Officer further notes that the claimant received a \u201cfinal warning\u201d in writing on 02/13/2006 regarding resident neglect or mistreatment. That written warning indicated that any further incident of resident neglect or mistreatment <em>will </em>result in immediate termination. Therefore, based upon this 02/13/2006 warning the Staff Hearing Officer is not persuaded that the claimant\u2019s termination was related to her work injury since the claimant was warned of a possible termination 5 months before her 06/30/2006 industrial injury. The claimant received another warning on 07/03/2006. That warning involved another incident of resident mistreatment which occurred on the date of the claimant\u2019s industrial injury. Thereafter, the claimant was terminated effective 07/03/2006. Therefore, the Staff Hearing Officer finds that the employer has met their burden as set forth in <em>State ex rel. Louisianar-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>Comm. </em>72 [Ohio St.]3d 401 [650 N.E.2d 469] to establish a voluntary abandonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 30} 15. On February 9, 2007, another SHO mailed an order refusing relator\u2019s administrative appeal from the SHO\u2019s order of January 23, 2007. The employer\u2019s appeal was also refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 31} 16. On March 14, 2008, relator, Linda Pounds, filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 32} It is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">{\u00b6 33} A voluntary departure from employment precludes receipt of TTD compensation. An involuntary departure does not. <em>State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>State ex rel. Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 401, 650 N.E.2d 469, the claimant was fired for violating the employer\u2019s policy prohibiting three consecutive unexcused absences. The court held that the claimant\u2019s discharge was voluntary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">[W]e find it difficult to characterize as \u201cinvoluntary\u201d a termination generated by the claimant\u2019s violation of a written work rule or policy that (1) clearly defined the prohibited conduct, (2) had been previously identified by the employer as a dischargeable offense, and (3) was known or should have been known to the employee. Defining such an employment separation as voluntary comports with <em>[State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533] and <em>[State ex rel. Watts v. Schottenstein Stores Corp. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 118, 623 N.E.2d <em>1202] </em>\u2014 i.e., that an employee must be presumed to intend the consequences of his or her voluntary acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>State ex rel. McKnabb v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 559, 561, 752 N.E.2d 254, the court held that the rule or policy supporting an employer\u2019s voluntary abandonment claim must be written. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">Now at issue is Louisianar-Pacific\u2019s reference to a <em>written </em>rule or policy. Claimant considers a written policy to be an absolute prerequisite to precluding TTC. The commission disagrees, characterizing Louisiana-Pacific\u2019s language as merely illustrative of a TTC-preclusive firing. We favor claimant\u2019s position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">The commission believes that there are common-sense infractions that need not be reduced to writing in order to foreclose TTC if violation triggers termination. This argument, however, contemplates only some of the considerations. Written rules do more than just define prohibited conduct. They set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>forth a standard of enforcement as well. Verbal rules can be selectively enforced. Written policies help prevent arbitrary sanctions and are particularly important when dealing with employment terminations that may block eligibility for certain benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 86} To begin, relator argues that the work rule allegedly violated fails to clearly define prohibited conduct as required by <em>Louisiana-Pacific. </em>As previously noted, relator allegedly violated rule 18 of the employee handbook when, on June 80, 2006, she allegedly used \u201can inappropriate tone of voice\u201d towards a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 37} To reiterate, rule 18 provides: \u201cPhysical, mental, or verbal abuse/harassment of residents, visitors, families, or fellow employees; resident neglect/abuse, violation of patients\u2019 rights, or failure to report same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 38} In the magistrate\u2019s view, rule 18 does clearly define prohibited conduct. That the determination of verbal abuse may involve a subjective component in the mind of a witness to the alleged abuse or even the recipient of the alleged verbal abuse does not render rule 18 so vague as to require this court to declare that it fails to define prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">{\u00b6 39} In the magistrate\u2019s view, the real issue here is whether the relied-upon evidence constitutes some evidence supporting a commission\u2019s determination that relator violated the work rule on June 30, 2006, by using an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">{\u00b6 40} It was the duty of the SHO to determine whether relator actually used an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident on June 30, 2006, that would justify her termination from employment. <em>State ex rel. Hin[o]josa v. Wulff Ents., Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-166, 2008-Ohio-240, 2008 WL 192544; <em>State ex rel. Watkins v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-337, 2003-Ohio-3109, 2003 WL 21384850. Stated otherwise, it is insufficient for the SHO to simply determine that the employer terminated relator for violation of a work rule that clearly defines prohibited conduct. Id. It was the employer\u2019s burden to present evidence to the SHO upon which he could rely in determining that relator actually committed the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">{\u00b6 41} A careful reading of the SHO\u2019s order of January 23, 2007, leaves substantial doubt that the SHO actually determined that relator used an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident on June 30, 2006. If the SHO was, in fact, persuaded that relator used an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident on June 30, 2006, the SHO did not directly say so in his order. At best, such a finding is only implied or inferred from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>{\u00b6 42} Even if the SHO\u2019s order of January 23, 2007, can be read to contain a finding that relator actually used an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident on June 30, 2006, there is not \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 43} The document described at paragraph eight of the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact is referred to in the DHO\u2019s order as the \u201cundated and unsigned statement filed 08/09/2006 from an unknown person with the employer.\u201d This document shall be referred to herein as \u201cthe employer\u2019s undated statement.\u201d Due to the representations of employer\u2019s counsel at oral argument, we now know that the employer\u2019s undated statement was prepared by the employer\u2019s human-resources director, Ms. Wachalec, who appeared at the SHO\u2019s hearing. We still do not know the date that the document was prepared by Wachalec, but the DHO has told us that the employer\u2019s undated statement was filed on August 9, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 44} The employer\u2019s undated statement states that on June 30, 2006, \u201cthe Unit Manager of station two overheard Linda in a resident\u2019s room using an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident.\u201d The words spoken in an inappropriate tone of voice are not disclosed. We are only told that there was an inappropriate tone of voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 45} The name of the unit manager who presumably told Wachalec what he had heard and concluded about relator\u2019s tone of voice is not revealed in the employer\u2019s undated statement, nor has it been revealed to this magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 46} We have been told by employer\u2019s counsel that the unit manager did not appear at the administrative proceedings and thus did not testify regarding the tone of voice that he heard on June 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">{\u00b6 47} The document described at paragraph ten of the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact was prepared by relator\u2019s supervisor, Ms. Hennessey, on July 3, 2006. Hennessey signed this document, which hereafter shall be referred to as \u201cthe employer\u2019s July 3, 2006 termination document.\u201d- As previously noted, this document states: \u201cOn Friday June 30th you\u2019re [sic] supervisor heard/witness[ed] inappropriate tone of voice in a remark directed towards patient J.G.\u201d We know that Hennessey appeared at the SHO\u2019s hearing. We also know that Hennessey herself did not hear or witness the tone of voice on June 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">{\u00b6 48} There is no dispute that it was only the unit manager who allegedly heard relator\u2019s tone of voice on June 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">{\u00b6 49} Yet the unit manager, whose identity remains unknown, did not prepare his own written statement describing what he heard on June 30, 2006, nor did he appear on behalf of the employer to testify at the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>{\u00b6 50} Given the above scenario, the only evidence that the SHO had before him to make a determination of whether relator actually used an inappropriate tone of voice on June 30, 2006, were the two employer documents indicating that the unit manager had reported what he or she concluded to be an inappropriate tone of voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 51} In the magistrate\u2019s view, the two employer documents fall short of constituting the \u201csome evidence\u201d needed to support a determination that relator actually used an inappropriate tone of voice towards a resident on June 30, 2006. The two documents require the SHO to guess whether relator actually used an inappropriate tone of voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 52} This magistrate recognizes that R.C. 4123.10 provides that the commission \u201cshall not be bound by the usual common law or statutory rules of evidence or by any technical or formal rules of procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 53} Notwithstanding R.C. 4123.10, this case severely tests the limits of the time-honored some-evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 54} In <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 22, 23, 11 OBR 35, 462 N.E.2d 1237, this court had occasion to describe the some-evidence rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">A mere scintilla of evidence would be insufficient to support the finding of the Industrial Commission. Rather, the \u201csome-evidence\u201d rule is somewhat akin to the rule applied in civil cases to determine whether a verdict should be directed. See Civ.R. 50(A)(4). Thus, the mandamus determination must be predicated upon a finding whether or not there is evidence to support the findings of the Industrial Commission, not whether this court agrees with those findings. In making the appropriate determination, the court is required to construe the evidence most strongly in favor of supporting the findings of the Industrial Commission. This appears to be the \u201csome-evidence\u201d rule, namely, whether, when construed most strongly in favor of supporting the findings of the Industrial Commission, the evidence reasonably supports the findings made by the Industrial Commission. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">{\u00b6 55} Here, when construing the two employer documents most strongly in favor of supporting the commission\u2019s findings, they fail to constitute some evidence under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">{\u00b6 56} Again, at best, we have two employer documents indicating that the unit manager reported his conclusion or opinion that relator\u2019s tone of voice was inappropriate on June 30, 2006. The unit manager never prepared a written statement explaining why he concluded that the tone of voice was inappropriate, nor did he testify at the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>{\u00b6 57} It is certainly conceivable that a tone of voice could be construed as verbal abuse under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, the employer here failed to produce evidence upon which the commission could rely to support a finding of verbal abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 58} Accordingly, for all the above reasons, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its SHO\u2019s order of January 23, 2007 and, in a manner consistent with this magistrate\u2019s decision, enter a new order that adjudicates the merits of relator\u2019s request for TTD compensation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
