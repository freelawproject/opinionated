(\u201cFIA\u201d) appeals from the May 23, 2008 journal entry of the Court of Common Pleas, Union County, Ohio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>dismissing FIA\u2019s case against defendant-appellee Mary Salmon for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">{\u00b6 2} FIA filed a claim with the National Arbitration Forum pursuant to a written agreement between FIA and Salmon that provided that all claims between the parties were to be submitted to binding arbitration. On February 27, 2007, an arbitrator issued an award in favor of FIA in the amount of $40,033.36. Salmon failed to pay FIA the amount due pursuant to the arbitration award. On February 7, 2008, FIA filed a motion and application to confirm and enforce the arbitration award pursuant to R.C. 2711.09 in the Union County Court of Common Pleas. On March 6, 2008, Salmon filed an answer and affirmative defenses, and on March 17, 2008, FIA filed a motion to strike Salmon\u2019s answer objecting to the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 3} On April 9, 2008, the trial court issued a hearing notice setting this matter for a bench trial on May 9, 2008. On April 18, 2008, FIA filed a motion to convert the bench trial set for May 9, 2008, to a hearing on its motion and application to confirm and enforce the arbitration award. On April 23, 2008, the trial court issued a hearing notice rescheduling the May 9, 2008 hearing to May 29, 2008. On May 1, 2008, Salmon filed a request to change the hearing date, and on this same date the trial court issued a hearing notice, rescheduling the hearing to May 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 4} The parties appeared for an evidentiary bench trial on May 22, 2008, and on May 23, 2008, the trial court issued a journal entry dismissing FIA\u2019s case for failure to properly prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 5} FIA now appeals, asserting one assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">The trial court committed prejudicial error and abused its discretion in dismissing appellant\u2019s motion to confirm and enforce arbitration award in contravention of the provisions of Civil Rule 41(B)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">{\u00b6 6} In its sole assignment of error, FIA alleges that the trial court erred and abused its discretion by dismissing FIA\u2019s case for failure to prosecute pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">{\u00b6 7} Prior to reviewing the merits of FIA\u2019s assignment of error, we first note that an appellee\u2019s brief has not been filed in this case. Pursuant to Ohio App.R. 18(C), if an appellee fails to timely file a brief, \u201cin determining the appeal, the court may accept the appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\u201d See also <em>In re Estate of Vann, </em>3rd Dist. No. 10-05-12, 2005-Ohio-5040, 2005 WL 2335058.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Civ.R. 41(B)(1) governs involuntary dismissals for failure to prosecute. Specifically, Civ.R. 41(B)(1) provides that \u201c[w]here the plaintiff fails to prosecute, or comply with these rules or any court order, the court upon motion of a defendant or on its own motion may, after notice to the plaintiffs counsel, dismiss an action or claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 9} Generally, dismissal with prejudice is an extremely harsh sanction and contrary to the fundamental preference for deciding cases on their merits. <em>Jones v. Hartranft </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 368, 371, 678 N.E.2d 530. Accordingly, a court should not order a dismissal with prejudice unless the plaintiffs conduct is so \u201cnegligent, irresponsible, contumacious, or dilatory as to provide substantial grounds\u201d for such a dismissal. <em>Dray v. Gen. Motors Cory., </em>3rd Dist. No. 1-05-35, 2006-Ohio-347, 2006 WL 213846, \u00b6 22, citing <em>Tokles &amp; Son, Inc. v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 621, 632, 605 N.E.2d 936; <em>Willis v. RCA Cory. </em>(1983), 12 Ohio, App.3d 1, 2,12 OBR 57, 465 N.E.2d 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 10} However, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to dismiss an action for lack of prosecution. <em>Pembaur v. Leis </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 89, 91, 1 OBR 125, 437 N.E.2d 1199. An appellate court is confined solely to whether the trial court abused that discretion. Id. An abuse of discretion constitutes more than an error of law or judgment and implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 11} Our review of the record reveals that FIA\u2019s pleadings filed in the trial court were signed by attorney William McCann of the law firm Javitch, Block &amp; Rathbone, L.L.P. At the May 22, 2008 hearing, attorney Matthew Warner, also of Javitch, Block <em>&amp; </em>Rathbone, L.L.P., appeared in court on behalf of FIA, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">The Court: This is case number 08-CV-0075, FIA Card Services, plaintiff, versus Mary D. Salmon, defendant. This is hearing (sic) on the arbitration award. Proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">Mr. Warner: Your Honor, Matthew Warner appearing on behalf of the plaintiff. My Supreme Court number is 0074607. Your Honor, today we wish to argue the motion\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">The Court: Wait a minute. Have you entered an appearance in this case? Mr. Warner: I have not. No your Honor. I\u2019m from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">The Court: I didn\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-12\">Mr. Warner: I\u2019m from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The Court: Where\u2019s Mr. McCann?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">Mr. Warner: He\u2019s from our Cleveland office, sir. I am from the Columbus Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">The Court: You haven\u2019t entered an appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">Mr. Warner: I\u2019m making my appearance now orally on the record, your Honor, with all due respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">The Court: That isn\u2019t the way that\u2019s done. And you know it and I do too. And Mr. McCann knows it too. There you are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">Mr. Warner: I would ask, your Honor, that we proceed today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-11\">The Court: Not with you I\u2019m not going to. You haven\u2019t filed anything, you know. And I \u2014 that isn\u2019t the way that thing works. You know it and I know it. So if you \u2014 that\u2019s the first thing. And if \u2014 and if plaintiff doesn\u2019t \u2014 if they haven\u2019t made arrangements to put on the evidence on the whole works and have somebody here who happens to be Mr. McCann, William McCann, I\u2019m done for the day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\">Mr. Warner: Well, your Honor, for the record I would like to at least argue our motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">The Court: Well, no. I\u2019m not going to let you argue your motion. You haven\u2019t entered an appearance. I\u2019m not going to let you do that. That\u2019s not right. Mr. Warner: Your Honor, I could\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\">The Court: Mr. McCann is the one who should be here. Either that or has to be some sort of a substitution or some sort of an entry of appearance. Mr. Warner: Well, I am from the same law firm as him, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-15\">The Court: I don\u2019t know that. Don\u2019t see it on the record. Not here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-16\">Mr. Warner: I can give you one of my business cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-17\">The Court: I don\u2019t want your business card. So we\u2019re done, aren\u2019t we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-18\">Mr. Warner: Well, your Honor, I\u2019d ask for a reasonable continuance then of the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-19\">The Court: Well, you haven\u2019t even entered an appearance. How can you ask for a continuance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-20\">* :|: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-21\">The Court: Okay. We\u2019re done. I mean, I\u2019ll tell you that right now. We\u2019re done. Anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-22\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-23\">Mr. Warner: If I may ask a question, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-24\">The Court: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Mr. Warner: When you mean we\u2019re done, can \u2014 with all due respect, can you please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">The Court: Means that I\u2019m going to put an entry on saying that it\u2019s dismissed for want of prosecution. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. Does that answer the question you were going to ask?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"> {\u00b6 12} We note that although Civ.R. 41(B)(1) permits a trial court to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute, a condition precedent to dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute is notice to the plaintiff or plaintiffs counsel of the court\u2019s intention to dismiss. <em>Dray, </em>2006-Ohio-347, 2006 WL 213846, at \u00b621, citing Civ.R. 41(B)(1). Notice is an absolute prerequisite for dismissal for failure to prosecute. <em>Perotti v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 7 Ohio St.3d 1, 2-3, 7 OBR 256, 454 N.E.2d 951. The Supreme Court of Ohio has also held that any dismissal with prejudice is proper only when \u201ccounsel has been informed that dismissal is a possibility and has had a reasonable opportunity to defend against dismissal.\u201d <em>Hillabrand v. Drypers Corp. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 517, 518, 721 N.E.2d 1029, citing <em>Quonset Hut, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 46, 684 N.E.2d 319, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 13} We note that other Ohio appellate districts have previously addressed the similar issue of representation by different attorneys in the same firm. In <em>Minnesota v. Karp </em>(1948), 84 Ohio App. 51, 53, 39 O.O. 96, 84 N.E.2d 76, the First District held that \u201cthere is a presumption that a regularly admitted attorney has authority to represent the client for whom he appears.\u201d In <em>Garcia v. Coler </em>(June 11, 1987), 2nd Dist. No. 86-CA-36, 1987 WL 12647, the Second District concluded that \u201cthe use of different attorneys from the same law firm did not result in any discernable prejudice to the appellees.\u201d Finally, in <em>Freeman v. Freeman, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-85, 2003-Ohio-4959, 2003 WL 22149517, the Tenth District found that \u201cit is not uncommon for an associate of a firm to appear as substitute counsel on behalf of a partner when that partner is unable to make the court appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 14} Our review of the record reveals that at the hearing on May 22, 2008, attorney Warner advised the trial court that he was admitted to the Ohio bar and licensed to practice before the courts in the state of Ohio. Additionally, attorney Warner is employed by Javitch, Block &amp; Rathbone, L.L.P., which is the same firm that employs attorney McCann, whose name appears on the pleadings in this case on behalf of FIA. Furthermore, we note that the appearance of attorney Warner as substitute counsel for attorney McCann was in no way prejudicial to the appellee in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 15} Based on the foregoing, as the appearance of attorney Warner as substitute counsel was in no way prejudicial to the appellee, we find that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing FIA\u2019s case for failure to prosecute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(1). Accordingly, FIA\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">{\u00b6 16} Therefore, the May 23, 2008 journal entry of the Union County Court of Common Pleas dismissing FIA\u2019s case for failure to prosecute is reversed, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b592-6\">Willamowski and Rogers, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
