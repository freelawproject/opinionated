Eastman, for strict product liability and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant manufactures tools, including the tool subject of this case, the Stanley Fat Max 22 hammer (\u201cFM22\u201d). Appellee is a framing carpenter who was injured on April 23, 2004, when one of the claws of his FM22 broke off, flew into his left eye, and ruptured his left eyeball. Appellee\u2019s injuries resulted in permanent disfigurement and vision loss in the left eye. Appellee filed the instant action against appellant, alleging claims of both strict product liability for defective manufacturing under R.C. 2307.73(A)(1) and 2307.74, and common law negligence. On December 17, 2007, following a week-long trial, the jury found in appellee\u2019s favor on both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">{\u00b6 3} We begin by recapitulating the relevant facts adduced below. Appellee is a framing carpenter by trade and had been working in that trade for ten years at the time of the accident. Appellee\u2019s work involved continuous use of a hammer. He estimated that he makes at least 300 strikes with his hammer per day. He would also use the claw end of his hammer to break the metal straps used to secure bundles of roof trusses. Appellee testified that this is a common and accepted practice among framing carpenters. Appellant\u2019s in-house engineer, Steven Crosby, and its manager of products support, Steven Gemmall, both corroborated appellee\u2019s testimony that this is an acceptable use for a hammer like the FM22.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">{\u00b6 4} In January 2004, appellee began using the FM22 at issue. Then, on April 23, 2004, while attempting to break a metal strap on a bundle of roof trusses, one of the claws of appellee\u2019s FM22 broke off, flew into appellee\u2019s left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>eye, and ruptured the eyeball. At the time of his accident, appellee was not wearing safety goggles. He testified that this was because the day was rainy and the ground was muddy, and he could not see through the goggles as a result. His co-worker testified that the rainy and muddy conditions on the day in question would cause rain and mud to build up on the goggles and would cause the goggles to fog.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">{\u00b6 5} Appellee conceded that it is always safer to wear safety goggles when using a hammer. Appellee conceded that the FM22 bore a sticker warning that users should wear safety goggles because \u201ctools or struck objects may chip.\u201d However, he stated that because he was not using the FM22 to strike an object, he did not anticipate the danger of the tool chipping. Gemmall conceded that appellee\u2019s FM22 did not \u201cchip\u201d and that an entire claw snapped off. He agreed that appellant did not warn users about the risk of an entire claw snapping off with force sufficient to rupture the user\u2019s eyeball. Gemmall also testified that he did not expect users to anticipate such a risk when deciding whether safety goggles were necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">{\u00b6 6} Engineer Greg Dubois testified as an expert on behalf of appellee. He examined and tested appellee\u2019s FM22. He concluded that the FM22 had experienced a \u201cquench crack,\u201d which means that it had developed a crack as a result of not being properly cooled after being heat-treated. Gemmall agreed that a quench crack would be a manufacturing defect. One of the reasons that Dubois felt there had been a quench crack was, he stated, that there was evidence of intergranular failure. However, he did not have any photographic evidence of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">{\u00b6 7} Crosby, a metallurgical expert, agreed that there had been a crack in appellee\u2019s FM22, but he testified that there is no metallurgical evidence that it was a quench crack. First, he explained that the so-called intergranular failure, upon which Dubois had based his opinion, was evidence of a \u201cductile rupture failure,\u201d which is inconsistent with a quench crack. Crosby also explained that a quench crack would be located at the \u201cV,\u201d or \u201ccrotch,\u201d formed by the hammer and the claw, while the crack in appellee\u2019s FM22 was located at the \u201cshear lip,\u201d which is \u201cfurther down\u201d from the crotch than a quench crack would be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">{\u00b6 8} Crosby\u2019s theory was that the FM22 cracked and broke due to appellee\u2019s misusing and abusing the hammer. When it was brand new, the FM22\u2019s head had a checkered face covered with pyramid-like shapes for a better grip on struck objects. At the time of the accident, the checkers or pyramids were completely gone, and the face was smashed completely flat. Both Dubois and Crosby opined that this was a deformed hammer. Crosby opined that such deformity would not be expected on a hammer used only for framing purposes, though he admitted that appellant has not tested the FM22 to determine what it \u201cshould\u201d look like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>after normal use by a framing carpenter. Appellee testified that it usually takes about two years for a hammer\u2019s head to become completely flat. He denied abusing the FM22 in the three-month period in which he had used it. Dubois testified that another of appellee\u2019s hammers, which had not been manufactured by appellant, was worn flat and was cracked. Crosby testified that abuse of a hammer can lead to a crack, which can cause separation of a claw.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">{\u00b6 9} Dubois\u2019s file on this case contained a rule promulgated by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (\u201cASME\u201d), which stated that \u201cnail hammers shall not be used to strike hard or hardened objects such as rocks, bricks, concrete, masonry nails * * Appellee had admitted that he routinely used the FM22 to strike concrete nails. The trial court refused to allow appellant to cross-examine Dubois about this ASME standard because it was written by and for engineers, not hammer users. The court concluded, therefore, that the rule was not binding upon appellee. The court also noted that the FM22 contained no manufacturer\u2019s warning against using the FM22 on masonry nails. Appellant put the standard into the record by proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">{\u00b6 10} Robert St. John is appellant\u2019s director of engineering for its consumer-tools division. He testified that he has personally observed the manufacturing procedures that are used in the Taiwanese plant in which appellee\u2019s FM22 was made. He stated that the plant\u2019s manufacturing procedures complied with appellant\u2019s specifications for the FM22. He further testified that quality engineers audit and process every shipment of Stanley hammers that leaves the factory. He testified that appellant\u2019s written procedures and specifications call for testing of each hammer to ensure the absence of quench cracks. However, the only evidence he produced showing that testing had actually been performed was his testimony that he observed compliance with the written procedures and specifications during his numerous visits to the Taiwanese manufacturing facility. He admitted on cross-examination that he did not have any documents to corroborate testing of appellee\u2019s FM22.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">{\u00b6 11} Following his injury, appellee underwent two surgeries and suffered permanent vision loss. Appellee returned to work in July 2004, with no restrictions. He later re-injured his eye in an incident unrelated to the present action, and that injury caused him not to work from November 27, 2004, through December 2004. Until a few days before trial, he had not seen an ophthalmologist since May 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellee has worked continuously since January 2005. At the time of trial, he worked full-time, which, he explained, is not 52 weeks per year and 40 hours per week in the construction business; rather, because his portion of construction occurs outdoors, it is subject to changes in seasons and weather. At the time of his injury, appellee was earning $10 per hour. At the time of trial, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>was earning $14 per hour and had been earning that rate of pay for two years preceding the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">{\u00b6 13} Appellee\u2019s witness, Dr. Bruce Growick, a vocational rehabilitation expert, reviewed appellee\u2019s educational and work history, and his physical abilities and eye impairment. Based on this information, Dr. Growick opined that appellee is qualified to perform only 15 to 20 percent of the unskilled jobs for which he had been qualified prior to the incident in question. Dr. Growick acknowledged that appellee is presently working in his former position; therefore, that position is not among the 80 to 85 percent of jobs for which appellee is no longer qualified as result of his injury. He also admitted that it would be speculative to state that appellee would be unable to perform his job at a particular point in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">{\u00b6 14} Dr. Richard Palfin is an economist who testified on appellee\u2019s behalf. Dr. Palfin reviewed documentation of appellee\u2019s pre- and post-injury earnings, his medical records, and Dr. Growick\u2019s vocational analysis. Based upon all of those records, Dr. Palfin calculated the present value of the annual percentage of appellee\u2019s lost earning capacity. On cross-examination, he conceded that he had based his annual earnings calculation on a 52-week year. He also testified that he had not taken into account the seasonal nature of appellee\u2019s work and the fact that appellee\u2019s work weeks were not uniformly 40-hour weeks. Therefore, Dr. Palfin had used an annual future wage of $29,120, while appellee\u2019s annual salary prior to the accident was only $21,350.03. Dr. Palfin did not assign a starting year for when appellee would experience loss of earning capacity; rather, he stated, it would be up to the jury to determine when appellee would actually begin to experience any loss of earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">{\u00b6 15} The jury awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $986,300, including $60,300 for past economic loss, $200,000 for past noneconomic loss, $426,000 for future economic loss, and $300,000 for future noneconomic loss. The jury further determined that appellee was 35 percent negligent and that his negligence was a proximate cause of his injury. The court entered judgment in appellee\u2019s favor in the amount of $986,300. Appellant filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d), and for a new trial or remittitur. The trial court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant timely appealed and advances seven assignments of error for our review, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-8\">I. The trial court erred in denying the Stanley Works\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B), because the evidence does not support the damages element of Shawn Eastman\u2019s claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-9\">II. The trial court abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in admitting the testimony of Palfin and Growick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>III. The trial court erred in denying Stanley Works\u2019 motion for directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-4\">IV. The trial court erred by refusing to provide an assumption of the risk jury instruction regarding strict liability and erred in instructing the jury to ignore the unforeseeable use of the hammer by Mr. Eastman, a sophisticated user.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-5\">V. The trial court erroneously refused to allow Stanley Works to admit the American Society of Mechanical Engineer\u2019s [sic] standard for nail hammers\u2014 safety requirements, B107.0R 1 M-1997, as approved by ANSI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">VI. Remittitur of the excessive jury award is warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-7\">VII. The trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">{\u00b6 17} In its first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for JNOV. A motion for JNOV is made pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B). \u201cThe standard for a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50(B) is the same as that for a motion for a directed verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50(A).\u201d <em>Estate of Cowling v. Estate of Cowling, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 276, 2006-Ohio-2418, 847 N.E.2d 405, \u00b6 28. Civ.R. 50(A)(4) provides, \u201cWhen a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[I]t is well established that the court must neither consider the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses in disposing of a directed verdict motion. * * * Thus, \u2018if there is substantial competent evidence to support the party against whom the motion is made, upon which evidence reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cowling, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 276, 2006-Ohio-2418, 847 N.E.2d 405, at \u00b6 31, quoting <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 284-285, 21 O.O.3d 177, 423 N.E.2d 467. \u201c[T]he motion raises a question of law because the motion examines the materiality of the evidence, as opposed to the conclusions to be drawn from the evidence. Because the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict presents a question of law, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Duffer v. Powell, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-859, 2006-Ohio-2613, 2006 WL 1431469, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">{\u00b6 19} In support of its motion for JNOV, appellant argued that appellee failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s award of future economic damages proximately caused by the defect in the FM22. It argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>testimony of Drs. Growick and Palfin was too speculative to establish calculable financial loss and a causal connection between such loss and the defect (for the strict product liability claim) or appellant\u2019s negligence (for the common law negligence claim). Appellant argued that this insufficient expert testimony coupled with the fact that appellee has returned to his former full-time position, precludes recovery of future economic damages. The trial court rejected these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant makes the same arguments to this court in support of its first assignment of error. In response, citing <em>Day v. Gulley </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 83, 23 O.O.2d 382, 191 N.E.2d 732, appellee argues that \u201closs of any eye is, according to Ohio law, an objective injury\u201d and the jury properly concluded appellee\u2019s impairment from that fact alone. It is undisputed on appeal that appellee proved the permanency of his injury. However, <em>Day </em>does not stand for the proposition that any objective injury relieves the plaintiff of the burden to prove the existence of a reasonably certain amount of future economic damages causally related to that impairment. In <em>Day, </em>the court discussed objective injuries as part of its holding that such an injury permits the \u201cjury [to] draw their conclusions as to future pain and suffering from that fact alone[,]\u201d without expert testimony. <em>Day </em>at 86, 23 O.O.2d 382, 191 N.E.2d 732. The court in <em>Day </em>was discussing damages for <em>pain and suffering, </em>which are <em>noneconomic </em>damages. Indeed, the jury in the present case awarded appellee $300,000 for the future <em>noneconomic </em>damages he will suffer as a result of his objective, permanent impairment. Appellant does not challenge, and we do not disturb, the jury\u2019s award to appellee of damages for his future pain and suffering. Because appellant\u2019s first assignment of error addresses appellee\u2019s claim for future <em>economic </em>damages and does not involve appellee\u2019s damages for future pain and suffering, appellee\u2019s citation of <em>Day </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2315.18(A)(2) provides that, for purposes of tort actions, \u201ceconomic loss\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">(a) All wages, salaries, or other compensation lost as a result of an injury or loss to person or property that is a subject of a tort action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">(b) All expenditures for medical care or treatment, rehabilitation services, or other care, treatment, services, products, or accommodations as a result of an injury or loss to person or property that is a subject of a tort action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">(c) Any other expenditures incurred as a result of an injury or loss to person or property that is a subject of a tort action, other than attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with that action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Appellee\u2019s claim for future economic damages falls under subparagraph (a) because he seeks compensation for \u201clost wages, salaries or other compensation.\u201d Thus, in order to resolve this assignment of error, we must determine whether the trial court properly concluded that appellee had presented \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>competent evidence\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that he will experience a loss of future \u201cwages, salaries or other compensation\u201d that was proximately caused by his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">{\u00b6 22} The Supreme Court of Ohio has explained, \u201cThe measure of damages for impairment of earning capacity is <em>the difference between the amount which the plaintiff was capable of earning before his injmy and that which he is capable of earning thereafter.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Hanna v. Stoll </em>(1925), 112 Ohio St. 344, 353, 3 Ohio Law Abs. 250, 147 N.E. 339; see also <em>Deyo v. Adjutant General\u2019s Dept. </em>(Aug. 16, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93API12-1667, 1994 WL 425003.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">{\u00b6 23} In the case of <em>Power v. Kirkpatrick </em>(July 20, 2000), Franklin App. No. 99AP-1026, 2000 WL 992028, this court expounded on the concept of impairment of earning capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">An award of damages for future wage loss raises two independent evidentiary concerns: (1) whether [the plaintiff] offered sufficient proof of any future impairment; and (2) whether [the plaintiff] offered sufficient evidence of the extent of prospective damages flowing from the impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">{\u00b6 24} As for the first inquiry, it is undisputed that appellee presented sufficient proof of his future, permanent impairment. Thus, we must focus our attention on the second inquiry \u2014 whether appellee presented sufficient proof that he is reasonably certain to incur a loss in the future of \u201cwages, salaries or other compensation\u201d as a result of his impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant cites <em>Power, </em>Franklin App. No. 99AP-1026, 2000 WL 992028, in which this court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-10\">In order to recover future damages, including future wage loss, [the plaintiff] must prove by sufficient evidence that he is reasonably certain to incur such damages in the future. <em>Galayda v. Lake Hosp. Sys., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 421, 425, 644 N.E.2d 298. Therefore, <em>the showing of future loss of earnings in a personal injury case involves demonstrating with reasonable certainty that an individual\u2019s injury or condition prevents that individual from attaining his or her pre-injury wage.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">(Emphasis added.) See also <em>Broadstone v. Quillen, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 632, 2005-Ohio-4278, 834 N.E.2d 424, \u00b6 19 (\u201cthe showing of future loss of earnings in a personal injury case involves demonstrating with reasonable certainty that an individual\u2019s injury or condition prevents that individual from attaining his or her pre-injury wage\u201d); <em>Ratliff v. Colasurd </em>(Apr. 27, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-504, 1999 WL 253002, *15 (\u201cThe showing of future earnings loss in a personal injury case therefore involves demonstrating with reasonable certainty, first, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>appellee\u2019s injury or condition prevents him from attaining his or her pre-injury wage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant argues that appellee\u2019s expert witnesses never established, with reasonable certainty, that the amount of wages that appellee will be capable of earning over his working life after his injury is less than the amount of wages he was capable of earning over his working life before his injury. In response, appellee argues that he did provide sufficient proof of future wage loss and cites the case of <em>Deyo, </em>Franklin App. No. 93API12-1667, 1994 WL 425003, apparently because in <em>Deyo, </em>we upheld a jury\u2019s award for future economic damages under R.C. 2315.18(A)(2)(a), where, as here, the record contained an economist\u2019s testimony quantifying a loss of future earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">{\u00b6 27} However, that case is distinguishable because, as appellee notes, the plaintiff in <em>Deyo </em>was injured in such a way that he was incapable of performing his previous nonsedentary job and was restricted to sedentary work, which his former employer could not provide. The plaintiff presented an expert who opined that the plaintiff could be expected to earn quantifiably less in the future, performing the sedentary work for which he was qualified, than he was capable of earning before his injury, when he was not restricted to sedentary employment. That is, he presented evidence as to the difference between what he would have earned during the remainder of his working life had he not been injured, and the amount he was <em>reasonably certain to earn </em>over the same period in the sedentary work to which his injury had confined him.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">{\u00b6 28} Here, unlike in <em>Deyo, </em>appellee is not restricted to sedentary employment; indeed, he has returned to his former position with no restrictions, his physician has placed no medical restrictions on any future employment, and Dr. Growick testified that he cannot say, with any reasonable degree of certainty, that appellee\u2019s injury will render him unable to perform the functions of his job at any point in the future. Appellee\u2019s economist, Dr. Palfin, testified that the dollar amount he assigned to appellee\u2019s lost earning capacity (based on a 2007 earning capacity of $14 per hour and an expected retirement age of 65), should be reduced for any amount of time in which appellant works. He explained that this is because his calculation of the present value of appellee\u2019s future economic loss ($646,160) is entirely based upon the assumption that appellee would <em>not be working </em>at any time from the date of trial to the end of his normal working life.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">{\u00b6 29} Moreover, though Dr. Growick testified that appellee\u2019s injury renders him incapable of performing 80 to 85 percent of jobs for which he was qualified prior to his injury, Dr. Growick never said that any of the jobs that appellee has lost the opportunity to pursue would have paid him the same or more \u201cwages, salaries or other compensation\u201d than he has actually been earning since his accident. Only if the loss of those job opportunities quantifiably reduced \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>amount which [appellee] was capable of earning before his injury\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> will he have proven with reasonable certainty that he has suffered future economic losses. No expert testified to any such reduction in earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">{\u00b6 30} The dissent expresses concern that our analysis is improperly focused on the fact that appellee returned to his former position of employment and earned more at the time of trial than he earned three and a half years earlier, at the time of his injury. It is true that evidence of appellee\u2019s current work situation is relevant. But his return to his former position does not, ipso facto, prevent his recovery of future economic damages under R.C. 2315.18(A)(2)(a). Rather, appellee did not meet his burden of proof of this element of damages because his experts\u2019 opinions as to his lost earning capacity were fundamentally flawed. First, the opinions were based upon the hypothetical situation of appellee\u2019s being unemployed, despite the fact that he had been steadily employed since his recovery, and as Dr. Growick acknowledged, it would constitute speculation to presume that appellee would lose his job or be unable to work at some point in the future. Second, there is no evidence that attributed any quantifiable reduction in appellee\u2019s wage-earning capacity to his loss of potential occupations.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">{\u00b6 31} The deficiency of the evidence in this case is illustrated by the case of <em>Hall v. Kreider Mfg., Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-272, 2003-Ohio-6661, 2003 WL 22927416. In that case, the plaintiff was a dentist who claimed that his wrist injury permanently foreclosed his ability to perform extractions, which were a quantifiable source of part of his income. We determined that the plaintiffs medical evidence failed to establish the permanency of his impairment; however, if he had been able to establish that his injury was permanent, then he could have proven his claim for future economic damages by presenting an expert to quantify, with reasonable certainty, the amount of \u201cwages, salaries or other compensation\u201d that he would have lost as a result of being unable to perform extractions for the remainder of his working life.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">{\u00b6 32} Our analysis does not preclude future economic-damage claims based upon R.C. 2315.18(A)(2)(a) in the hypothetical case of a physician turned winery proprietor, mentioned by the dissent. In such a case, if the medical and vocational evidence established with reasonable certainty that the physician\u2019s permanent impairment precluded him from future performance as a physician, then that plaintiff could recover future economic damages once his economic expert placed a present value on such losses by opining as to a negative mathematical difference between the plaintiffs pre-injury and post-injury earning capacity. In that hypothetical, just as in the present case, future economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>damages are available, but must be proved with reasonable certainty. The evidence in this case is insufficient to establish, with reasonable certainty, that there is a \u201cdifference between the amount which the plaintiff was capable of earning before his injury and that which he is capable of earning thereafter},]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or that appellee\u2019s injury \u201cprevents [him in the future] from attaining his * * * preinjury wage.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">{\u00b6 33} As we noted earlier, we must review de novo the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for JNOV. Having done so, and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellee, we find that reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion on the issue of future economic damages, and that conclusion is adverse to appellee. Accordingly, the trial court erred in submitting the issue to the jury. For this reason, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, and its second assignment of error is overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">{\u00b6 34} In its third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on both the product-liability claim and the negligence claim. The Supreme Court of Ohio has set forth the standard appropriately applied to review of a decision to grant or deny a directed verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\">According to Civ.R. 50(A)(4), a motion for directed verdict is granted if, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, \u201creasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.\u201d The \u201creasonable minds\u201d test mandated by Civ.R. 50(A)(4) requires the court to discern only whether there exists any evidence of substantive probative value that favors the position of the nonmoving party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">A motion for directed verdict * * * does not present factual issues, but a question of law, even though in deciding such a motion, it is necessary to review and consider the evidence. Since we are presented with a question of law, we apply a de novo standard of review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

R.C. 2307.73(A) provides, \u201cA manufacturer is subject to liability for compensatory damages based on a product liability claim only if the claimant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence * * * (1) Subject to division (B) of this section, the manufacturer\u2019s product in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>question was defective in manufacture or construction as described in section 2807.74 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 2307.74 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">A product is defective in manufacture or construction if, when it left the control of its manufacturer, it deviated in a material way from the design specifications, formula, or performance standards of the manufacturer, or from otherwise identical units manufactured to the same design specifications, formula, or performance standards. A product may be defective in manufacture or construction as described in this section even though its manufacturer exercised all possible care in its manufacture or construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The elements of appellee\u2019s negligence claim are (1) the existence of a duty to appellee, (2) breach of that duty, (3) damages proximately resulting therefrom. <em>Jeffers v. Olexo </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 140,142, 539 N.E.2d 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant argues that the trial court should have granted it a directed verdict on the strict product liability claim because appellee did not prove that the FM22 was defective in manufacture and on the negligence claim because appellee did not prove that appellant breached its duty to appellee, all because he failed to prove that the FM22 in question had a quench crack. Citing the testimony of its own expert \u2014 Crosby\u2014appellant argues that the claw broke in the wrong place for there to have been a quench crack present; there was a ductile pulling fracture, which is inconsistent with a quench crack; and there was no photographic evidence of a quench crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">{\u00b6 37} Appellant ignores the fact that the jury was presented with Crosby\u2019s testimony on behalf of appellant, and Dubois\u2019s testimony on behalf of appellee. The two experts differed on whether the FM22 had a quench crack when it left appellant\u2019s hands, and whether this caused the claw to snap off while appellee was using it. \u201cWhere conflicting expert testimony exists, the trier of fact is responsible for determining which expert is more credible.\u201d <em>Parsons v. Washington State Community College, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1138, 2006-Ohio-2196, 2006 WL 1174501, \u00b6 22. This is because \u201c[t]he weight of conflicting expert evidence and the credibility of the experts are matters peculiarly for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Bedel v. Univ. of Cincinnati Hosp. </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 420, 428, 669 N.E.2d 9, citing <em>Hubach v.

Boehm Pressed Steel Co. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 702, 709, 702 N.E.2d 929. But \u201ca motion for a directed verdict must be denied when \u2018substantial, competent evidence has been presented from which reasonable minds could draw different conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waddell v.

Continental Gen. Tire, Inc. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 30, 31, 748 N.E.2d 36. In this case, Dubois\u2019s testimony constituted sufficient evidence that the FM22 had a quench crack and that it was this quench crack that caused the claw to break off. Accordingly, reasonable minds could have differed on the issue whether the FM22 contained a manufacturing defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">{\u00b6 39} Additionally, appellant argues that appellee failed to establish proximate cause for purposes of the negligence claim. It argues that appellee\u2019s use of the hammer to strike masonry nails and the fact that another of appellee\u2019s hammers was severely flattened and had a crack showed that it was appellee\u2019s abuse of the FM22 \u2014 not defective manufacturing \u2014 that caused it to break. Moreover, it argues, appellee\u2019s unforeseeable misuse of the FM22 is a complete defense to the strict product liability claim. Thus, appellant argues, appellee\u2019s misuse of the FM22 independently merited a directed verdict in its favor as to both the product-liability claim and the negligence claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">{\u00b6 40} In any product-liability case, whether based in common law or statute, a plaintiff must prove that the product defect proximately caused his injury. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

Congruently, \u201c \u2018[i]f an injury is the natural and probable consequence of a negligent act and it is such as should have been foreseen in the light of all the attending circumstances, the injury is then the proximate result of the negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mussivand v.

See <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 288, 21 O.O.3d 177, 423 N.E.2d 467, citing <em>Clinger v. Duncan </em>(1957), 166 Ohio St. 216, 2 O.O.2d 31, 141 N.E.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">{\u00b6 43} Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only \u201cwhere the product is used in a capacity which is unforeseeable by the manufacturer and completely incompatible with the product\u2019s design.\u201d <em>Cox v.

SICO, Inc. </em>(May 13, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 74060, 1999 WL 304520. In our view, the court properly sent this issue to the jury, as it was not the case that reasonable minds could only conclude that appellee misused the FM22. Though appellee\u2019s use of the hammer might have been <em>unreasonable, </em>unreasonable use is not a defense to a strict product-liability action or to a negligence action. <em>Bowling, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 282, 31 OBR 559, 511 N.E.2d 373; <em>Calmes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 470, 476, 575 N.E.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">{\u00b6 44} Finally, appellant argues that it was entitled to a directed verdict on its strict product-liability claim because when appellee failed to wear goggles while using the FM22, he knowingly and voluntarily assumed the risk occasioned by any defect. <em>Bowling, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 282, 31 OBR 559, 511 N.E.2d 373. For support of this proposition, appellant points out that appellee admitted that he knew that it is safer to wear goggles when using the hammer because he was aware of the risk that tools can chip and come apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cFor the defense of assumption of the risk to act as a bar to recovery of damages, the defendant must establish that the plaintiff knew of the condition, that the condition was patently dangerous, and that the plaintiff voluntarily exposed himself or herself to the condition. Ordinarily, assumption of the risk is a question of fact, to be resolved by the factfinder.\u201d <em>Carrel v. Allied Prods. Corp. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 284, 289, 677 N.E.2d 795, citing <em>Goodin v. Corry </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 178, 5 OBR 362, 450 N.E.2d 727; <em>Sapp v. Stoney Ridge Truck Tire </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 85, 97, 619 N.E.2d 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>{\u00b6 46} Appellee argues that appellant was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on assumption of the risk because there was no evidence that appellee knew of the existence of the defect (i.e., the quench crack). Appellee maintains that the defense will not apply where the plaintiff was merely aware that use of the product carries some risks; rather, the defendant must show that the plaintiff was aware of the actual condition or defect alleged to have caused the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">{\u00b6 47} By finding appellee 35 percent negligent, the jury determined that appellee failed to guard against the possibility of a defect when he decided not to wear his goggles. But comparative negligence does not apply to strict product liability. <em>Bowling, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 283, 31 OBR 559, 511 N.E.2d 373. Thus, in order to be relieved of all liability for appellee\u2019s product-liability claim, the evidence had to show that \u201c[appellee] knew of the condition, that the condition was patently dangerous, and that [appellee] voluntarily exposed himself * * * to the condition.\u201d <em>Carrel, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 289, 677 N.E.2d 795. However, there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that appellee was aware of the quench crack in his FM22. Thus, appellant was not entitled to a directed verdict on its affirmative defense of assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">{\u00b6 48} For all of the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for directed verdict as to the strict-product-liability and negligence claims. Therefore, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">{\u00b6 49} In its fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury in two respects: (1) by refusing to give the jury an instruction on the doctrine of assumption of the risk and (2) by refusing to give a so-called \u201csophisticated user\u201d instruction. We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>Dawson v. McNeal, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-396, 2004-Ohio-107, 2004 WL 51786, \u00b6 17; <em>Peck .v. Serio, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 471, 2003-Ohio-6561, 801 N.E.2d 890, \u00b6 6. \u201cGenerally, a trial court should give a requested instruction if it is a correct statement of the law applicable to the facts in the case and reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instruction.\u201d <em>Miller v. Lindsay-Green, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-848, 2005-Ohio-6366, 2005 WL 3220215, \u00b6 91, citing <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 575 N.E.2d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">{\u00b6 50} With respect to the defense of assumption of the risk, as we explained above, there was no evidence adduced upon which reasonable minds could differ as to whether appellee was aware of the defect in the FM22. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse to give the assumption-of-the-risk instruction. With respect to the \u201csophisticated user\u201d instruction, appellant argued below, and argues here, that by virtue of appellee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ten years of experience as a framing carpenter, he is a \u201csophisticated user\u201d of hammers, and his status as a sophisticated user means that he must be deemed to have been aware of the specific risk that the FM22 posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant provides no citation to any authority for this argument, and we are unaware of any such authority. Our research reveals that only one Ohio court has ever mentioned the \u201csophisticated user\u201d doctrine, and that court described it thusly: \u201cThe sophisticated or knowledgeable purchaser defense is invoked in cases involving suppliers of dangerous products to industrial companies.\u201d <em>Roberts v. George V. Hamilton, Inc. </em>(June 30, 2000), Jefferson App. No. 99 JE 26, 2000 WL 875324. <em>Roberts </em>involved a claim against a manufacturer of asbestos-containing insulation brought by the widow of a man who had formerly been employed by an industrial company that used the insulation, and the plaintiff alleged that the manufacturer had failed to warn her deceased husband\u2019s employer about the risks associated with the insulation. In that case, the \u201csophisticated user\u201d was the employer, not the plaintiffs decedent. No Ohio court has ever applied the \u201csophisticated user\u201d doctrine to a non-failure-to-warn claim, and appellant has cited no authority for the proposition that we should do so. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that, as a matter of law, appellee\u2019s experience as a carpenter warrants that he be deemed aware of the risk of a quench crack in his hammer. For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">{\u00b6 52} In its fifth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow it to cross-examine Dubois about the ASME safety standard for nail hammers. \u201cThe admission of evidence is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court may reverse only upon the showing of an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Peters v. Ohio State Lottery Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 296, 299, 587 N.E.2d 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">{\u00b6 53} Appellant argues that the court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of the ASME safety standard was prejudicial because the standard, which states, \u201cnail hammers shall not be used to strike * * * masonry nails\u201d demonstrates that appellee\u2019s use of the FM22 in that manner was not reasonably foreseeable to appellant. But as appellee points out, this argument would have misled the jury into believing that because appellant relied on the ASME standard for determining which uses it could reasonably foresee, appellee\u2019s conduct while using the hammer must have been governed by the ASME standard. Appellant does not argue, and we see no evidence, that the ASME standard is binding upon users such as appellee. Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to refuse to admit this evidence. For this reason, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>{\u00b6 54} In its sixth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for remittitur. Specifically, it argues that the court should have remitted the compensatory-damage award in the amount of future economic damages that the jury awarded. In light of our resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which we determined that appellant was entitled to a JNOV as a matter of law because the jury\u2019s award of future economic damages was unsupported by the evidence, appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is moot, and we overrule it on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">{\u00b6 55} In its seventh assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for new trial. It argues, as it did before the trial court, that it is entitled to a new trial: (1) pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(1), because the cumulative effect of the many errors below deprived it of a fair trial; (2) pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(6), because the jury\u2019s award of future economic damages was against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (3) pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(9), because the trial court made an error of law in admitting the testimony of Drs. Palfin and Growick.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">{\u00b6 56} In our resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, we concluded that the jury\u2019s award of future economic damages was indeed unsupported by sufficient evidence, and therefore, the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for JNOV; this renders moot the second argument under appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error. Our resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error also rendered moot appellant\u2019s assignment of error concerning the admission of the testimony of Drs. Palfin and Growick. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third argument under its seventh assignment of error is moot because it concerns the same issue. Finally, we have recognized only one error that prejudicially affected appellant during the proceedings below, and we have fully corrected it by sustaining appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. Thus, we do not discern a cumulative prejudice to appellant\u2019s defense that would warrant a new trial. For all of the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">{\u00b6 57} In summary, we sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, and we overrule appellant\u2019s second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, and we remand this matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b901-9\">McGrath, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b901-10\">Brown, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-12\">. <em>Cowling, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 276, 2006-Ohio-2418, 847 N.E.2d 405, at \u00b6 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. <em>Hanna v.

The basis for this finding appears to be that appellee has been able to return to work for his former employer at a higher wage and because the vocational expert could consider only certain factors such as accommodations made by his employer, but could not definitively say whether appellee could continue to be employed as a framing contractor. While appellee\u2019s current ability to earn wages does reduce any past lost wages, his impaired future earning claim is a matter that should be decided based upon the opinion of experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">{\u00b6 59} Appellee presented substantial, competent evidence through expert testimony that it was reasonably certain appellee would experience a loss of future earning capacity. The earning capacity of appellee is not necessarily dependent upon what is actually earned before or after the injury. Earning capacity is what appellee was capable of earning prior to the injury compared with what he is capable of earning in the future. The lost earning capacity of appellee was addressed by both the vocational expert and the economic expert for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">{\u00b6 60} The testimony of both experts was necessary in this case to establish appellee\u2019s diminished future earning capacity. The trial court\u2019s judgment is based upon both experts\u2019 opinions as to what impairment appellee will suffer in the future. Appellee questioned the physician to establish the disability, the vocational expert to discuss its effect in the workplace, and the economist to calculate its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">{\u00b6 61} The majority relies upon answers to questions posed to Dr. Growick as a basis for finding that there was a failure to prove future lost earning capacity. The vocational expert was asked the following questions on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">Q. You don\u2019t have any idea whatsoever, sir, within any reasonable degree of certainty, as to whether he is not going to be able to be employed as a framing carpenter, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-10\">Q. It would be totally speculative that he would not be able to do his job at some point, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">A. Correct. I couldn\u2019t predict the future other than if he has good personnel reviews currently, and the industry is doing well, and his employer is doing well, which sometimes the accommodations like his is employer specific. Given those considerations, other than that, I can\u2019t predict what would happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>{\u00b6 62} This testimony did not affect appellee\u2019s ability to prove lost earning capacity, as that element of damage has been accepted under Ohio law. The mere fact that appellee can still do his job today and the mere fact that his employer is accommodating him and may continue to accommodate him does not preclude a claim for lost earning capacity. At trial, Dr. Palfin gave an example of lost earning capacity when he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-5\">A. The reality in economics is capacity income of an individual. For example, if you have a physician who is earning [$]400,000 a year, decides to start a winery up in Napa, California, loses money a year and is injured, what is his loss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">It\u2019s not the loss as a proprietor of a winery in Napa. It\u2019s the loss of what his capacity is as a physician, what he could have done, not necessarily what he would have done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">The fact that no one can predict whether appellee\u2019s employer will continue to accommodate him does not preclude a finding of lost earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">{\u00b6 63} Appellee will suffer obvious deficits for the rest of his working life. Dr. Growick testified that with his depth-perception problem and monocular vision, appellee would be excluded from a significant portion of jobs he would be capable of doing. Appellee testified that he sometimes runs into things and he is slower. His current employer will not let him operate the forklift. His employer does not want him to work on the second floor of any house or walk the walls and lay them out for joists. The trial court properly submitted this issue to the jury, and the jury properly concluded that these restrictions would put appellee at an economic disadvantage in the future. The jury\u2019s verdict was reasonable, based upon expert testimony, that appellee will be more likely to be laid off in economic downturns and less likely to be hired for jobs in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">{\u00b6 64} The majority finds, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of appellee, that appellee failed to prove with reasonable certainty his claim for future lost earning capacity. In reaching its conclusion, the majority cited portions of Dr. Growick\u2019s testimony, ignoring the rest and failing to consider the testimony of Dr. Palfin. At trial, Dr. Growick testified to the following regarding appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-10\">[H]e scored average, which was consistent with what his vocational profile is. Although, interestingly enough, he had a relatively low verbal IQ, which might be consistent with the fact that he dropped out of high school. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">* * * [H]e will be excluded from a significant portion of the available jobs that he is capable of doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>* * * [T]he kinds of jobs he would be able to do, if he did become unemployed, certainly are not as broad as what he could have done prior to the accident. I would say it would be about 15 or 20 percent of the available unskilled jobs that he could do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-4\">And given the economy and everything else, you have to assume that he is going to have a tougher time with monocular vision, with low education, basically unskilled and low semi-skilled work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">{\u00b6 65} Dr. Growick testified that because appellee\u2019s current employer was making accommodations for him, he \u201cmight not be likely to get a similar job somewhere else.\u201d Dr. Growick agreed with counsel that appellee\u2019s employment prospects in the future are bleak. Dr Growick, on cross-examination, testified that \u201cthe kinds of jobs I would see [appellee] sort of gravitating to would be work order clerk. Somebody that is going to handle the manifest at a docking station when it comes in, things like that.\u201d Dr. Growick also testified that the skills necessary to be a carpenter require depth perception and field of vision according to definitions of occupational titles produced by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">{\u00b6 66} This testimony established that at least in Dr. Growick\u2019s opinion, appellee does have restrictions that will limit his capacity to earn income as a carpenter over the next 30 years. The next issue then to be addressed is whether the evidence in the record establishes that these restrictions result in reduced earning capacity as compared to appellee\u2019s preinjury earning capacity. The majority indicates that a jury should not be able to speculate as to the value attached to the postinjury earning capacity. However, Dr. Growick gave testimony as to the earning capacity of the type of job that appellee would be capable of performing. This testimony was set forth during the cross-examination of Dr. Growick when he testified that the kind of job appellee could perform, such as store clerk, would have the capacity to earn \u201c[e]ight to ten dollars an hour, generally speaking.\u201d It is probable that the jurors accepted the differential in earning capacity of eight to ten dollars per hour compared to the $14-per-hour capacity established by Dr. Palfin for a carpenter in reaching their verdict. The earning capacity difference of up to six dollars for 2,080 hours per year times 30 years equals $374,400 which is fairly close to the $417,000 in lost earning capacity found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">{\u00b6 67} Dr. Palfin, an expert witness for appellee, has over 40 years of experience as an economist. He has served as a bank examiner for the FDIC, a contracting officer and economist for the United States Department of Defense, and as a professor. Dr. Palfin was called to provide his opinion to quantify and calculate the actual lost earning capacity of appellee. Dr. Palfin relied in part on the following information from the testimony of Dr. Growick: (1) appellee is not necessarily a good candidate for further retraining without substantial education, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>(2) he is blind in one eye and will not improve, (3) 85 percent of all unskilled jobs require some depth perception, and (4) appellee is excluded from a significant portion of the labor market.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">{\u00b6 68} Dr. Palfin testified that his calculation of lost future earning capacity was based on $14 per hour through retirement at age 65. Dr. Palfin further testified that his opinion was based upon a reasonable degree of economic certainty. On cross-examination, appellant challenged Dr. Palfin as to whether the lost earning capacity of appellee was speculative. Dr. Palfin testified: \u201cIt is not speculative. Think of the example I gave you, the physician versus the wine venture. That\u2019s not speculative. Capacity is what counts.\u201d Again, on cross-examination, Dr. Palfin testified: \u201cAgain, capacity is what you could do, not what you would do or did do. Capacity, that\u2019s the key concept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">{\u00b6 69} There was evidence from the expert witnesses that established that the loss of vision in one eye resulted in a loss of earning capacity. The experts testified that the loss of one eye severely limited appellee\u2019s occupational choices and, at least according to Dr. Growick, disqualifies him from his chosen field of carpentry. Dr. Growick provided testimony from which the jury could conclude that the earning capacity post-injury would be in the range of eight to ten dollars per hour. Dr. Palfin established that the earning capacity preinjury would be $14 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">{\u00b6 70} The majority acknowledges that appellee\u2019s return to his former position does not necessarily preclude his recovery of future economic damages, but finds that appellee did not sustain his burden of proof because the experts\u2019 opinions as to his lost earning capacity were fundamentally flawed. I respectfully disagree. The trial court, in its decision denying appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, found that \u201cthe testimony, if believed by the jury, was that the incident in question caused plaintiff to permanently lose the sight in one of his eyes and that as a consequence of this condition, his employability potentialities and prospects in the future have suffered, all to his future economic detriment.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court found appellee had presented sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s award of future economic damages. Based upon an independent, de novo review of the record, I similarly conclude that reasonable minds could differ as to appellee\u2019s entitlement to future economic damages, and, thus, I would overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. Being in the minority, I find it unnecessary to address the issues raised under the second, sixth, and seventh assignments of error. I concur, however, with the majority\u2019s analysis of the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
