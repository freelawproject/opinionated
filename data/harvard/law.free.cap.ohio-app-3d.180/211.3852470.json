For reasons that follow, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 2} On February 18, 2008, RCO filed a complaint in the Franklin County Municipal Court against Clevenger, Antonio Fountoulakis, and New Resource Construction Consulting and Contracting (\u201cNew Resource Construction\u201d), alleging breach of contract. Clevenger answered the complaint on March 4, 2008. Fountoulakis and New Resource Construction, however, did not, and default judgment was entered against them on April 25, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 3} Clevenger moved for summary judgment on April 18, 2008, asserting that RCO had failed to plead the necessary elements in order to pierce the corporate veil and hold her personally liable for the acts of New Resource Construction. On May 5, 2008, RCO filed a joint memorandum contra and motion for summary judgment. Attached thereto, RCO submitted various exhibits as documentary evidence, which, it argued, demonstrated that New Resource Construction\u2019s corporate entity should be disregarded and Clevenger should be held personally liable for its acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">{\u00b6 4} On June 19, 2008, the trial court granted Clevenger\u2019s summary judgment, and in its decision explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">In the case at bar, the plaintiff filed a Complaint alleging breach of contract against Nicole Clevenger, Antonio Fountoulakis and New Resource Construction Consulting and Contracting, LLC. The plaintiff attached several exhibits to its Complaint, two of which were the contracts in question. The contracts were on New Resource letterhead and signed by Antonio Fountoulakis. None of the documentation attached contains Nicole Clevenger\u2019s name or signature. Nor does the Complaint specifically allege the conduct of Ms. Clevenger that entitles the plaintiff to relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">Plaintiff argues in its first response to the motion that defendant Clevenger has failed to prove that she was not directly involved with the activities of New Resource. Plaintiff makes some inference to the fact that Ms. Clevenger may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>have fraudulently created this limited liability company (\u201cNicole Clevenger had complete control over her closely held company and used it for her personal piggy bank.\u201d) The plaintiff did not allege fraud in its Complaint nor any other reason to pierce the limited liability company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">{\u00b6 5} RCO filed a timely appeal and assigns the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">1. Whether the trial court committed reversible error in entering summary judgment in favor of the appellee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">2. WThether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the case without allowing the appellant the opportunity to complete discovery and amend the original complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 6} Initially, we note that Clevenger has failed to file an appellate brief in this matter. Accordingly, pursuant to App.R. 18(C), this court may accept RCO\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as presented in its brief as correct and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment if RCO\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 7} RCO\u2019s first and second assignments of error are interrelated and will be considered jointly. The gravamen of RCO\u2019s argument under these assignments of error is that the trial court erred in granting Clevenger\u2019s motion for summary judgment because, contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding, RCO provided evidence that supported holding Clevenger personally liable for the acts of New Resource Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 8} Appellate review of summary judgment motions is de novo. <em>Helton v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 158, 703 N.E.2d 841. \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u201d <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment was made. <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">{\u00b6 9} The general rule is that corporations are distinct legal entities, and, thus, shareholders, officers and directors are not normally liable for the debts of the corporation. <em>Belvedere Condominium Unit Owners\u2019 Assn. v. R.E. Roark Cos. Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 274, 287, 617 N.E.2d 1075. In <em>Belvedere, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that in order to pierce the corporate veil and impose personal liability upon shareholders, it must be shown that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>(1) control over the corporation by those to be held liable was so complete that the corporation has no separate mind, will, or existence of its own, (2) control over the corporation by those to be held liable was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to disregard the corporate entity, and (3) injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control and wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 10} Ohio courts have recognized that \u201c \u2018there is no precise test to determine whether the elements required to pierce the corporate veil have been satisfied, and each case should be \u201cregarded as <em>\u2018sui generis\u2019 </em>and decidable on its own facts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Sanderson Farms, Inc. v. Gasbarro, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-461, 2004-Ohio-1460, 2004 WL 583849, at \u00b6 24-25, quoting <em>Lesick v. MedGroup Mgt., Inc. </em>(Oct. 29, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-990097, 1999 WL 979136, *7, quoting <em>Bucyrus-Erie Co. v. Gen. Prods. Corp. </em>(C.A.6,1981), 643 F.2d 413, 418. Because \u201c[o]ne of the purposes of incorporation is to limit the liability of individual shareholders,\u201d the party seeking to have the corporate form disregarded bears the burden of proof. <em>Univ. Circle Research Ctr. Corp. v. Galbreath Co. </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 835, 840, 667 N.E.2d 445, citing Section 3, Article XIII of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, the trial court granted summary judgment to Clevenger on the basis that RCO\u2019s complaint \u201cdid not allege fraud in its Complaint nor any other reason to pierce the limited liability company.\u201d We disagree, however, with the trial court\u2019s analysis of the issue. Under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, a complaint need only give the defendant fair notice of a desired claim and an opportunity to respond. <em>Leichliter v. Natl. City Bank of Columbus </em>(1999), 134 Ohio App.3d 26, 31, 729 N.E.2d 1285. \u201cPiercing the corporate veil is not a claim, it is a remedy encompassed within a claim. It is a doctrine wherein liability for an underlying tort may be imposed upon a particular individual.\u201d <em>Geier v. Natl. GG Industries, Inc. </em>(Dec. 23,1999), Lake App. No. 98-L-172, 1999 WL 1313640 (refusing to hold that a plaintiffs complaint had to relate a specific intention to proceed under the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, and, thus, the trial court properly allowed the jury to decide a piercing the corporate veil issue where the complaint contained some indication that evidence on the issue would be introduced at trial); see also <em>Dalicandro v. Morrison Rd. Dev. Co. </em>(Apr. 17, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-619, 2001 WL 379893. Thus, while RCO\u2019s complaint could have been drafted better, i.e., it raises vague and general allegations collectively against all defendants, as opposed to levying specific allegations against individual defendants, the complaint does allege that defendants (individually and severally) breached the contracts entered into with RCO in several ways, and also presented \u201can erroneous and false invoice.\u201d The pleading also informed Clevenger of RCO\u2019s intent to hold her individually liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding, RCO was not required to plead fraud in order to seek piercing of the corporate veil. While demonstrating (as opposed to pleading) fraud is one way to meet the second prong of the <em>Belvedere </em>test, a plaintiff may also meet that prong by demonstrating \u201can illegal act, or a similarly unlawful act.\u201d <em>Dombroski v. WellPoint, Inc., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 506, 2008-Ohio-4827, 895 N.E.2d 538, syllabus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s decision appears to focus on the qualitative nature of RCO\u2019s complaint, and not on the evidence that RCO submitted in connection with its joint memorandum contra and motion for summary judgment. Indeed, the issue before the trial court was procedurally postured on a motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss, and we cannot discern what weight, if any, the trial court gave to the documentary evidence submitted by RCO. The trial court\u2019s decision also does not address the first and third prongs of the <em>Belvedere </em>test, and, thus, it is unclear as to whether or not the trial court made these determinations. When the foregoing is considered in light of the fact that Clevenger failed to file an appellate brief and oppose the facts set forth by RCO on appeal, we are compelled to find that summary judgment was inappropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 13} Based on the foregoing, we sustain RCO\u2019s first and second assignments of error. In so doing, however, we express no opinion as to the ultimate merit of RCO\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court and remand this case to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-7\">Sadler and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">. In <em>Dombroski, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio recently modified the second prong of the <em>Belvedere </em>test, holding that to pierce the corporate veil, \"the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant shareholder exercised control over the corporation in such a manner as to commit fraud, an illegal act, or a similarly unlawful act.\u201d Id. at syllabus. It explained that \"[l]imiting piercing to cases in which the shareholders used their complete control over the corporate form to commit specific egregious acts is key to maintaining this balance. Were we to allow piercing every time a corporation under the complete control of a shareholder committed an unjust or inequitable act, virtually every close corporation could be pierced when sued, as nearly every lawsuit sets forth a form of unjust or inequitable action and close corporations are by definition controlled by an individual or small group of shareholders.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\">. Putting aside the fact that RCO was not required to <em>plead </em>the elements of fraud to pierce the corporate veil, we cannot discern whether or not the trial court considered RCO's allegation regarding the presentation of a \"false and erroneous invoice\u201d constituted an act that could serve as a basis for doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
