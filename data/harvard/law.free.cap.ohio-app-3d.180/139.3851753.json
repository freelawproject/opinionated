Sharrett\u2019s automobile collided with an automobile operated by Krista Stidham, killing Sharrett. Stidham was at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">{\u00b6 3} At the time of the collision, Stidham, the tortfeasor, had an automobile liability insurance policy with a $300,000 single limit. State Auto had issued to D. Keith and Angela Smith an automobile liability policy with an uninsured/underinsured endorsement that had limits of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. Progressive had issued to Matthew C. Sharrett and Tiffany Sharrett an automobile liability policy that had underinsured-motorist coverage with limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 for each accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The coverage of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy was insufficient to satisfy the damages sustained by the Smiths. Angela still had damages of $84,000, and Michaelia\u2019s remaining damages totaled $27,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">{\u00b6 5} Although State Auto\u2019s endorsement and the Progressive policy covered the Smiths\u2019 underinsured claims, the companies disagreed on how to apportion the claims in accordance with the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in their policies. Ultimately, State Auto paid its per-person policy limit of $50,000 to Angela, and Progressive then paid her $84,000. Michaelia received her entire underinsured settlement of $27,500 from State Auto. Progressive waived a volunteer defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 6} State Auto filed this action seeking a declaration that both insurers shared the liability for the underinsured claims proportionately according to the policies\u2019 limits. State Auto also sought contribution from Progressive for two-thirds of State Auto\u2019s payments to the Smiths. Progressive counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that the policies should apply in a sequential manner. Specifically, Progressive contended that the State Auto policy was primary, that its own policy was excess, and that its payment of $34,000 to Angela Smith satisfied its obligation as the excess insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 7} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and submitted the motions on stipulated facts. The trial court declared that both policies provided excess coverage and that both insurers were liable in proportion to the per-accident limit of insurance provided by their respective policies. The court entered judgment for State Auto in the amount of $51,666.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 8} Progressive raises two assignments of error in this appeal. First, it maintains that State Auto provided primary underinsured coverage and that, as a result, the trial court erred by declaring Progressive responsible for a pro-rata share. Second, Progressive argues that even if pro-rata liability was appropriate, the trial court erred in calculating its pro-rata share. We review de novo the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment and its interpretation of the insurance contracts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">{\u00b6 9} It is undisputed that the State Auto endorsement and the Progressive policy provided underinsured coverage to the Smiths in this case. Moreover, both policies would have provided primary underinsured coverage except for the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses. An \u201cother insurance\u201d clause can limit liability when other insurance is available to cover the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>{\u00b6 10} State Auto\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provided, in critical part, that \u201c[i]f there is other applicable insurance available under one or more policies or provisions of coverage that is similar to the insurance provided by this [uninsured/underinsured] endorsement: [a]ny insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any collectible insurance providing such coverage on a primary basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 11} State Auto argues that this clause should have limited its liability to excess coverage because the Smiths did not own the vehicles involved in the collision and because the Progressive policy provided primary coverage. State Auto recognizes, however, that this position creates a Catch-22, because its primary coverage triggered the excess coverage in Progressive\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause under these facts, leaving the Smiths without primary coverage. State Auto advocates that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses should have cancelled each other out and that pro-rata liability had to be applied to avert this absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 12} Progressive argues that State Auto may have intended to limit its liability with the \u201cother insurance\u201d excess clause, but contends that the \u201cexcess\u201d clause employed was ambiguous because it referred to insurance coverage for \u201cvehicles,\u201d and because underinsured-motorist coverage applies to persons, not vehicles. According to Progressive, State Auto\u2019s excess clause should have been held unenforceable, and State Auto should have been declared the primary underinsurance provider. Progressive alone would have gained from such a reading because the issue was not coverage of the insureds but the order in which the two insurers were to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 13} As with any contract, we must give the insurance policy a reasonable construction in conformity with the intention of the insured and the insurer as gathered from the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will not create an ambiguity where none exists.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 14} We determine that State Auto and the Smiths intended that the insurance apply to persons and that the excess clause referred to vehicles, because the underinsured-motorist coverage was found in a motorist provision and the coverage was triggered by an accident involving an automobile.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude that the meaning of State Auto\u2019s excess clause was not ambiguous, although its reference to \u201cvehicles\u201d may have lacked precision. Other courts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>have decided the priority of uninsured/underinsured coverage have enforced identical and similar excess clauses, despite the reference to vehicles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">{\u00b6 15} Progressive argues next that its excess clause, which did not refer to a vehicle, was clearer and should have been given effect over State Auto\u2019s clause, resulting in sequential coverage. Progressive\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provided, \u201cIf there is other applicable uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, we will pay only our share of the damages. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all available coverage limits. However, any insurance we provide shall be excess over any other uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, except for bodily injury to you or a relative when occupying a covered vehicle.\u201d \u201cYou\u201d is defined as a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 16} There is no doubt that Progressive\u2019s excess clause was triggered: the Smiths were not named insureds or relatives under the Progressive policy, and the State Auto policy provided coverage. But the policies were similar in the risk they insured, and the \u201cother insurance\u201d excess clauses in both policies were enforceable and applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 17} When faced with a similar conflict of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. </em>Co.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applied pro-rata liability, declaring that \u201c[w]here two insurance policies cover the same risk and both provide that their liability with regard to that risk shall be excess insurance over other valid, collectible insurance, the two insurers become liable in proportion to the amount of insurance provided by their respective policies.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court rejected an argument that a more specific clause should apply.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>{\u00b6 18} While <em>Buckeye Union </em>dealt with liability insurance, appellate courts have applied <em>Buckeye Union\u2019s </em>rule to disputes involving uninsured/underinsured coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">{\u00b6 19} In accordance with <em>Buckeye Union, </em>we determine that pro-rata liability applied in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we decline Progressive\u2019s invitation to favor its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause over State Auto\u2019s. Accordingly, we overrule the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 20} Progressive challenges the trial court\u2019s calculation of its pro-rata liability in the second assignment of error. Two issues surface in our analysis: (1) which policy limits \u2014 the per accident or the per person \u2014 defined the ratio and (2) what amount of liability was to be apportioned.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">{\u00b6 21} The court in <em>Buckeye Union </em>did not directly address which limits govern because the policies reviewed in that case contained single limits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court used the combined maximum <em>per-accident </em>policy limits to determine the pro-rata ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">{\u00b6 22} Both parties advocate that the policies\u2019 combined <em>per-person </em>limits of underinsured insurance applied in this case. Thus, $150,000 was the \u201camount of insurance\u201d applicable for determining the pro-rata share. A pro-rata ratio based upon the per-person policy limits would impose one-third of the liability on State Auto and two-thirds on Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">{\u00b6 23} We do not need to decide between the limits because State Auto sought contribution for only two-thirds of the liability and not three-fourths. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred by ordering Progressive to contribute more than its two-thirds share.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">{\u00b6 24} Although the parties agree on the proration formula, they disagree on the amount of liability to be prorated. Progressive argues that this amount included its payment to Angela Smith as well as State Auto\u2019s payments to the Smiths. State Auto contends that Progressive\u2019s payment should be excluded. But State Auto does not present a cogent argument to support this position. And State Auto\u2019s position conflicts with the pro-rata language in both policies and ignores Progressive\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>{\u00b6 25} We agree with Progressive: to determine the amount of liability to be prorated in this case, we must combine the insurers\u2019 payments to settle the Smith\u2019s underinsured claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">{\u00b6 26} The underinsured payments were $84,000 to Angela and $27,500 to Michaelia. State Auto\u2019s pro-rata share is $28,000 and $9,166.67, respectively, for a combined total of $37,166.67. Because State Auto paid $77,500, it overpaid by $40,333.33 and is owed this amount from Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, we sustain the second assignment of error on this basis and reduce the judgment against Progressive to $40,333.33. We otherwise affirm the trial court\u2019s declaration that pro-rata liability applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-7\">Sundermann, P.J., and Dinkelacker, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\">. <em>Doe v.
