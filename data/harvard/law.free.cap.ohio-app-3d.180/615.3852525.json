Robert Reidy. Appellants allege that Reidy sexually assaulted them on several occasions between 1965 and 1968. As the basis of their fraud claim, appellants assert that Reidy, a Roman Catholic parish priest, had a fiduciary relationship with appellants, and, as a consequence, had a duty to disclose his sexual propensities, his history as a sexual abuser, and his true intentions concerning appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">{\u00b6 2} In his cross-appeal, Reidy argues that the applicable statutes of limitations bar appellants\u2019 sexual-assault claims, as well as their claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of R.C. 2151.421 (negligent reporting). Reidy further contends that appellants\u2019 negligent-reporting claim is premised upon a retroactive application of the code. Finally, Reidy argues that appellants\u2019 civil-conspiracy claim should have been dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">{\u00b6 3} Reidy\u2019s cross-appeal is the subject of a motion to dismiss filed in this court. Appellants assert that the denial of a motion to dismiss is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d as that term is defined by R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">{\u00b6 4} In fact, appellants\u2019 efforts to transform their sexual-assault claims into a fraud claim were properly dismissed by the trial court. Appellants failed to assert at least two essential elements of their fraud claim, i.e., a duty to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>and a transaction. Although appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is overruled, their motion to dismiss the cross-appeal is granted. The denial of Reidy\u2019s motion to dismiss by the trial court did not determine the action or prevent a judgment, and, as a consequence, is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 5} On May 29, 2002, appellants filed suit against Reidy in this matter. Pertinent to this appeal, in their second amended complaint, appellants raised claims for sexual assault, violations of R.C. 2151.421 (negligent reporting), breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, civil conspiracy, and violations of the Ohio Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\u201cRICO\u201d) statute against Reidy. Appellants also asserted claims for negligence, negligent hiring, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, vicarious liability, fraud, civil conspiracy, and violations of the Ohio RICO statute against appellees and cross-appellants, Bishop Thomas Tobin and the Catholic Diocese of Youngstown.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 6} On May 12, 2003, Reidy filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On May 13, 2003, Tobin and the diocese jointly filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On July 2, 2003, appellants filed in opposition. On July 8, 2003, the trial court conducted an oral hearing on the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 7} In a judgment entry dated August 6, 2003, the trial court dismissed appellants\u2019 fraud claims against Reidy, Tobin, and the diocese pursuant to Civ.R. 12(b)(6) and 9(B), which require that a claim for fraud be pleaded with particularity. In addition, the trial court dismissed appellants\u2019 negligent-hiring claim and their Ohio RICO claim and rejected their equitable-estoppel argument regarding the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 8} However, the lion\u2019s share of appellants\u2019 claims survived the motions to dismiss because the trial court concluded that they had asserted repressed memory. The trial court premised its conclusion on the following allegations in the second amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe sexual abuse of plaintiffs and the circumstances under which it occurred caused plaintiffs to develop various coping mechanisms which prohibited them from knowing or having reason to know that they were victims of sexual abuse and, as a result, suffered injury. The sexual abuse of plaintiffs and the circumstances under which it occurred also caused plaintiffs to develop confusion and symptoms of psychological disorders, including great shame, guilt, self-blame, depression, repression and disassociation. As a result, plaintiffs were unable to perceive or know that the conduct of Defendant Reidy was wrongful or abusive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the existence or nature of their psychological and emotional injuries and the connection of such injuries to the sexual abuse perpetrated upon them by Defendant Reidy. Not until a period within one year of the filing of this lawsuit did plaintiffs begin to know or have reasons to know that Defendant Reidy engaged in wrongful or abusive acts that caused their injuries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 10} With respect to the dismissal of appellants\u2019 fraud claims, the trial court stated, \u201cThe fifth issue is whether Plaintiffs fail to plead the fraud claims with particularity pursuant to Civ.R. 9(B). Plaintiffs do not state the requisite elements of fraud in their complaint. Therefore, Defendants [sic] motion to dismiss Plaintiffs [sic] fraud and RICO claims is GRANTED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 11} On October 1, 2003, appellants filed a motion seeking leave to file their third amended complaint instanter. In this third amended complaint, appellants reasserted their fraud claims with two substantive changes. First, appellants raised the fraud claims against Reidy in a separate count. In other words, for the first time, appellants specifically alleged that Reidy was acting in a fiduciary capacity and owed a duty to disclose his sexual proclivities to appellants. Second, appellants provided additional factual allegations, citing a written directive from Rome relating secret allegations of sexual abuse and a directive to transfer the accused in order to avoid detection, to fulfill the requirements of Civ.R. 9(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 12} In a judgment entry dated November 14, 2003, the trial court granted appellants\u2019 motion to file a third amended complaint. However, the trial court stated, \u201c[T]he Court does not feel that the arguments set forth [in the third amended complaint] are sufficient to change the decision to dismiss the negligent hiring, fraud, and RICO claims.\u201d On November 26, 2003, appellants filed a motion for clarification of the November 14, 2003 judgment entry. On December 11, 2003, the trial court confirmed that the negligent hiring, fraud, and RICO claims raised in the third amended complaint had been dismissed and stated that there was no just reason for delay. This timely appeal was filed on January 12, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 13} Several assignments of error were rendered moot during the pendency of this appeal. First, appellants concede that their Ohio RICO claim and equitable-estoppel argument were rejected by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Doe v. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 491, 2006-Ohio-2625, 849 N.E.2d 268. Second, approximately six months after the issuance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Archdiocese of Cincinnati, </em>appellants entered into a settlement agreement with Tobin and the archdiocese. Upon notification of the settlement, we ordered appellants and Reidy to file supplemental briefs in order to clarify the assignments of error that remain at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">{\u00b6 14} An order granting a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is subject to de novo review on appeal. <em>State ex rel. Cook v. Seneca Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>175 Ohio App.3d 721, 2008-Ohio-736, 889 N.E.2d 153, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 15} In order to sustain the dismissal, \u201cit must appear beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\u201d <em>LeRoy v. Allen, Yurasek, &amp; Merklin, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 323, 2007-Ohio-3608, 872 N.E.2d 254, \u00b6 14, citing <em>Archdiocese of Cincinnati, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 491, 2006-Ohio-2625, 849 N.E.2d 268, at \u00b6 11. In reviewing whether a motion to dismiss should be granted, an appellate court must construe all factual allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 190, 192, 532 N.E.2d 753. Additionally, the material allegations of the complaint and any inferences drawn therefrom must be construed in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>LeRoy </em>at \u00b6 14, citing <em>Kenty v. Transamerica Premium Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 415, 418, 650 N.E.2d 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 16} As a result of the holding in <em>Archdiocese of Cincinnati </em>and the settlement reached between appellants, Tobin, and the archdiocese, assignments of error one, two, four, and five are either moot or settled and withdrawn. Thus, the sole remaining assignment of error asserted by appellants is the third assignment of error from their original brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law in dismissing appellants\u2019 fraud claims as to appellee Reidy for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 18} In order to recover on a claim for actual fraud in Ohio, a plaintiff must establish the following six elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018(a) a representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018(b) which is material to the transaction at hand,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c \u2018(c) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-14\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c \u2018(d) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201c \u2018(e) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c \u2018(f) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans v. Chambers Funeral Homes, </em>8th Dist. No. 89900, 2008-Ohio-3554, 2008 WL 2766173, \u00b6 39, quoting <em>Gaines v. Preterm-Cleveland, Inc. </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 54, 55, 514 N.E.2d 709. Allegations of fraud must be pleaded with particularity. Civ.R. 9(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 25} In their third amended complaint, appellants argue that Reidy had a fiduciary relationship with appellants, and, therefore, a duty to fully disclose his propensity for sexual abuse, his history of sexual abuse, and his true intentions concerning appellants. Appellants further allege that Reidy concealed the foregoing material information from appellants in order to induce their confidence so that he could sexually abuse them. Finally, appellants claim that they justifiably relied to their detriment on the concealed facts, and, as a consequence, suffered repeated incidents of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 26} In the August 6, 2003 judgment entry, the trial court concludes without explanation that \u201c[pjlaintiffs do not state the requisite elements of fraud in their complaint.\u201d In his appellate brief, Reidy contends that appellants have failed to plead any history of sexual abuse perpetrated by him prior to the alleged assault of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 27} In response to Reidy\u2019s assertion, appellants focus their fraud argument on a directive from Rome instructing church officials to conceal complaints of sexual abuse and to transfer offending priests to avoid detection. Appellants also rely on the trial court\u2019s statement in the judgment entry that \u201c[a] reasonable inference can be drawn from the recurrent transfer of Defendant Reidy from parish to parish set forth in \u00b6 6 of the second amended complaint that Defendant Diocese may have been aware of a potential problem with sexual abuse involving Defendant Reidy.\u201d However, these allegations do not save appellants\u2019 fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 28} The defect in appellants\u2019 claim lies in their failure to establish several elements of fraud. First, appellants allege, as a foregone conclusion, that Reidy had a fiduciary relationship with each plaintiff, despite the fact that no Ohio court, or other state or federal court, has recognized that a priest owes a per se fiduciary duty to his congregants.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">{\u00b6 29} The issue was raised in Ohio approximately 20 years ago in <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 527 N.E.2d 1235. Strock filed a breach-of-fiduciary-duty claim against his minister, when he discovered that the minister was engaged in an affair with Mrs. Strock at the same time he was performing marriage-counseling services for the couple. Whether the minister owed a fiduciary duty to Strock was never addressed, because the breach-of-fiduciary-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>duty claim was rejected as an effort to revive abolished amatory actions for alienation of affections. Id. at 216-217, 527 N.E.2d 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 30} Other states that have considered the issue have rejected a per se fiduciary relationship between clergy and their congregants in favor of a rule that requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that his or her relationship with the institution was somehow unique or distinct from the institution\u2019s relationship with other parishioners. For instance, in cases involving adult congregants, several decisions have turned on whether the parishioner sought formal pastoral counseling from the minister or priest. See <em>Ahern v. Kappalumakkel </em>(2006), 97 Conn.App. 189, 199, 903 A.2d 266; <em>F.G. v. MacDonell </em>(1997), 150 N.J. 550, 564, 696 A.2d 697; <em>Moses v. Diocese of Colorado </em>(Colo.1993), 863 P.2d 310, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 31} Child congregants were addressed in <em>Martinelli v. Bridgeport R.C. Diocesan Corp. </em>(C.A.2, 1999), 196 F.3d 409, in which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the diocese owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, because the plaintiff had been a student at a diocesan school that employed the abusive priest, and the diocese knew that the plaintiff had a \u201cspecial and privileged relationship\u201d with the priest as a result of his membership in a small group of boys mentored by the priest. Id. at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"AT0\">{\u00b6 32} Typically, breach-of-fiduciary claims and fraud claims based upon the sexual molestation of minors by priests have been asserted against the institution, rather than the individual. See <em>Doe v. Archdiocese of Milwaukee </em>(2005), 284 Wis.2d 307, 700 N.W.2d 180; <em>Doe v. Norwich Roman Catholic Diocese </em>(2006), 40 Conn.Supp. 667, 909 A.2d 983. Consequently, they provide little insight into the fraud claim asserted against Reidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 33} In Ohio, a \u201cfiduciary\u201d is \u201ca person having a duty, created by his undertaking, to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Evans v. Chambers Funeral Homes, </em>8th Dist. No. 89900, 2008-Ohio-3554, 2008 WL 2766173, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Strode, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 207, 527 N.E.2d 1235. A \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d is formed when \u201cspecial confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u201d <em>In re Termination of Emp. of Pratt </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St.2d 107, 115, 69 O.O.2d 512, 321 N.E.2d 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\"> {\u00b6 34} The fiduciary\u2019s role may be assumed by formal appointment or it may arise de facto from a more informal relationship between the parties. For the de facto status to be recognized, however, both parties must understand that under the circumstances, a special trust and confidence has been reposed in one by the other. <em>Blon v. Bank One, Akron, N.A. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 98, 519 N.E.2d 363. However, \u201ca mere friendship in which a person renders gratuitous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>assistance to a friend does not give rise to a confidential or fiduciary relationship.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Hill </em>(March 15, 2000), 4th Dist. No.99CA2663, 2000 WL 326134, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 35} Despite the apparently broad definition of the term \u201cfiduciary\u201d in Ohio, a review of the case law reveals that courts have been reluctant to characterize relationships between individuals as being fiduciary in nature, with the obvious exception of those relationships that involve statutorily-imposed duties. See, e.g., <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Century 21 Arrow Realty, </em>8th Dist. Nos. 87081 and 87108, 2006-Ohio-3967, 2006 WL 2171568, \u00b6 32; <em>Homing v. Fletcher, </em>7th Dist. No. 05 MA 7, 2005-Ohio-7078, 2005 WL 3642343, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 36} Courts have required complete dependence by the inferior party in order to recognize the de facto status. See <em>In re Estate of Svab </em>(1966), 8 Ohio App.2d 80, 88, 37 O.O.2d 86, 220 N.E.2d 720 (daughter is fiduciary where mother\u2019s eyesight prevented her from reading joint-and-survivorship documents); but see <em>Hill, </em>2000 WL 326134 (fiduciary relationship between relatively independent uncle and niece began when parties executed power of attorney); and <em>In re Case </em>(Apr. 3,1998), 2nd Dist. No. 16747,1998 WL 151141 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 37} The third amended complaint reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cDue to Plaintiffs\u2019 position as minors, together with Defendant Reidy\u2019s position in the Roman Catholic Church as a priest, holy man and authority figure, and his fiduciary relationship with each Plaintiff, Defendant Reidy was able to exert control and continue to have control and influence over Plaintiffs. By his words, actions and omissions, during the period from at least 1965-1968, Defendant Reidy represented to Plaintiffs that the object of his relationship with Plaintiffs was to provide counseling, comfort and advice and assured each Plaintiff that his conduct was proper. This occurred during each contact that Defendant Reidy had with each Plaintiff during this time frame. Defendant Reidy actively and fraudulently concealed from Plaintiffs the wrongfulness of his sexual exploitation and misconduct involving Plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">{\u00b6 39} The relationship described in the third amended complaint falls short of the complete dependence required in Ohio to demonstrate a de facto fiduciary relationship. Moreover, there is no precedent in Ohio for the conclusion that an adult who undertakes a friendship with a minor is a de facto fiduciary. Finally, Reidy correctly asserts that appellants do not allege that he had sexually assaulted anyone prior to 1965, nor have they identified the \u201csexual propensities\u201d he allegedly had a duty to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">{\u00b6 40} Even assuming arguendo that Reidy was a de facto fiduciary, Appellants do not identify the transaction that serves as the basis of their fraud claim. In order to assert a viable fraud claim, appellants must allege that Reidy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>concealed a fact \u201c \u2018material to the transaction at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans, </em>2008-Ohio-3554, 2008 WL 2766173, \u00b6 39, quoting <em>Gaines v. Preterm-Cleveland, Inc., </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 55, 514 N.E.2d 709. Appellants appear to premise their fraud claim on the fact that they trusted Reidy, and, as a consequence, they suffered injuries as a proximate cause of that trust. However, the engenderment of trust is simply not the kind of transaction contemplated by the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">(\u00b6 41} In effect, appellants attempt to retrofit their sexual-assault claims into a fraud claim. The Supreme Court of Ohio rejected a similar effort to transform sexual-assault claims into other torts in <em>Doe v. First United Methodist Church </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 531, 629 N.E.2d 402, 407. In an effort to circumvent the one-year statute of limitations for sexual abuse, the appellant in <em>First United Methodist </em>argued that the allegations in her complaint also constituted negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. To the contrary, the Supreme Court concluded, \u201cThe fact that appellant pled negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress cannot be allowed to mask or change the fundamental nature of Appellants\u2019 causes of action which are predicated upon acts of sexual battery.\u201d Id. at 537, 629 N.E.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 42} Construing the allegations in the third amended complaint as true, Reidy\u2019s actions, while constituting reprehensible behavior, do not establish the requisite elements of actual fraud. Moreover, the allegations reveal an improper effort to change the fundamental nature of their sexual-abuse claims. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 fraud claim against Reidy is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">CROSS-ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cI. Counts 1 through 10 and 14, 15, and 17 of the third amended complaint must be dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cII. Count 14, which asserts a violation of Rev.Code \u00a7 2151.421 must be dismissed as violating the prohibition against retroactive laws set out in Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 1.48 and Art. II, \u00a7 28 of the Ohio Constitution, and for its failure to state a claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cHI. Count 20, which alleges a claim for conspiracy fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">{\u00b6 46} With respect to counts 1 through 10, 14, 15, and 17, Reidy contends that appellants\u2019 allegations of repressed memory are so nebulous that the trial court should have rejected them. He states, \u201cTo be sure, while a motion to dismiss for the failure to state a claim does not prevent a judgment in movant\u2019s favor if it is denied in the usual case, in the context of <em>this </em>case, where the allegations in the complaint on their face patently and unambiguously showed the claims are prohibited, an entirely different situation is presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>{\u00b6 47} Reidy further contends that appellants\u2019 failure-to-report claim violates the prohibition against retroactive law. Finally, Reidy argues that the conspiracy claim is deficient because appellants fail to state a damage claim independent of the underlying tort and because members of an organization cannot conspire with one another since an organization can act only through its agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b648} Before we reach the merits of Reidy\u2019s appeal, we must first determine whether the judgment entry denying his motion to dismiss is a final, appealable order. Appellants argue that the denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 49} First, we are aware that the trial court included the phrase \u201cno just cause for delay\u201d in its December 11, 2003 judgment entry. However, \u201cthe mere addition of Civ.R. 54(B) language to what is not a final order does not transform that entry into a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Sason v. Shepherd, </em>11th Dist. No. 2007-L-199, 2008-Ohio-173, 2008 WL 171069, \u00b6 3, citing <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136, 1138 (\u201cthe phrase \u2018no just reason for delay\u2019 is not a mystical incantation which transforms a nonfinal order into a final appealable order,\u201d <em>Wisintainer </em>at 354, 617 N.E.2d 1136). Consequently, the trial court\u2019s invocation of the Civ.R. 54(B) language does not convert the December 11, 2003 judgment entry into a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 50} We addressed the appealability of a denial of a motion to dismiss based upon the statute of limitations in <em>Hughes v. Zordich </em>(Apr. 25, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 99 C.A. 167, 2001 WL 1740069. After acknowledging the constitutional limitations on the jurisdiction of appellate courts and reviewing the definition of a \u201cfinal order\u201d set forth in R.C. 2505.02(B), we concluded that the trial court\u2019s order did not fit into any of the categories listed in the statute: \u201cSuch a ruling does not determine the action or prevent a judgment. Appellant still has the opportunity to prevail at trial on the merits of her case. Furthermore, should she not prevail at trial, she will then have occasion to appeal that judgment.\u201d Id. at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 51} The same is true in the case sub judice. Here, Reidy will have an opportunity to investigate appellants\u2019 claims of repressed memory during the discovery process. In the event that appellants cannot substantiate their claims, Reidy will have ample opportunity to challenge those claims on summary judgment and/or at trial, and, if necessary, on appeal. Likewise, Reidy will have additional opportunities to advance his legal challenges to appellants\u2019 negligent-reporting and civil-conspiracy claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 52} Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of Reidy\u2019s motion to dismiss is not a final, appealable order. Consequently, we hereby dismiss Reidy\u2019s cross-appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>{\u00b6 53} In summary, appellants\u2019 third assignment of error predicated on the dismissal of their fraud claim is overruled, as appellants cannot establish at least two elements: a duty to disclose and a transaction. Appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss Reidy\u2019s cross-appeal is granted, as that portion of the August 6, 2003 judgment entry denying Reidy\u2019s motion to dismiss does not constitute a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-6\">Vukovich and Rice, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b664-7\">Cynthia Rice, J., of the Eleventh District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
