For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">{\u00b6 2} On August 12, 2002, appellee removed appellant from his classified civil service position for violating several of appellee\u2019s written work policies. Appellant appealed his removal to the SPBR. The SPBR stayed the appeal pending the disposition of a related criminal case. Following appellant\u2019s conviction, appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal to the SPBR. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) issued a report and recommendation finding that as a result of his conviction, appellant forfeited his status as a classified employee and was thus barred from receiving any compensation from the date of his removal forward. Accordingly, the ALJ recommended that appellant\u2019s appeal be dismissed. The SPBR overruled appellant\u2019s objections, adopted the ALJ\u2019s report and recommendation, and dismissed the appeal. Appellant appealed the SPBR\u2019s dismissal order to the common pleas court, which reversed and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">{\u00b6 3} Following that hearing, a different ALJ issued a report recommending that the SPBR affirm the removal order. The ALJ concluded that although appellee had not proven all the allegations set forth in the removal order by a preponderance of the evidence, appellee had proven allegations serious enough to warrant upholding the removal order. Appellant filed objections to the ALJ\u2019s report and recommendation, but, on July 9, 2007, the SPBR issued an order adopting the ALJ\u2019s recommendation and affirming appellant\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Appellant filed a timely appeal, pursuant to R.C. 119.12, to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, where he argued that the SPBR\u2019s decision was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. Appellant further argued that the SPBR failed to afford sufficient weight to appellant\u2019s evidence of disparate treatment. On July 15, 2008, the common pleas court affirmed the SPBR\u2019s order, finding that appellant\u2019s actions, as established by the evidence, constituted violations of appellee\u2019s written work policies. The court concluded that the SPBR\u2019s decision was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant timely appealed to this court, where he raises two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">The decision of the lower court affirming the order of the State Personnel Board of review was erroneous insofar as the order of the board upholding the appellee\u2019s removal of Warren L. Long was not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">The decision of the lower court affirming the order of the State Personnel Board of review was erroneous insofar as the order of the board failing to give sufficient weight to appellant\u2019s evidence of disparate treatment was not in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">{\u00b6 6} In an administrative appeal, pursuant to R.C. 119.12, the common pleas court reviews an order to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. The Supreme Court of Ohio has defined reliable, probative, and substantial evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-9\">(1) \u201cReliable\u201d evidence is dependable; that is, it can be confidently trusted. In order to be reliable, there must be a reasonable probability that the evidence is true. (2) \u201cProbative\u201d evidence is evidence that tends to prove the issue in question; it must be relevant in determining the issue. (3) \u201cSubstantial\u201d evidence is evidence with some weight; it must have importance and value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">(Footnotes omitted.) <em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">{\u00b6 7} The common pleas court\u2019s \u201creview of the administrative record is neither a trial <em>de novo </em>nor an appeal on questions of law only, but a hybrid review in which the court \u2018must appraise all the evidence as to the credibility of the witnesses, the probative character of the evidence, and the weight thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lies v. Veterinary Med. Bd. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 204, 207, 2 OBR 223, 441 N.E.2d 584, quoting <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 280, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390. The common pleas court \u201cmust give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts,\u201d although \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>findings of the agency are by no means conclusive.\u201d <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"> {\u00b6 8} This court\u2019s standard of review is more limited than that of the common pleas court. In reviewing the common pleas court\u2019s determination that the SPBR\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, this court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the common pleas court abused its discretion. <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264. \u201c \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. Absent an abuse of discretion, the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency or the common pleas court. <em>Provisions Plus Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-670, 2004-Ohio-592, 2004 WL 240215, \u00b6 8, citing <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 614 N.E.2d 748. However, on the question of whether the board\u2019s order was in accordance with the law, this court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Kistler v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1095, 2006-Ohio-3308, 2006 WL 1781457, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">{\u00b6 9} At the outset, we must address appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court applied the wrong standard of review when it affirmed the SPBR\u2019s order. \u201cA trial court\u2019s application of a standard of review when reviewing an administrative order is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Ohio FAIR Plan Underwriting Assn., </em>174 Ohio App.3d 218, 2007-Ohio-6505, 881 N.E.2d 872, \u00b64, citing <em>Beck v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>Clermont App. No. CA2005-04-030, 2006-Ohio-60, 2006 WL 39408, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">{\u00b6 10} As noted by appellant, in its decision and entry, the trial court initially cited R.C. 4141.282(H), which sets forth the standard of review applicable to an appeal from a decision of the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission. Following its analysis of the pertinent issues, however, the court concluded that \u201creliable, probative and substantial evidence supports the decision of the Board and the decision is in accordance with applicable law.\u201d As the court ultimately applied the correct standard of review set forth in R.C. 119.12, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">{\u00b6 11} Having determined that the trial court applied the correct standard of review, we turn now to the merits of appellant\u2019s appeal. By the first assignment of error, appellant contends that the court abused its discretion in affirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>SPBR\u2019s decision, as it is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">{\u00b6 12} Documentary and witness testimony provided at the administrative hearing generally established the following facts. Appellant began his employment with appellee on January 4,1988. At the time of his removal, appellant was an External Audit Manager I in the Audit Performance and Consulting Section of the Bureau of Audits, one of four bureaus within the Office of Research, Assessment, and Accountability. Appellant managed a group of auditors working in the Toledo and Cincinnati regions. Each of these regions employed one supervisor who reported directly to appellant. Appellant reported to External Audit Manager II, Christopher Carson.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant\u2019s job responsibilities primarily involved management and coordination of field audits for various entities, including Medicaid providers. Appellee issued appellant desktop and laptop computers equipped with software and e-mail capabilities to facilitate appellant\u2019s job performance. Appellant\u2019s position and job responsibilities exposed him to sensitive client-based information related to Medicaid services, including Medicaid recipients\u2019 names and Social Security numbers, as well as dates and types of services provided. This information could be accessed via appellant\u2019s desktop and laptap computers. All employees, including appellant, were required to abide by appellee\u2019s written work policies, including, as pertinent here, the \u201cStandards of Employee Conduct,\u201d the \u201cComputer and Information Systems Usage Policy,\u201d and the \u201cTelephone Usage Policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">{\u00b6 14} In 2002, Dorothy Hughes, an investigator in appellee\u2019s Office of the Chief Inspector, received a complaint from the Ohio Inspector General alleging that appellant had utilized his state position to commit fraud. Hughes investigated the matter on behalf of appellee. In the course of the investigation, Hughes interviewed appellant and several other individuals. The investigation also included an inspection of appellant\u2019s state-issued laptop and desktop computers and computer disks, as well as office telephone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">{\u00b6 15} Following the investigation, Hughes issued a July 15, 2002 report, which summarized the interviews and the information gleaned from review of the computers, computer disks, and telephone records. That report provides the following pertinent facts. Hughes interviewed the complainant, David Dempsey, on May 29, 2002. Dempsey stated that his friend, Warren Anthony, introduced him to appellant in an effort to help him obtain a large business loan. Appellant represented that he was an auditor for the state of Ohio, that he owned his own company, and that he would have no problem securing the loan for Dempsey. Appellant told Dempsey to wire $15,000 to appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s bank account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Dempsey complied with appellant\u2019s directive; however, appellant failed to obtain the loan and did not return the $15,000 to Dempsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">{\u00b6 16} Hughes first interviewed appellant on May 30, 2002. Appellant stated that he knew Anthony personally, but was never involved in a business relationship with him. Appellant told Dempsey that he could secure the loan and that the broker\u2019s fees would be approximately $15,000. Dempsey was late with the payment, so appellant personally borrowed the money to pay the broker fees for him. When Dempsey wired the money to appellant, he kept it as repayment for his fronting the broker fees. Although the broker refused to extend the loan to Dempsey, appellant later arranged for a friend to loan the money to Dempsey. Dempsey refused to accept the loan. The broker refused to return the money because the loan was offered but refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">{\u00b6 17} Hughes also questioned appellant about his computer usage. Appellant stated that he often permitted his staff to borrow his laptop computer while conducting field audits; however, he did not keep a written record showing to whom he loaned it. At the time of the interview, he was unsure whether he had the laptop or whether he had loaned it to a staff member. Accordingly, Hughes directed Steve Jones, a security officer employed by appellee, to accompany appellant to his home to search for the laptop. Jones retrieved the laptop and brought it to Hughes. Thereafter, appellant admitted that he had downloaded AOL onto the laptop and could access his personal e-mail account from the laptop. Later that day, at Hughes\u2019s direction, Jones confiscated computer disks from appellant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">{\u00b6 18} According to Hughes\u2019s report, review of the computer disks revealed that between 1996 and 2001, appellant created numerous non-work-related documents during working hours. Review of appellant\u2019s laptop confirmed appellant\u2019s admission that he had downloaded his personal AOL account, which included email access, and that several non-work-related websites had been accessed, including several pornographic websites.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">{\u00b6 19} As part of the investigation, Hughes also confiscated appellant\u2019s desktop computer. Review of the desktop revealed that e-mails with attachments containing pornographic photographs had been sent to and opened from the desktop and that at least one pornographic website had been accessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">{\u00b6 20} On June 3, 2002, Hughes interviewed Warren Anthony. Anthony stated that he had numerous business dealings with appellant. Anthony verified that he introduced appellant to Dempsey and generally corroborated Dempsey\u2019s account of the failed loan transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">{\u00b6 21} Hughes again interviewed appellant on June 14, 2002. Appellant reiterated that he had no business dealings with Anthony. When questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>about his computer usage, appellant initially admitted that he had received a single e-mail on his desktop containing the pornographic photographs; however, he later admitted that the photographs might have come in three or four e-mails. Appellant stated that he asked a computer technician named Wanda to instruct him on the procedure for opening the attachments, as he did not know how to do it. Appellant denied visiting pornographic websites on either his desktop or laptop computer. He stated that his cousin, Rashaan Price, used his laptop without his permission in early spring 2002; when he realized it was missing, he told Price to return it. He admitted that he had not properly secured the laptop, even though he suspected Price might have utilized his AOL account to send pornographic e-mails to women. Appellant also acknowledged that he made personal long distance and local calls from his office telephone and failed to reimburse the state for those calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">{\u00b6 22} On June 17, 2002, Hughes interviewed Price, who stated that he had borrowed appellant\u2019s laptop several times in the preceding few years with appellant\u2019s permission. He last borrowed it in early March 2002 without appellant\u2019s permission; he returned it in May 2002 at appellant\u2019s request. Price was not aware that the laptop belonged to the state of Ohio. He admitted that he viewed pornographic websites on appellant\u2019s laptop, using appellant\u2019s AOL account. He further admitted that he sent pornographic e-mails to women under appellant\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">{\u00b6 23} Hughes interviewed Wanda Brown on June 25, 2002. Brown acknowledged that she worked as a computer technician in appellant\u2019s office from September to December 2000. She stated that she had never opened pornographic e-mails for appellant. She further stated that had she done so, she would have immediately reported it.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">{\u00b6 24} In her report, Hughes concluded the following: (1) the information gathered during the investigation supported the allegation in the complaint that appellant utilized his state position to influence Dempsey to do business with him and that appellant engaged in a fraudulent act by accepting the $15,000, scheduling an apparently bogus loan closing, and failing to obtain the loan; (2) appellant had violated appellee\u2019s Standards of Employee Conduct, Computer and Information Systems Usage Policy, and Telephone Usage Policy by (a) exhibiting carelessness in the use of state equipment and property by failing to secure his state-issued laptop, which resulted in its unauthorized use and abuse by Price, (b) improperly utilizing his state-issued computer to create non-work-related documents, many of which were related to appellant\u2019s personal business ventures, (c) downloading software on both his desktop and laptop computers without authorization, (d) viewing pornographic material on his state-issued computers, and (e) making personal local and long distance calls from his state-issued telephones; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>and (3) appellant failed to cooperate with the official investigation into Dempsey\u2019s complaint, in that he provided false, misleading, or incomplete information.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">{\u00b6 25} Following the issuance of Hughes\u2019s report, appellee held a predisciplinary hearing on July 29, 2002. Thereafter, on August 12, 2002, appellee issued an order, which stated that appellant was being removed from his employment for violating seven of appellee\u2019s \u201cStandards of Employee Conduct,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1q\">D4 Providing incomplete, false or misleading information during an administrative or official investigation or inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">F7 Loading unauthorized software on State computer or connecting unauthorized hardware to computer or network.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">Fll Use of State Internet System for unauthorized activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">F12 Immoral or indecent conduct (including, but not limited to downloading pornographic material from the State Internet System).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">F18 Unauthorized use or abuse of State equipment, property or State paid time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">F19 Carelessness in the use of State equipment or State property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-11\">F23 Violation of 124.34 of the ORC; incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, acts of misfeasance or nonfeasance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">{\u00b6 26} The testimony provided by appellant, Hughes, and Price at the administrative hearing generally corroborated the information contained in Hughes\u2019s July 15, 2002 report, with the following additions. Appellant testified that appellee permitted its field auditors and managers to download personal e-mail provider software, such as AOL, in order to access e-mail while in the field, as connecting to appellee\u2019s server was often difficult. Appellant admitted that use of this software was restricted to work-related matters. He stated that he was unaware of any formal policy against using the software for personal reasons, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant admitted that Price\u2019s authorized and unauthorized use of his laptop computer was prohibited by appellee and that he was responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of the laptop. In addition, appellant admitted that he was not aware that Price took the laptop in March 2002 until appellant discovered it was missing in May 2002. As to the pornographic photographs recovered from his desktop, appellant testified that he opened the emails only because there was no indication that they contained objectionable material. He testified that he was embarrassed that the computer technician observed the photographs and immediately deleted them. He admitted that he did not report the incident to his supervisor or any other person of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Appellant further testified that he could not recall being provided with a copy of appellee\u2019s written computer-usage policy. He admitted that he generally understood that state computers were to be used only for official state business, however. He further testified that he did not send or receive the e-mails retrieved from his laptop and that he used his personal AOL account on the laptop only for work-related purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 29} Hughes testified that appellee\u2019s standards of employee conduct and computer-usage policies prohibited the downloading or viewing of non-work-related material, including pornographic websites, on state-issued computers. She further testified that appellant\u2019s unauthorized downloading of AOL software onto his laptop computer violated appellee\u2019s computer-usage policy. She also averred that appellee\u2019s computer-usage policy prohibited use of computers by persons not employed by appellee and mandated that employees secure their computers to prohibit access by non-employees. Hughes also testified that appellant\u2019s personal local and long-distance telephone calls from his office phone violated appellee\u2019s telephone-usage policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 30} Hughes stated that her finding that appellant was untruthful in the official investigation stemmed from his denial of a business relationship with Anthony when documentary evidence established that he had such a relationship. Hughes also determined that appellant was untruthful in stating that he loaned his laptop to his subordinates during audits, as those subordinates denied borrowing it. She further found appellant untruthful because he denied any knowledge of a business called Scruples of Cincinnati, when a document retrieved from one of the confiscated computer disks indicated that he was the Chief Financial Officer of that entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 31} Price testified that he had borrowed appellant\u2019s laptop several times since the late 1990s and that appellant had never required him to obtain permission before doing so. Although appellant was aware that Price had sent emails utilizing his AOL e-mail account, appellant had never told him to stop doing so. Price acknowledged that he had appellant\u2019s laptop from March to May 2002, during which time he accessed the Internet and sent e-mails using appellant\u2019s AOL account. He further admitted that he sent sexually explicit e-mails to women under appellant\u2019s signature and may have mistakenly accessed pornographic websites.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 32} In her report and recommendation, the ALJ issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended that the SPBR affirm appellant\u2019s removal for violating R.C. 124.34 and D4, FU, F12, F18, and F19 of appellee\u2019s standards of employee conduct. In particular, the ALJ concluded that appellant was aware of appellee\u2019s written work policies and understood that he was required to comply with them. As to the specific violations of those policies, the ALJ concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>appellant violated D4 because, during the investigation, he was evasive and not forthcoming about his business relationship with Anthony; he averred, without confirmation, that he loaned his laptop to his subordinates; he provided an implausible explanation concerning the inappropriate e-mail photographs discovered on his desktop; and he denied, despite documentary evidence to the contrary, that he was involved in an outside business venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 33} The ALJ further concluded that appellant violated Fll, F12, and F18 because pornographic photographs and/or websites were recovered from appellant\u2019s laptop, desktop, and computer disks; non-work-related documents were recovered from the computer disks, and appellant provided implausible explanations for these incidents. The ALJ concluded, however, that appellee had not proven that appellant abused appellee\u2019s telephone-usage policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 34} The ALJ also concluded that appellant violated F19 because appellant did not take the necessary precautions to ensure that his laptop, which contained sensitive, client-based personal information, would not be used by a non-state employee. In so finding, the ALJ noted that appellant had presented no evidence demonstrating that he had reported the laptop missing or informed anyone that he did not generate the inappropriate materials recovered from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 35} The ALJ further concluded that appellant violated R.C. 124.34, as he engaged in dishonest and immoral conduct and neglected his duty. In particular, the ALJ found that appellant was dishonest throughout the investigation, as well as in taking $15,000 from Dempsey under false pretenses, attempting to hide the money in his wife\u2019s account, and not returning the money until ordered to do so by a court. The ALJ also determined that appellant\u2019s conduct was immoral by having inappropriate and pornographic photographs on his state-issued computers. In addition, the ALJ determined that appellant neglected his duty when he accessed inappropriate websites, e-mails, and non-work-related documents on his state-issued computers and was unaware of the whereabouts of his laptop for a significant period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 36} Lastly, the ALJ concluded that appellee had not proven that appellant violated F7. More specifically, the ALJ found that while appellant technically violated the computer-usage policy by loading AOL onto his laptop without authorization, other evidence established that he and other employees were encouraged to download their own Internet service provider to enhance work-related communication while in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">{\u00b6 37} As noted previously, the trial court determined that the SPBR\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. On appeal to this court, appellant contends in his first assignment of error that the common pleas court abused its discretion in so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>finding. More specifically, appellant contends that the SPBR, ignored certain evidence and improperly resolved credibility issues in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 38} Appellant first contends that the SPBR ignored appellee\u2019s failure to establish a chain of custody for the laptop and desktop computers and computer disks after they were confiscated from appellant\u2019s home and office. Appellant argues that appellee\u2019s failure in this regard compromised the reliability of the evidence recovered from the computers and computer disks. Testimony presented at the hearing shows that appellee established a proper chain of custody, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 39} Regarding the laptop, Jones testified that he retrieved the laptop from appellant\u2019s home and immediately turned it over to Hughes. Hughes corroborated this testimony. Hughes further testified that after she obtained control of the laptop, an employee in the chief inspector\u2019s office assisted her in viewing the information contained on it. Appellant presented no evidence that any of the persons who had access to the laptop tampered with it after it was removed from appellant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 40} As to the desktop, Hughes testified that she took possession of it and gave it to a computer technician employed by appellee. The technician gave it to Hughes\u2019s supervisor and then provided Hughes and her supervisor with administrative access to the computer files. Again, appellant presented no evidence establishing that Hughes, her supervisor, or the computer technician manipulated the data on the desktop after it was removed from appellant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">{\u00b6 41} Regarding the computer disks, Jones testified that he retrieved them from appellant\u2019s office at Hughes\u2019s direction and gave them to her supervisor. Hughes testified that her supervisor provided the computer disks to her. Appellant presented no evidence establishing that anyone with access to the computer disks corrupted them after they were removed from appellant\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">{\u00b6 42} Appellant also contends that the SPBR ignored appellee\u2019s failure to present evidence refuting his testimony that he was unaware that Price was utilizing his laptop computer to exchange e-mails with his friends. Initially, we note that the record belies appellant\u2019s assertion. Price testified that appellant was aware that he sent e-mails using appellant\u2019s AOL e-mail account and never told him to stop doing so. Further, appellant\u2019s argument misses the point. As noted by the ALJ, appellant violated appellee\u2019s standards of employee conduct and computer policy precisely because he was unaware that Price was even using his laptop. Indeed, appellant admitted that he was responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of the laptop and that Price\u2019s use of the laptop was prohibited by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Appellant further contends that the SPBR faded to consider appellant\u2019s testimony that he never received notice of appellee\u2019s computer-usage policy. Again, the record belies appellant\u2019s contention. The ALJ noted that appellant had so testified. In addition, the ALJ noted that Carson testified that while he was unsure whether the computer policy was distributed in paper form or electronically, he was certain he would have informed the managers, including appellant, that such a policy existed and that they should tell their employees to follow it. In addition, Carson testified that he was certain appellant was provided with the standards of employee conduct. Those standards provide that it is the responsibility of all employees to familiarize themselves with and adhere to the policies and procedures promulgated by appellee and that all state-issued property, including computer hardware, software, e-mail, and Internet usage, is to be used only for official purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">{\u00b6 44} Appellant also contends that the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding appellant\u2019s email usage contradict the evidence presented at the hearing. Appellant contends that one of the offending e-mails was sent after the laptop was confiscated on May 30, 2002; thus, he could not have violated appellee\u2019s computer-usage policy by sending an e-mail from his personal AOL account on his personal laptop. Initially, we note that appellant does not specify the e-mail to which he refers; therefore, it is difficult for this court to review this claim. Further, presuming that the e-mail to which appellant refers is one sent on June 13, 2002, we note that the ALJ made only a passing reference to it in her recitation of evidence presented at the hearing, and, in doing so, noted appellant\u2019s testimony that he did not have access to his departmental laptop on that date. Indeed, the ALJ did not specifically cite that e-mail in either her findings of fact or conclusions of law. But even without this particular e-mail, appellee presented evidence of other inappropriate materials recovered from the laptop and desktop, materials that sufficiently established that appellant violated appellee\u2019s standards of employee conduct and computer-usage policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant also challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that he engaged in dishonest and fraudulent acts with regard to the loan transaction with Dempsey. Appellant argues that no evidence refuted appellant\u2019s testimony to the contrary. Once again, the record belies appellant\u2019s claim. Hughes\u2019s report, which was admitted at the hearing, includes her notes from the interviews she conducted with Dempsey and Anthony. Those interviews support the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant engaged in dishonest and fraudulent conduct in taking $15,000 from Dempsey under the false pretense of securing a loan for him and thereafter failing to return the money when he was unable to secure the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">{\u00b6 46} Appellant also challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant was untruthful during the investigation because he denied having any business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>dealings with Anthony when documentary evidence established that he did. Appellant contends that the documentary evidence relied upon by the ALJ established that appellant and Anthony contemplated, but did not consummate, a business relationship. Although, once again, appellant does not cite the specific evidence to which he refers, we presume he refers to an April 2, 2002 letter wherein Anthony indicated to appellant that he wished to dissolve the business relationship the two contemplated and that appellant had performed no work in furtherance of the relationship. Appellant\u2019s contention that a business relationship does not involve the negotiation process involving the performance of work is unpersuasive. Further, the ALJ also cited a February 17, 2001 letter wherein Anthony praised appellant for the \u201coutstanding job\u201d appellant had done for Anthony\u2019s company. The ALJ cited this letter as evidence \u201cclearly alluding to a business relationship with Mr. Anthony and [his company].\u201d Thus, the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant untruthfully denied business dealings with Anthony is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">{\u00b6 47} Appellant also challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s carelessness regarding his laptop allowed access to sensitive information such as Social Security numbers and protected health information. Appellant contends that no evidence established that any non-state employee actually accessed sensitive material from his laptop while it was not in his possession. Appellant\u2019s argument is unavailing. The ALJ did not conclude that any non-state employee actually obtained sensitive information from appellant\u2019s laptop; rather, the ALJ was concerned, legitimately so, about the <em>potential </em>for such an event. Carson\u2019s testimony supports the ALJ\u2019s finding. Indeed, Carson testified that \u201c[i]t is possible for that information to be looked at on the laptop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">{\u00b6 48} Finally, appellant contends that the ALJ improperly resolved credibility issues in favor of appellee. In particular, appellant notes that he testified that Wanda opened the desktop e-mail that contained the pornographic photographs. The ALJ noted appellant\u2019s testimony, but further noted that Hughes\u2019s report indicated that Wanda Brown denied ever opening any files for appellant. This was a dispute of fact to be resolved by the ALJ. The ALJ simply found appellant\u2019s testimony to be noncredible, a finding within the ALJ\u2019s province as the finder of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">{\u00b6 49} For all these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the SPBR\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">{\u00b6 50} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error contends that the trial court abused its discretion in affirming the SPBR\u2019s order because the SPBR failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>afford sufficient weight to appellant\u2019s disparate-treatment evidence. Appellant argues that the SPBR administered more severe discipline to him than to two other employees, William Meyer and Douglas McGuckin, for similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">{\u00b6 51} Ohio Adm.Code 124 \u2014 9\u201411 (A) provides that the SPBR \u201cmay hear evidence of disparate treatment between the appellant and other similarly situated employees of the same appointing authority for the purpose of determining whether work rules or administrative policies are being selectively applied by the appointing authority or to determine whether the discipline of similarly situated employees is uniform.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 124-9-ll(B) provides that \u201c[e]vidence of disparate treatment will be considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the discipline which was imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">{\u00b6 52} The issue of whether employees are similarly situated sufficiently to merit consideration as evidence of disparate treatment is for the trier of fact, i.e., the SPBR. <em>Swigart v. Kent State Univ., </em>Portage App. No. 2004-P-0037, 2005-Ohio-2258, 2005 WL 1077176, \u00b6 37, citing <em>Ohio Dept. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities v. Moore </em>(June 18, 1998), Gallia App. No. 98 CA 1, 1998 WL 334496. Although the SPBR has discretion to consider evidence of disparate treatment in evaluating the appropriateness of discipline, the Ohio Administrative Code does not mandate absolute uniformity of discipline. \u201c \u2018An employee\u2019s discipline must stand or fall on its own merits.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Green v. W. Res. Psychiatric Habilitation Ctr. </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 218, 219, 3 OBR 248, 444 N.E.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">{\u00b6 53} Before considering the merits of appellant\u2019s argument, we must address appellant\u2019s contention regarding a statement made by the trial court in its decision and entry. The court stated that it \u201cmust observe that it is not privy to all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Mssrs. Meyer and McGuckin. The Court is not in a position to do a comparative analysis of why the Board acted more lenient towards these employees, if it is alleged that it did so.\u201d Appellant argues that the court erroneously concluded that it was without authority to review the SPBR\u2019s decision to disregard his disparate treatment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">{\u00b6 54} We adopt appellee\u2019s interpretation of the court\u2019s statement, i.e., that the court could not adequately review the issue because appellant failed to provide the court with sufficient information about the evidence he presented at the administrative hearing pertaining to the alleged disparate treatment. Indeed, a review of appellant\u2019s brief filed in the common pleas court asserts only that \u201c[o]ther similarly-situated employees, William Meyer and Douglas McGuckin, received suspensions and/or other disciplinary action far short of removal for similar conduct.\u201d Appellant\u2019s failure to develop his argument by pointing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>specific evidence of disparate treatment constituted a waiver of the issue. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in choosing not to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">{\u00b6 55} Although appellant has presented the identical argument before this court, we shall, in the interest of justice, address the issue. In support of his disparate treatment argument regarding Meyer, appellant offered the testimony of Carson. Carson testified that Meyer was a bargaining-unit employee who reported to Dave Smith, an External Audit Supervisor, who reported to Vera Scott, an External Audit Manager I, who reported to Carson, an External Audit Manager II. Appellee objected to the admission of any testimony related to Meyer on the grounds that he was not similarly situated to appellant for purposes of Ohio Adm.Code 124-9-11 because he was a bargaining-unit employee and did not report directly to Carson. The ALJ sustained appellee\u2019s objection, but granted appellant\u2019s oral motion for leave to proffer evidence at the conclusion of the hearing. That evidence consists of a series of uncertified documents related to appellee\u2019s imposition of a two-day suspension resulting from Meyer\u2019s unapproved seven-day absence from work. In her report and recommendation, the ALJ determined that Meyer was not similarly situated because he was a bargaining-unit employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">{\u00b6 56} We agree with appellee that Meyer is not a valid comparable for purposes of disparate treatment. Meyer was employed as an External Auditor III, a nonsupervisory position; appellant was an External Audit Manager I who managed ten employees. Further, Meyer was a member of the collective-bargaining unit and was, thus, subject to the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement. Those provisions undoubtedly addressed the imposition of employee discipline. In contrast, appellant was an exempt employee not subject to such provisions. Appellant and Meyer did not report directly to the same individual. And appellant and Meyer did not commit the same infractions. Accordingly, the ALJ did not abuse her discretion in concluding that Meyer was not similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">{\u00b6 57} In support of his disparate treatment argument regarding McGuckin, appellant offered the testimony of Carson, as well as documentary evidence related to the discipline imposed upon McGuckin. That evidence established that McGuckin was an External Auditor Manager II who, like Carson, reported directly to Bureau Chief William Severns. In July 2002, McGuckin received a written reprimand for \u201cpreparing and submitting an official document knowingly containing false and misleading information implying that a senior manager had acted in an improper and possibly illegal manner.\u201d Carson testified that the reprimand arose out of McGuckin\u2019s transmission to Severns of a single, work-related e-mail, which included cryptic language about an examination taken by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>internal candidate for a position within the agency. In her report and recommendation, the ALJ determined that McGuckin was not similarly situated because appellant and McGuckin were not on the same managerial level and did not engage in similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">{\u00b6 58} For the reasons noted by the ALJ, we also conclude that McGuckin is not a valid comparable for purposes of disparate treatment. McGuckin\u2019s conduct does not compare in any respect to the magnitude and breadth of the conduct for which appellant was removed from employment. The ALJ did not abuse her discretion in concluding that McGuckin was not similarly situated. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">{\u00b6 59} Having overruled appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, we hereby affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b828-7\">Klatt and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
