The policy was issued to the wife and delivered to and kept by her. She obtained a divorce from him seven years after, and afterwards, without his knowledge, surrendered the policy to the company and took a paid-up policy, conforming in all respects to the original one. The husband had paid the annual premiums, except .the one next preceding the divorce, which was paid by her. There were no children. She soon after died, and a little later he also.

The petitioners ask this court to decide which of the respondents is entitled to the amount of the insurance on the life of Charles McCammon. The facts are very few. Mr. McCammon insured his own life, with a provision that the amount was payable to <em>Ms wife, Lydia McOammon, </em>(no mention of her representatives or assigns being made,) if she survived him; if she did not, then-the amount to go to their children; but no provision was made if they had no children. The insured paid the premiums regularly until 1874, when Mrs. McCammon obtained a divorce from him and married another man. In 1875 she surrendered this policy, which it appears she had carried away with her, and took out a new paid-up policy, payable in the same manner. After this she paid one premium and some interest, \u00e1nd died in 1876. Mr. McCammon made one payment of interest after her death, and then he died. Neither left any children. The question is, whether the estate of Charles McCammon, the insured, shall have the amount of the policy, or whether, it shall go to the second husband of Mrs. McCammon. It seems a little curious that McCammon should have been paying premiums on his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>life for the benefit of his wife\u2019s second husband. Certainly no such intention existed in the minds of any of the parties to the contract. There is no reason or justice in it, and the court will not so hold unless obliged to do so by some very clear rule of law. The law, however, is clearly the other way. \"We suppose it to be well settled that if McCammon insured his life, payable to his wife if she survived him, and she died before him, the policy would, by her death, become payable to him. It is held'distinctly in <em>Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>34 Conn., 305, that the interest of the wife is only a contingent one, and if she dies before her husband she never has any interest. On page 314 the court says, speaking of another decision: \u201c There the contingent interest of the wife became absolute by the death of her husband during her life; <em>here that interest was defeated </em>by her death during the lifetime of her husband. This distinction renders it unnecessary for us to determine the principal question involved in that case. For if it be conceded on the one hand that Mrs. Kendall had an assignable interest in the policy in question, it must be conceded on the other hand that that interest was a contingent one, <em>and that the contingency upon which it was to become absolute never has happened and never can </em>happen.\u201d See also <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Fellowes, </em>36 Conn., 132. This must be the law. It will not be denied that if I obtain insurance on my own life, my estate can recover the amount even though the policy is not in terms payable to me or my representatives. If it is made payable to another <em>if he survives me, </em>and he dies before me, that clause' becomes inoperative, and the policy is still payable to me as if that clause were not contained in it. This is only applying to policies the same rales of construction applicable to deeds, wills, and other contracts. <em>Gambs </em>v. <em>Covenant Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>50 Misso., 44; <em>Kerman </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>23 Wis., 108; <em>Mut. Benefit Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Atwood's Admx., </em>24 Gratt., 497. This is substantially the case of a lapsed legacy, where if the legatee dies before the testator, the legacy goes back to the estate; or it may be regarded as a trust made by the husband for the benefit of the wife if she survived him, and if not for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>their children, if any. If the <em>cestuis que trust </em>all die, the property would revert to him.- The provisions of the statute of 1850, applicable to insurances for the benefit of married women, do not apply to this case, because the premium was more than $ 150. Nor do the subsequent statutes affect the rights of the parties, because they were not existing when the contract was made. But if these statutes apply, the construction of the contract will be what we claim it. The object of . these policies is to provide for the family of the deceased, and not for some other family. In <em>Continental Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Palmer, 42 Conn., 60, the court held that the avails of such a policy, if not affected by any statute, are substantially to bo disposed of like intestate estate of the insured. This is no doubt in accordance with the intent of McCammon when ho obtained the policy and paid the premiums, and the law will \u201cinterpolate in the contract a provision\u201d to that effect. It is held in all the cases where a debtor insures his life payable to a creditor and pays the premiums, he is entitled to the policy if he pays the debt. <em>Courtenay </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Gifford, 337; <em>Morland </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>20 Beav., 889. No principle can be better settled than that the avails of a policy <em>ought </em>to go to the person who applied for the policy and paid the premiums. The only cases where any exceptions are made to this rule are, where the policy is by its terms payable absolutely to some other person, or where by statute it goes to the surviving widow or children. The statute of 1871 recognizes this equity. This is an equitable proceeding, and the court should decide it upon the equities of the case. The provision as to children is of no consequence because there were none. The surrender of the policy by Mrs. Reynolds and her husband, and the re-issue of a paid-up policy, without the knowledge or consent of McCammon, cannot change the rights of the parties. <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Fellowes, </em>36 Conn., 132; <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>38 id., 294; <em>Norwood v. Guerdon, </em>60 Ill., 253. The new policy was issued in consideration of the amount of premiums paid by McCammon; it was payable to Mrs. Reynolds only on condition that she survived McCammon, and on her death any interest she might possibly have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>had in it vanished. Nor does the fact that after the divorce she paid one premium, and after the issue of the paid-up policy she paid some interest on the notes, affect the construction of the contract. She did not pay them on any desire or request of McCammon. The fact that he paid the interest due in 1877, and that her last husband also tried to pay it, shows that this was merely an effort to deprive McCammon of his rights. The utmost that can be claimed is that these payments should be refunded to her administrator. Even if the statute of 1871 applies, McCammon paid every premium but one, and is entitled to almost all of the amount due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>H. G. Robinson, </em>for the respondent Dunham.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-6\">The whole interest in the policy in question was vested in Mrs. Reynolds at the time of her death, and has passed to her legal representatives. The original contract is to be governed by the charter and the statute law of 1850. Both these legislative acts completely divest the husband of all interest in the policy. They give it to the wife as her separate estate; \u201c shall inure to her separate use and benefit independently of her husband and his creditors and representatives.\u201d And these acts contemplate payment of premiums by the husband, and limit to $150, and .then to $800 a year, the amount which he may pay as premium without defrauding his creditors. The policy is applied for in terms for the wife\u2019s benefit. The contract is with her alone, and the children in a certain event. The consideration is expressed to move from her, and the husband is no party to the contract in- any way. He can maintain no suit at law or in equity upon it. These principles seem to need no support of authorities, but are fully recognized in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>American Tontine Life Ins. Co., </em>46 N. York, 674, and in <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>99 Mass., 154. Our own court, in <em>Conn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>34 Conn., 305, says of such an insurance by a husband, \u201cIt is not a gift. The charter of the company and the statute law required the policy to be made as it was in order to protect it from the claims of creditors and the representatives of the husband.\u201d And again, \u201c It is not a will, but a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>authorized and regulated by the statutes, and when once entered into is no more revocable than a promissory note.\u201d The fact that there were no children rendered the condition as to them a nullity. \u2022 A promissory note payable in five years to <em>A, </em>and in the event of his death to his children, if <em>A </em>should die never having had children would plainly be a promise to A\u2019s estate. <em>A fortiori </em>this is so when the contract is made under a statute which says that the contract shall bp <em>A\u2019s </em>estate and her children\u2019s, \u201c if any.\u201d A case exactly like this one arose in Indiana, and it is the only precisely similar case which we have found. <em>B </em>insured the life of her husband for the benefit of herself and her legal representatives. In. case of her death before her husband, the amount of insurance was to be paid to her children. <em>B </em>died, and subsequently the husband, leaving no children. Held\u2014in a contest between the executors of the husband and wife, \u201cthat the wife had such an interest in and ownership of the policy, and such a right to the proceeds, as would on her death descend to her heirs, though her husband survived her. Had the husband survived, the administrator of her estate might have sold and assigned the policy and distributed the money as the assets of her estate.\u201d <em>Hutson </em>v. <em>Merrifield, </em>51 Ind., 24. The court says (p. 29) of the clause in the contract relating to payment to children if the husband survives the wife:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-4\">\u201c As there were no children to take the money under this clause of the policy, it may properly be regarded as if that clause had been wholly omitted from it.\u201d It is to be noticed in addition that the only statute of Indiana determining the course of insurance moneys in wives\u2019 policies had been repealed, and the case stood upon common law principles. The law of wills affords an imperfect analogy, because an insurance policy is a contract and not a gift, and because in wills there is a residuary clause to catch lapses. But even in the law of wills a similar principle is found. \u201cWhere a condition subsequent is impossible, or becomes impossible by the act of God, the condition will be void, and the legacy single and absolute, and in this case the civil and common law coincide.\u201d Willard\u2019s Eq., 528, and citations. The conclusion then is irresistible that the title to a policy like this one vests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>in the wife\u2019s representatives at the time of her death without children, unless the late statutes affect the contract. The first statute which changes this state of things was enacted in 1871. This statute does not affect the original policy, because\u20141st, it is in its terms prospective, and, 2d, if it were otherwise it could not impair the obligation of this existing contract. When the court, in <em>Chapin </em>v. Fellowes, speaks of a wife\u2019s interest being \u201ccontingent,\u201d it is only as between the wife and the children, in a case where there were children. When the contingency is an impossibility the interest becomes absolute. There can be no contingency toward a husband in a contract from whose benefits the parties and the statute have excluded him. The entire opinion of the court in <em>Continental Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Palmer, 42 Conn., 60, favors the views we are urging.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b87-5\">Pardee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1q8\">The petitioners\u2019 charter, granted in 1851, (8 Private Acts, 611,) provides \u201cthat policies of insurance issued by said company on the life of any person, expressed to he for the benefit of a married woman, whether the same he effected by herself or her husband, or by any other person in her behalf, shall inure to her separate use and benefit, and that of her and her husband\u2019s children, if any, as may he expressed in said policies, independently of her husband and his creditors and representatives, and also independently of any other person effecting the same in her behalf, his creditors and representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">By virtue of this provision the husband is enabled to make in a specified manner a lawful gift to his wife, for her sole and separate use and benefit, irrespective of the claims of his creditors. Mr. McCammon bought of the petitioners their agreement to pay at his death a fixed sum to and for the sole use and benefit of his wife, and delivered the policy to her. There was then a valid contract between herself and the company; she held a chose in action, subject to the principles governing other agreements involving pecuniary obligations. If the amount expressed in the policy had been made payable to her without condition, she would at once have become the owner of a valuable property, which she was permitted, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>by the special law and the declaration of the husband, to hold independently of him; of an interest which she could sell or assign, either absolutely or by way of security; one which, upon her death, would pass to her legal representatives as would any other sole and separate estate. It is true that the gift to Mrs. McCammon was made subject to a condition subsequent; if issue had survived the amount would have been payable to such issue; but as no child was ever born to either of them the condition became void and may be laid out of consideration. Holding then the first policy as of her sole and separate property, she had the right to exchange it for the second. For this last she paid the entire consideration and the annual premiums save one. Thus she purchased insurance upon Mr. McCammon\u2019s life solely for her own benefit, and paid for it from her separate estate. And although it is true that upon a change of purpose he could have made the gift of the first policy valueless, so far as his own action was concerned, by omitting to pay the annual premiums necessary to keep it in force, it is difficult to perceive upon what principle his legal representatives can now retract and resume in behalf of his estate a valid gift made by him to his wife. It is suggested in argument that it is a strange conclusion of law that the first husband should pay money of which the second should have the benefit. But to this possibility all gifts from husbands to and for the sole and separate use of wives are exposed; the marriage tie is dissoluble by death or divorce; neither the dying nor the divorced husband can control the ultimate destination of the sole estate of the surviving or separated wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In <em>Conn. Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Burroughs, 34 Conn., 305, the policy was in favor of one Mrs. Kendall; she pledged it for borrowed money, and died; her husband died four days later; a child survived them. The contest was between that child and the pledgee. It was determined that by the terms of the policy the mother\u2019s interest ceased, and that of the child, which was before contingent, became fixed and certain by the death of the mother before that, of the father, and that the mother could not by the pledge defeat the right of the child. In <em>Chapin </em>v. Fellowes, 36 Conn., 132, the mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>died, her husband and child surviving. After her death he surrendered the policy, took out another for the same amount in his own name and for his sole benefit, and within two years died insolvent, leaving children. The contest was between his creditors and his children for the fund. It was held that, upon the death of the mother previous to that of the husband, the policy by its terms immediately became payable to the children, and was so payable at the death of the father. In <em>Continental Life Ins. Co. </em>v. Palmer, 42 Conn., 60, the wife died, husband and children surviving; one of the children died leaving a child; subsequently the husband died. The effort was to exclude this grandchild from participating in the fund. It was decided that a transmissible interest vested in the children upon the issuing of the policy, and that the grandchild took by descent the interest of its parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The policy in each of these cases contained the proviso in behalf of children, and in each case children survived. The respective wives had received conditional gifts. At no moment was either of them in a position to deal with her policy as its absolute owner. In each case an event occurred which put an end to any interest in her or in her estate in the fund. In each case the duty of the court was to enforce the proviso in favor of children, and whatever is said in either of them as to the nature or extent of the interest of the wife in her policy, is to be understood as said of it in instances where there are children, and not as determining, where a policy is made payable without condition to the sole and separate use of the wife, in instances where there are no children, that she takes no. interest unless she survives her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The Superior Court is advised that the amount due upon the policy should be paid to the representative of the estate of Lydia S. Eeynolds; the payment by Charles McCammon of $24.50 on December 29th, 1876, on the policy, with interest thereon, to be deducted and paid to the representative of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
