J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJQ\">Petitioner, defendant in an action for wrongful death based upon the negligence of an employer, seeks a writ of mandate to compel respondent court to vacate an order issued on March 23, 1982, overruling its demurrer and to enter an order dismissing the action. Petitioner contends that respondent court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Real parties are plaintiffs in an action brought in their capacity as nondependent heirs and personal representatives of the deceased employee, their son Edward Francis Morrill. The decedent, employed as a laborer by petitioner, met his death on November 24, 1980, in the ordinary course and scope of his employment when a section of the side of a hill on which he was working collapsed and buried him.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Article XIV, section 4, of the California Constitution vests the Legislature with plenary power, unlimited by any provisions of the Constitution, to create and enforce \u201ca complete system of workers\u2019 compensation, by appropriate legislation, and in that behalf to create and enforce a liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability, and their dependents for death incurred or sustained by the said workers in the course of their employment, irrespective of the fault of any party.... to the end that the administration of such legislation shall accomplish substantial justice in all cases expeditiously, inexpensively, and without incumbrance of any character; all of which matters are expressly declared to be the social public policy of this State, binding upon all departments of the State government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Section 3600 of the Labor Code, in relevant part, provides: \u201cLiability for the compensation provided by this division, in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person . .. shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his employees arising out of and in the course of the employment and for the death of any employee if the injury proximately causes death, in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur: [\u00b6] (a) Where, at the time of the injury, both the employer and the employee are subject to the compensation provisions of this division. [\u00b6] (b) Where, at the time of the injury, the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his employment and is acting within the course of his employment. [\u00b6] (c) Where the injury is proximately caused by the employment, either with or without negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Section 3601, in relevant part, provides: \u201c(a) Where the conditions of compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation, pursuant to the provisions of this division is .. . <em>the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer </em>.... \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Labor Code section 3207 provides that \u201c\u2018Compensation\u2019 means compensation under Division 4 and includes every benefit or payment conferred by Division 4 upon an injured employee ... or in the event of his death, upon his dependents, without regard to negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Labor Code sections 4700-4709 govern death benefits. Labor Code section 4701 provides: \u201cWhen an injury causes death, either with or without disability, the employer shall be liable, in addition to any other benefits provided by this division, for: [\u00b6] (a) Reasonable expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the employee\u2019s burial, not exceeding one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500). [\u00b6] (b) A death benefit, to be allowed to the dependents when the employee leaves any person dependent upon him for support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Labor Code section 4706.5, subdivision (a), provides: \u201c(a) Whenever any fatal injury is suffered by an employee under such circumstances as to entitle the employee to compensation benefits, but for his or her death, and such employee does not leave surviving any person entitled to a dependency death benefit, the employer shall pay a sum to the Department of Industrial Relations equal to the total dependency death benefit that would be payable to a surviving spouse with no dependent minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">It is clear from the foregoing statutes that the employer is liable for a death benefit to persons dependent upon the employee for support (\u00a7 4701, subd. (b)), and in the absence of persons dependent upon the employee for support, the employer must pay a sum equal to a death benefit to the Department of Industrial Relations (\u00a7 4706.5, subd. (a)). Section 4706.5 was authorized by article XIV, section 4, of the California Constitution, enacted in the general election of 1972.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Where the \u201cconditions of compensation\u201d exist, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board has exclusive jurisdiction, and the superi- or court may not entertain an action for damages against the employer. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 76, 83 [293 P.2d 18]; <em>Treat </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Gas etc. Corp. </em>(1927) 82 Cal.App. 610, 617 [256 P. 447].) The record establishes that, at the time of the injury resulting in death, both the employer and the employee were subject to the compensation provisions of the Workers Compensation Act (\u00a7 3600, subd. (a)); that at the time of injury, the employee was performing service growing out of and incidental to his employment and was acting within the course of his employment (\u00a7 3600, subd. (b)); and that the injury was proximately caused by the employment. (\u00a7 3600, subd. (c).) Where the conditions of compensation exist, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board has exclusive jurisdiction. (\u00a7 3601, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u201cIt has been consistently held, without exception, that section 3601 means precisely what its terms imply. It is said that: \u2018When an employee\u2019s injuries or death are compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the right of the employee or his dependents, as the case may be, to recover such compensation is the exclusive remedy against the employer.\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018In the most explicit terms, section 3600 declares the exclusive character of the employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation liability in lieu of any <em>other </em>liability to <em>any </em>person. Sections 3600 and 3601 form a complementary, unmistakable declaration of legislative policy ....\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dixon </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 499, 503 [125 Cal.Rptr. 872].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The exclusive remedy provisions \u201cform part of the quid pro quo of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme \u2018in which the sacrifices and gains of employees and employers are to some extent put in balance, for, while the employer assumes a new liability without fault, he is relieved of the prospect of large damage verdicts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Schwartz </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 628, 633-634 [131 Cal.Rptr. 200].) These broad provisions bar real parties\u2019 attempt to fasten liability for tort damages upon petitioner. <em>(Casaccia </em>v. <em>Green Valley Disposal Co. </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 610, 612-613 [133 Cal.Rptr. 295].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue as prayed for in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Miller, J., and Smith, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The petition of real parties in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 19, 1983. Grodin, J., did not participate therein. Bird, C. J., was of the opinion .that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> Article XIV, section 4, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe Legislature shall have power to provide for the payment of an award to the state in the case of death, arising out of and in the course of the employment, <em>of an employee without dependents, </em>and such awards may be used for the payment of extra compensation for subsequent injuries beyond the liability of a single employer for awards to employees of the employer.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
