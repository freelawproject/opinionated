The County argues that this rule is not subject to the meet-and-confer requirement of Government Code section 3505 because: (1) the rule has only an insignificant impact on the conditions of employment; and (2) it is a managerial decision falling within the \u201cmerits, necessity, or organization\u201d exception to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3500-3510). For the reasons discussed below, the writ of mandate was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\n<em>Undisputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Both parties agree on the following events. On August 10, 1979, the Solano County Administrator issued a memorandum to all county departments, which read in pertinent part: \u201cTo preclude any question of whether a vehicle is authorized to be driven on County business in the future, the following policy will apply in all cases. . .. [N]o vehicles other than a 4-wheel passenger type vehicle which the employee has insured ... will be authorized to be driven on County business. Permission to operate . .. motorcycles ... on County business must be requested in writing to the County Administrator [and be granted].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Ray Villanueva, a county employee, sought permission on August 27, 1979, to use his motorcycle on county business. The County refused permission on December 19, 1979. On January 24, 1980, the County refused to process Villanueva\u2019s timely grievance on the grounds that it did not constitute a grievance under the County\u2019s grievance procedure. Respondent Union, Villanueva\u2019s representative, asked the County on January 28, 1980, to meet and confer on the matter. On February 1, 1980, the County refused to meet and confer, claiming that the rule was exempt under the \u201cmerits, necessity, or organization\u201d exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>(Gov. Code, \u00a7 3504) to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act. The Union filed its petition with the superior court on February 21, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>Disputed Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The Union contends that the rule set forth in the August 10 memorandum is a new rule, and has filed the declarations of several county employees that they were unaware of any rule and had openly used their motorcycles on county business without objection for several years. The County responds with its own affidavit that the rule has been in force for at least 15 years, and that the August memorandum was merely a reminder of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Following an order to show cause, the trial court issued its memorandum of decision granting the writ of mandate, without express findings of fact or law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Scope of Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The scope-of-bargaining provision in section 10a of Solano County\u2019s regulations is identical for practical purposes with Government Code section 3504, which reads: \u201cThe scope of representation shall include all matters relating to employment conditions and employer-employee relations, including, but not limited to, wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, except, however, that the scope of representation shall not include consideration of the merits, necessity, or organization of any service or activity provided by law or executive order.\u201d Therefore, interpretation of the code language necessarily bears upon the meaning of the County rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Federal labor legislation has frequently been the model for California labor law, and it is well settled that California courts will look to federal law for guidance in interpreting state statutes whose language parallels that of the federal statutes. <em>(Social Workers\u2019 Union, Local 535 </em>v. <em>Alameda County Welfare Dept. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 382, 391 [113 Cal.Rptr. 461, 521 P.2d 453].) The scope-of-representation language of Government Code section 3504 is taken directly from the federal Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and while California\u2019s exception for \u201cmerits, necessity, or organization\u201d has no direct analogue in the NLRA, the federal courts have incorporated its meaning into their interpretation of \u201cwages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>(Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 608, 617-618 [116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 507, 526 P.2d 971].) Consequently, federal precedents provide persuasive, though not limiting, authority in the present case. <em>(Ibid.; Social Workers\u2019 Union, Local 535, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Safety Rules and Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The Union contends that the rule prohibiting use of motorcycles on county business is purely a safety rule. The County admits that \u201c[t]he decision to preclude use of motorcycles obviously contains an aspect of safety ....\u201d In common usage, when the word \u201csafety\u201d is used as an adjective it denotes \u201ccontribution to or insuring safety; protective\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (1971)). In the context of the California Occupational Safety and Health Act, Labor Code section 6306, subdivision (a) states that the term \u201c\u2018safety\u2019 ... as applied to an employment or place of employment mean[s] such freedom from danger to the life, safety, or health of employees as the nature of the employment reasonably permits.\u201d Section 6306, subdivision (b) requires that the terms \u201csafety device\u201d and \u201csafeguard\u201d be given \u201ca broad interpretation so as to include any practicable method of mitigating or preventing a specific danger .. .. \u201d Our Supreme Court has made it clear that section 6306 is \u201c\u2018to be given a liberal interpretation for the purpose of achieving a safe working environment.\u2019\u201d <em>(Bendix Forest Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Division of Occupational Saf. &amp; Health </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 465, 470 [158 Cal.Rptr. 882, 600 P.2d 1339].) In light of these definitions of the term \u201csafety\u201d and the extensive background material presented by the County regarding the relative seriousness of motorcycle injuries and their resulting costs, we can only conclude that the County\u2019s rule prohibiting use of motorcycles on the job was intended to be, and is, a safety rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The Union further argues that safety rules are a mandatory subject of bargaining, since they concern the terms and conditions of employment. The County admits that \u201cit is recognized that safety practices considered alone may be a subject of meet and confer.\u201d Indeed, the cases have uniformly held that safety rules are a mandatory subject of bargaining. (See, e.g., <em>United Steelworkers of America, etc. </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(D.C. Cir. 1980) 647 F.2d 1189, 1236, cert, den., 453 U.S. 913 [69 L.Ed.2d 997, 101 S.Ct. 3148]; <em>Firefighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 608, 620, 623; <em>N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>Miller Brewing Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1969) 408 F.2d 12, 14; <em>N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>Gulf Power Company </em>(5th Cir. 1967) 384 F.2d 822, 824-825; <em>Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Board </em>(1964) 379 U.S. 203, 222 [13 L.Ed.2d 233, 245, 85 S.Ct. 398, 64 A.L.R.3d 1130] (conc. opn. of Stewart, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>However, the County argues that to be a subject of mandatory bargaining, the rule must have more than a \u201cremote, indirect, or incidental impact on work conditions.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>Ladish Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1976) 538 F.2d 1267, 1270.) The County cites several holdings from the long line of cases requiring that a rule must \u201cmaterially\u201d or \u201csignificantly\u201d affect the terms or conditions of employment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and must affect more than a small number of employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The County argues that since its rule will have only a minor impact on the very small number of its employees who wish to ride motorcycles on the job, it does not meet the materiality test and therefore is not a meet-and-confer item. The Union\u2019s contention that <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 488 [60 L.Ed.2d 420, 99 S.Ct. 1842], \u201ceffectively overrules\u201d this line of cases and the materiality analysis is not supported by a reading of <em>Ford.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Yet the County has not cited, and we have not found, any case applying the materiality analysis to a safety rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To the contrary, the cases have implied that <em>all </em>safety rules are subject to collective bargaining.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We believe it is the inherent nature of safety rules that has excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>them from the materiality analysis of the courts. It is a truism that even small precautions can prevent major mishaps, and it follows that any safety rule, no matter how apparently trivial, could have an important impact on the conditions of employment. Moreover, where human health and safety are involved, a rule should not be slighted simply because it will affect only a few employees. We see no reason to depart from the apparent intent of the cases that all safety issues, regardless of their purported \u201cmateriality\u201d or \u201csignificance,\u201d are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining, or as in this case, of meet and confer.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Finally, the County suggests that a rule in the best interests of its employees should not be subject to meet and confer. We note that just because the traditional role of union and management may be reversed in this case (i.e., the Union expressing concern over the County\u2019s implementation of a safety rule), the mandatory nature of meet-and-confer is not changed. Whether a change is beneficial or detrimental to the employees is a decision reserved to the employees as represented by their union. <em>(American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(8th Cir. 1979) 602 F.2d 184, 187, fn. 3.) Moreover, it is settled that the good faith of the employer does not exempt it from bargaining. (See, e.g., <em>Alfred M. Lewis, Inc. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 587 F.2d 403, 411; <em>Labor Board </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 736, 747 [8 L.Ed.2d 230, 238, 82 S.Ct. 1107].) We emphasize at this point that this court in no way evaluates the merit of the County\u2019s rule, but only determines if it is a meet-and-confer item.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Managerial Prerogative and Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The County next argues that a major objective of its motorcycle rule is the reduction of liability exposure and workers\u2019 compensation costs. The County also suggests that it has a higher purpose: protection of the public from the threat of motorcycles. The County believes these concerns fall within the exception to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act for \u201cmerits, necessity, or organization.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3504.) Federal and California courts have made it clear that if the need for managerial control is sufficiently great, or if public policy considerations are paramount, such a need or policy can outweigh the employees\u2019 right to meet and confer on an otherwise mandatory subject of bargaining. (See, e.g., <em>First National Maintenance Corp. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 666, 678 [69 L.Ed.2d 318, 330, 101 S.Ct. 2573, 2580]; <em>San Jose Peace Officer\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 935, 946 [144 Cal.Rptr. 638]; <em>N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>Gulf Power Company, supra, </em>384 F.2d 822, 824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The cases have consistently set a high standard in determining the existence of managerial prerogative or overriding public policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The federal courts have variously asked whether the disputed subject of bargaining \u201crelates solely to the internal procedures of the employer\u201d <em>(N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>L. 264, Laborers\u2019 Intern. U., etc. </em>(8th Cir. 1976) 529 F.2d 778, 785); goes to \u201cthe core of entrepreneurial control\u201d or is \u201cfundamental to the basic direction of a corporate enterprise ...\u201d <em>(Fibreboard Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Board, supra, </em>379 U.S. 203, 223, 225 [13 L.Ed.2d 233, 246] (conc. opn. of Stewart, J.)); concerns \u201cmajor shifts in capital investment or corporate strategy\u201d <em>(Local 777, Democratic U. Organizing Com. </em>v. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1978) 603 F.2d 862, 884); alters \u201cthe underlying nature of the business\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 885); or if bargaining about the issue would \u201csignificantly abridge [the employer\u2019s] freedom to manage the business\u201d <em>(Fibreboard, supra, </em>379 U.S. at p. 213 [13 L.Ed.2d at p. 240]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The California cases have looked at whether the decision is \u201cinextricably interwoven with important policy considerations\u201d <em>(San Jose Peace Officer\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 935, 946); is \u201cprimarily a matter of public safety\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 947); or if meeting and conferring on the issue would \u201cplace an intolerable burden upon fair and efficient administration of state and local government\u201d <em>(Berkeley Police Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 931, 937 [143 Cal.Rptr. 255]).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The County has failed to show a prerogative or policy sufficient to invoke the \u201cmerits, necessity, or organization\u201d exception to the meet and confer requirements of Government Code section 3504.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">First, even if we accept the County\u2019s comparative cost figures as the inevitable result of allowing its employees to use motorcycles on the job,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> cost alone is not a sufficient basis to exclude a rule from meet and confer. In <em>Vernon Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Vernon, supra, </em>107 Cal.App. 3d 802, for example, the city imposed a rule against washing cars as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>result of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The city still was required to meet and confer on the issue. In the present case, the County anticipates similar claims. Potential increases in insurance premiums or claims seem to us an ordinary expense of doing business, be it private enterprise or county administration. Moreover, as the Union correctly points out, virtually every management decision entails some economic impact, and to exempt a changed condition of employment or safety rule from bargaining on that basis would quickly lead to the demise of employer-employee bargaining and the strong public policies underlying such bargaining. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3500; <em>Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 608, 622.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Second, we do not see how, in the language of the cases, a county employee\u2019s choice of on-the-job transportation is \u201cat the core of entrepreneurial control\u201d or would \u201calter the underlying nature of the business,\u201d or how meeting and conferring on the issue would \u201cplace an intolerable burden\u201d upon the administration of Solano County. To the contrary, an employee\u2019s use of a particular form of transportation appears to us an incidental aspect of the employee\u2019s job responsibilities (although not, perhaps, an incidental aspect of the employee\u2019s working conditions) and a comparatively minor concern to any typical California county facing truly major problems. The County suggests in its appellate brief that employees riding motorcycles are not \u201cbusinesslike,\u201d implying some impairment of the County\u2019s ability to operate effectively. This claim was neither raised below nor substantiated by any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Finally, these facts do not rise to the level of those California cases where the acknowledged impact of a rule on working conditions could be subordinated to an overriding need for a public policy determination, not subject to bargaining. The use of deadly force by police <em>(San Jose Peace Officer\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>City of San Jose, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.3d 935), the level of fire protection in a community <em>(Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Vallejo, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 608), and the services provided welfare recipients <em>(Los Angeles County Employees Assn., Local 660 </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 1 [108 Cal.Rptr. 625]), are critical public policy questions far removed from the issue of whether county employees should be allowed to ride their motorcycles on the job. The County\u2019s argument that precluding employee use of motorcycles protects the public is unpersuasive, as the only evidence before this court is that motorcyclists are vulnerable to greater injury themselves, not that they disproportionately <em>cause </em>accidents or <em>exacerbate </em>injuries to <em>others.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We turn last to the only major fact issue in this case: whether the County\u2019s motorcycle rule is really a new rule at all. One test for determining whether a rule is subject to meet and confer is whether there has been a change in <em>practice </em>or <em>enforcement. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Local 777, Democratic U. Organizing Com. v. N. L. R. B., supra, </em>603 F.2d 862, 889; <em>International Assn, of Fire Fighters Union </em>v. <em>City of Pleasanton </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 959, 972 [129 Cal.Rptr. 68]; <em>N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>Miller Brewing Company, supra, </em>408 F.2d 12, 15-16.) The County does not deny that its employees have been using their motorcycles on the job with full knowledge of their supervisors, and have been reimbursed by the County for such expenses. The County\u2019s refusal to permit employee Villanueva to continue using his motorcycle clearly indicates either a change of practice or enforcement. The rule is thus a meet and confer item, whether it is new or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">California courts have not been reluctant to intervene when a public agency has taken unilateral action without bargaining. In such situations, courts have been zealous in condemning the unilateral action and in granting appropriate relief. <em>(Vernon Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Vernon, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 802, 823; Grodin, <em>Public Employment Bargaining in California: The Meyers-Milias-Brown Act in the Courts </em>(1972) 23 Hastings L.J. 719, 753-754.) The County\u2019s unilateral action constituted a per se violation of the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The grant of the writ of mandate is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">White, P. J., and Barry-Deal, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-12\">A memorandum of decision may be treated as an appealable order or judgment when it constitutes the trial judge\u2019s final determination on the merits and is signed and filed. The memorandum decision in the present case meets these criteria. <em>(Estate of Lock </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 892, 896 [176 Cal.Rptr. 358]; <em>Safeway Stores Inc. </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 430, 434, fn. 1 [147 Cal.Rptr. 835]; <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Concord Community </em>Hosp; <em>Dist. </em>(1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 51, 55 [43 Cal.Rptr. 255].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">See, e.g., <em>Oakland Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 1007, 1012 [175 Cal.Rptr. 105]; <em>Vernon Fire Fighters </em>v. <em>City of Vernon </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 802, 817 [165 Cal.Rptr. 908]; <em>Keystone Steel &amp; Wire etc. </em>v. <em>N.
