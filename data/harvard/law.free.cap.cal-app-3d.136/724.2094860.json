Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 1) contending that (1) the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to give a jury instruction relating to his identification, and (2) that the court abused its discretion and violated the principle of individualized sentencing by punishing appellant for his presentencing flight to deter others from similar conduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The following facts were adduced at trial. On August 18, 1976, Ms. Laura Monte, a box girl at Von\u2019s market, observed a white man park his motorcycle and enter the store. A few seconds later, a blue van decorated with a desert scene pulled up next to the motorcycle. Appellant, a black man, stepped outside and entered the store. He returned five minutes later and got on the motorcycle. Ms. Monte said, \u201cThat\u2019s not yours,\u201d but appellant drove off with the van following him. Ms. Monte took down the van\u2019s license number and gave it to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">On September 6, 1976, a police officer spotted the van, stopped it, and arrested appellant, the driver. Three days later, Ms. Monte made a photograph identification of appellant as the man who had taken the motorcycle. She also positively identified appellant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">Two witnesses testified for appellant. Richard Robertson, the owner of the van, stated that he lent it to appellant on occasion, but on August 18 he had given the van to one Michael Gray. Leonard Cullietta stated that on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>18th he saw appellant at Mr. Cullietta\u2019s gas station, where he was working on his motorcycle from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">1. <em>The Jury Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Appellant requested an instruction concerning proof of identity beyond a reasonable doubt, taken verbatim from <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 380, 386 footnote 1 [121 Cal.Rptr. 69].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court refused to give the instruction, but instead gave CALJIC No. 2.91, a variation of the proposed instruction, and CALJIC Nos. 2.20 (credibility of witnesses) and 2.22 (weighing conflicting evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Criminal defendants are entitled to an instruction relating identity to reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hurley </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 895, 900 [157 Cal.Rptr. 364]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d at p. 387.) Appellant relies on <em>Guzman, </em>to support his contention that the court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction was prejudicial error. The trial court in <em>Guzman, </em>however, had given absolutely no instruction linking proof of identification with the concept of reasonable doubt. Later cases have held that CALJIC Nos. 2.20 and 2.91, which the court approved in the instant case, satisfy the <em>Guzman </em>requirement and made additional instructions superfluous. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sequeria </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 1, 17-18 [179 Cal.Rptr. 249]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lybrand </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 1, 13 [171 Cal.Rptr. 157]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurley, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d at p. 900.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">2. <em>The Sentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The probation report filed for appellant\u2019s 1977 sentencing hearing recommended state prison without probation in light of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>numerous prior convictions\u2014including two convictions of grand theft\u2014and his failure to respond to formal probation. Appellant, however, failed to appear for the 1977 hearing and became a fugitive. On July 13, 1981, appellant was apparently arrested in San Diego and was brought to Los Angeles for sentencing. The court received a supplemental probation report which noted that soon after appellant\u2019s flight, he began raising a family, established his own business, bought a home, had apparently lived without further law enforcement contacts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had made a \u201cremarkable reversal in his life.\u201d The report recommended no probation, but suggested time in county jail instead of state prison.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">At the 1981 sentencing hearing, the trial judge reviewed the history of the case and indicated that he had read both probation reports. Defense counsel then cited appellant\u2019s good behavior since his 1976 conviction and noted that appellant had not been arrested since that time. Counsel referred to the supplemental probation report and its recommendation, and requested that the court credit appellant for time served preceding trial. The court then stated: \u201cCounsel, the probation officer that originally investigated the case recommended state prison. In light of his prior record I think it would be the only proper penalty to be imposed. The fact that he did not show up and became a fugitive and avoided arrest for three years should not automatically entitle him now to escape punishment for the offense. [|] In the first place it would be establishing a very dangerous precedent for all defendants out on bail to think they can become fugitives, and later come in and say they hadn\u2019t been in trouble, [t] With his background and the offense involved in this case, I think that the original recommendation of the probation Department was the only proper and logical one, and that is the one I intend to follow.\u201d The trial judge sentenced appellant to state prison, noting that if the case were a determinative sentencing matter, he would impose the midterm of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention is twofold. First, he argues that the trial judge improperly considered appellant\u2019s flight, punishing him for criminal activity of which he was not tried and convicted. Second, he maintains that the court violated the principle of individualized sentencing by considering not only appellant, but also the effect of a lenient sentence on others who might be encouraged to avoid sentencing in hope of improving their own records.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first argument is without merit. When the court\u2019s remarks are read in context, it is apparent that the trial judge did not punish appellant for his flight. In fact, it was appellant\u2019s counsel who directed the court\u2019s attention to the events subsequent to appellant\u2019s conviction, and it was the court who expressly refused to consider appellant\u2019s flight, either in mitigation or in aggravation of the sentence. The trial judge simply adopted the punishment originally recommended, imposing what would be the midterm sentence for appellant\u2019s grand theft conviction; he merely refused to let appellant\u2019s escape influence his present sentencing decision either way.  His actions were everything but arbitrary and capricious, and do not justify a reversal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 888, 898.[168 Cal.Rptr. 898].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Moreover, the trial judge would have committed no error even if he had considered appellant\u2019s flight. While a sentencing judge may not punish a defendant because he has illegitimate children receiving welfare support <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 216-217 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396]), because he refused to plead guilty and presented a frivolous defense <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 537, 546 [60 Cal.Rptr. 671]), because he had not been punished sufficiently for previous offenses <em>(People </em>v. <em>Molina </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 544, 552-553 [141 Cal.Rptr. 533]), a judge may consider all the facts and circumstances properly before him relating to defendant\u2019s character, his attitude towards the offense, and his amenability to rehabilitation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fowler </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 557, 565-566 [167 Cal.Rptr. 235]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (b).) Thus, in <em>In re Perez </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 168 [148 Cal.Rptr. 302], where the sentencing judge augmented the defendant\u2019s sentence because of his belief that the defendant had committed and suborned perjury, the court stated: \u201cThere are two ways in which the courts have given consideration to a defendant\u2019s perjury on the witness stand in pronouncing judgment . . . : (1) the imposition of additional punishment for the independent substantive offense of perjury, and (2) the denial of probation or the imposition of a lengthier sentence because a defendant\u2019s willingness to commit perjury reflects adversely upon his prospects for rehabilitation, [t] The first clearly violates due process. When there has been no charge of perjury or conviction for that crime, due process would be denied if additional punishment were inflicted for that crime. [Citations. The second way is permissible] so long as consideration is limited to its reflection upon the character of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>and his prospects for rehabilitation. ... [t] .... [|] . . . \u2018 \u201cThe effort to appraise \u2018character\u2019 is, to be sure, a parlous one . . . . [Yet] the fact remains that a manipulative defiance of the law is not a cheerful datum for the prognosis a sentencing judge undertakes .... Impressions about an individual being sentenced . . . are, for better or worse, central factors to be appraised under our theory of \u2018individualized\u2019 sentencing. The theory has its critics. While it lasts, however, a fact like the defendant\u2019s readiness to lie under oath before the judge who will sentence him would seem to be among the more precise and concrete of the available indicia.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>505 F.2d 1233, 1237 (1974).\u2019 <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Grayson, supra, </em>438 U.S. 41, 51 [57 L.Ed.2d 582, 590].)\u201d (84 Cal.App.3d at pp. 171-172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Similarly, appellant\u2019s own manipulative defiance of the law by evading sentencing would have been a proper factor for the trial judge to consider. Appellant\u2019s argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Appellant next contends that the trial judge\u2019s comments concerning the dangerous precedential value of allowing fugitives to avoid punishment show that he abandoned the principle of individualized sentencing. This contention is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">While \u201cthe rule that the measure of the constitutionality of punishment for crime is individual culpability is well established\u201d <em>(In re Rodriguez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 639, 653 [122 Cal.Rptr. 552, 537 P.2d 384]), the sentencing process as a whole has a number of other legitimate objectives as well. Thus, while section 1170 of the Penal Code declares that \u201cthe purpose of imprisonment for crime is punishment,\u201d it also admonishes the court to apply the sentencing rules of the Judicial Council.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rule 410 of California Rules of Court lists seven different objectives of sentencing, among them \u201c[protecting society,\u201d and \u201c[d]eterring others from criminal conduct by demonstrating its consequences.\u201d Rule 408(a) points out that the \u201cenumeration in these rules of some criteria for the making of discretionary sentencing decisions does not prohibit the application of additional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\u201d Rules 414 and 416 set forth numerous criteria affecting the decision to grant or deny probation, and rules 421 and 423 list various circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of a crime for sentencing purposes. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Warner </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 678, 689 [143 Cal.Rptr. 885, 574 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>P.2d 1237] (paramount concern in sentencing is the protection of society); <em>In re Foss </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 910, 924-925 [112 Cal.Rptr. 649, 519 P.2d 1073] (rehabilitation, isolation, and deterrence are legitimate purposes of. punishment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">In the instant case, the dialogue shows that the court did not abandon individualized sentencing; instead, it carefully considered appellant\u2019s background, the offense involved, and the original probation report, and then deliberately based its decision on these factors. The judge\u2019s additional comments explaining rejection of appellant\u2019s unusual claim for leniency properly considered the effect a reduced punishment would have on society. Clemency because of good conduct during flight would not only fail to deter others from similar behavior, but would encourage it and could seriously undermine the effectiveness of the law enforcement process. Since the court based its sentencing decision on appellant\u2019s character and behavior before his flight, it complied with the principles of individualized sentencing; its additional comments regarding a contrary decision were entirely appropriate and fulfilled legitimate objectives of the sentencing procedure. (See <em>In re Perez, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d at p. 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">But even assuming the judge\u2019s remarks were erroneous, any error was harmless because in light of the other articulated factors relied on by the trial judge, it is not reasonably probable that a different result would occur upon resentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boerner </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 506, 509-510 [174 Cal.Rptr. 629]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 270, 281 [172 Cal.Rptr. 612]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 67, 80 [171 Cal.Rptr. 365]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].) Appellant\u2019s reliance in this context on <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 208, is misplaced. Although the Supreme Court in that case stated that \u201ca trial judge [cannot] always insulate ungermane and biased remarks at a sentence hearing by concluding his remarks with recital of the \u2018saving\u2019 formula that sentence was imposed because of the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>the crime committed\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 218), it is clear that in the instant case, the judge\u2019s insistence on basing appellant\u2019s sentence on his conduct before his flight was in no event a mere recital of a \u201csaving formula.\u201d Thus, any possible error was not prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Feinerman, P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 5, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The instruction requested by appellant reads as follows: \u201cYou are instructed that the identity of the defendant as the person who committed the crime is an element of every crime. Therefore, the burden is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the crime alleged was committed, but also that the defendant was the one who committed it. You must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the witness\u2019 identification of the defendant. [H] In this regard, you are instructed that it is not necessary for the defendant to prove that another person may have committed the crime, nor is it the burden of the defendant to prove his innocence. If facts and circumstances have been introduced into evidence which raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was the person who committed the crime charged, then you should find the defendant not guilty of the offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Citing <em>Guzman, </em>the Supreme Court held in 1980 that the trial court should tailor identity instructions to the facts of the case before it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 143, 159 [167 Cal.Rptr. 844, 616 P.2d 826].) The <em>Hall </em>rule, however, is explicitly prospective only, and does not apply to this 1976 trial. In any case, as in <em>Hall, </em>\u201cany error was harmless since CALJIC Nos. 2.20 and 2.91 were given.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lybrand, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at p. 13.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The supplemental probation report notes appellant\u2019s disclosure that his arrest in San Diego was based on suspicion of forgery, and that a preliminary hearing on this charge had been scheduled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Both appellant and respondent mistakenly maintain that the 1981 report recommended probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellant also claims that the judge improperly discounted his good behavior since 1977. This contention is without merit; although the court must consider a probation report, as it did in the instant case, it may in its discretion reject the report\u2019s recommendations in whole or in part. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Lopez) </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 456, 459 [172 Cal.Rptr. 140].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">As previously pointed out by this court, \u201c|t|he legislative declaration that imprisonment has a punitive purpose is in no way inconsistent with the notion that the sentencing process as a whole has a variety of objectives. Obviously, dispositions as diverse as unsupervised probation, probation with some time in county jail, and imprisonment in the.state prison serve a variety of purposes including rehabilitation and restitution.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1979) 87 Cal.App.3d 1014, 1022 [151 Cal.Rptr. 483].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Appellant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at page 217, where the Supreme Court enumerated only three criteria for denial of probation: rehabilitation, protection of the public, and undue depreciation of the seriousness of the offense. However, the <em>Bolton </em>court never indicated that these criteria should from now on be the exclusive reasons for denial of probation and such an interpretation would indeed be irreconcilable with the structure of our sentencing rules. Moreover, a granting of probation because of good conduct during a period of successful evasion of sentencing might well \u2018\u201cunduly depreciate the seriousness of the offense . . . <em>(Id., </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Lock </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 454, 457, footnote 5 [179 Cal.Rptr. 56, 637 P.2d 292], is equally unpersuasive. The <em>Lock </em>court merely indicated that a sentence based <em>solely </em>on societal concerns might violate individual sentencing principles; by contrast, the trial judge in the instant case considered the lack of deterrence of the sentence proposed by appellant only as an aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
