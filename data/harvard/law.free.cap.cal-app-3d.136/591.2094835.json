Gigax seeks reversal of a summary judgment granted in favor of defendant Ralston Purina Company (Ralston). Gigax\u2019s complaint sought money damages for personal injuries based on theories of products liability, negligence and wanton and reckless misconduct. Gigax was employed as a laborer for the Van Camp Seafood Company (Van Camp) in San Diego, California. While cleaning a nonoperating hydraulic conveyor belt machine, the machine suddenly started and Gigax\u2019s left arm was drawn in and amputated at the elbow. The hydraulic conveyor belt was designed and manufactured by Ralston and Gigax alleges negligent design as a basis for Ralston\u2019s liability. Following his injury Gigax pursued his workers\u2019 compensation remedy against Van Camp as his statutory employer and obtained compensation and award. He then instituted this common law damage action against Ralston as a third party tortfeasor. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3602, 3852.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Upon Ralston\u2019s factual representation Van Camp was a division of Ralston and not a \u201csubsidiary\u201d corporation, the court found no triable issue of fact existed and determined Ralston, not Van Camp, was Gigax\u2019s employer at the time of his injury and therefore immune from tort liability pursuant to the exclusive remedy provisions of Labor Code section 3601, subdivision (a). Upon this basis the court granted summary judgment. Gigax appeals, pointing to factual issues that must be determined before deciding whether Ralston is the statutory employer immune from a common law tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">We derive the following facts from the documents and declarations presented to the trial court in connection with Ralston\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Van Camp Seafood Company, Inc., was incorporated in California in 1922 and its headquarters are in San Diego. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Gigax was employed by Van Camp beginning November 30, 1971. He continued as an employee until April 1, 1978, the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Gigax was originally hired by Phil Reyna, Industrial Relations Manager for Van Camp. He worked under the direction of a Van Camp supervisor. The right to fire Gigax was vested in Roy Thompson, General Manager of Van Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Van Camp maintains its employment records in its San Diego office. It incurred liability on its own account for social security obligations in 1979 for $2,373,890.24. Van Camp incurred withholding tax liability in 1979, federal income tax liability for $2,523,780.53 and a liability for California income tax for $444,323.80. Gigax was reported as an employee on Van Camp\u2019s payroll return. Further, Van Camp prepared a profit and loss statement detailing the operation of Van Camp. Van Camp produces cans of tuna and in its sales program prominently displays the words \u201cVan Camp\u201d and its logo, \u201cChicken of the Sea.\u201d The San Diego telephone directory lists Van Camp Seafood Company, not Ralston.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Ralston Purina Company is a Missouri corporation. Ralston asserts it \u201cacquired substantially all of the assets of Van Camp Seafood Company, a California corporation, pursuant to a plan and arrangement of reorganization within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 368, subdivision (a)(1)(C).\u201d Pursuant to this plan Van Camp transferred property and assets to Ralston in exchange for delivery to Van Camp of 53/100 of a share of Ralston stock for each share of Van Camp stock and for the assumption of certain liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">It is represented that Van Camp submits monthly financial reports to Ralston as well as its annual budget. But Ralston has refused to answer questions as \u201cnot applicable\u201d concerning activities, meetings and minutes of \u201cdivision officers\u201d of Van Camp. Ralston\u2019s answers do not disclose the present corporate status of Van Camp Seafood Company. The nature of Ralston\u2019s control over Van Camp since the acquisition of Van Camp stock is presently in an evidentiary limbo awaiting light.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Separate legal and financial departments are employed by Van Camp and deal solely with the Van Camp operations. Van Camp and Ralston are both multinational corporations in scope of activities. Van Camp has a worldwide packing and marketing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Gigax brought his petition for workers\u2019 compensation award against \u201cVan Camp Seafood\u201d as his employer. <em>The answer before the workers\u2019 compensation board designates Van Camp Seafood, self-insured as the employer and Ralston Purina as the insurance carrier. </em>This particular document was signed by Ralston\u2019s agent on the line designated \u201cemployer or insurer carrier.\u201d A letter from Jeffrey Trambucco, Ralston\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Administrator, declared: \u201cAs <em>you are aware, this office is handling the workers \u2019 compensation claims for Van Camp Seafood.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) This letter also designates the employer as Van Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Gigax himself perceived Van Camp\u2014and no one else\u2014to be his employer. He was not aware of any interrelationship between Van Camp and Ralston until it was raised in connection with his bringing Ralston in as a Doe in his amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">One further set of facts should be noted concerning Van Camp\u2019s corporate status. Van Camp has been sued on occasion in the California courts and has responded by filing an answer, and on occasion a cross-complaint as \u201ca California corporation.\u201d (See Hays v. Van Camp Seafood Company, San Diego Super. Ct. No. 373165; Mata v. Van Camp Seafood Company, San Diego Super. Ct. No. 409670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In sum, the extent and nature of the interrelationship of Ralston to this particular subdivision, division, or subsidiary, or whatever it is legally, has not been detailed in the answers given to interrogatories. However, Ralston repeats this conclusionary phase: Van Camp is an \u201coperating division\u201d of Ralston, not a subsidiary in a legal corporate sense and on this basis alone contends Van Camp is not a separate corporate entity; therefore it is argued Ralston is the corporate employer, not subject to suit as a third party tortfeasor. Upon this complex yet incomplete factual matrix, the trial court determined Ralston was as a matter of law Gigax\u2019s employer and therefore not subject to suit as a third party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">It is settled principle of law that the summary judgment procedure is a drastic remedy and should be used with extreme caution so that it does not become a substitute for the open trial method of determining facts. <em>(Arauz </em>v. <em>Gerhardt </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 937, 940 [137 Cal.Rptr. 619].)  A motion for summary judgment should be denied if the papers submitted show there is a triable issue of fact. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c; <em>Daugherty Co. </em>v. <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 151, 156 [92 Cal.Rptr. 120].) It is the burden on the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>moving for summary judgment to negate the existence of triable issues of fact in a fashion that entitled it to judgment on the issues raised by the pleadings. <em>(IT Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 443, 451-452 [147 Cal.Rptr. 828].) And if an issue of fact is present, the trial judge abuses his discretion in granting such a motion. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 334, 337 [116 Cal.Rptr. 125].) The function of the trial court is issue finding, not issue determination. <em>(Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 439, 441 [116 P.2d 62].)  In examining the papers filed, those of the moving party are to be strictly construed while those of the opposing party are to be liberally construed. <em>(Slobojan </em>v. <em>Western Travelers Life Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 432, 437 [74 Cal.Rptr. 895, 450 P.2d 271].)  And the moving party cannot depend upon the allegation of his own pleadings to cure a deficiency of fact nor can the adversary do so. However, a party can rely upon the adversary\u2019s pleadings to establish facts not contained in his own affidavits. <em>(Arauz </em>v. <em>Gerhardt, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d 937, 941 [137 Cal.Rptr. 619].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation laws were enacted in the early 20th century to provide a system of social insurance to compensate victims of work-related injuries. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution came an unprecedented increase in employee injuries and deaths. Victims of these industrial accidents were faced with formidable barriers to recovery because liability was premised on the concept of fault and the defenses of assumption of the risk, the fellow-servant doctrine and contributory negligence had to be overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Under the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, an employee\u2019s remedy against an employer for a work-related injury is\u2014as a general rule\u2014exclusively limited to the benefits provided by statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Labor Code section 3601 provides, in relevant part: \u201c(a) Where the conditions of compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation pursuant to the provisions of this division is, except as provided in Section 3706 the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer or against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his employment. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>However, the employee retains the right to pursue any common law remedies he may have against third party tortfeasors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Labor Code section 3602 provides: \u201cIn all cases where the conditions of compensation do not concur, the liability of the employer is the same as if this division had not been enacted.\u201d And Labor Code section 3852 reads in pertinent part: \u201cThe claim of an employee for compensation does not affect his claim or right of action for all damages proximately resulting from such injury or death against any person other than the employer. ...\u201d Thus the Labor Code does not purport to alter the correlative rights and liabilities of persons who do not occupy the reciprocal statuses of employer or employee. (See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Industrial Vangas, Inc., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 268, 276-277.) The workers\u2019 compensation laws were not designed to relieve one other than the employer from any liability imposed by statute or by common law. (See also <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 700, 803 [186 P. 354]; <em>Baugh </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d 200, 214; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Press Co. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 786, 790 [141 Cal.Rptr. 55].) This basic precept of law is not negated by the fact that the \u201cperson other than the employer\u201d is not a stranger but has entered into a consensual legal relationship with the employer. <em>(Baugh </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra; Campbell </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Press Co., supra; Latham </em>v. <em>Technar, Inc. </em>(E.D.Tenn. 1974) 390 F.Supp. 1031, 1039.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">However, because the workers\u2019 compensation laws were enacted before the advent of multiunit enterprises, they fail to address the precise issue here of a parent corporation\u2019s claim of immunity from common law tort liability for injuries to the employees of a kindred corporation. (See <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1979) 590 F.2d 655, 658.) Thus the pristine issue was and still remains unresolved. Did an employer-employee relationship exist between Gigax and Ralston? More specifically, was Ralston Gigax\u2019s statutory employer within the meaning of the applicable Labor Code provisions?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Such a question usually is one of fact for a determination by the trier of fact. This is particularly true where the facts as to the employment relationship are in conflict. (See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Press Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d, pp. 790, 791.)  In <em>Schaller </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1938) 11 Cal.2d 46 [77 P.2d 836], the court said (pp. 50-51) as quoted in <em>Van Horn </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 457, 463 [33 Cal.Rptr. 169]: \u201cThe question of whether a worker is an employee within the meaning of the Compensation Act . . . is referred to as a question of mixed law and fact to be proved like any other question. [Citations.] It is a question of fact . . . where the facts are in dispute. It becomes a question of law only when but one inference can reasonably be drawn from the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The tests for determining who is the employer are the same in workmen\u2019s compensation cases as in the master-servant cases. <em>(City of Brunswick </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1953) 87 Ga.App. 751 [75 S.E.2d 203, 204]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hycon, Inc. </em>(D.D.C. 1965) 244 F.Supp. 151, 156; <em>Latham </em>v. <em>Technar, Inc., supra, </em>390 F.Supp. at p. 1039.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Courts have consistently recognized the preeminent factor to be considered in determining this factual question of employer-employee relationship is \u201cthe right of control.\u201d <em>(Grant </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 647, 653 [139 Cal.Rptr. 533]; <em>Isenberg </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com. </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 34, 39 [180 P.2d 11].)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The Supreme Court said in <em>Isenberg </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com., supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 34, 39: \u201cThe principal test of the employment relationship <em>was held to be the \u2018right to control over the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired. </em>\u2019 <em>Strong evidence of this right is shown by the right of the principal to discharge the worker. </em>The secondary tests are listed in that opinion as including, \u2018(a) whether or not the one performing service is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (b) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specalist without supervision; (c) the skill required in the particular occupation; (d) whether the principal or workman supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work for the persons doing the work; (e) the length of time for which the services are to be performed; (f) the method of payment, whether by time or by the job; (g) whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal; (h) <em>whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of employer-employee. </em>(Rest., Agency, \u00a7 220; Cal.Ann. \u00a7 220.)\u2019\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In the case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hycon, Inc., supra, </em>244 F.Supp. 151, the federal court held the employer-employee relationship has as a principal component the right to control the employee. In <em>Hycon, </em>plaintiff Thomas was a truck driver for Edmonds Art Stone Company, the parent corporation of Hycon. Thomas was injured while operating a truck owned by Hycon. After being awarded compensation benefits from Edmonds, Thomas sued Hycon as a third party tortfeasor alleging the truck had defective brakes. Hycon argued it was the employer or so interrelated with and part of the employer that it was not a third party to the employer-employee relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Concerning the right to control, the court said (244 F.Supp. pp. 155-156): \u201cIn the instant case, it cannot be said that Hycon had the right to control plaintiff\u2019s conduct. The plant foreman of Edmonds Art Stone Company assigned plaintiff to the delivery run on this as on previous occasions; there is no evidence that anyone other than the foreman controlled the plaintiff, or had the right to control him, in the details of his run, its destination, and manner of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u201c. . . Plaintiff\u2019s operation of the defendant\u2019s truck was entirely in obedience to employer Edmonds\u2019 instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u201cThis court finds, therefore, that defendant Hycon, Inc., is a third party within the meaning of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and may be liable in damages for any injuries sustained by employees of Edmonds Art Stone Company as a result of Hycon\u2019s negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">And in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co. of California </em>(1979) 100 Idaho 590 [603 P.2d 156], the Idaho Supreme Court focused on the right of control as being a significant element in determining statutory employer status: \u201c ... Collier Carbon did not control its [subsidiary\u2019s] day-to-day operation. Collier Carbon did not have the right to control [its subsidiary\u2019s] operations or its employees. They did not direct the details of [the subsidiary\u2019s] work nor did they have the right t\u00f3 hire or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>fire personnel. There was no employment contract between Collier Carbon and the employees of [its subsidiary], and generally Collier Carbon did not pay the wages of [the subsidiary\u2019s] employees.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>St. Clair Metal Products Company </em>(1973) 45 Mich.App. 242 [206 N.W.2d 444], plaintiff Oliver was injured by a machine while working for a wholly owned entity of St. Clair. She recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits from the subsidiary and then brought suit against the parent. The trial court rejected a motion for summary judgment and the appellate court affirmed, stating (at p. 445): \u201cDefendant St. Clair relying on Renfroe v. Higgins Rack Coating &amp; Manufacturing Co., Inc., 17 Mich.App. 259, 169 N.W.2d 326 (1969), contends the issue of [plaintiff\u2019s] status as fellow servant is a matter of law, not a question for the jury. The reliance is misplaced. . . . [W]hen evidence before a trier of fact is incomplete or disputed, the matter should not be disposed of summarily. [Citations.]\u201d To the same effect see <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Air La Carte, Inc. </em>(1980) 79 A.D.2d 553 [434 N.Y.S.2d 17, 19],</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The evidence before the trial court points without contradiction to employment by Van Camp, control and direction of Gigax vested in and exercised by Van Camp, not Ralston. Such evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, precludes granting of a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">A host of cases hold an employee of a wholly owned subsidiary who has obtained workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the subsidiary may maintain an action in tort against the parent corporation and this is so even though the parent and subsidiary are covered by the same workmen\u2019s compensation policy. In <em>Wilkerson </em>v. <em>Gulfstream Land &amp; Development Corporation </em>(Fla.App. 1981) 402 So.2d 550, the court said: \u201c[W]e do not believe that a parent corporation must necessarily be shielded from suit by an employee of its subsidiary. Rather, we align ourselves with those jurisdictions which have dealt with this issue and have uniformly upheld the right of the subsidiary\u2019s employee to maintain such an independent action. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Ralston would seek to avoid this rule with its contention that Van Camp is not a subsidiary or separate corporate body but merely a \u201cdivision.\u201d A \u201csubsidiary\u201d corporation is clearly defined in the law. (See Corp. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 181, 1001, 1200.) A \u201csubsidiary\u201d is a corporation whose voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>shares of more than a specified percentage are owned directly or indirectly by the parent corporations. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 189, subd. (a).) Generally speaking a percentage ownership of more than 50 percent creates the corporation as a \u201csubsidiary\u201d whether it is owned directly or indirectly through one or more subsidiaries. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The term \u201cdivision,\u201d however, is not defined with equal clarity in the law. It is a generic term. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1961) page 664 defines a division as \u201ca major administrative unit of an industrial enterprise comprising at least several departments or constituting a complete integrated unit for a specific purpose.\u201d Thus a division could be of the specie described in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States </em>(E.D.Va. 1969) 307 F.Supp. 932,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or it could be a totally separate entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Thus, the term \u201cdivision\u201d confers no particular legal qualities on a specific corporate or unincorporated organization. Affixing the label \u201cdivision\u201d to Van Camp cannot transform it into what Van Camp, in actuality, is not. An exploration of its exact nature, its separateness from or oneness with the parent corporation depends upon the unique factual relationships in each case. The degree of separation between the parent and the subsidiary entity, whether true subsidiary or simply a subdivision of a larger integrated whole, is again a factual matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the present case, the facts, the evidence before the trial court do not demonstrate that Van Camp is merely a smaller part of an integrated whole. On the contrary, certain facts would indicate that Van Camp acts and operates as a separate business entity. It is a proper factual inference from the record below that Van Camp is a corporation totally separate and distinct, in location, function and identity from its corporate parent, Ralston.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In determining the degree of separation between various entities, the courts have uniformly focused on the substance of the organizations rather than the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Professor Clifford Davis in an article entitled \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation\u2014Using An Enterprise Theory of Employment to Determine Who is a Third Party Tort Feasor\u201d (32 Pitt.L.Rev. 289 (1971)) supports the reality\u2014fact oriented approach. Davis points out: \u201cThe diversification of an employer\u2019s business into many enterprises also allows the multiple employer to shift the costs of injury from the type of business that caused the injury to the type of business that happened to be the employer of the injured employee. Further it allows the business that caused the injury to escape responsibility for damages which exceed the amount of the compensation paid.\u201d (Id., at pp. 294-295.) Davis further observes: \u201cWhen an employer engaged in multiple enterprises is willing to separate his businesses when such a characterization benefits him (for example, by allowing the exclusion of a separated enterprise because the employees in that enterprise are not numerous enough to make compensation compulsory), a reciprocity of rights requires that courts recognize the separate capacities of the multiple employer when he is sued by an injured employee. <em>In other words, the multi-enterprise employer can be an employer in one business and a third party tort-feasor in another. Allowing an employee to recover against his multiple enterprise employer as a third party tort-feasor would place the multiple employer on the same footing as single enterprise employers and make the definition of third party tort-feasor more uniform in application.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u201cThis recognition of the separate employments of the multiple employer is consistent with what has already been done under many compensation statutes. In many instances an employer engaged in more than one enterprise has had one of his activities classified as a separate employment for compensation purposes. [Citing examples.]</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201cThe conceptual difficulty of seeing an employer in dual capacities\u2014 as employer responsible for compensation and as a third party tort-feasor responsible for the negligent acts of employees of a business separate from that employing the injured employee\u2014probably is not sufficient to justify shielding the employer from liability as a third party tort-feasor. ... As suggested above, no difficulties are encountered where the separate businesses are separately incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>because there are two separate employing entities. <em>Similarly, there should be little difficulty in separating the businesses if the employer has characterized them as separate in order to avoid compensation liability or even if he keeps separate books for each enterprise, which would be likely where the compensation ratings differ. The ultimate issue in cases involving a multi-enterprise employer is whether the injuring enterprise and the enterprise employing the claimant are truly merged.\u201d (Id., </em>at pp. 298-300; italics added; fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">This sound reasoning was applied in the leading case of <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co., supra, </em>590 F.2d 655, a diversity case interpreting the law of the state of Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">After careful review of the body of law the <em>Boggs </em>court held: \u201cWe conclude that Blue Diamond should not be allowed to avoid the consequences of its corporate structure in order to claim immunity from customary tort liability under the Kentucky workmen\u2019s compensation statute. The District Court properly concluded that the Blue Diamond and Scotia are separate and distinct corporations.\u201d (Pp. 662, 663.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">And in <em>Latham </em>v. <em>Technar, Inc., supra, </em>390 F.Supp. 1031, the plaintiff was killed while employed by Jim Robbins Seat Belt Company and suit was brought against the parent company Allied Chemical Corporation. Allied acquired all of the stock of Jim Robbins. The court described the nature of the relationship between Robbins and Allied as follows (p. 1033): \u201cAmong the various divisions of Allied is the Automotive Products Division, which in turn, includes the air bag operations ... of Jim Robbins.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) The court said: \u201cAlthough the stock ownership of one corporation by another may serve in certain instances as an indicia of identity or commixture as between the two, <em>for the purposes of determining who may maintain a common law action against a third party, it is not conclusive. </em>Likewise, the presence of a common insurer as between the holding company and the wholly owned subsidiary does not automatically establish a single employer unit, nor does identity of management create identity for workmen\u2019s compensation purposes. . . . [W]hether Allied enjoyed sufficient identity with Jim Robbins on July 3, 1973 so as to raise the former to the legal status of an employer of Brenda Sue Gaddis <em>can be answered only by determining if the two manufacturing concerns were so completely integrated and commingled that neither party could be realistically viewed as a separate economic entity. The Court cannot find such absolute integration in this case. </em>An examination of the factors discussed above compel the Court to the observation that Jim Robbins by whom Brenda Sue Gaddis was employed was a sufficiently separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>entity from Allied to permit a common law suit to be maintained against Allied. The fact that any loss suffered by either corporation would ultimately come out of the same common pocket is merely a fiscal attribute of common ownership, a trait which, as noted above, does not preclude the maintenance of a common law suit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1037; italics added; fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">A similar analysis was used by the court in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hycon, Inc., supra, </em>244 F.Supp. .151. In that case various brochures and letterheads carried the name of Hycon, Inc., with the additional words \u201cDivision\u2014 Edmonds Art Stone Company,\u201d and in the practical operation Hycon functioned as a department or division of Edmonds. However, separate books of account and profit and loss statements were kept by each corporation. They each maintained payroll withholding and social security tax returns and the plaintiff\u2019s employment was reported on Edmond\u2019s tax return. The court stated at page 155: \u201c/n <em>the instant case, the businesses were distinct, one being in manufacturing, the other in distribution. </em>Stocks were sold in the yard, with a complete transfer of title from Edmonds to Hycon, and separate accounts were maintained for all purposes. Such sales, with their consequent transfer of title, negate any idea of joint venture. There is no evidence of a sharing of profits and losses, or joint proprietary interest or right of mutual control over the subject matter of the enterprise which might indicate a joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u201cSaf-T-Cab [167 Md. 46, 172 Atl. 608 (1934)] was essentially a case in which the non-employing corporation was set up with no purpose or function other than the holding of title to the business assets. [Citation.] In such a case identity may be readily inferred. <em>This is not such a case; Hycon has real, organic business functions and interests different from Edmonds. This court holds, therefore, that Hycon and Edmonds were not a single employer for the purposes of the Act.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In <em>Mingin </em>v. <em>Continental Can Co. </em>(1979) 171 N.J.Super. 148 [408 A.2d 146, 148], the parent corporation sought immunity from suit by claiming employer status. Said the New Jersey Supreme Court: \u201cTo adopt Continental\u2019s theories on a general basis would be to ignore the development of modern business conglomerates. Merely to reflect upon the facts presented delineates the scope of the problem. To apply the principles advanced to such organizations as this organization or General Motors or Trans-America or International Telephone and Telegraph, all of which own businesses not only national but multi-national in scope and as diversified as the ability of the conglomerate to acquire new businesses, dramatizes the perilous seas upon which the court is invited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>embark. The proposition advanced would thus be to deny the products liability field to a significant percentage of our population. This drastic result ought not to be mandated except by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u201c. . . Plaintiff has the right to bring this action. Summary judgment is denied.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">And finally, the most profound and insightful analysis of the particular problem with which we are faced was expressed by Justice Cardozo speaking for the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Berkey </em>v. <em>Third Ave. Ry. Co. </em>(1926) 244 N.Y. 84 [155 N.E. 58, 61], where he stated: \u201cThe whole problem of the relation between parent and subsidiary corporations is one that is still enveloped in the mists of metaphor. Metaphors in law are to be narrowly watched, for starting as devices to liberate thought, they end often by enslaving it. We say at times that the corporate, entity will be ignored when the parent corporation operates a business through a subsidiary which is characterized as an \u2018alias\u2019 or a \u2018dummy.\u2019 All this is well enough if the picturesqueness of the epithets does not lead us to forget that <em>the essential term to be defined is the act of </em>operation. \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">This is an age of increased concentration of discrete business entities in the hands of syndicates, consortiums, conglomerates, cartels, holding companies and families of companies. These amorphous creatures range from regional to national, to multinational in size; megacorporations are joined by overt as well as covert ties with other corporate giants of the earth. These linkages or affinities\u2014that can be formed or severed within soundproof walls of the corporate board room\u2014may seek to have more than a subtle influence on the question of statutory employer status, thus thwarting California\u2019s statutory and interrelated common law scheme for workers\u2019 compensation. The California common law tort system faced with interrelated, sprawling economic giants should not deny adequate recovery to an injured employee due to the fortuitous circumstances that the tortfeasor is not a stranger but is controlled by the same business enterprise that controls his immediate employer. (See <em>Boggs, supra, </em>at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">To that end we hold it is not the name given by a public relations office to a business entity or the misty legal metaphor which determines Ralston\u2019s status as employer. As Cardozo teaches us, it is <em>\u201cthe act of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>operation. \u201d </em>It is the substance, the hard realities, that are to determine whether one corporation is in fact separate and distinct and therefore under our statutory scheme, not the employer for workers\u2019 compensation law purposes. To dispose of this case by simply accepting the label affixed to Van Camp as a \u201cdivision\u201d and thereby determine that Ralston is Gigax\u2019s employer is to merely restate the question rather than to answer it. The rights of employees vis-a-vis the statutory employer or third party tortfeasor under California workers\u2019 compensation and tort laws are not to be manipulated by such easy levers.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Gigax has the right to bring this action to trial. The summary judgment should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Brown (Gerald), P. J., and Cologne, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 22, 1982.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">The records of the Commissioner of Corporations of California as well as the Secretary of State were not brought before the trial court.
