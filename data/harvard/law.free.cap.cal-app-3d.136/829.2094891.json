Admin. Code, tit. 4, \u00a7 100) in light of <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 431 [146 Cal.Rptr. 585, 579 P.2d 476, 96 A.L.R.3d 613], which struck down companion retail price maintenance provisions and regulations determined to be in fatal conflict with the provisions of Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 United States Code section 1 et seq. For the reasons which we explain, we will conclude that the price posting provisions contained in section 24756, and implementing rule, are likewise invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The facts are undisputed. On or about July 26, 1979, petitioner, a licensed rectifier of distilled spirits, sold its products to five separate retailers at prices or quantity discounts other than as contained in price or quantity discount schedules on file with the Department in violation of section 24756 and rule 100. The Department suspended petitioner\u2019s license for 10 days as to each count, stayed upon stated conditions. On appeal to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Board (Board), petitioner challenged the Department\u2019s order contending that rule 100 is invalid under <em>Rice, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Sherman Act, the Robinson-Patman Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13 et seq.) and the equal protection clause. In its written opinion affirming the decision of the Department, the Board concluded that although the price posting statute and Department rule constituted an invalid price fixing scheme under the rationale of <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, and <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rice </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 979 [153 Cal.Rptr. 757], affirmed <em>sub nom. California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 97 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 100 S.Ct. 937], it was nevertheless prohibited from declaring the statute unconsitutional under the provisions of California Constitution, article III, section 3.5,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and consequently refrained from determining the validity of the derivative rule as an \u201cidle act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Petitioner now renews its challenges below seeking to annul the order of the Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Preliminary to our discussion of the merits, we review the recent line of decisions which have considered California\u2019s price maintenance legislation for alcoholic beverages. In its benchmark decision, the California Supreme Court held that the price maintenance provisions embodied in former section 24755 (repealed by Stats. 1980, ch. 1368, \u00a7 3) which required distilled liquors wholesalers to set minimum retail prices constituted a violation of the Sherman Act neither shielded by the \u201cstate action\u201d exception nor saved by application of the Twenty-first Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, 444-459.) Thereafter, in reliance on the <em>Rice </em>analysis, state courts uniformly have invalidated related price maintenance and regulatory provisions. (See <em>Capiscean Corp. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 87 Cal.App.3d 996 [151 Cal.Rptr. 492] [price fixing in retail sale of wine]; <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rice, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 979<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>[price maintenance provisions for wholesale and retail sale of wine]; <em>Norman Williams Co. </em>v. <em>Rice </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 348 [166 Cal.Rptr. 563] [designation statute] reversed and remanded in <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Norman Williams Co. </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 654 [73 L.Ed.2d 1042, 102 S.Ct. 3294].) Petitioner argues that <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, squarely controls the issue herein; that since section 24756 sanctions horizontal price fixing among liquor wholesalers, it likewise must fall as an inseparable part of the price maintenance structure considered in <em>Rice. </em>Respondents counter that neither Rice nor its progeny apply herein since those decisions construed legislation dealing with vertical and horizontal price fixing as distinguished from \u201cprice posting\u201d by licensed wholesalers. Accordingly, we consider the reasoning in <em>Rice </em>and related precedents in order to determine whether the challenged statute violates the Sherman Act and, if so, whether antitrust immunity is afforded either under the \u201cstate action\u201d exception announced in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1943) 317 U.S. 341 [87 L.Ed. 315, 63 S.Ct. 307], or by reason of the application of the Twenty-first Amendment. (See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 432 at pp. 439-451; see also <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Norman Williams Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. 654 [73 L.Ed.2d 1042];<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 U.S. 97, 102-110 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 241-246].)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">It is well established that price fixing alone is illegal per se because it eliminates one form of competition. <em>U.S. </em>V. <em>Univis Lens Co. </em>(1942) 316 U.S. 241, 252 [86 L.Ed. 1408, 1419, 62 S.Ct. 1088]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Trenton Potteries Co. </em>(1927) 273 U.S. 392, 397 [71 L.Ed. 700, 705, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989].) It is equally settled that \u201cany combination which tampers with the price stucture is unlawful. Although the participants of a price fixing scheme may be in no position to control the market, to the extent that they raise, lower or <em>stabilize </em>prices they violate the act, and this is so even if the prices fixed are reasonable. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 453-454; italics added.)  But in determining that the imposition of retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>prices by producers constituted a clear violation of federal law <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, 454-456), the court focused its inquiry upon the <em>effect </em>of the statutory pricing scheme rather than its form reasoning that former section 24755 \u201chas the effect not only of allowing illegal vertical restraints on competition\u2014i.e., resale prices specified by producers and imposed upon retailers\u2014but horizontal restraints as well.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 454.) In view of the statistical evidence there presented reflecting a gradual and marked reduction in price differentials among liquors of the same type, the court determined that the statute clearly violated Sherman Act policy reasoning in part: \u201cHowever, that there may be some interbrand competion does not detract from the circumstance that among leading brands there is a uniformity of price which persuasively demonstrates the absence of \u2018free and unfettered competition\u2019 in the California liquor industry. Indeed, the posting system facilitates price fixing among producers. While it may be a per se violation of the Sherman Act for competitors to exchange price information on a regular basis <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Container Corp. </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 333, 336-337 [21 L.Ed.2d 526, 529-530, 89 S.Ct. 510]), producers may readily determine the prices charged by their competitors by referring to the prices filed with the department or to industry publications listing the posted prices. (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 4, \u00a7 99.2, subd. (b)(2).)\u201d <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 455-456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Thus, contrary to respondents\u2019 assertion that the <em>Rice </em>analysis is limited to vertical price fixing arrangements alone, the court underscored the anticompetitive <em>effect </em>resulting from the posting system\u2019s facilitation of price fixing among producers as an impermissible restraint of trade in violation of Sherman Act policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Under the challenged statute, licensed wholesalers are required to announce their prices in advance by posting them with the Department and, under sanction of penalty, are prevented from making sales to retailers at different prices. Although in form a price posting regulation, it is not immune from antitrust analysis under <em>Rice </em>in order to determine whether an illegal price fixing restraint is otherwise manifested. Here, as in <em>Rice, </em>petitioner introduced statistical evidence demonstrating a progressive elimination of price variations between wholesalers selling the same brand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>and competing brands.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, as the Board concluded, subdivision (f) of the implementing rule literally \u201cinvites periodic examination of the price lists on file\u201d thus assuring other competitors that the filing licensee will not sell its products to anyone at a lower price. In plain effect, the mandated price posting, coupled with the regulatory compliance condition, openly sanctions and promotes an exchange of price information among competitors calculated to produce a uniform price structure vividly demonstrating the absence of free and unfettered competition in the wholesale liquor industry. <em>(See Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 455-456.) The pernicious effect of the statutory scheme in promoting horizontal price restraints is the same whether applied to wholesale or retail price maintenance provisions; price fixing at either level is violative of the Sherman Act. (See <em>Midcal Aluminum, Inc., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at p. 983.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">. Accordingly, we conclude that section 24756 suffers from the same infirmity as the wholesale price posting requirements examined in <em>Midcal. </em>Consequently, the price posting statute must be declared invalid as an illegal restraint of trade in the absence of state action exemption or constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Whether antitrust immunity is conferred on the price posting scheme under the doctrine of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>317 U.S. 341, rests upon a determination of compliance with governing standards: first, the challenged restraint must be clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be \u201cactively supervised\u201d by the state itself. <em>(California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>U.S. 97, 105 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 243].) Assuming arguendo that the statutory scheme unmistakably evidences a clear legislative policy sanctioning wholesale price maintenance in satisfaction of the first prong, no similar compliance with the second prong requiring active state involvement is demonstrated. The observations of our highest federal court in its critique of a parallel California statute is aptly instructive: \u201c[T]he State simply authorizes price-setting and enforces the prices established by private parties. The State neither establishes prices nor reviews the reasonableness of the price schedules; nor does it regulate the terms of fair trade contracts. The State does not monitor market conditions or engage in any \u2018pointed reexamination\u2019 of the program. The national policy in favor of competition cannot be thwarted by casting such a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private price fixing arrangement. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Id., </em>445 U.S. at pp. 105-106 [63 L.Ed.2d at p. 243]; see also <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, 445, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">As petitioner correctly argues, active state involvement is as absent here as it was under the resale price maintenance program invalidated in <em>Rice. </em>Under both statutory programs, as the Board found, the state neither established its own pricing scheme nor reviewed the reasonableness of the prices set by others. The state merely provides, at public expense, a facility for the exchange of wholesale price information among competitors resulting in a uniform price structure, a practice which stifles rather than promotes free competition. In the absence of active supervision or \u201cpointed reexamination\u201d by the state itself to insure that Sherman Act policies are not unnecessarily subordinated <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, 445), no antitrust immunity is extended. Nor do we comprehend the Department\u2019s insistent claim that it is the individual wholesaler who sets his own prices rather than the state or others. It is the very existence of an essentially private price fixing arrangement under statutory sanction which is repugnant to Sherman Act policies. As long declared: \u201ca state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 U.S. 97, 104, 106 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 242, 243-244] [quoting <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>317 U.S. at p. 351 (87 L.Ed. at p. 326)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We next consider whether section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment of the United States Consitution<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> insulates the challenged statute from Sherman Act compliance, a contention rejected by the Board for the reasons stated in <em>Rice </em>and <em>Midcal. </em>We are similarly persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Whether the statutory scheme may be sustained under-the protection of the Twenty-first Amendment requires a balancing process in order to determine what policies are furthered by the statute, whether the price posting provisions clearly vindicate those policies, and whether and to what degree the Sherman Act policy is undermined by that statutory program. <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 451.) Although the amendment grants to states virtually complete control in regulating the sale of liquor and structuring a liquor distribution system, such control is not absolute and remains subject to overriding federal interest in the regulation of interstate commerce. \u201cThe competing state and federal interests can be reconciled only after careful scrutiny of those concerns in a \u2018concrete case.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 U.S. 97, 110 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 246].) We believe that the <em>Rice </em>rationale relating to the state\u2019s interest in retail price maintenance provisions is equally applicable and controlling in the context of a wholesale price posting program. Both sections were enacted as a part of chapter 10 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act for the same legislative purposes: to promote temperance and orderly marketing conditions (\u00a7\u00a7 24749, 23001; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 451.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">By analogy to <em>Rice </em>we similarly find no compelling justification for the horizontal restraints created by the wholesale price posting statute which tend to eliminate free competition. There is no showing that price posting actually protects small retailers. Indeed, the studies considered in <em>Rice </em>suggest that price posting provides the small retailer with little protection, if any, from discriminatory pricing practices at the wholesale level. Conversely, there is no reason to assume that price posting is necessary to the effective policing of discriminatory price practices under the provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act. As earlier discussed, there is eloquent proof that price posting actually results in serious impairment of price competition in the wholesale liquor industry. While it is arguable that price posting may provide useful information to the consumer retailer who might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>otherwise be subject to predatory practices, it seems clear that it is only in a noncompetitive setting that the protection of wholesale price posting would even be required. Ironically, it is the price posting scheme <em>itself </em>which tends to create a noncompetitive environment which would conceivably justify whatever protection is afforded the retailer through such accessible information. In convoluted result, the price posting statute provides a remedy for an ailment which it itself creates.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Finally, it is doubtful whether the small retailer would gain any competitive advantage through the posting of quantity discounts which as a practical matter would be available only to larger retailers. Nor does the circumstance that the narrowing of prices to lower levels thus minimizing the burden imposed upon retailers justify the anticompetitive effect of price posting. To reiterate, the major economic premise underlying the Sherman Act is the promotion of free competition; any restraint on trade which <em>raises, lowers or stabilizes prices, </em>is prohibited. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 150, 222 [84 L.Ed. 1129, 1167-1168, 60 S.Ct. 811].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Nor is it reasonable to conclude that the wholesale price posting program is likely to promote temperance. (See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd.., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, pp. 457-459.) Again, it is conjectural at best whether the anticompetitive effect of price posting would trigger higher wholesale prices and consequent higher retail prices so as to cause a perceptible decrease in consumption demands. As <em>Rice </em>teaches, there is little evidence to suggest that price maintenance legislation significantly contributes to reduced consumption of alcohol. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 457.) Such doubtful benefit is inadequate to override the significant objectives of the Sherman Act <em>(California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 U.S. 97, 114 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 248-249]; <em>Rice, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d p. 458).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Moreover, alternative means to accommodate state concerns compatible with the objectives of the Sherman Act could be readily fashioned. Obviously, the establishment of a truly competitive market, permitting access to retailers of independent wholesale prices, would enable purchases at the best possible price. Additionally, a more limited exchange of presale price information among wholesalers arguably would result in minimal anticompetitive effects within the industry while providing wholesalers and retailers with adequate price information without risk of predatory price practices. Such limited exchange in order to further adherence to the Robinson-Patman Act would appear consonant with Sherman Act precepts. (See e.g., <em>Wall Products Co. </em>v. <em>National Gypsum Co. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1971) 326 F.Supp. 295 [permissible price <em>verification </em>among gypsum manufacturers]; but see <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co. </em>(1978) 438 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>422 [57 L.Ed.2d 854, 98 S.Ct. 2864], which substantially restricts such limited price exchange practice.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In conclusion, we hold that consideration of relevant balancing factors compels a determination that the policies underlying the Sherman Act are paramount and that the price posting scheme embodied in section 24756 and the implementing rule are invalid. <em>(California Liquor Dealers </em>v. <em>Midcal Aluminum, supra, </em>445 U.S. 97, 114 [63 L.Ed.2d 233, 248-249]; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 431, p. 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In view of our determination, we need not reach the remaining issues raised in the briefs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">The order of the Board below is annulled.

First, as discussed, the mere definitive distinction does not eliminate the possibility that price posting legislation may in fact facilitate illegal price fixing.

The leading scotch whiskeys went from a $.50 per case variance equal to 9/10 percent to $.29 per case variance or 3/10 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"Alt\">For znirtibrand competition, with one exception, every wholesaler who sold one of the leading brands of gin, scotch whiskey or straight whiskey charged the same per case price as his competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">Additionally, during the fifteen-month period prior to the hearing, there were only two instances where the price of one of the analyzed brands was reduced: In November and December 1979, John Walker Red and Gordon\u2019s Gin were reduced in price; during those two months every wholesaler in Northern California who handled that brand made the exact same price reduction. The following January, each increased his price to the same amount charged by their competitors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b720-15\">We agree with the Board\u2019s determination that the semantical distinction between a \u201cprice schedule\u201d and \u201cprice list\u201d noted in <em>Midcal, </em>90 Cal.App.3d at p. 985, is dictum at best. However labeled, it is the price posting system that facilitates illegal price fixing that is central to our inquiry. <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 455.) Additionally, we observe that the Department itself equates the statutory term with \u201cprice schedules,\u201d the designation consistently employed in the implementing rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Section 2 provides: \u201cThe transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\"> We reject respondents\u2019 contention that the challenged statute was enacted to prevent price discrimination proscribed by section 25503, subdivision (e), thus justifying the anticompetitive effect of the price posting program. The price discrimination measure, enacted after section 24756, is found in an entirely different chapter (15) of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act for the wholly different purpose of maintaining the independence of the tripartite levels of distribution provided under the act. (See <em>California Beer Wholesalers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 402, 407-412 [96 Cal.Rptr. 297, 487 P.2d 745].) Nor do we find the holding in <em>Schenley Affiliated Brands Corp. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 177 [98 Cal.Rptr. 609], applicable as contended. <em>Schenley, </em>which then assumed the validity of price fixing legislation, dealt with an earlier version of rule 100 concerning the types of permitted assortments by wholesalers and the prohibition of \u201ctie-in\u201d sales for discount purposes; there is no suggestion in <em>Schenley </em>that section 24756 was intended either to implement or supplant section 25503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b724-10\">While it is unnecessary to discuss the question of the Board's authority to declare the subject statute unenforceable by reason of the restrictions imposed under California Constitution, article III, section 3.5, we assume, arguendo, that the explicit constitutional language would prohibit such an administrative adjudication as determined below. However, we agree with the Board that, as a general proposition, such prohibition on constitutional grounds would not affect an administrative agency\u2019s power in the enforcement of its own rules. (See <em>Goldin </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 638, 669, fn. 18 [153 Cal.Rptr. 802, 592 P.2d 289].)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
