J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azl_\">The People appeal adverse rulings relating to the constitutionality of certain provisions of Los Angeles County Ordinance No. 5860 (Ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The provisions of the Ordinance at issue here relate to licensing of escort bureaus. Section 533<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> mandates that \u201c[e]very person conducting, managing or carrying on any escort bureau shall first procure a license and pay an annual license fee . . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Section 532 defines \u201cescort bureau\u201d as meaning \u201cany business or agency which for a fee, commission, hire, reward or profit, furnishes or offers to furnish escorts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Section 531, subdivisions (a) and (b), defines an \u201cescort\u201d as: \u201c(a) Any person who, for hire or reward accompanies others to or about social affairs, entertainment or places of amusement. [11] (b) Any person who, for hire or reward consorts with others about any place of public resort or within any private quarters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The central issue in this case is whether the operation of an escort bureau is protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or pursuant to the California Constitution as a proper exercise of the freedom of association, an integral aspect of freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">We conclude that such activity is not constitutionally protected and that the Ordinance does not offend either the free speech or due process guarantees of the United States and California Constitutions. We also determine that the Ordinance is a valid exercise of the police power, and so reverse the rulings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In September 1980, the People filed misdemeanor complaints against Dorothy Carol Katrinak (Katrinak) and Sharon Lynn Lee (Lee). Katrinak was charged with violating section 533 by engaging in the business of an escort bureau without first obtaining a license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lee was charged with violating Business and Professions Code section 16240 by failing to comply with section 533 of the Ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Katrinak and Lee filed motions to dismiss and demurrers to their respective complaints on the grounds that section 533 and the related licensing sections were unconstitutional on their face. The trial court dismissed the cases after ruling the Ordinance was unconstitutionally broad and vague and that the court was therefore without jurisdiction to proceed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People appealed to the appellate department of the superior court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The superior court ordered the two cases consolidated on appeal, and affirmed the trial court in an unpublished opinion. The court held that \"... the associational purposes of an escort bureau more closely parallel those [allegedly protected activities] of a social club . . .,\u201d and cited its opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d Supp. 8 [148 Cal.Rptr. 575 ].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The People\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>court was granted, pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 63(a), (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On appeal, the People contend that the Ordinance is constitutional and a valid application of the county\u2019s police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Katrinak and Lee assert that: (1) The operation of an escort bureau is a protected activity under the First Amendment and we must therefore use a strict scrutiny standard of review; (2) the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and violates fundamental due process guarantees in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Under the California Constitution, a county has broad authority to \u201cmake and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7, <em>Sunset Amusement Co, </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 64, 72 [101 Cal.Rptr. 768, 496 P.2d 840].) Such ordinances and regulations will ordinarily be upheld unless they violate state or federal due process standards. \u201cIn the exercise of its police power [the legislative body] does not violate due process so long as an enactment is procedurally fair and reasonably related to a proper legislative goal. The wisdom of the legislation is not at issue in analyzing its constitutionality, and neither the availability of less drastic remedial alternatives nor the legislative failure to solve all related ills at once will invalidate a statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 398 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512]; see also <em>Perez </em>v. <em>City of San Bruno </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 875, 889 [168 Cal.Rptr. 114, 616 P.2d 1287].)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Katrinak and Lee, however, assert that an escort bureau involves the First Amendment right of association as that right relates to free speech, which would require us to review the Ordinance under a strict scrutiny standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glaze </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 841, 845 [166 Cal.Rptr. 859, 614 P.2d 291]; <em>Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Po</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>lice Commissioners, supra, </em>7 Cal. 3d at p. 72.) We therefore review the First Amendment claims before reaching the due process issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">1. <em>Since the Ordinance does not involve restrictions on protected First Amendment activities, we need not employ a \u201chigher standard\u201d of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Freedom of speech enjoys a \u201cpreferred position\u201d under the law, and the courts will exercise a zealous solicitude for rights shielded by the amendment. If the Ordinance in fact involves restrictions on protected First Amendment activities, we agree we must employ a higher standard of review. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This higher standard requires the government to show \u201cthat the regulation is narrowly and explicitly drawn and necessary to further a legitimate government interest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glaze, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 846; see also <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Mun. Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 684, 692 [68 Cal.Rptr. 721, 441 P.2d 281].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The First Amendment embraces freedom of association as an essential aspect of freedom of speech. The United States Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cabstract discussion is not the only species of communication which the Constitution protects; the First Amendment also protects vigorous advocacy, certainly of lawful ends, against governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>(N. A. A. C. P. </em>v. <em>Button </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 415, 429 [9 L.Ed.2d 405, 416, 83 S.Ct. 328].) In order to shelter this vigorous advocacy, certain forms of group activity come within the privilege. Thus, the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the rights of laymen to \u201cassociate together to help one another to preserve and enforce rights granted them under federal laws... . \u201d <em>(Railroad Trainmen </em>v. <em>Virginia Bar </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 1, 7 [12 L.Ed.2d 89, 94, 84 S.Ct. 1113].) Association for political purposes is also firmly within the scope of the amendment\u2019s protection: \u201cThere can no longer be any doubt that freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas is ... protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d (Ku<em>sper </em>v. <em>Pontikes </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 51, 56-57 [38 L.Ed.2d 260, 266, 94 S.Ct. 303]; see also <em>Democratic Party of U.S. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 107, 121 [67 L.Ed.2d 82, 94, 101 S.Ct. 1010].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The Supreme Court has thus recognized freedom of association as necessary to promote the First Amendment\u2019s goal of preserving \u201can uninhibited market place of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\u201d <em>(Red Lion Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>FCC </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 367, 390 [23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>L.Ed.2d 371, 389, 89 S.Ct. 1794]; see also <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 160, 175 [49 L.Ed.2d 415, 427, 96 S.Ct. 2586].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">With these principles in mind, we must determine whether operation of an escort bureau is a constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The parties have not submitted and our research has not revealed any California cases or cases from other jurisdictions directly addressing this particular issue. However, we find persuasive our Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pages 74-75, in which petitioners argued that roller skating rink activities include \u201centertainment\u201d or \u201camusement\u201d of patrons and that the patron\u2019s rights of free speech and assembly would be affected by a licensing ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Answering the contention, the Supreme Court stated, \u201c. . . no case has ever held or suggested that simple physical activity falls within the ambit of the First Amendment, at least in the absence of some element of communicating or advancing ideas or beliefs.... The key element is, of course, <em>communication. </em>We have difficulty finding that essential element to exist in the context of a roller skating rink.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The court goes on to observe that \u201c[t]here is no question that petitioners\u2019 patrons are assembled together in one building or rink, and in that sense constitute an \u2018assemblage.\u2019 But again, no case has ever suggested that the constitutional freedom of assembly or association extends to a congregation of persons engaged in mere physical activity or self-amusement. \u2018It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association <em>for the advancement of beliefs and ideas </em>is an inseparable aspect of the \u201cliberty\u201d assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. [Citations. ]\u2019 ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The activities described in the Ordinance at issue are essentially entertainment-oriented, commercial relationships. Escort bureaus, like roller rinks, do not foster assemblages for the advancement of beliefs and ideas. Rather, they provide a commercial service for those who wish to hire a companion. The activity in question is closer to the \u201cself-amusement\u201d of patrons at a roller rink than the group activity traditionally shielded by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">As to Katrinak and Lee\u2019s novel contention that \u201cthe right to associate for the sake of association is a fundamental right,\u201d citing <em>City of Santa </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number><em>Barbara </em>v. <em>Adamson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 123 [164 Cal.Rptr. 539, 610 P.2d 436] for support, we do not understand that case as supporting such a broad proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In <em>Adamson, </em>our Supreme Court struck down a municipal ordinance prohibiting six or more unrelated persons from living together in areas zoned for family residences. Basing its decision on the California constitutional right of privacy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court quoted from the ballot argument drafted by the proponents of the provision which added the right of privacy to the Constitution: \u2018\u201cThe right of privacy is the right to be left alone. <em>It is a fundamental and compelling interest. </em>It protects our <em>homes, </em>our <em>families, </em>our thoughts, our emotions, our expressions, our personalities, our <em>freedom of communion </em>and our <em>freedom to associate with the people we choose. </em>. ..\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Although the ballot argument in support of the privacy amendment to the California Constitution mentions \u201cfreedom to associate with the people we choose,\u201d the fundamental right contemplated is privacy, not association. Freedom to associate with people of one\u2019s choice is a necessary adjunct to privacy in the family and the home. However, Katrinak and Lee are urging a far broader interpretation than the right of privacy would support. While the privacy right clearly encompasses certain fundamental personal decisions concerning family life,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Ordinance under attack does not touch upon the family but instead, regulates an essentially commercial relationship. Sale of companionship does not occupy the same position under our laws as the sort of personal intimacy protected under the concept of a right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Freedom of speech which assuredly rests in some measure for its continued existence on the citizen\u2019s right to associate freely is to be zea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>lously guarded. However, it is clear from the cases cited that language such as \u201cshelter this vigorous advocacy,\u201d \u201can uninhibited market place of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail,\u201d \u201cassociate together . .. to preserve and enforce rights granted . ..,\u201d \u201cto petition ... for redress of grievances\u201d indicates that we are dealing with protections insuring our precious right of freedom from untoward government intrusion and oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It would make a mockery of these cherished constitutional principles to suggest that the activities embraced by an escort bureau rise to a similar level. Therefore we are agreed that the operation of an escort bureau does not involve constitutionally protected activity which would require us to examine regulatory legislation under the strict scrutiny standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">We next examine the licensing provisions of the Ordinance in the light of constitutional due process guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">2. <em>The Ordinance withstands due process scrutiny.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">An ordinance enacted under the police power does not violate due process if it is \u201cprocedurally fair, and reasonably related to a proper legislative goal.\u201d <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 398 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512].) Katrinak and Lee attack the Ordinance as violating constitutional due process on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">They initially contend that the escort bureau provisions bear no reasonable relationship to a proper legislative goal. (Ibid.) However, \u201c[t]he requirement that a license first be obtained before conducting a business or activity has long been recognized as a valid exercise of the police power.\u201d <em>(Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, supra, </em>7 Cal. 3d at p. 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Licensing of local business promotes the public welfare, a traditional goal of the police power, by imposing certain requirements of accountability upon those who sell products or services to the public. Los Angeles County reasonably could conclude that its citizens would benefit from licensing of escort bureaus as local commercial enterprises.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Katrinak and Lee also urge that the Ordinance is invalid because it lacks any provision indicating that the business license commission must grant a license at all. The Ordinance, however, carefully specifies grounds for denial in section 83.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 47 requires the issuance of a license subject to conditions where the conditions imposed will obviate the grounds for denying the license. The relevant language in section 47 provides: \u201cIf the applicant does not request a hearing and a hearing is not required by this ordinance, <em>the license shall be issued </em>subject to the conditions recommended pursuant to Section 45.2.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] If a hearing is held and the Commission finds that the facts are such that one or more or [j/c] the provisions of Article 7 of this chapter relating to the denial of a license would apply if the license is issued without conditions, but that conditions can be imposed which will eliminate any ground for denial provided for in said Article 7, <em>the Commission shall instruct the tax collector to issue, and the tax collector shall issue, </em>the license subject to such conditions.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Absence of a parallel provision mandating issuance of a license without conditions does not invalidate this Ordinance on its face. Under sections 83 and 47, the business license commission must, a fortiori, issue a license unless it finds grounds for denial which cannot be cured by imposing limiting conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Katrinak and Lee further contend that two sections of the Ordinance contain unconstitutionally vague language.  A statute or ordinance violates fundamental due process if it requires or prohibits the doing of an act with such vagueness that a person of common intelligence must guess at its meaning. It must be sufficiently definite to provide a standard of conduct, or notice, and a standard for ascertaining guilt. <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 491 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barksdale </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 320, 327 [105 Cal.Rptr. 1, 503 P.2d 257].) However, a statute is presumed valid and courts will uphold it \u201cif its terms may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Hartway) (1977) 19 Cal.3d 338, 345 [138 Cal.Rptr. 66, 562 P.2d 1315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Katrinak and Lee attack the term \u201cconsorts\u201d in section 531, subdivision (b) as unconstitutionally vague. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1981) defines \u201cto consort\u201d as an intransitive verb meaning \u201cto keep company.\u201d The definition of \u201cconsort\u201d used as a noun is \u201cone that shares the company of or is associated with another,\u201d or \u201ccompanion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 485.) Subdivision (b) may be reasonably construed to specify any person who keeps company with others, for reward or hire, in public or in private quarters. As construed, this provision is not constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Under the same theory Katrinak and Lee also question the constitutionality of section 536, which provides for a sheriffs report and hearing on license applications as follows: \u201cThe Sheriff, <em>after investigation, shall report to the Commission </em>as to whether the applicant for a license to conduct an escort bureau is of good moral character and reputation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the business is to be conducted at a suitable place, is calculated or intended to be operated as a subterfuge for the conduct of an unlawful or immoral business and practice. Except as otherwise provided in Section 63[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] <em>the Commission </em>or referee <em>shall hold a public hearing, </em>notice of the time and place of which shall be given to the applicant as provided in Section 101.\u201d (Italics added.) They contend that the phrases \u201cgood moral character and reputation,\u201d and \u201cimmoral business\u201d are unconstitutionally vague and that the provision lacks adequate guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">This section, however, merely instructs the sheriff regarding the content of a preliminary report to the business license commission or referee to be considered at the time of the hearing along with other information.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Section 83 of the Ordinance, which Katrinak and Lee do not challenge, sets forth grounds for denying a license for activities not involving free speech.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We note that our Supreme Court in <em>Sunset Amusement Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, supra, </em>7 Cal. 3d at pages 71, 73, approved of a city ordinance with language substantially similar to that in section 83. (See also <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commrs. </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 566, 574 [12 Cal.Rptr. 226].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Constitutional due process also reaches legislative enactments which are so broad that they prohibit constitutionally protected conduct. <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 493; <em>Findley </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 566, 571 [133 Cal.Rptr. 241].) The Ordinance at issue does not appear on its face to affect any conduct other than operation of an escort bureau, which is not a protected activity. Having determined that the definitional language of the enactment is not unconstitutionally vague, we therefore conclude that it is also not overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">3. <em>Other contentions do not address a controversy pending before this court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Katrinak and Lee raise a host of contentions regarding provisions of the Ordinance regulating licensed escort bureaus and their employees. Their position as <em>unlicensed </em>individuals, however, precludes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>them from pursuing these issues. \u201cThe rule is well established . .. that one will not be heard to attack a statute on grounds that are not shown to be applicable to himself and that a court will not consider every conceivable situation which might arise under the language of the statute and will not consider the question of constitutionality with reference to hypothetical situations. [Citations.] Petitioner has not shown that the statute is being invoked against him in the aspects or under the circumstances which he suggests, and hence may not be heard to complain.\u201d <em>(In re Cregler </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 308, 313 [14 Cal.Rptr. 289, 363 P.2d 305]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bratis </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 751, 758 [141 Cal.Rptr. 45].)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">They likewise attack several of the licensing provisions which on their face do not apply to the case at bench. The complaints as filed name Katrinak and Lee as <em>individuals </em>who have failed to comply with section 533. They may not challenge the sections concerned with fictitious names (\u00a7 538) and applicants other than individuals (\u00a7 537) without some proof that these provisions actually apply to them. <em>(Id.)</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We conclude that the operation of an escort bureau is not a protected activity under the United States or California Constitutions. The Los Angeles County Ordinance requiring escort bureaus to be licensed is a valid exercise of the county\u2019s police power, and as herein discussed, is not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The judgment (order of dismissal) is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Potter, J., and Lui, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied November 24, 1982.
