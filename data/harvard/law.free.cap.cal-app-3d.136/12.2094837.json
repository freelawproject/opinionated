He was accused and found guilty by respondent Board of Medical Quality Assurance (hereafter Board), under Business and Professions Code sections 2361 and 2411, of knowingly assisting others in making or sighing a certificate and document directly or indirectly related to the practice of medicine which falsely represented the existence or nonexistence of a state of facts. For the attending \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d he was placed on probation for one year during which period he was permitted to continue practicing his profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Dr. Fort thereafter, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate, by which he sought to set aside the Board\u2019s decision and sanction. He has appealed from that court\u2019s judgment denying the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The record discloses the following factual-procedural context.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">California, as do most of the states of our nation, has a legislative program which extends medical aid to public assistance recipients and \u201cmedically needy\u201d persons and families. It is commonly known as MediCal and it is supported by county, state, and federal funding. The medical aid is, generally furnished by physicians (including psychiatrists), who must be licensed or approved by Medi-Cal as \u201cproviders.\u201d Such providers are compensated by Medi-Cal for services personally performed by them. Payment is made to the provider on a written claim upon which he is required to certify that he personally provided the stated services.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Medi-Cal also requires that all claims for compensation set forth the name of the provider who rendered the described services. No provider shall submit, or cause to be submitted, any false or misleading statement of material fact in connection with any claim for reimbursement. And a violation of any Medi-Cal statute, rule, or regulation, relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>its health care services shall be deemed contrary to public health, safety, welfare, and morals.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Particularly, psychiatric services are not covered by Medi-Cal when performed by nonphysicians. And when psychiatric services are performed by a physician, they are (or at here relevant times, were) paid for by Medi-Cal at the rate of $50 for 50 minutes of such services.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Sanctions are imposed upon providers for violation of related statutes or Medi-Cal regulations in order to protect the public welfare, the medical aid program, and the public funds appropriated for it. Among the sanctions is a possible felony conviction for presenting, with intent to defraud, any false or fraudulent claim for payment by a provider. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14107.) Another, as here, may be imposed under the State Medical Practice Act upon a provider for unprofessional conduct for \u201cknowingly making or signing [or assisting in making or signing] any certificate or other documents directly or indirectly related to the practice of medicine .. . which falsely represents the existence or nonexistence of a state of facts.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2361, 2411.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The superior court, exercising its independent judgment on the entire record of the Board, had concluded that the Board\u2019s findings of fact were supported by the weight of the evidence and that such findings, in turn, were supportive of the Board\u2019s decision and the sanction thereupon imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">On this appeal, we \u201cmust uphold the trial court\u2019s determination as to the basis of the [Board\u2019s] action if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Adcock </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1973) 10 Cal. 3d 60, 66 [109 Cal.Rptr. 676, 513 P.2d 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">We consider first certain uncontroverted evidence of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Dr. Fort was the founder and principal actor of a nonprofit enterprise which came to be named, or rather nicknamed, after himself as Fort Help. It offered psychiatric help, without cost, to mentally and emotionally disturbed persons. The furnished help consisted mainly, if hot entirely, of counseling by nonprofessional lay people who had themselves suffered mental or psychiatric problems, such as rehabilitated drug and alcohol abusers. Such persons were considered, and termed, a part of Fort Help\u2019s \u201cstaff.\u201d Before long, Fort Help encountered financial difficulties, and decided to finance its operations through Medi-Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Dr. Fort became licensed and authorized by Medi-Cal as a provider,, permitted to personally furnish psychiatric services and subscribe written claims upon Medi-Cal for his compensation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We advert now to the here relevant findings of fact by the Board. (Findings of fact by the superior court were waived by the parties.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">During Fort Help\u2019s years of operating under Medi-Cal, Dr. Fort, apparently busy with his outside practice of psychiatry, did not at any time \u201cparticipate or involve himself with Medi-Cal [claims] or patients.\u201d He had informed Fort Help\u2019s staff that he would <em>not </em>\u201cpersonally see any of the patients involved and that he [would <em>not] </em>personally sign any of the [Medi-Cal] claims forms.\u201d And he \u201cdid not participate or involve himself with Medi-Cal billing or patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Instead, in order that Fort Help\u2019s Medi-Cal operations and income might continue, he agreed that otherwise unauthorized, and nonprofessional, staff members might \u201cuse his name\u201d in certifying to Medi-Cal that he, as provider, had rendered the services which members of the staff had actually performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u201cThe staff thereafter submitted claims to Medi-Cal, certified by use of [Dr. Fort\u2019s] name, which reflected that specified patients had, on particular dates, received the medical service of psychotherapy ... from [Dr. Fort]. In fact, [Dr. Fort] had not rendered such service. It had been rendered by persons other than physicians, and [Dr. Fort] knew such to be the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u201c[C]laims submitted to Medi-Cal by Fort Help and certified by use of [Dr. Fort\u2019s] name indicated that [he] had rendered 50 minutes of individual psychotherapy. In fact, these claims contained false or misleading statements of material facts, as follows: [If] 1. The service rendered was, in fact, group therapy. [If] 2. The service was rendered by unlicensed persons. (Nonphysicians)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Dr. Fort authorized \u201cothers to use his name on certifying claims [to Medi-Cal] which contained false information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Dr. Fort\u2019s \u201caforenoted conduct constituted a regular aspect of his participation in the operation of Fort Help from 1974 through 1976. During this period, the fiscal intermediary paid to Fort Help approximately $40,900 in 1974; $72,900 in 1975; and $52,000 in 1976 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>psychotherapy services, although [Dr. Fort] had not personally rendered such services as indicated in the claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">In 1976, Dr. Fort learned that Medi-Cal had questioned claims presented by Fort Help. He thereupon \u201cdirected that his name no longer be used in certifying Medi-Cal claims [and] Fort Help has not participated in the Medi-Cal Program since.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">We have read the record of the Board\u2019s hearing. We conclude that the above findings of fact by the Board, and the later judgment of the superior court based upon the whole record, were supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>Adcock </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 60, 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">And those findings, we opine, abundantly supported the Board\u2019s determination that: \u201cBy assisting others to commit acts which would constitute a violation of Section 2411 of the Business and Professions Code were they licensed physicians, [Dr. Fort\u2019s] conduct constitutes unprofessional conduct. Cause for disciplinary action was established under Section 2361(a) of the Business and Professions Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">We have considered other of the Board\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact,\u201d heavily relied upon by Dr. Fort, which are found irrelevant to the case\u2019s issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The Board additionally \u201cfound,\u201d apparently in justification, or explanation, of the mildness of its sanction, that Dr. Fort \u201creaped no personal financial income or gain from or through the Medi-Cal Program,\u201d that his purpose was \u201caltruistic,\u201d and that the evidence failed to establish \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cdishonesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">It is true that evidence before the Board established, beyond any doubt, that all of the Medi-Cal funds paid to Dr. Fort as a provider were, in one manner or another, used by Fort Help for its charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u201cFraud\u201d and \u201cdishonesty\u201d are closely synonymous. Fraud is defined as \u201ca dishonest stratagem.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Diet. (1961) p. 904.) It \u201cmay consist in the misrepresentation or the concealment of material facts\u201d <em>(Koch </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 537, 541 [14 Cal.Rptr. 429]), or a statement of fact made with \u201cconsciousness] of [its] falsity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 286, 298 [246 P.2d 160].)  And it is the universally recognized rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that: \u201c\u2018It is not essential to liability that the person charged with fraud should have received any benefit therefrom .. .. \u2019 ... \u2018Liability is predicated upon the fact that [another] has been misled to his prejudice, and not that defendant has profited by his wrong.\u2019\u201d <em>(Swasey </em>v. <em>de L\u2019Etanche </em>(1936) 17 Cal.App.2d 713, 718 [62 P.2d 753]; see also <em>Von Schrader </em>v. <em>Milton </em>(1929) 96 Cal.App. 192, 201 [273 P. 1074]; 37 C.J.S., Fraud, \u00a7 44, p. 297; 37 Am.Jur.2d, Fraud &amp; Deceit, \u00a7 18, pp. 42-43; and see the authorities in those works collected.) Here, MediCal, and its funding county, state, and federal governments, had been misled to their prejudice by Dr. Fort and Fort Help\u2019s staff. The fraudulently obtained money approximated $165,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Moreover, a finding of fraud, or lack of it, will be tested by the same rule as a pleading of fraud. <em>(In re J. T. </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 633, 641 [115 Cal.Rptr. 553]; <em>D\u2019Andrea </em>v. <em>Pringle </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 689, 697 [52 Cal.Rptr. 606]; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Froloff </em>(1939) 30 Cal.App.2d 400, 407 [86 P.2d 691].) <em>Both state a conclusion. (Hannon </em>v. <em>Madden </em>(1931) 214 Cal. 251, 267 [5 P.2d 4]; <em>Norkin </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 237 Cal.App.2d 435, 437 [33 Cal.Rptr. 51].) An allegation or finding of fraud \u201cadds nothing.\u201d <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Gardner </em>(1927) 86 Cal.App. 421, 425 [260 P. 961]; it concerns no \u201cissuable fact\u201d <em>(Heller </em>v. <em>Dyerville Mfg.

Water Dist. </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 238, 270 [45 Cal.Rptr. 793]).)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We are thus obliged to treat what the Board termed \u201cfindings,\u201d of \u201chonesty,\u201d and lack of evidence of \u201cfraud\u201d as \u201cconclusions,\u201d which are in disagreement with its \u201cexpress findings\u201d as to Dr. Fort\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u201c\u2018It is, of course, well settled that a general and ultimate finding . . . which is drawn as a <em>conclusion </em>from facts previously found, cannot stand if the specific facts upon which it is based do not support it.\u2019\u201d <em>(Garrison </em>v. <em>Edward Brown &amp; Sons </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 473, 478 [154 P.2d 377], italics added; see also <em>Estate of Bielec </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 213, 221, fn. 10 [104 Cal.Rptr. 516, 502 P.2d 12, 58 A.L.R.3d 1088]; <em>LaMar </em>v. <em>LaMar </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 898, 900 [186 P.2d 678]; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Hiber</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>nia Savings &amp; Loan Soc. </em>(1918) 177 Cal. 656, 659 [171 P. 677]; <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Gesford </em>(1912) 163 Cal. 243, 246 [124 P. 1016]; <em>Matter of Forrester </em>(1912) 162 Cal. 493, 495 [123 P. 283]; <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 295, 301 [138 P.2d 768].) \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s mistaken conclusion [which] is not supported by the facts found, ... must be disregarded.\u201d <em>(Wells </em>v. <em>Comstock, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 528, 532.) \u201cThese are not findings of ultimate fact but conclusions of law which are not supported by any facts found. Accordingly, they must be disregarded.\u201d <em>(D\u2019Andrea </em>v. <em>Pringle, supra, </em>243 Cal.App.2d 689, 696.) And: \u201cWhere a conclusion, whether it be characterized as a finding ... or a legal conclusion, is drawn from specific probative findings, it cannot stand if it is not supported or is inconsistent with the specific probative findings.\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 392, 397-398 [67 Cal.Rptr. 796].)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Dr. Fort also argues that section 241 l\u2019s requirement that its violation must be \u201cknowingly\u201d done mandates the elements of \u201cwrongful intent\u201d and \u201ca consciousness of wrongdoing.\u201d He then insists that the administrative record does not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State Department of Health </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 548 [150 Cal.Rptr. 344], a medical doctor was charged with violating section 2411. He contended that since the Board had found that \u201che did not intend to defraud or mislead the Medi-Cal program,\u201d he had as a matter of law not acted \u201cknowingly,\u201d as required by the statute. The court first stated: \u201cCalifornia case law has long held that the requirement- of \u2018knowingly\u2019 is satisfied where the person involved has knowledge of the facts, though not of the law.\u201d (P. 554.)  Then, addressing itself to the case before it, the <em>Brown </em>court held (pp. 556, 557) that: \u201cBusiness and Professions Code section 2411 is violated by a physician who signs or makes a medical certificate which states a false set of facts, so long as the doctor has knowledge of the falsity of the document .... Such certification was unprofessional conduct within the meaning of ... section 2411.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The rationale of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State Department of Health </em>is seemingly borrowed from the criminal law, where it has long been held that: \u201cThe word \u2018knowingly\u2019 imports only a knowledge that the facts exist which bring the act or omission within the provisions of this code. It does not require any knowledge of the unlawfulness of such act or omission.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 7, subd. 5; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns </em>(1888) 75 Cal. 627, 630-631 [17 P. 646]; <em>People </em>v. Calban (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 578, 585-586 [135 Cal.Rptr. 441]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Autterson </em>(1968) 261 Cal. App.2d 627, 632 [68 Cal.Rptr. 113]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCree </em>(1954) 128 Cal.App.2d 196, 202-203 [275 P.2d 95].)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The rule iterated by <em>Brown </em>v. State <em>Department of Health </em>is reasonably apposite to the case before us. Applying it, we find the Board\u2019s determination that Dr. Fort had \u201cknowingly\u201d assisted in the violation of section 2411 to have been supported by its findings and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the Board\u2019s finding based upon Dr. Fort\u2019s testimony\u2014that he had authorized the false use of his name on MediCal claims \u201conly if done for a lawful purpose and in a lawful manner\u201d\u2014 had somehow impeached its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Dr. Fort had authorized the false signing of his name to Medi-Cal claims, falsely stating that he had personally provided psychiatric services. One may not reasonably escape responsibility for an unlawful, or criminal, act by the device of authorizing its commission \u201cfor a lawful purpose and in a lawful manner.\u201d And were we to undertake the difficult assumption of Dr. Fort\u2019s intent that his name be falsely, but lawfully, signed and used, it would be of no avail to him. For under the rationale of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, supra, </em>86 Cal.App. 3d 548, he had \u201cknowingly\u201d authorized the proscribed act. The violated statute did not require any knowledge of the <em>unlawfulness </em>of the authorized falsification. It was sufficient that \u201cthe doctor ha[d] knowledge of the falsity of the document.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 556.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Another of Dr. Fort\u2019s appellate contentions is stated in this manner: \u201cIt was error for the superior court to uphold the division\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request to be heard and to be confronted with the ex parte matter then before the division on the issue of the type of factfinder to be used in the case against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The Board, as correctly stated by Dr. Fort, \u201cwas vested with the discretion to decide whether an administrative accusation against a physician should be heard by one of the regional medical quality review committees, or a five-member panel thereof, consisting principally of physicians and members of allied professions, or by an administrative law judge.\u201d It had exercised its discretion by selecting an administrative law judge to preside over Dr. Fort\u2019s disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We interpret the instant contention as an argument that Dr. Fort was somehow denied <em>due process, </em>by denial of a voice, or hearing, as to the type of tribunal chosen to preside over the Board\u2019s later hearing. The issue appears to be one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u201cDue Process is a flexible concept; the precise procedures necessary to prevent the arbitrary deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest vary \u2018with the subject-matter and the necessities of the situation.\u2019\u201d (I<em>n re Bye </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 96, 103 [115 Cal.Rptr. 382, 524 P.2d 854], cert. den. 420 U.S. 996 [43 L.Ed.2d 679, 95 S.Ct. 1437].)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Due process requires that before one, as here, is disciplined by deprival or abridgment of the right to engage in his business or profession, he be given reasonable notice of the charges against him, notice of the time and place of a hearing, and thereafter a fair hearing on the charges. <em>(Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 19 Cal. 3d 294, 307-309 [138 Cal.Rptr. 53, 562 P.2d 1302]; <em>Endler </em>v. <em>Schutzbank </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 162, 178-180 [65 Cal.Rptr. 297, 436 P.2d 297]; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Constitutional Law, \u00a7 299, pp. 3588-3590.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Dr. Fort makes no contention that either of the hearing tribunals permitted by law in his case, was calculated to, or would, deny him the right of due process. We are advised of no authority, and we find none, acknowledging a due process right, in one so situated, to participate in the selection of a hearing tribunal, when such selection is reposed by law in an administrative agency. The record before us establishes, according to the above-noted criteria, that Dr. Fort was extended his full measure of due process in respect of the administrative proceeding conducted by the Board. He was constitutionally entitled to no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">We have found no merit in Dr. Fort\u2019s argument that the discipline imposed upon him did not have a \u201crational connection with [his] fitness or capacity to practice his profession,\u201d as is constitutionally required by <em>Schware </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners </em>(1957) 353 U.S. 232, 239 [1 L.Ed.2d 796, 801-802, 77 S.Ct. 752, 64 A.L.R.2d 288]. A physician\u2019s \u201cknowing\u201d assistance to others in making or signing a document <em>related to the practice of medicine </em>\u201cwhich falsely represents the existence or nonexistence of a state of facts\u201d manifestly has a \u201crational connection\u201d with such \u201cfitness or capacity.\u201d And we find invalid Dr. Fort\u2019s argument that the relevant statutes, and the \u201caccusation,\u201d did not \u201cgive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>notice that he could be found liable on the reconstructed concept of unprofessional conduct employed by [the Board] in this case,\u201d or that the subject statutes were somehow fatally overbroad or vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The judgment of the superior court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Racanelli, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b38-6\">NEWSOM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">I am entirely at a loss to understand how one can be penalized for furthering a fraudulent scheme in the absence of any showing whatever of knowledge or evil intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In fact, express findings of the respondent board negate the existence of any such mens rea, stress that Dr. Fort acted \u201caltruistically,\u201d and establish that he authorized use of his name only for a \u201clawful\u201d purpose and in a \u201clegal\u201d manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Contrary to popular opinion and the careless decisions of a number of appellate courts, no absolute liability attaches to the commission of acts which, like those at issue here, are <em>mala prohibitam </em>and not <em>mala in se. (Morissette </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1952) 342 U.S. 246 [96 L.Ed. 288, 72 S.Ct. 240]): evil intent cannot be inferred, but must be proved. It was not proved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Observing no evidence, let alone substantial evidence, of any wrongdoing by Dr. Fort, I would reverse the decision of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">I will add that, in light of the board\u2019s findings of Dr. Fort\u2019s innocent intent and professional competency, the penalties imposed upon him seem to me unjust, gratuitous and irrelevant. Particularly inapposite is an order that the time Dr. Fort spends outside California will not be applied \u201cto the reduction of this probationary period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">Who is the craftsman of such decrees?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 22, 1982. Newsom, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 15, 1982. Bird, C. J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
