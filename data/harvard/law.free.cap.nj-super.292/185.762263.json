She described the robber as a black male, about 200 pounds and six feet tall, with a mustache and close-cropped hair, wearing a dark stadium coat and a dark shirt. The robber said, \u201cYou have a family. I have a family. So you understand.\u201d He then patted his waist in a manner described and demonstrated to the jury by the victim, saying, \u201cI have a gun here.\u201d He demanded money and the cashier gave him the contents of the cash drawer. A customer who entered the store saw the robber as he was leaving. Upon being told that the man \u201ctook all the money,\u201d the customer looked out the window and observed him enter an older model car, then drive out of the lot with headlights off.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Defendant was apprehended about two hours after the robbery based upon the description that the victim furnished to police. The capture occurred after defendant stopped at a Tenafly gas station, asking for directions to Hillsdale and complaining of car trouble. He aroused suspicions sufficient for the owner\u2019s brother, Christopher Reilly, to request that a police officer come to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Reilly volunteered to lead defendant to Hillsdale, but the officer decided to follow, noting that defendant was driving without headlights. The officer stopped defendant\u2019s ear, and noticed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>eating Doritos. As defendant could not produce a license or registration, the officer returned to the patrol car to check the vehicle registration. Recalling a previous radio transmission about the 7-Eleven robbery, he also asked for a description of the perpetrator, which matched that of the defendant. Defendant was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Later that morning, he was identified by the cashier-victim from a photographic array prepared by police. While at the police station, she inadvertently entered a room where defendant was being detained. After defendant saw her, he volunteered to an officer, \u201cNow I\u2019m in real trouble ... [n]ow she can identify me,\u201d a statement that confirmed that he knew who the cashier was.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">When apprehended, defendant possessed $597 in small denominations, among which were fifty-four one-dollar bills and forty-six five-dollar bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\n<em>The First-Degree Robbery Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Defendant urges that, even if he was found guilty of robbery, his motion to dismiss the charge of first-degree robbery was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 provides in pertinent part: \u201cRobbery is a crime of the second degree, except that it is a crime of the first degree if in the course of committing the theft the actor ... is armed with, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Shortly before the decision in <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 445 A.2d 399 (1982), the Legislature amended the definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-l(c) to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">\u201cDeadly weapon\u201d means any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, whether animate or inanimate, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury or which in the manner it is fashioned would lead the victim reasonably to believe it to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">As explained by the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-14\">We think it obvious that the Legislature\u2019s initiative in this regard indicated its desire to broaden the definition previously existing for the term \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Of course, the Legislature has the power, now exercised through the recent amendment to <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:ll-l(c) ... to provide the same sanction for a robbery committed by simulating the use of a weapon as for one perpetrated with an actual firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\"><em>[Butler, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 229 n. 3, 231 n. 4, 445 A.2d 399.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Later, in <em>State v. Hutson, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>222, 526 A.2d 687 (1987), the Court recognized that the statutory definition of \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d would be satisfied if the defendant (1) possessed a tangible object <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cdevice, instrument, material or substance\u201d), and (2) it was reasonable for the victim to believe it to be capable of causing serious bodily harm or death. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 526 A.2d 687. The evidence in <em>Hutson </em>did not provide the basis for such a reasonable impression (\u201cthere was simply no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the [rolled] newspaper was fashioned or held in such a manner as to create <em>any </em>impression on the victim\u201d), even though one of the robbers said he had a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 228, 526 A.2d 687. The Court recognized, however, that unlike the statute it considered in <em>Butler, </em>under the amended statute a first-degree robbery charge can be sustained even if a real gun is not employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">This was again emphasized in <em>State v. LaFrance, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>583, 569 A.2d 1308 (1990). There, a first-degree robbery conviction was sustained where the robber simulated a gun by placing his hand in his pocket under circumstances in which it was reasonable to believe that he had a concealed gun. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 569 A.2d 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Similarly here, it was reasonable for the cashier to accept defendant\u2019s simulation of possession of a gun by patting his waist, covered by a loose fitting stadium coat, proclaiming \u201cI have a gun here,\u201d as he demanded the money in the cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The jury was carefully charged on the issue, both in the formal charge, and in response to several jury questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Answering one jury question, the judge instructed the jury, in part, that in order to find defendant guilty of a first-degree robbery,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the Defendant must use a firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, and the manner in which that item is fashioned must lead the victim reasonably] to believe it capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">The victim need not see the device or instrument so long as there is some device used by the defendant that is fashioned to create in the victim the reasonable sensory impression that the object is capable of causing serious harm or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The record discloses that the victim testified and indicated by physical demonstration what the defendant <em>did </em>when he said he had a gun and asked for the money. On cross examination, the victim testified that defendant patted his waist, and also that \u201che put his hand in and patted his waist.\u201d Then she answered the judge\u2019s question, \u201cDid you say he put his hand in?\u201d, saying, \u201cNo. He patted. Like this. (Witness Indicates.).\u201d Then, in answer to the judge\u2019s question, \u201cWas it on the outside of his jacket?\u201d, she answered, \u201cNo. It\u2019s like the jacket was opened that night and he just patted it like this. (Witness Indicates.).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In summation, the prosecutor argued to the jury that \u201cthe object this man used was this coat, coupled with his hand underneath it by saying I have a weapon. I have a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">It was objectively reasonable for the victim to have believed defendant\u2019s simulation of a concealed gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">We note further that the judge also charged the jury that \u201cit is alleged that defendant made certain oral statements. It is your function to decide whether or not any of those statements were actually made by the Defendant and if made whether such statement or any portion thereof is credible.\u201d He charged further that the jury could take into consideration circumstances and facts surrounding the giving of the statement in determining whether defendant\u2019s statement was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">This charge points up a second dimension of defendant\u2019s statement that he had a gun. While not critical to our previous analysis, we think that statement could properly have been received not only to show that the victim reasonably believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>defendant\u2019s simulation, but, under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for its truth as well. While no gun was recovered, we see no reason why the jury could not have accepted defendant\u2019s entirely unrebutted statement at face value if they believed it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>The Gilmore Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Defendant, who is black, argues that the State\u2019s exercise of one of its peremptory challenges to excuse the only remaining black juror in the venire violated his rights to equal protection of the law and to a fair and impartial trial as set forth in <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986). The prosecutor had previously used about seven peremptory challenges,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> excluding only white jurors. Several other black jurors had been excused by the judge for various reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Citing <em>United States v. Clemons, </em>843 <em>F.2d </em>741 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>835, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>97, 102 L.Ed.2,d 73 (1988), defendant says that a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination was made out because one hundred percent of the black venire persons were excluded by the State. We question defendant\u2019s broad interpretation of the <em>Clemons </em>holding, as the case cited in <em>Clemons </em>respecting exclusion of a single black juror did not discuss <em>prima facie </em>showings, but merely confirmed that exclusion of even one black juror <em>for a racial reason </em>constitutes an equal protection violation. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>817 <em>F.2d </em>1538, 1541 (11th Cir.1987), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>cert. dismissed, 487 U.S. </em>1265, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>28, 101 L.Ed.2d 979 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The jury selection circumstances in this case are similar to those in <em>State v. Bey, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>557, 584, 610 A.2d 814 (1992), in which six of seven black venire persons had been excused for cause, and the State exercised a peremptory challenge excusing the remaining black person. The prosecutor had used five peremptory challenges in total, four to excuse persons who were not black. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 610 A.2d 814. No <em>prima facie </em>showing of discrimination was found in <em>Bey, </em>and we find none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We have, nonetheless, considered the reasons provided by the prosecutor for excusing the black juror. The trial judge had refused a specific request to ask the juror about his disability, the nature of which apparently was, and is, not clear. The judge thought that the juror\u2019s negative answer to a general question posed to all jurors, \u201cDo you have any physical impairment which would prevent you from serving as a juror in this case?\u201d, was sufficient. The prosecutor reasonably could have declined to gamble on that subjective negative answer without the desired amplification. Moreover, the prosecutor also articulated his concern that the juror had avoided making eye-contact with him during the <em>voir dire, </em>a frequent indicator of prospective adverse reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">As in <em>Bey, </em>the requisite <em>prima, facie </em>showing of discrimination was here lacking. In any event, a reasonable non-diseriminatory basis for the challenge was established. <em>See Gilmore, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 538-39, 511 A.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>The Remaining Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The remaining issues raised by defendant require little comment. As suggested by counsel\u2019s failure to object, the omission of a specific jury instruction on identification evidently was not deemed significant in the context of the trial. <em>See State v. Macon, 57 N.J. </em>325, 333, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). Absent an error clearly capable of producing an unjust result, we do not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>arguments directed to the jury charge unless objections are made before the jury retires. <em>R. </em>1:7-2; <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We have examined the array of six photographs from which defendant\u2019s picture was identified by the victim eight hours after the robbery. It was not unduly suggestive, and surely not such as to create a \u201c\u2018substantive likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u2019 \u201d <em>See State v. Madison, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>223, 232, 536 A.2d 254 (1988) (quoting <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>377, 384, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247,1253 (1968)). Moreover, much like in <em>State v. Salaam, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 69-72, 541 A.2d 1075 (App.Div.1988), the circumstantial and direct evidence was strongly corroborative of defendant\u2019s guilt, if not overwhelming. There was no plain error in failing to make a <em>sua sponte </em>identification charge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">As to the sentence, a presumptive term of fifteen years was imposed based upon aggravating factors appropriately balanced by the sentencing judge against the likelihood that defendant was not armed and did not intend serious harm. The aggravating factors included a substantial history of arrests and convictions, a prior robbery conviction among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Our judicial conscience is not shocked by imposition of the presumptive term of imprisonment. However, we must remand for the limited purpose of modifying the sentence to delete the VCCB and Safe Neighborhood Service Fund assessments improperly imposed under the merged theft count.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The judgment of conviction is in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-16\"> As the theft offense was merged into the robbery for sentencing purposes, no separate penalties should have been attributed to that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">The following statements are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">(b) Statement by party-opponent. A statement offered against a party which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">(1) the party's own statement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">In a criminal proceeding, the admissibility of a defendant's statement which is offered against the defendant is subject to Rule 104(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">No <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(c) proceeding was here required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-14\"> Seven was the figure apparently accepted by the court. The precise count appears uncertain as we read the record, but it was no less than five.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b228-9\">KLEINER, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AiY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Although I concur with the majority in its disposition of the points of error raised by defendant referencing <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986), and those issues raised concerning the photographic array provided to the victim eight hours after the robbery, I respectfully conclude that the majority has misconstrued <em>State v. Hutson, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>222, 526 A.2d 687 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>(1987). I therefore dissent. I would, as in <em>Hutson, </em>vacate defendant\u2019s conviction for armed robbery and remand to the Law Division for correction of the judgment of conviction to a second-degree robbery and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Simply stated, a pronouncement by a robber that he is armed, unaccompanied by the display of any object that could reasonably be mistaken by the victim for a deadly weapon, is not sufficient to support a conviction of armed robbery in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The record here is vague. As noted by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">On cross examination, the victim testified that defendant patted his waist, and also that \u201che put his hand in and patted his waist.\u201d Then she answered the judge\u2019s question, \u201cdid you say he put his hand in?\u201d, saying, \u201cNo. He patted. Like this. (Witness Indicates.).\u201d Then, in answer to the judge\u2019s question, \u201cWas it on the outside of his jacket?\u201d, she answered, \u201cNo. It\u2019s like the jacket was opened that night and he just patted it like this. (Witness Indicates.).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Unfortunately, the trial judge failed to specifically articulate the exact movements of the victim that demonstrated to the jury the alleged action of defendant. We are left to guess whether defendant touched his waist underneath his opened coat or touched the outer area of his coat at the waist.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Even had the victim\u2019s description been more fully described in the record, and assuming that the victim\u2019s description conveys the concept that defendant patted his waistline under an opened coat, that description failed to include any bulge at the waistline or any other device that the victim reasonably could have concluded was a weapon. There exists no evidence that the victim perceived a \u201cdevice, instrument, material or substance,\u201d as required by the statutory definition of deadly weapon under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-lc.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Hutson, \u201cN.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-lc requires (a) that the victim have a subjective belief that the device or instrument be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, <em>and </em>(b) that subjective belief be a reasonable one under the circumstances.\u201d 107 <em>N.J. </em>at 227, 526 A.2d 687 (emphasis supplied). Although my colleagues conclude, \u201cIt was objectively reasonable for the victim to have believed defendant\u2019s simulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>of a concealed gun,\u201d the victim herself never articulated that perception. The only reference to the victim\u2019s belief was the prosecutor\u2019s argument in summation, \u201cthe object this man used was this coat, coupled with his hand underneath it by saying I have a gun.\u201d The absence of a \u201cdevice, instrument, material or substance,\u201d required by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-1, warrants a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. The vague description of defendant\u2019s hand movement may not be substituted for the necessary tangible object. <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">My colleagues have also buttressed their decision to affirm by referencing defendant\u2019s alleged statement to the victim as a truthful declaration under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b). Yet my colleagues ignore the similar statement of the defendant in <em>Hutson. Id. </em>at 224, 526 A.2d 687. The statement by the passenger in <em>Hutson </em>that he had a gun, which the other passenger described as a Magnum, was insufficient to convict the defendant even though the driver-victim testified, \u201c[a]t this time I look in the back, they had a little newspaper and I started driving fast with no stop.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If the newspaper in <em>Hutson </em>was insufficient to sustain a conviction of armed robbery, I must conclude that patting one\u2019s waistline underneath an opened coat in the absence of any bulge is also insufficient to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction. Defendant is guilty of robbery in the second degree. His conviction for first-degree armed robbery cannot be sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
