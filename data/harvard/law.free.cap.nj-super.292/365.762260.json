We hold that the costs of remediation of groundwater pollution is covered and may not be denied under the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion of the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Defendant, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (Armstrong), was a prior owner of a manufacturing site determined to have been contaminated \u2014 possibly through defendant\u2019s activities \u2014 and subject to various environmental cleanup requirements. In addition to the soil on the site, its groundwater was also contaminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">For a period of time defendant was insured through CGL policies issued by plaintiff, Reliance Insurance Company (Reliance), that incorporated exclusions for damage to property \u201cowned, occupied by or used by\u201d or \u201cpremises alienated by\u201d the insured. Long after, when defendant notified plaintiff it was being sued by a site transferee for indemnification for the costs of environmental cleanup, plaintiff denied coverage and initiated this action for a declaration of policy coverage. The Law Division concluded that because there was no evidence that any groundwater pollution had harmed a third-party, the \u201cowned property\u201d and \u201calienated property\u201d exclusions would bar coverage. The court also concluded that because defendant suffered no prejudice from plaintiffs delay in denying coverage, plaintiff was not estopped from asserting the exclusions as a bar to coverage. Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cross-appeal relates to the court\u2019s ruling that any spills that occurred were \u201caccidents\u201d under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Plaintiff instituted this action on November 16, 1990, seeking a declaration that pending claims for property damage against Armstrong, in a lawsuit Armstrong ultimately settled, involving claims for environmental contamination created by its former manufacturing plant were not covered under policies plaintiffs predecessor had issued. Defendant counterclaimed, alleging breach of contract and requesting a declaration of coverage. On July 17, 1992, defendant was granted partial summary judgment, the court ruled that the policy language \u201ccaused by accident\u201d did not contain a temporal limitation. Although the court denied without prejudice the cross-motions regarding the policy exclusions, it ruled that remediation expenses incurred to prevent the immediate threat of off-site contamination were not excluded from coverage. <em>Reliance Ins.

Protec. v. Signo Trading Int\u2019l., Inc., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 612 A.2d 932 (1992) involving \u201cowned property\u201d exclusions as they related to environmental contamination of a party\u2019s site, Reliance moved for reconsideration. In its decision reported as <em>Reliance Ins. Co. v. Armstrong World Indus., supra, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 162-64, 625 A.2d 601, the court concluded that the policy exclusions barred coverage. These cross appeals followed. We have calendared back-to-back these appeals and seven others which we decide today. <em>Adron, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 679 A.2d 160 (App.Div.1996); <em>Kentopp v.

Co., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 679 A.2d 174 (App.Div.1996). We have permitted the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the New Jersey State League of Municipalities (League of Municipalities), Insurance Environmental Litigation Association (Insurance Environmental), and various private insured corporations (insureds) to participate in the appeals as <em>amicus curiae. </em>The full exposition of the issues through the arguments provided by all participating has been invaluable to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Defendant\u2019s property, a glass manufacturing plant in Millville, had been in use since the 1800s, and was acquired by defendant in 1938. 259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 542, 614 A.2d 642. Over the years, before and after defendant acquired it, areas of the site were used as dumping grounds for waste from the manufacturing process, including hazardous and petroleum substances. In 1969, defendant sold the property to the Kerr Glass Manufacturing Corporation (Kerr) under a contract that required defendant to indemnify Kerr from damages related to defendant\u2019s prior operations. <em>Id. </em>at 542 \u2014 43, 614 A.2d 642. In 1983 Kerr sold a portion of the site to American National Can Company (ANCC). <em>Id. </em>at 543, 614 A.2d 642. In 1985, ANCC transferred the property to Triangle Acquisition Corporation (Triangle). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In anticipation of the transfer to Triangle, ANCC instituted an environmental investigation pursuant to the terms of the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (ECRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lK-6 to - 13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>In June 1985, ANCC entered into an administrative consent order with DEP. ANCC alleged that two portions of the site indicated soil and groundwater pollution. A fourteen-acre area in the northeast corner of the site had been used for \u201cwidespread\u201d dumping at least until the late 1960s, and sampling of the area\u2019s soil and the sediment in a tributary contiguous to the area indicated the presence of such contaminants as total petrole<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>um hydrocarbons (TPHCs), arsenic, lead and mercury. Farther, these contaminants were in the groundwater beneath that area. It was not known whether soil contaminants present in other areas of landfill had entered the groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Environ Corporation\u2019s (Environ) 1987 ECRA Sampling Plan set forth specific findings of pollutants in two particular areas. The report noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">The ground water sample [from one of the two shallow monitoring wells] was also analyzed for [contaminants]. Only arsenic was present at concentrations above ISEE guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">The ground water sample from [the other shallow monitoring well] was analyzed [for contaminants], PAHs and PPMs were not detected____ Petroleum hydrocarbons were present, but at concentrations below the ISEE recommended cleanup guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">The ground water sample from [the one deep monitoring well] was analyzed for [contaminants]. Most of the TPHCs and PP+40 compounds were not detected, and of those that were, all were present at concentrations below the ISEE recommended cleanup guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">A relatively small and low-level arsenic plume is present in the western corner of AEC 1. At this time, it is premature to develop any remedial system for this arsenic contamination. ENVIRON proposes to develop an appropriate remedial system, if necessary, or establish alternate concentration levels as cleanup levels after evaluating the effects of this plume on off-site environments (e.g., the Maurice River)____ Previous river sediment sampling indicated that contamination currently exists from upstream of the facility. It is likely that arsenic levels in the Maurice River could be high, given the various industrial activities that have occurred at upgradient locations in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">Arsenic, in general, has an extremely high distribution coefficient that contributes to a highly attenuated migration of arsenic in ground water. This means that the arsenic plume cannot be readily removed from the aquifer because the desorption or dissolution rate of arsenic constituents from the aquifer material to ground water is extremely slow ... [and], migration of the arsenic plume will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>extremely slow. Therefore a ground water remedial plan is not proposed at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The report noted as to a second area that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">[IJt is premature to develop a remedial system for the arsenic contamination in the area of the former drainage ditch. An appropriate remedial approach, if needed, or alternate concentration levels will be developed after further investigation of the interaction of ground water and surface water and evaluation of the effects of this arsenic plume on the Maurice River. Currently, the arsenic concentration in the downgradient well ... is well below the action level for arsenic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">As part of its overall conclusions as to groundwater contamination, the report said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Ground water sampling results identify two areas (AECs 5 and 8) where VOCs have been detected at elevated levels and two areas (AECs 1 and 46) where arsenic has been detected above the drinking water standard of 50 ppb. Although concentrations of these constituents have been detected above the informal ECRA action levels and/or state MCLs, alternate concentration levels will likely be used to make a final determination of the need for ground water cleanup. To establish alternate concentration levels, it will first be necessary to understand the interaction of ground water and the Maurice River.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">In January 1989, DEP conditionally approved ANCC\u2019s sampling-plan, one of the conditions of which was further groundwater sampling. In January 1990, DEP notified ANCC that its cleanup plan was unapproved because \u201cthe ground water investigation has not been completed and all sources of contamination have not been delineated.\u201d On March 1,1990, ANCC set forth additional remediation plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Environ continued testing and periodically reporting on ongoing soil sampling. In its June 1992 progress report, Environ reported that as of May 1992 various monitoring wells in AEC 1 and AEC 46 still tested positive for arsenic.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Following ANCC\u2019s environmental investigation, in 1989 it filed a Federal action against Kerr seeking contribution, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 9607(a), for the costs of pollution remediation. 259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 543, 614 A.2d 642. Kerr then filed a third-party complaint against Armstrong. <em>Ibid. </em>Armstrong received process on April 3, 1989, and on April 13, 1989, it wrote plaintiff informing it of the lawsuit and stating it believed plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>and its other carriers were obligated to defend it. Defendant enclosed copies of the third-party complaint, informed plaintiff of the attorney it had initially contacted for defense, and requested plaintiff contact its legal department with any objections. It also advised plaintiff to \u201ccoordinate ... the defense of this lawsuit\u201d with Armstrong\u2019s attorney. On June 28, 1989, plaintiff responded that it had received the third-party complaint and that it would \u201cnotify [defendant] within a reasonable time of [its] decision in this matter.\u201d Plaintiff reserved its rights under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">By February 1990, defendant had, over the course of the federal litigation, incurred almost $650,000 in defense fees. Between April 1989 and November 1990, defendant\u2019s Associate General Counsel of Legal Affairs and its General Manager of Insurance allegedly spoke to plaintiffs claims representatives many times, without plaintiff seeking to disclaim liability under the policies. Defendant\u2019s Insurance Department\u2019s General Manager had a similar experience. Defendant contends that on November 20, 1990, after plaintiff filed the complaint in this matter, it first learned plaintiff was disclaiming coverage. On March 12, 1991, defendant settled the federal lawsuit having spent more than $1 million defending the action. The terms of the settlement were confidential and the agreement was filed under seal. 259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 544 n. 2, 614 A.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Between 1942 and 1952 Reliance's predecessor, Standard Accident Insurance Company, issued annual CGL policies to defendant. 259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 544, 614 A.2d 642. Each policy described coverage in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">Coverage C \u2014 Property Damage Liability ... [The insurer agrees t]o pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including loss of use thereof, caused by accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">[259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548, 614 A.2d 642.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The scope of coverage was limited by specific exclusions, in particular the \u201cowned-property\u201d and contractual-liability exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">This policy does not apply ... to injury to or destruction of (1) property owned, occupied by or used by or rented to the insured, or (2) except with respect to the liability under sidetrack agreements and the use of elevators or escalators, property in the care, custody or control of the insured; or (3) any goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed or [premises alienated] by the name insured or work completed by or for the name insured, out of which the accident arises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">This policy does not apply ... to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement except a contract as defined herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\n<em>[/bid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Within the \u201cConditions\u201d section of the policy, the term \u201ccontract\u201d was defined as follows: \u201cA warranty of goods or products or, if in writing, a lease of premises, easement agreement, agreement required by municipal ordinance, sidetrack agreement, or elevator or escalator maintenance agreement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The terms \u201cproperty,\u201d \u201caccident,\u201d and the phrase \u201call sums which the insured shall become obligated to pay as damages\u201d were not defined. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Defendant argues that plaintiff lost the right to rely upon any coverage exclusions because it failed to make a timely coverage determination and to communicate that decision to defendant in a reasonable manner. In determining whether an insurer should be estopped from asserting exclusion defenses under policies because of prejudice to the insured, the test is whether the insurer\u2019s acts or omissions \u201cconstituted a material encroachment upon the rights of an insured to protect itself by handling the claim directly and independently of the insurer.\u201d <em>Griggs v. Bertram, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>347, 359, 443 A.2d 163 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Prejudice justifying an estoppel against the insurer will be presumed where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>there has been a long lapse of time without any indication by the insurance carrier of a loss or rejection of coverage, during which the insured justifiably expects to be protected by the carrier and cannot, except at the risk of forfeiting coverage, act for itself under the policy [because] ... there is a realistic restraint upon the insured\u2019s contractual freedom of action and a significant incursion upon its legitimate, protectable interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 362, 443 A.2d 163.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The court here concluded that plaintiff took no action to prejudice defendant. 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 156, 625 A.2d 601. We agree. Plaintiff did not investigate the site or \u201cassume the defense\u201d of the insured. Defendant engaged counsel on its own behalf before it received plaintiffs June 28, 1989, acknowledgement letter. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 625 A.2d 601. There is no indication that plaintiff caused defendant to suffer any inability to direct its own defense and investigate the matter. Plaintiffs June 28, 1989, letter to defendant said: \u201cWe are presently reviewing our obligation to [you]. We will notify you within a reasonable time of our decision in this matter.\u201d 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 155, 625 A.2d 601. This letter did not imply that plaintiff believed it had a duty to defendant or that plaintiff was acting for or would defend defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Therefore, despite the significant time interval, plaintiffs failure to more timely notify defendant of its decision as to the applicability of the policy exclusions may only act as an estoppel if in fact defendant can show actual prejudice. <em>See Miller v. Board of Trustees of Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 477, 432 A.2d 560 (App.Div.) (prejudice an element of estoppel), <em>certif. denied, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>502, 443 A.2d 714 (1981). Inasmuch as defendant had itself secured the services of private counsel and ultimately reached a settlement, we see no evidence that plaintiffs actions prejudiced defendant in the settled litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Defendant, however, asserts that the Federal action did not raise the possible bar of the policy exclusions, and as a result it \u201cdid not try even to develop\u201d any facts in that action about off-site migration of pollution, the absence of which proof ultimately ended in the decision in this case that coverage was precluded under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u201cowned property\u201d exclusion. Defendant asserts it was thereby prejudiced. Any lack of proof regarding those aspects of the case in our view cannot properly be attributed to an insurer\u2019s failure to defend. If such proofs were necessary for defendant to prevail on the coverage issue, it was defendant\u2019s obligation to discover the facts establishing its claim of coverage. In any event, our ruling in this appeal regarding groundwater pollution coverage renders that aspect of the alleged prejudice moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Law Division judge noted that although DEP had made allegations against defendant\u2019s transferee claiming groundwater pollution, \u201cthere is no evidence presented that groundwater pollution has affected any <em>actual </em>third party adjacent property claimant.\u201d 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 160, 625 <em>A.2d </em>601. Thus, based on <em>State v. Signo, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 64, 612 A.2d 932, holding that CGL policies do not provide coverage for the mere threat of third-party damage where there has been no injury, the judge concluded that the mere possibility of off-site migration of pollution would not be sufficient to invoke coverage. 265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 160-61, 625 A.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The burden is on the insured to bring the claim within the basic terms of the policy. <em>Diamond Shamrock Chems. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 216, 609 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>481, 634 A.2d 528 (1993). The carrier, however, bears the burden of establishing that any matter falls within the exclusionary provisions of the policy. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>18, 26, 483 A.2d 402 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Although plaintiff contests the cause and extent of groundwater pollution at the site, it acknowledges that \u201cthere is some evidence here that the groundwater at the ... [site] has been contaminated.\u201d Thus, the question is whether the groundwater beneath defendant\u2019s site is property <em>of the </em>insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In 1992, our Supreme Court held that the typical CGL policy did not cover the costs of preventing future environmental damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>to a third party unless those costs result from \u201cpreventfing] imminent or immediate future damage when a present injury has already been demonstrated.\u201d <em>State v. Signo, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 64, 612 A.2d 932. A year later the Court in <em>Morton Int\u2019l v. General Acc. Ins. Co. of Am., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>1, 27, 629 A.2d 831 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2764, 129 L.Ed.2d 878 (1994), decided that \u201cenvironmental-response costs and remediation expenses\u201d were \u201cdamages\u201d under the terms of the CGL policies before it. The Court referred approvingly to Justice O\u2019Hern\u2019s dissent in <em>Signo, supra, </em>where he sought to apply a \u201ccommon man\u2019s\u201d approach to the insurance policy definition of \u201cdamages.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Between 1987 and 1992, United States District Court Judge Brotman twice applied New Jersey law in the area of insurance coverage for groundwater pollution. <em>Gloucester Tp. v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>668 <em>F.Supp. </em>394 (D.N.J.1987); <em>Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>788 <em>F.Supp. </em>846 (D.N.J. 1992). In the earlier of the two cases, <em>Gloucester Tp., supra, </em>he was deciding insurance coverage issues involving the expenses of cleanup that the Township was incurring in connection with a court-ordered closure of its landfill. 668 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 395-96. The judge recognized in that case, which involved present and continuing damage to \u201cgroundwater both on and offsite,\u201d that \u201cthe reality of toxic dump clean-up and the clean-up at issue in the case at bar requires repairs and preventive measures to environmental systems such as groundwater which do not follow property boundaries, but rather \u2018flow\u2019 both on the property of the insured and third party neighbors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. Citing an unpublished decision of this court in which we \u201cfound that the underlying claim of DEP did state a colorable claim under parens patriae for damages to the natural resources of the state,\u201d he said that a legal cause of action exists to protect these resources. <em>Id. </em>at 398. He thus concluded that the costs of cleanup and closure constituted \u201cdamages\u201d under the subject CGL policies. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Later, in <em>Chemical Leaman, supra, </em>Judge Brotman was again interpreting insurance policy exclusions in a pollution matter, where the plaintiff, presented with cleanup costs under Federal law for remediating contamination of ground and surface water \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of its plant, sought insurance coverage under its CGL policies. 788 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 848-51. The judge again concluded that the insured\u2019s \u201ccleanup costs which it is obligated to pay pursuant to [the Federal law] with respect to ground and surface water contamination in the vicinity of,\u201d but not at its plant, constituted compensable \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the relevant provisions of the CGL policies. <em>Id. </em>at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We have heretofore expressly addressed the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion as it relates to an insured\u2019s pollution of groundwater beneath the insured\u2019s site. <em>Morrone v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 419-20, 662 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1995). In <em>Morrone, </em>the insurer appealed a grant of summary judgment directing it to provide the insured a defense under several occurrence-based \u201cgarage\u201d policies. 283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 413-14, 662 A.2d 562. The insured had sold the property, and thereafter purchasers sued her alleging gasoline leaks that caused both soil and groundwater contamination. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 662 A.2d 562. One of the insurer\u2019s defenses was that the exclusion barring coverage did not extend to \u201cproperty damage to property owned ... by the insured. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416-17, 662 A.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>Morrone, </em>we considered the conflicting trial court decisions in <em>Reliance, supra, </em>and <em>UMC Stamford, Inc. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 647 A.2d 182 (Law Div.1994). <em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 662 A.2d 562. After addressing the reasoning of each, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">These eases raise potentially far-ranging concepts of ownership of groundwater beneath a person\u2019s land. They are each well-reasoned; one is not clearly more cogent than the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 419, 662 A.2d 562.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">We recognized groundwater\u2019s \u201cunique\u201d qualities, and ultimately concluded that \u201cgroundwater does not clearly fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>category of \u2018owned property\u2019 for the purposes of the exclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 662 A.2d 562. Because exclusionary clauses must be narrowly read and ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the insured, <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992), we held that the insurer was obligated to defend groundwater damage claims, despite the policy\u2019s owned property exclusion. <em>See also, Pittston Co. v. Allianz Ins. Co., </em>905 <em>F.Supp. </em>1279 (D.N.J., 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We see no need to revisit the issue or to rehash the various policy arguments for and against holdings finding coverage and exclusion. They have, as we noted, been well argued before us. For varying reasons, the majority of jurisdictions to have considered the ownership-of-groundwater issue have concluded that groundwater below real property does not \u201cbelong\u201d to the property owner. <em>See </em>Carol Crocea, Annotation, <em>Liability Insurance Coverage For Violations of Antipollution Laws, </em>87 <em>A.L.R. </em>4th 444, 536-39 (1991). Some courts have expressly concluded, largely based on environmental statutes not unlike New Jersey\u2019s, that groundwater is a public resource belonging to the government and is thus \u201cthird party\u201d property for purposes of \u201cowned property\u201d exclusions in insurance policies. <em>See Intel Corp. v.

Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 <em>Md. </em>758, 625 A.2d 1021, 1035-36 (1993). In <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, </em>the Maryland Supreme Court considered whether the State possessed the requisite property interest in groundwater contaminated by environmental pollution to qualify the groundwater as \u201cthird-party property\u201d for purposes of the insured\u2019s CGL policy. <em>Id., </em>625 A.2d at 1024-25. After noting that \u201cthe State is said to be the owner of the navigable waters within its boundaries,\u201d the court explained that such \u201cownership\u201d was not absolute but as a \u201cquasi trustee for the public benefit and to support the rights of navigation and fishery to which the entire public are entitled therein.\u201d <em>Id., </em>625 A.2d at 1033. With respect to \u201csubterranean waters,\u201d the court stated that it had previously \u201csuggested a preference for\u201d the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d which held that \u201cthe landowner is limited to a reasonable exercise of the owner\u2019s proprietary right in the water, i.e., such an exercise as may be reasonably necessary for some useful or beneficial purpose, before obstructing, diverting or removing percolating water to the injury of a neighbor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>625 A.2d at 1034. But the court concluded that \u201ccommon-law principles of groundwater were created to adjudicate disputes between neighboring property owners who claimed a right to use\u201d the groundwater, and were thus of limited help in deciding the question of state ownership of groundwater. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Turning its attention to particular enactments, the court noted that \u201c[n]either the Maryland Constitution nor any statute proclaims the State to be the owner <em>of </em>waters within its borders.\u201d <em>Ibid </em>Nevertheless, it noted the \u201cmany provisions\u201d in state statutes where the legislature had included groundwater within the definition of \u201cwaters of the State\u201d and \u201cwaters of this State,\u201d but distinguished such statutes as pertaining to \u201cthe State\u2019s regulatory maintenance of clean water.\u201d <em>Ibid </em>After noting that nothing in its review of any legislative history indicated that \u201cthe legislature ascribed ownership of groundwater to the State,\u201d it concluded that the \u201clegislative pronouncements\u201d of record merely demonstrated that the state \u201chas committed itself to regulatory oversight of the groundwaters of Maryland to benefit ... citizens.\u201d <em>Ibid </em>And although in the case before it \u201cthe question of groundwater ownership [arose] in the context of a potentially insurable injury by pollution,\u201d Maryland\u2019s \u201cinterest in groundwater [nonetheless] rests on its power to preserve and regulate.\u201d <em>Id, 625 A.2d </em>at 1036. Thus, it found the State\u2019s power was not a \u201cproperty interest within the contemplation of the insurance policy in dispute.\u201d <em>Ibid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Finally, several courts that have generally concluded that groundwater is \u201cproperty of the state\u201d have also recognized that, under particular circumstances, it might still be considered the insured\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of the \u201cowned property\u201d exclusions. <em>See Shell Oil Co. v. Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., </em>12 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>715, 15 <em>Cal.Rptr </em>2d 815, 844 (1993) (court concluded that although private ownership rights in groundwater might be \u201climited\u201d by California law that stated that all water in the state was the property of the people, there was a question of fact as to whether the groundwater at issue fell within the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d language of the policy\u2019s \u201cowned property\u201d exclusion), <em>reh\u2019g denied and opinion modified on other grounds </em>(February 22, 1993), <em>review denied </em>(May 13, 1993); <em>cf.

(State-ownership is merely expressive \u201cof the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In <em>Morrone, supra, </em>we applied the principle of construing exclusions against the insurer where terms are deemed ambiguous. 283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 420, 662 A.2d 562. We recognize that \u201cin the absence of a specific definition in an insurance policy, the words must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary, plain and usual meaning.\u201d <em>Daus v. Marble, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 251, 636 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1994). The exclusion, however, is for damages to the property of the insured. Although the insured has a property right in the reasonable use of the groundwater, payment is not being sought for damage to or loss of the right to <em>use </em>groundwater. We remain firm in our conclusion that the exclusion should not apply where the damage is to the groundwater itself instead of to the insured\u2019s \u201cproperty\u201d right of reasonable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Our courts adhere to the \u201creasonable intention of the parties\u201d test where \u201cthe phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policyholder cannot make out boundaries of coverage.\u201d <em>Signo Trading, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 62-63, 612 A.2d 932 (quoting <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>233, 246-47, 405 A.2d 788 (1979)). In this case, the absence of the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d could easily confuse the average policyholder as to the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>coverage when attempting to apply the exclusion to the costs related to discovery, monitoring and remediation of polluted groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We must also consider whether the groundwater falls under the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d of the insured exclusion. In New Jersey, the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d exclusion of a CGL policy is not applicable where the damage is \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the property upon which the work is being done by the insured. <em>Condenser Serv. v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 183-84, 155 A.2d 789 (App.Div.1959), <em>certif. denied, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>548,158 A.2d 450 (1960). Moreover, our courts generally view the \u201ccare, custody or control\u201d issue as fact sensitive. <em>See e.g., Elcar Mobile Homes, Inc. v. D.K. Baxter, Inc., </em>66 <em>N.J.Super. </em>478, 491, 169 A.2d 509 (App.Div.1961) (\u201cWe are of the opinion that what constitutes \u2018care, custody, or control\u2019 [under the terms of a policy exclusion] ... depends not only upon whether the property is realty or personalty, but as well upon many other facts, such as the location, size, shape and other characteristics of the property, what the insured is doing to it and how, and the interest in and the relation of the insured and others to it.\u201d) Thus, in <em>Morrone, supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 420, 662 A.2d 562, we noted that groundwater, \u201cother than being a source of potable water ... is certainly not susceptible to the custody or control of a property owner.\u201d We adhere to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We turn to the \u201calienated premises\u201d exclusion which we have held \u201cis designed to extend the [owned property] exclusion to claims by subsequent owners of property previously owned by the insured.\u201d <em>Wickner v. American Reliance Ins. Co., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 567-68, 642 A.2d 1046 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>392, 661 A.2d 1256 (1995). We are satisfied that this exclusion is inapplicable to claims of this nature relating to groundwater. Inasmuch as the owned property exclusion is inapplicable, it cannot be extended by the alienated property exclusion whose purpose is limited to preventing the circumvention of the owned property exclusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Further, since the insured did not own the groundwater, it was not part of the premises alienated by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The policies are contingent in part upon damages being \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d Plaintiff contends that the judge erred in construing those provisions to apply to continuous discharges of pollutants over many years, while effectively ignoring what plaintiff says was an intended temporal limitation upon any event deemed an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In <em>Morton, supra, </em>the Court had to determine the extent of coverage under CGL policies for the owners of a mercury-processing plant who sought reimbursement for costs incurred in defending a DEP action and remediating pollution at the site. 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 6-7, 629 A.2d 831. Justice Stein reviewed the development of CGL policies from accident-based to occurrence-based, stating that the term \u201caccident\u201d in the pre-1966 policies was \u201cgenerally construed ... to encompass ongoing events that inflicted injury over an extended period provided that the injury was unexpected or unintended from the insured\u2019s standpoint.\u201d 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 31, 629 A.2d 831 (citations omitted). And see our opinion in the same case, concluding that the \u201cpre-1966 policy ... left the definition of \u2018accidents\u2019 to the courts which more broadly construed the term.\u201d 266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 336, 629 A.2d 895 (App.Div.1991). <em>Morton </em>involved both pre- and post-1966 policies, and the Supreme Court noted that, with respect to the accident based policy at issue, \u201cthe Appellate Division correctly acknowledged that the trial court had focused improperly on the manner in which the injury had been caused and had erroneously concluded that the policy did not provide coverage for the unexpected result of a deliberate act.\u201d 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 81, 629 A.2d 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Plaintiff asserts that the judge erred in construing \u201caccident\u201d without regard to any temporal element. We disagree. Our Supreme Court noted that the pre-1966 policies were construed generally to encompass ongoing injuries or harmful events over an extended period so long as the injury was neither expected nor intended. <em>Morton, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 31, 629 A.2d 831; <em>Diamond </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Shamrock, supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 199-200, 609 A.2d 440; and <em>Broadwell Realty Srvs. v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 582, 528 A.2d 76 (App.Div.1987), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Morton, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 629 A.2d 831. The Court went on to hold</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">that in environmental-coverage litigation a case-by-case analysis is required in order to determine whether, in the context of all the available evidence, \u201cexceptional circumstances [exist] that objectively establish the insured\u2019s intent to injure\u201d [citation omitted]. Those circumstances include the duration of the discharges, whether the discharges occurred intentionally, negligently or innocently, the quality of the insured\u2019s knowledge eoncer'ning the harmful propensities of the pollutants, whether regulatory authorities attempted to discourage or prevent the insured\u2019s conduct and the existence of subjective knowledge concerning the possibility or likelihood of harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">[134 <em>N.J. </em>at 86-87, 629 A.2d 831.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Court also addressed the standard for pollution-exclusion policies. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 629 A.2d 831. It did not, however, differentiate between the accident-based and occurrence-based policies for purposes of whether the single pre-1966 policy applied to the ongoing pollution at the site, thereby implying that damages sought under an accident-based policy are not automatically excluded simply because they occurred over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We reject plaintiffs assertion that the record indicates defendant in fact understood that the term \u201caccident\u201d had a temporal meaning, inasmuch as the applicable standard is one of the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations rather than its subjective understanding. <em>Meier v. New Jersey Life Ins. Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>597, 617, 503 A.2d 862 (1986). There does not appear to be any question of fact presented as to whether defendant either expected or intended the damages at issue here, as that inquiry was framed by the <em>Morton </em>Court. 134 <em>N.J. </em>at 86-87, 629 A.2d 831. Nonetheless, we do not preclude development of the issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Finally, plaintiff contends that the California Court of Appeals has already addressed this issue between these two parties and concluded that \u201can accident policy covers only unexpected and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>unintended events which are also sudden\u201d (citing <em>Armstrong World Industries, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>26 <em>Cal.</em>Rptr.2d 35, 91 (Cal.App.1993), <em>review granted sub nom. and opinion superceded, In re Asbestos Ins.

Plaintiff has not briefed the subsequent developments in that case, and the opinion to which it cites was subsequently superseded. 27 <em>Cal. Rptr 2d </em>488, 866 P.2d 1311. In any event, California law would not be applicable here. \u201c[T]he construction of a contract will ordinarily be governed by the law of the state in which the contract was made, and this general rule is applicable to policies of insurance.\u201d <em>Keystone Ins.

Signo Trading Intern., Inc., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 612 A.2d 932 (1992), is controlling on us, even though only two <em>of </em>the four-member majority (and two of the dissenters) are now on the Court. Nevertheless, despite its statement with respect to the \u201cowned property exclusion,\u201d that \u201ccourts should resort to the doctrine of reasonable expectations only when \u2018the phrasing of the policy is so confusing that the average policy holder cannot make out the boundaries of coverage,\u2019 \u201d 130 <em>N.J. </em>at 62, 612 A.2d 932 (citation omitted), in that case there was no injury to any property other than the insured\u2019s. <em>Signo </em>involved no evidence of either contaminated groundwater, <em>see </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 65, 612 A.2d 932, or injury to a third party. Furthermore, there was no endeavor \u201cto prevent imminent or immediate future damages when a present injury has already been demonstrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 612 A.2d 932. According to the Court, therefore, \u201cthe policy does not cover the costs of clean-up performed by or on behalf of an insured on its own property when those costs are incurred to alleviate damage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the insured\u2019s own property and not to the property of a third party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 612 A.2d 932. The Court held \u201cthat the effect of the owned property exclusion is to make the policies\u2019 coverage inapplicable in the absence of property damage to third parties .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66-67, 612 A.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In <em>Morrone v. Harleysville Mutual Ins. Co., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>411, 662 A.2d 562 (App.Div.1995), a panel of this court concluded that \u201cground water does not clearly fall within the category of \u2018owned property\u2019 for purposes of the exclusion\u201d because of the general rules concerning construction of insurance policies and exclusions. The court also held that groundwater is \u201cnot susceptible to the custody or control of the property owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 662 A.2d 562. Thus, the panel concluded that a carrier had a duty to defend a former property owner in a groundwater contamination case. But <em>Morrone </em>involved a declaratory judgment action after complaints were filed \u201cagainst plaintiff by subsequent purchasers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414, 662 A.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">I am satisfied that the holding of <em>Morrone </em>is dispositive of the principal issue of whether groundwater is \u201cowned property\u201d for purposes of the policy exclusion and that because groundwater is not \u201cowned property,\u201d its contamination must give rise to \u201cdamages\u201d to some third party. In light thereof <em>Signo </em>is not dispositive, and it is irrelevant whether the insured is sued by a subsequent purchaser, an adjoining property owner or the State, or is required to take remedial action by the Department of Environmental Protection. I would not revisit the issues resolved in <em>Morrone. Cf. Hellwig v. J.F. Rast &amp; Co., </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 254, 521 A.2d 896 (App.Div.1987) (Stern, J.A.D. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">I add only that the question of whether a carrier has an obligation to defend or indemnify under an insurance policy poses a very different issue than whether the insured can be held responsible for losses to a third party or the costs of remediation. That groundwater is not \u201cowned property\u201d in terms of the carrier\u2019s obligation to its insured does not, of course, impact on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>common law and statutory obligations of the insured for groundwater contamination under its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">I join the opinions of the court in this and the related cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
