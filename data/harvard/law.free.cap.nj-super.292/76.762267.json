The prosecutor advised the court that while the witnesses, victims James Barr and Billy Dave Britton, were told by defense counsel that the weapon was a knife, both witnesses would testify that the weapon counsel \u201cshow[ed] them in his office was not the weapon that the defendant used.\u201d The judge denied the motion, reasoning that it was common that \u201cyou get witnesses that bounce back and forth between different sides,\u201d and that if they were reinterviewed there was a \u201cgood chance ... they\u2019d give you another statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Defense counsel then moved for sequestration of the State\u2019s witnesses, and the court ordered all witnesses sequestered. Trial was then commenced. Defendant\u2019s motion to \u201cdismiss\u201d (and for entry of judgment of acquittal) was granted as to counts three and four at the end of defendant\u2019s case. Those counts alleged aggravated assault on L.W. and A.A. Defendant was found guilty of counts five and six, the weapons violations, and on count one, the aggravated assault upon James Barr. The jury found defendant not guilty as to count two, aggravated assault upon Bill Britton.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">After denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, defendant was sentenced to a presumptive seven year term with a mandatory three year parole disqualifier under the Graves Act on count five, and to concurrent terms on the other convictions. Defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>assessed a $150.00 Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty and $225.00 Safe Street penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On this appeal defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">POINT I THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO RELIEVE DEFENDANT\u2019S ATTORNEY AND FAILING TO GRANT A CONTINUANCE OF THE TRIAL SO AS TO PERMIT DEFENDANT TO OBTAIN NEW COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">POINT II THE ATTORNEY FOR THE DEFENDANT PROVIDED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE SUFFICIENT TO CREATE A REASONABLE PROBABILITY THAT HIS INEFFECTIVENESS MATERIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">POINT III THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO PERMIT A WITNESS CALLED BY THE DEFENSE TO TESTIFY ON THE BASIS THAT SHE VIOLATED AN ORDER OF SEQUESTRATION THEREBY SEVERELY PREJUDICING THE DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">We reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The events which led to the defendant\u2019s indictment occurred on the evening of November 1, 1993 when James Barr (Barr), Billy Britton (Britton) and A.A. went to the home of L.W. to pick her up for a movie. Defendant, who lived in the duplex next to L.W., was sitting on the porch of his house. The four friends left L.W.\u2019s house about fifteen minutes later, and saw defendant on the steps of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">As the four were driving away defendant walked into the street and \u201cflagged down\u201d the car. Defendant was upset about reports that L.W. had told Britton (her boyfriend) that defendant had kissed her. Defendant had also heard from L.W. that Britton, therefore, \u201cwanted to fight\u201d him. According to Britton, defendant ordered him out of the ear, but Barr got out and indicated that he would fight the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">As the two approached each other, defendant pulled an object from his pocket. The quartet testified that it was a gun. Barr saw defendant cock the gun and thought it was a .9 millimeter. Britton testified it was \u201ca semi-automatic pistol.\u201d There was also testimony that defendant actually touched Barr with the gun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>that Barr retrieved a baseball bat from the car for use in the confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Defendant testified that he only pulled out a knife in a pouch. He stated that he carried the knife which he had purchased at \u201cCowtown\u201d for protection. After he and Barr argued and struggled briefly, defendant got on his bicycle and rode away. Later that evening, Barr, Britton, A.A. and L.W. reported the incident to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Defendant was arrested in his home six days later, at \u201capproximately 1 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d by two police officers who told him he was being charged with aggravated assault with a firearm. His girlfriend, Stephanie Loud, was present at the time. The police executed an arrest warrant but did not have a search warrant to search the apartment. Although they looked around the home, the police did not open any drawers or cabinets.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Defendant testified that he told the arresting officer that the object involved was a knife, and that it was in a kitchen drawer. He testified that he told the officers that he did not have a gun and gave them permission to search his apartment. He said the officers conducted a limited search, but did not go into the drawer where the knife was, and that they seized no weapon. After his arrest, defendant filed charges against Barr for assault with a baseball bat during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Sometime after defendant was indicted, Barr and Britton were contacted by defendant, who asked that they speak with his attorney, Robert S. Greenberg. Britton agreed to the meeting because at that time he was on friendlier terms with defendant, and he considered the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d and wanted to help defendant. According to Britton, he never told Greenberg that the weapon was not a gun because \u201c[t]hey made it seem like if I said that [the knife Greenberg showed him] was the gun, everything would be over with real quick.\u201d Britton did not want to go to court and signed a statement prepared by Green-berg.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Barr testified that defendant told him he was going to have a baby and asked him \u201cto say it was a knife or something\u201d so the charges against defendant could be reduced. In exchange, defendant promised to \u201cdrop\u201d the charges involved in Barr\u2019s use of the bat. Barr testified that he told Greenberg that defendant had a gun, and that the knife Greenberg showed him was not the weapon defendant possessed. Barr also testified that the statement he gave Greenberg was not the truth, but that he signed it because he was \u201cconcerned with ... going to jail\u201d in light of his use of the bat. Greenberg \u201cinsinuated\u201d Barr might go to jail and defendant agreed to dismiss the charges against Barr. On cross-examination, Barr acknowledged that he told Greenberg that the statement was true when it was read to him before the statement was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The statement read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">We, Bill Britton and James Barr were interviewed by Robert Greenberg, attorney for Darrel Dayton on 5/12/94. Mr. Greenberg showed us a black-handled knife and a black case. We believe that the weapon which we thought was a gun may have been a knife, this knife. It was dark out at the time and neither of us got a good look at the weapon. This statement is true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Barr and Britton testified, however, that they were positive that the weapon was a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Defendant asserts that \u201cthe Trial Court\u2019s refusal to grant defense counsel\u2019s application to withdraw so prejudiced the defendant as to require a reversal of his conviction and the grant of a new trial.\u201d The State suggests that, even if the application should have been granted, any error was harmless because both Barr and Britton acknowledged voluntarily signing the statement as true and accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Immediately prior to jury selection Greenberg moved to withdraw as counsel and for a continuance so that defendant could obtain new counsel. In support of the motion, Greenberg stated that, several months earlier, he had interviewed Britton and Barr in his office. A week before trial (which commenced on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>6, 1994), the prosecutor called to advise him that the two had recently been interviewed by the Prosecutor\u2019s office. According to Greenberg, there was some suggestion that Barr and Britton would testify that \u201cperhaps the statement they had given in my office had been in some way pressured out of them by me.\u201d Greenberg believed that if either denied making the statement or suggested in open court that the statement was not made voluntarily, his testimony \u201cmight be necessary to contradict their statements in front of the jury.\u201d Greenberg, therefore, believed that his inability to testify would prevent defendant from putting forth facts relevant to the defense. He, therefore, moved to withdraw so that he could appear as a witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The trial judge denied the motion. At the close of defendant\u2019s case, however, the judge told defense counsel \u201c[i]f you want to testify in this case, you can be my guest. I certainly have no objection to it. You can get on the witness stand and testify, if that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d Counsel declined the offer and advised the judge \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that. And I think under the rules of professional conduct, it would not be ... permitted to take the stand on my client\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Defendant contends that he was denied due process because his attorney could not testify and give relevant evidence. He relies on <em>RPC </em>3.7 which provides, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">(a) a lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is <em>likely to be a necessary witness </em>except where:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">[Emphasis added.J <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>We have held that \u201cthe ethical prohibition\u201d embodied in <em>RPC </em>3.7 \u201cis not against being a witness, but against acting as trial attorney in a case where it is likely that the attorney\u2019s testimony will be necessary.\u201d <em>State v. Tanksley, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 393, 585 A.2d 973 (App.Div.1991). We have thus said that \u201c[a]n attorney representing a party at trial is competent to testify at the trial even though his decision to try the case may have been unethical.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Callen v. Gill, </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>312, 318, 81 A.2d 495 (1951); <em>State v. Riley, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 390-91, 523 <em>A.M </em>1089 (App.Div.1987). Here, the attorney chose not to testify for ethical reasons, and we must pass upon the impact of the denial of the motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The reasons for permitting an attorney who is likely to become a witness to withdraw as counsel were recently developed in <em>Freeman v. Vicchiarelli, </em>827 <em>F.Supp. </em>300 (D.N.J.1993). <em>Freeman </em>was a civil action in which defendant police officer Vicchiarelli moved to disqualify plaintiffs attorney because he was a \u201clikely\u201d witness at trial, 827 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 301. Counsel had been present at a conference during which defendant and a prosecutor allegedly demanded the execution by plaintiff of a release form before dropping charges they knew to be \u201cmistaken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff alleged that defendant maliciously prosecuted the matter in municipal court and violated his due process rights \u201cin an attempt to shield Vicchiarelli from potential future liability\u201d because plaintiff would not sign the form. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff was not present at the conference, and the defendant denied the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Plaintiff opposed the disqualification motion on the grounds that his attorney was \u201cnot a \u2018necessary witness\u2019 \u201d because it was not certain he would be called to the stand and that the motion was premature. However, Magistrate Rosen (applying New Jersey law) granted the defendant\u2019s application for disqualification, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">Although neither Plaintiff nor Defendant have stated that Mr. Lands will be called as a witness, RPC 3.7 does not require certainty as to a lawyer\u2019s testimony; the plain language of RPC 3.7 requires only \u201clikelihood.\u201d In this case, it is more than' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>likely that Mr. Lands will be a necessary witness. His testimony regarding the substance of the conversation in conference with Officer Vicchiarelli and Assistant Prosecutor Donovan is the primary evidence in this case. Plaintiff needs Mr. Lands\u2019 testimony to establish any unlawfulness in Defendant\u2019s pursuit of the probable cause hearing. As the complaint presently stands, it is hard to imagine how Plaintiffs claim can succeed without Mr. Lands\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">Plaintiffs second contention, that the attorney-witness rule only operates once the trial has commenced, misstates the scope of RPC 3.7. Because the language of RPC 3.7 on its face prohibits an attorney from acting in dual capacities at trial, Plaintiff argues that Mr. Lands should be allowed to continue to serve as Plaintiffs attorney prior to the trial. Though this argument is based upon a reasonable construction of the language of RPC 3.7, close examination of the case law and policies regarding the attorney-witness rule reveal that the attorney-witness rule begins to operate as soon as either attorney realizes that a possible conflict may arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\"><em>[Freeman v. Vicchiarelli, supra, </em>827 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 302-03.] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Here defendant wanted Ms counsel to withdraw so he could testify, and the issue is not what the court should have done if they sought his continued representation over prosecutorial objection. <em>See RPC </em>3.7(a)(l)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\"><em>Freeman </em>also rejected plaintiffs stipulation that his counsel would not testify, despite its adverse impact on plaintiffs case. According to Magistrate Rosen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">The primary purpose of the attorney-witness rule is protecting the interests of the client. Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics, <em>Opinion No. 630, </em>124 N.J.L.J. 906, 926. If the case may be \u201chandled by any competent lawyer ... it is appropriate for [the attorney-witness] to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926, <em>quoting </em>Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics <em>Opinion No. 233, </em>95 N.J.L.J. 206 (1972). Even when there is a question as to the materiality of the lawyer\u2019s testimony to the client\u2019s case, \u201cdoubts should be resolved in favor of the lawyer testifying and against his becoming or continuing as an advocate.\u201d Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics, <em>Opinion No. 233, </em>95 N.XL.J. 206-207, (1972) quoting ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 5-10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Permitting an attorney to stay in a ease by foregoing testimony necessary to his client\u2019s claim is tantamount to allowing an attorney to knowingly provide his client with less than the best advocacy. By concealing important, admissible evidence from the fact finder, such an attorney would be hurting his client. The withdrawal of \u201cnecessary\u201d testimony would also inhibit the court from viewing all of the evidence necessary to reach a just decision. The attorney-witness rule, designed to protect the client and to maintain the integrity of the fact-finding process, can not lead to such an \u2019ncongruous result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\"><em>[Freeman v. Vicchiarelli, supra, </em>827 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 306 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">We express our concern as to why defense counsel would interview the complainants or victims of the alleged offense without the presence of an investigator or some third party (other than defendant) who could be called to testify as to exculpatory information they conveyed. Having not done so, we do not understand why counsel did not earlier take action to withdraw in order to be able to so testify. It may be that it was already expected that defendant would testify, but his testimony might not be given the same weight as another observer. It may also be that counsel did not expect a repudiation \u2014 an event which is not foreign to a \u2022criminal trial practitioner. But, no matter the reason, counsel let at least a week pass after being advised by the prosecutor \u2014 as part of continuing discovery \u2014 that Barr and Britton would repudiate their statement to Greenberg and testify that defendant had a gun.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He should have moved to withdraw prior to the day of trial, and we can understand the judge\u2019s negative reaction at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In his certification in support of the motion for a new trial, Greenberg described the testimony he would have given. He certified that he did not know Barr or Britton prior to the meeting; he did not suggest that he \u201cwanted them to make a false statement\u201d; he did not negotiate or offer Barr a promise to drop the assault charges against him; he never told them they would not have to go to court if they signed the statement; and he told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the two that he would give the prosecutor a copy of the statement. Further, the attorney certified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">When I showed the knife in question to Britton and Barr, they examined it closely. Both defendants (sic) admitted to me that it was dark. Britton told <em>me </em>that when the weapon was exposed, defendant was too far away for him to see it clearly. During their interview, the demeanor of both Britton and Barr appeared sincere. Neither laughed when shown the knife or made any comment inconsistent with the doubt which was expressed in the statement signed by them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">It is true, as suggested by the State, that Barr and Britton admitted during trial that their statement to Greenberg was voluntary and that they were not pressured to sign it. It is also true, as urged by the State, that these witnesses\u2019 credibility was clearly an issue before the jury as a result of the statement and that L.W. and A.A. never flinched on their insistence that a gun was employed. But we know that the realities and impressions at trial may be different than the academic review of the words in the transcript prepared for an appeal. The direct testimony of defendant\u2019s attorney could have had far more impact and better effect than the admissions of the principal State\u2019s witnesses, particularly because they both indicated telling Greenberg at some point during the interview that defendant had a gun. Greenberg clearly had no such recollection. Moreover, despite what Barr and Britton said in their trial testimony, the jury may have been left with the impression that the witnesses would not admit the pressure or impact of counsel\u2019s presence at the conference when they were asked by him at trial about his conduct. In any event, the absence of testimony by counsel about what occurred in his office on a significant issue left a void at trial. Moreover, we cannot speculate as to its potential impact on the credibility of L.W. and A.A. in addition to that of Barr and Britton.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We need not, however, decide if the failure of counsel to move earlier to be relieved justified denial of the motion to withdraw or if that denial by itself warrants reversal in light of the totality of the proofs. This is so because we find that the preclusion of the testimony of defendant\u2019s girlfriend also affects the aggregate of factors warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Defendant asserts that the trial court committed error by refusing to allow Stephanie Loud (Loud) to testify in surrebuttal because she had been present in the courtroom during the other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The sequestration order arose after defense requested that the State\u2019s witnesses be sequestered. In response, the trial court issued a blanket order prohibiting all witnesses from being present for any testimony. Upon completion of the rebuttal testimony of arresting Officer Murphy, defendant sought to put Loud on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Murphy had testified that upon arrest defendant was told that \u201che was accused of having a semi-automatic weapon, a handgun,\u201d and that defendant \u201cwas curious as to why [they] were picking him up,\u201d but that he did not say it was a knife as opposed to a gun. Murphy also testified that defendant\u2019s girlfriend was in the house at the time and that if something about a knife was mentioned, \u201c[t]hat would have been documented in [Murphy\u2019s] investigation report.\u201d In response to a question, \u201c[i]s it that you don\u2019t remember him saying anything about a knife or that you don\u2019t recall specifically he said nothing about a knife,\u201d Murphy responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know specifically.\u201d On cross-examination Murphy admitted that defendant \u201cgave us permission\u201d to search the apartment for a gun, but that Murphy \u201cdeclined that invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The defense sought Loud\u2019s testimony to support defendant\u2019s position that he did, in fact, tell Murphy that he had a knife.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State objected because Loud had been in the courtroom during \u201cother testimony.\u201d The defense asserted that it was \u201csurprised\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>by Murphy\u2019s rebuttal testimony, and had not originally intended to call Loud as a witness. The trial judge declined to allow Loud\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">A defendant has a right to call witnesses to testify in his defense. <em>See State v. Fort, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>123, 128-29, 501 A.2d 140 (1985); <em>State v. Vassos, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>585, 590-92, 568 A.2d 583 (App.Div.1990). We have nevertheless stated that in extraordinary circumstances, a witness who has violated a sequestration order may be barred from giving testimony at trial. <em>State v. Tillman, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 143-44, 299 A.2d 419 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>428, 302 A.2d 132 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">There is no automatic exclusionary rule based on a witness\u2019 inadvertent violation of a sequestration order by sitting in the courtroom. <em>State v. Horton, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 372, 489 A.2d 1164 (App.Div.1985). In <em>Tillman, </em>we granted a defendant a new trial because the prosecutor met with two witnesses together after the sequestration order was entered, \u201cthere was a clear violation of the sequestration order and fault on the part of the State,\u201d 122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142, 299 A.2d 419, and the trial judge took no remedial action \u201cto mitigate the prejudicial effect of the violation of the sequestration order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 299 A.2d 419. The issue there was far different than whether defendant can be deprived of the right to call a defense witness whose testimony did not become relevant until the State presented rebuttal evidence contradicting defendant\u2019s testimony that he immediately told the arresting officer that he possessed a knife, not a gun. Nevertheless, in <em>Tillman </em>this court set out a general procedure for handling sequestration violations. The court suggested that the trial judge \u201cshould promptly conduct a <em>voir dire </em>out of the presence of the jury in order to ascertain the nature and extent of [the] violation ... [and] thereupon determine what remedial action is required, if any, in light of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We noted that, \u201c[i]n the extraordinary case ... [where] the prejudice cannot be dissipated by other remedial action ... the court may grant a mistrial\u201d and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Under extraordinary circumstances </em>also, the exact nature of which we need not determine here, consideration may be given to the alternative possibility of excluding the testimony of the offending witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\"><em>[State v. Tillman, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143, 299 A.2d 419 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">But even as to that, we noted a \u201ccaveat____as to the appropriateness of this remedy in a criminal case as affecting the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 299 A.2d 419. We further emphasized that \u201cwhere it does not clearly appear that the violation of the sequestration order possesses a potential for prejudice, a less drastic remedy appears to be proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 299 A.2d 419. \u201cThe court may, in its discretion ... call the disobedience of the order to the attention of the jury as bearing on the credibility of the witnesses involved ... In such case the parties may interrogate the witnesses as to what occurred and may comment thereon in their summations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\"><em>Horton </em>involved the trial court\u2019s preclusion of the testimony of defendant\u2019s mother, an alibi witness, because she sat in court during the testimony of another such witness. We concluded that the defendant was \u201cprejudiced both by possible speculation on the part of the jury as to why defendant\u2019s mother ... did not testify, and also by being deprived of the sole witness who could have established his alibi for the entire period in question.\u201d 199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 374, 489 A.2d 1164. We found such error could not be deemed harmless and in reversing the conviction, Judge Dreier stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">Where a defendant\u2019s witnesses are claimed to be excludable, defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights \u201cto have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor\u201d might be infringed. <em>U.S. Const., </em>Amend VI and XIV; <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), Art. I, par. 10. <em>See also, </em>Annotation, <em>supra, </em>14 A.L.R.3d \u00a7 2(c) at 54. As was stated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em>496 <em>Pa. </em>78, 436 A.2d 161, 163 (1981):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">Absent a showing of fault on the part of the party or counsel who called a witness, the overwhelming weight of authority is that a trial court should not deprive a criminal defendant of a witness\u2019 testimony solely because he violated a sequestration order____ To deny an accused the opportunity to present relevant and competent evidence in his defense would constitute a violation of his fundamental constitutional rights to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to a fair trial ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Because of the availability of alternative sanctions to enforce a sequestration order and because of the fundamental constitutional basis for an accused\u2019s right to present relevant testimony in his favor, it ordinarily would be an abuse of discretion to disqualify a witness unless either the accused or his counsel has somehow cooperated in the violation of the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\"><em>[State v. Horton, supra, 199 N.J.Super. </em>at 373, 489 A.2d 1164.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Later cases echo the general rule that exclusion of testimony should be the last resort, at least if the proffered testimony has any probative value. <em>See State v. Burke, </em>522 A.2d 725, 729 (R.I.1987), where Justice Weisberger stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Under the overwhelming weight of authority, it is an abuse of discretion to preclude a criminal defense witness\u2019s testimony for violation of a sequestration order unless special circumstances exist that would warrant the preclusion. <em>See, e.g, Holder v. United States, </em>150 <em>U.S. </em>91, <em>U S.Ct </em>10, <em>21 L.Ed, </em>1010 (1893); <em>United States v. Torbert, </em>496 F.2d 154 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>857, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>105, 42 L.Ed.2d 91 (1974); <em>Braswell v. Wainwrighx, </em>463 <em>F.2d </em>1148 (5th Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>299 F.2d 625 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>370 <em>U.S. </em>917, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>1553, 8 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>497 (1962). <em>See generally </em>Annot. 14 A.L.P.3d 16, \u00a7 6(c) at 54-56 (1967 <em>&amp; </em>1986 Supp.). Unless violation of the sequestration order is due to the consent, connivance, procurement or knowledge of the defendant or his counsel, a trial justice should not deprive a criminal defendant of his right to present testimony. State <em>v. Warren, </em>437 So.2d 836 (La.1983); <em>State v. Burdge, </em>295 <em>Or. </em>1, 664 P.2d 1076 (1983); <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em>496 <em>Pa. </em>78, 436 A.2d 161 (1981). Instead, a trial justice should consider alternative sanctions to enforce the order, such as the issuance of a cautionary instruction to the jury or in some instances a contempt proceeding against the witness. <em>See Holder v. United States, </em>150 <em>U.S. </em>91, 14 <em>S.Ct. </em>10, 37 <em>L.Ed. </em>1010 (1893); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leong, </em>51 <em>Haw. </em>581, 465 P.2d 560 (1970); <em>Commonwealth v. Scott, </em>496 <em>Pa. </em>78, 436 A.2d 161 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">There should be no exclusion of testimony where, as here, there was no intention to call the witness at the time he or she was in the courtroom as an observer, and there were alternative means of developing the sequestration issue before the jury. While a trial court\u2019s refusal to permit an offending witness from testifying will not always require a new trial, here defendant suffered prejudice. <em>See State v. Tillman, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 139-40, 299 A.2d 419; <em>State v. Horton, 199 N.J.Super. </em>at 373-74, 489 A.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">It is true that Loud would not have presented testimony as to whether or not defendant had a gun or a knife at the time of the confrontation. But the State chose to call Officer Murphy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>rebuttal to negate defendant\u2019s testimony that he immediately reacted to his arrest by saying there was no gun. In summation the prosecutor pointed to defendant\u2019s testimony that he was not \u201cjust ... making up\u201d the story about the knife for purposes of trial, and noted Officer Murphy\u2019s rebuttal testimony that that \u201cdefendant never said he had a knife\u201d as indicating defendant\u2019s \u201cwilling[ness] to lie____\u201d As the State suggested that the knife was a recent fabrication and relied upon a rebuttal witness to that effect, we cannot conclude that defendant was not prejudiced. To the contrary, the absence of testimony from both Greenberg and Loud may have left the jury with the impression that defendant fabricated the idea of the knife after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for retrial on the counts on which defendant was convicted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-12\"> <em>See also RPC </em>3.7(b) which provides that \u2018\u2018A lawyer may act as <em>advocate in a </em>trial in which another lawyer in the lawyer\u2019s firm is likely to be called as a witness unless precluded from doing so by RPC 1.7 or RPC 1.9.\u201d There was no endeavor to substitute an associate of Greenberg or any other attorney as trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\"> We need not discuss whether <em>RPC </em>3.7 prohibited further conduct by counsel in this case once he became aware of the possible need for his testimony.

This appears to either have been a misstatement on defendant's counsel's part, or an error in the transcript. Both parties appear to agree that Loud would have testified that defendant told the officer that he had a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
