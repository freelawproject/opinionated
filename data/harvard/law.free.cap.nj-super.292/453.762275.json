An earlier order permitted a notice of <em>lis pendens </em>to be filed by the law firm of Cole, Schotz, Bernstein, Meisel and Forman (\u201cCole\u201d) against real property owned by its former client, Carole Owens (\u201cOwens\u201d). The <em>lis pendens </em>served as notice that Cole was asserting an attorney\u2019s lien against the property. The lien was to secure fees owed by Owens to Cole. Due to the filing of the <em>lis pendens, </em>proceeds from the later sale of the property were placed in escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">After a thorough review of the record and the arguments of counsel, we hold that Cole does not have a lien on the property and the court should not have permitted the <em>lis pendens </em>to be filed. The order releasing the funds from escrow is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Cole was engaged to represent Owens in March 1990 in a matrimonial action. In July 1991, Cole moved for leave to withdraw as her counsel. In the same motion, Cole sought leave to file \u201ca statement with the Bergen County Clerk evidencing the existence of a charging lien\u201d on behalf of Cole pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:13-5. Cole alleged that Owens owed Cole some $40,000 in legal fees. An order was entered on August 12, 1991 relieving Cole as counsel and granting leave to Cole \u201cto file a <em>lis pendens </em>evidencing its attorney lien pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:13-5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Cole filed the <em>lis pendens </em>on August 16, 1991, against real property in Englewood, New Jersey owned solely by Owens. The property was being sold. An escrow agreement was entered into on November 4, 1991, under which the <em>lis pendens </em>would be discharged and $42,400 would be held in escrow \u201cuntil the resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tion of the dispute for attorney\u2019s fees\u201d between Cole and Owens. The agreement also provided that the \u201cmatter of counsel fees may be referred to arbitration\u201d; that neither party released any claims against each other, including Owens\u2019 claims as to the legality of the <em>lis pendens; </em>and that if there was any court determination that the <em>lis pendens </em>\u201cwas incorrectly filed,\u201d then the escrow funds would be released. The parties to the agreement included Cole, Owens and the trustee in bankruptcy for Cole\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Cole by letter dated November 4, 1991, informed Owens that she had the option of pursuing fee arbitration. <em>See R. </em>l:20A-6. The letter contained the name and address of the person to contact regarding that option.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Owens filed a motion dated November 22, 1991 to have the escrowed funds released to her. She argued that the <em>lis pendens </em>was improper because the requisite fee arbitration notice had not preceded the filing of the <em>Us pendens, see R. </em>l:20A-6, and bec\u00e1use <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-6 did not allow a <em>Us pendens </em>to be filed in a matrimonial action. The judge denied the motion saying he saw nothing in the <em>Us pendens </em>statute which would prohibit the use of a <em>Us pendens. </em>He also said that litigation had to be pending and therefore he required that litigation be instituted within fourteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">On February 8, 1992, Cole instituted suit for its fees. In May 1993, Owens moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that Cole failed to comply with <em>R. </em>l:20A-6. She also sought other relief including the release of the funds in escrow. The motion was denied. We denied a motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In July 1993, Owens filed a malpractice action against Cole. Owens unsuccessfully moved to consolidate that action with the Cole action for fees. We denied leave to appeal from the order denying consolidation. Thereafter, Owens moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment in the attorney fee action.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Cole then moved successfully for summary judgment dismissing Owens\u2019 malpractice complaint on the ground of the entire contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>versy doctrine. Owens appealed. We reinstated the malpractice action and consolidated it with the attorney fee action. We reasoned that Owens had raised the issue of attorney negligence as a defense to the attorney fee action and thus Owens should be allowed to proceed with her malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In February, March and June 1994, Owens unsuccessfully moved to dismiss Cole\u2019s complaint in the attorney fee action and to release the funds in escrow. In October 1994, a consent order was entered staying the trial of the consolidated action pending the completion, which has not yet occurred, of the underlying matrimonial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In June 1995, Owens again moved to have the funds held in escrow released to her. She relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mateo v. Mateo, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 656 A.2d 846 (App.Div.1995). The judge found <em>Mateo </em>controlling and held that the order permitting Cole to file a <em>lis pendens </em>was void. We granted Cole\u2019s motion for leave to appeal and stayed release of the escrow funds pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Cole argues that: (1) the <em>Mateo </em>decision is distinguishable; (2) Owens has never availed herself of the fee arbitration remedy, and has never indicated that she would do so; and (3) the motion for leave to file the <em>lis pendens </em>need not have been preceded by a Pre-Action Notice because: (a) the motion was not a lawsuit to recover a fee or a petition to determine and enforce an attorney\u2019s lien; and (b) the motion constituted \u201cancillary legal action\u201d which is specifically exempted under <em>R. </em>1.-20A-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">The Supreme Court has provided for arbitration of attorneys\u2019 fees since 1978. The underlying policy is to promote \u201cpublic confidence in the bar and the judicial system.\u201d See generally <em>Saffer v. Willoughby, Jr. </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>256, 263, 670 A.2d 527 (1996). Under our court rules, a client has the right to proceed with arbitration. <em>See R. </em>L20A-3. An attorney may not institute a lawsuit to recover a fee without giving the client a Pre-Action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Notice. The notice advises the client as to the client\u2019s right to request fee arbitration and the procedure therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The pertinent court rule provides: \u201cNo lawsuit to recover a fee may be filed until the expiration of the 30 day period herein giving Pre-Action, Notice to a client; however, this shall not prevent a lawyer from instituting any ancillary legal action.\u201d <em>R. </em>l:20A-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Ancillary legal action is authorized by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:13-5. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">After the filing of a complaint or third-party complaint or the service of a pleading containing a counterclaim or cross-claim, the attorney or counsellor at law, who shall appeal- in the cause for the party instituting the action or maintaining the third-party claim or counterclaim or cross-claim, shall have a lien for compensation, upon his client\u2019s action, cause of action, claim or counterclaim or cross-claim, which shall contain and attach to a verdict, report, decision, award, judgment or final order in his client\u2019s favor, and the proceeds thereof in whosesoever hands they may come. The lien shall not be affected by any settlement between the parties before or after judgment or final order, nor by the entry of satisfaction or cancellation of a judgment on the record. The court in which the action or other proceeding is pending, upon the petition of the attorney or counsellor at law, may determine and enforce the lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\n<em>Ubid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In <em>Mateo v. Mateo, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 79, 656 A.2d 846, we said that an application to establish an attorney\u2019s lien \u201cmust be brought as a step in the main cause, but tried as a separate and distinct plenary action.\u201d <em>See also Panarello v. Panarello, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 585 A.2d 428 (Ch.Div.1990); <em>Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 570 A.2d 1026 (Ch.Div.1989). We also said that an action for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cmust be dismissed where the attorney does not allege that he or she gave the client notice of the availability of the Fee Arbitration Committee proceedings.\u201d <em>Mateo, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 80, 656 A.2d 846; <em>see also Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 78, 570 A.2d 1026 (Pre-Action Notice must be given when, petition filed to fix an attorney\u2019s lien); <em>cf. Chalom v. Benesh, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>248, 260, 560 A.2d 746 (Law Div.1989) (defendants estopped from relying on failure to give Pre-Action Notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">In <em>Mateo, </em>the attorney did not file a complaint demanding payment of attorney\u2019s fees but \u201csimply moved in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>action for an attorney\u2019s lien pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:13-5.\u201d <em>Mateo, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 79, 656 A.2d 846. We said that the client is entitled to be advised of the right of fee arbitration before or at least at the time the client is embroiled in litigation which may result in a lien being placed upon the client\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 656 A.2d 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Here, as in <em>Mateo, </em>Cole initially moved for the imposition of a lien instead of filing a complaint or giving the Pre-Action Notice. Consequently, under <em>Mateo, </em>the lien is invalid. Cole, however, argues that giving Owens a Pre-Action Notice at the time Cole\u2019s motion was filed would not have benefitted Owens because she intended to pursue a malpractice claim, and a malpractice claim cannot be determined in a fee arbitration proceeding. <em>See R. </em>l:20A-2(c)(2); <em>see also Saffer v. Willoughby, Jr., supra, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>at 265-266, 670 A.2d 527. Consequently, the PreAction Notice, Cole argues, need not have been given at that time, and the \u201cancillary proceeding\u201d should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The argument is unpersuasive. What Owens might have done or not done if she had received the notice at the proper time is pure speculation. She should have been given the notice on or before Cole filed its motion. The failure to give the notice requires dismissal of the motion. <em>Mateo v. Mateo, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 80, 656 A.2d 846; <em>Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 570 A.2d 1026; <em>see R. </em>1:20A-6; <em>cf. Chalom v. Benesh, supra, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 260, 560 A.2d 746. In addition, the <em>lis pendens </em>must be voided for the reasons stated in the next section of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Cole maintains that the real property against which its <em>lis pendens </em>was filed was property which Owens would have <em>recovered </em>as part of equitable distribution in the matrimonial action. Cole argues that therefore its attorney\u2019s charging lien can be affixed to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The property in this case was the marital home. Owens and her husband were married in 1975. The property was purchased by them in 1979. In 1986 and 1987, they signed agreements which provided that the marital home was to be owned solely by the wife. The parties deeded the property to Carole Owens in 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">A divorce action was not filed until 1989. Thus, at the time the divorce action was filed, Owens was the sole owner of the property pursuant to the agreements and a deed. Because the property had been acquired during the marriage, it was subject to equitable distribution. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34r-23. However, our review of the record in the matrimonial action indicates that the husband did not assert a claim to the property. Consequently, Owens as a practical matter would not be \u201crecovering\u201d or obtaining the property as a result of the matrimonial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">An attorney\u2019s lien is merely a right in the attorney to a lien on any judgment recovered for the attorney\u2019s client. <em>Republic Factors, Inc. v. Carteret Work Uniforms, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>525, 534, 133 A.2d 6 (1957). It is an attorney\u2019s \u201cclaim of right to ask for intervention of the court for the attorney\u2019s protection, when having obtained judgment for his client, there is a probability of the client depriving him [or her] of his [or her] costs____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citation omitted). An attorney is \u201cconsidered an equitable assignee of the judgment to the extent of his debt.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Where there is no recovery, there is nothing to which the attorney\u2019s lien can attach. In <em>Wheeler v. Wheeler, </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 508, 145 A.2d 796 (App.Div.1958), we found the attorney\u2019s lien did not apply because plaintiff had recovered nothing to which the attorney\u2019s lien could attach. <em>See also Cole v. Cole, </em>30 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 435-438,104 A.2d 866 (Ch.Div.1954) (where the parties reconciled, there was no decree favorable to either husband or wife and, therefore, no valid charging lien could be asserted by the attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In the present case, Owens owned the property before the divorce action was filed. Her husband was not asserting a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to it. Hence, Owens would not be \u201crecovering\u201d the property in the divorce action. Under these circumstances, the charging lien of Cole could not attach to the property. <em>See Wheeler v. Wheeler, supra, 52 N.J.Super. </em>at 508, 145 A.2d 796 and <em>Cole v. Cole, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 435-438, 104 A.2d 866. The application to file the <em>lis pendens </em>should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Further, we question whether a <em>Us pendens </em>may be filed in order to secure an attorney\u2019s fees in a matrimonial action. Ordinarily <em>lis pendens </em>are filed when plaintiff asserts an interest in or a claim upon specific real property. <em>See Polk v. Schwartz, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 399 A.2d 1001 (App.Div.1979). The <em>lis pendens </em>statute provides that it may not be filed in an action to recover a judgment for money or damages only. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-6. An attorney in a suit for legal fees is seeking a monetary recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Moreover, a <em>lis pendens </em>is a \u201cform of taking.\u201d <em>Trus Joist Corp. v. Treetop Associates, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>22, 32, 477 A.2d 817 (1984). We question whether such a \u201ctaking\u201d of a client\u2019s property should be permitted in advance of an adjudication as to the merits of the attorneys\u2019 claim for fees. <em>See Trus Joist Corp., supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 477 A.2d 817 (a <em>lis pendens </em>has a \u201cvise-like grip upon the property, freezing the status quo.... \u201d); <em>cf. Chrysler Corp. v. Fedders Corp., 670 F.</em>2d. 1316 (3rd Cir.1982) (New Jersey <em>Us pendens </em>procedure complied with due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">In any event, it is clear under the facts in this case that a <em>lis pendens </em>should not have been permitted. Cole, through the use of the <em>lis pendens, </em>has obtained a pre-judgment lien on assets which the client would not be recovering in the underlying action. The purpose of the attorney\u2019s charging lien is to prevent the attorney from being deprived of a fee after having performed legal services which result in the client obtaining something of value. Here, the something of value belonged to the client prior to the underlying action and she was not at serious risk of losing it. A <em>lis pendens </em>should be discharged if the plaintiff has no right to a lien or a claim affecting the realty in question but only to some different claim or right against the defendant. <em>See O\u2019Boyle v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>Fairway Products, Inc., </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 167, 404 A.2d 365 (App.Div.1979). Cole\u2019s lien did not attach to Owens\u2019 marital home and the <em>lis pendens </em>against the marital home has no validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Further, important public policy issues are presented if Cole\u2019s position is upheld. The use of liens to secure counsel fees in matrimonial actions is a matter of serious concern. The New Jersey Ethics Commission, chaired by Judge Herman Michels, Presiding Judge of the Appellate Division, concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">the area of family or matrimonial law generates a high number of ethics grievances and fee disputes against individual lawyers and criticism of the judicial system____ <em>Testimony was heard of attorneys placing liens upon the sole residence of matrimonial clients </em>or, worse yet, of lawyers forcing clients to execute a mortgage upon their residence in favor of the attorney as a condition of continuing with then-representation where the initial retainer had been exhausted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\"><em>[See Report of the New Jersey Ethics Commission </em>at 178-179 (1993) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The Commission recommended that the Supreme Court \u201caddress, at an early date, the propriety of placing a lien or mortgage upon the matrimonial client\u2019s residence in order to secure the payment of an attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181. The Supreme Court recently appointed a special committee to consider this and other issues in matrimonial law and practice. <em>See </em>Henry Gottleib, <em>Three Years After Recommendation, Panel will study matrimonial practice, </em>144 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>236 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Our questioning the propriety of the <em>lis pendens </em>does not mean that we question the conduct of Cole. The firm properly sought a court order permitting the filing of the <em>lis pendens. </em>The record indicates that the firm has acted throughout in accordance with the highest standards of the bar. We also recognize that attorneys are not second class citizens and their legitimate interests must be protected. Nonetheless, as indicated in the report of the Ethics Commission, a potential for impropriety is present. An attorney\u2019s relationship with a client is a sensitive one. Courts must be vigilant to ensure \u201cthat the highest standards of loyalty and integrity will be maintained by all lawyers in this State.\u201d <em>In Re Education Law Center, Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>124, 133, 429 A.2d 1051 (1981). These considerations add strength to our conviction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the filing of the <em>Us pendens </em>against the matrimonial home should not have been permitted. The escrow funds must be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
