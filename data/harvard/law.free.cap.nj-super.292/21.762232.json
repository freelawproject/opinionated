Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, we remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">On May 30, 1990, Benjamin Ginsberg (Ginsberg), who was ninety years old at the time, experienced weakness and shortness of breath and consulted his personal physician of twenty years, Dr. Henry Green. Dr. Green\u2019s diagnosis was congestive heart failure; fluid in the chest cavity that was compressing a lung; kidney failure; arterial sclerosis; and mild diabetes mellitus. Dr. Green arranged for Ginsberg\u2019s immediate admission to St. Michael\u2019s hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">While at St. Michael\u2019s it was also found that Ginsburg was hypertensive; had arterial sclerotic heart disease; bronchial pneumonia; Parkinsonism; osteoarthritis with radiculopathy; hypergammaglobulinemia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; anorexia; dyspnea; and swelling of the abdomen and extremities. However, Ginsberg\u2019s primary problem was congestive heart failure as a manifestation of heart disease. He had lost more than forty percent of his heart muscle so that his heart was not pumping effectively, and blood was backing up into his lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">In the hospital, Ginsberg received various forms of treatment. As pertains to this case, he was given small doses of insulin (approximately four or five units) for diabetes. After about a month in the hospital, Ginsberg\u2019s condition had stabilized. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>was able to get out of bed and sit in a chair. Dr. Green testified that on or about July 13, his condition was such that he could be discharged from the hospital. Dr. Green and the Ginsbergs began making plans for home nursing care.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">On July 13, 1990, defendant Dr. Terrence Truitt, a resident at St. Michael\u2019s, ordered that Ginsberg receive four units of insulin. Defendant Nurse Mary Lee misinterpreted the order and incorrectly gave Ginsberg forty units of insulin on July 14, 1990. The type of insulin ordered by Dr. Truitt was time-released and did not take effect immediately. However, over the course of the day, Ginsberg\u2019s blood sugar level dropped steadily, reaching life threatening levels. He slipped into a coma, his blood pressure dropped and he went into substantial heart failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Dr. Green testified that he saw Ginsberg on the morning of July 14, and at that time Ginsberg was in insulin shock. Ginsberg was in a comatose state; he had impaired movement of his lungs; his blood pressure was dropping; he was not getting enough oxygen; and he had a rapid heart rate. As a result of his condition, Ginsberg was moved to the intensive care unit for further management. That day Dr. Green met with plaintiff, and Robert Ginsberg (the Ginsbergs\u2019 son) and asked them whether they wanted to employ extraordinary measures in the event of cardiac arrest. The Ginsbergs inquired as to the quality of Ginsberg\u2019s life in the event such measures were used, and asked Dr. Green\u2019s advice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Green advised against extraordinary measures, and the Gins-bergs accepted that advice. On July 15, 1990, Ginsberg died of cardiac failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Plaintiff filed this medical malpractice action as a result of the death of her husband. All named defendants were dismissed from the action except Dr. Truitt and Nurse Lee. The matter proceeded to trial against them. After five days of trial, the jury returned its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>verdict. In response to special interrogatories, it found that Dr. Truitt did not deviate from accepted standards of care (interrogatory one), but that Nurse Lee had deviated from accepted standards (interrogatory two). In response to interrogatory three, the jury found that Ginsberg\u2019s death would not have occurred when it did but for the deviation from accepted standards by Nurse Lee. In response to special interrogatory number four, the jury also found that the deviation increased the risk that Ginsberg would have died on a date earlier than otherwise would have occurred as a result of his pre-existing condition. However, in response to special interrogatory five, and notwithstanding its answer to the \u201cbut for\u201d causation question in interrogatory number three, the jury found that the increased risk was not a substantial factor in producing the death of Ginsberg on a date earlier than otherwise would have occurred. Accordingly, a judgment of no cause for action was entered on behalf of both defendants. After plaintiffs motion for a new trial was denied, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Dr. Green completed Ginsberg\u2019s death certificate and listed the causes of death as cardiac arrest with associated pneumonia and renal failure. He did not list hypoglycemia or insulin overdose as the cause of death. Although Dr. Green testified that the overdose caused a cascade of other events that killed Ginsberg, he was not permitted to explain why the death certificate read as it did or how, in his view, the insulin overdose caused Ginsberg\u2019s ultimate demise. That testimony was excluded because, although he had been deposed, Dr. Green had not been listed as an expert witness. Consequently, the trial judge only permitted him to testify as to what he personally observed and what he did to treat Ginsberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The videotaped testimony of Dr. Munoz, plaintiffs expert, was played at trial. Dr. Munoz testified that the low blood sugar caused by the insulin overdose deprived the heart and other organs of the fuel they needed to function. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">I believe the cause of death was insulin overdosage administered two days before his death which caused a chain of events that caused cardiac failure and other organ failures that caused his death on the 15th of July.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>It was Dr. Munoz\u2019 opinion that Ginsberg would have lived for approximately two more years had the insulin overdose not been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Dr. Angelo Scotti, the defense expert, testified that while the overdose of insulin increased the risk that Ginsberg would die on July 15, 1990, the overdose was not a substantial factor in his death because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">Mi-. Ginsberg didn\u2019t have a heart attack, didn\u2019t have one of those ventricular arrhythmias, did not have a seizure, and did not really die a brain death, did not die of hypoglycemia with not enough sugar to his brain and didn\u2019t go out and crash his car because he was hypoglycemic. So I couldn\u2019t come up either from looking at the chart, or looking at the death certificate, for a reason to say hypoglycemia, low blood sugar from the insulin was the cause of his death. He died a cardiac death he died from his heart disease which he came into the hospital with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Dr. Scotti also testified that, despite the overdose of insulin, Ginsberg never suffered from the condition known as insulin shock, and that the coma did not interfere with Ginsberg\u2019s ability to clear fluid from his lungs as Dr. Green had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Further, Dr. Scotti testified that the death certificate signed by Dr. Green confirmed his opinion because there was no mention of hypoglycemia as the cause of death or the contributing cause of death. With respect to the Ginsbergs' decision not to use extraordinary measures in the event of cardiac arrest, Dr. Scotti testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">He was put into the intensive care unit to watch his blood sugars and to make sure that he didn\u2019t have a problem with seizures or a heart attack or a rhythm problem, but at the same time when they decided to put him in, the decision was made to make him a no code, or do not resuscitate. Now what that means is no extraordinary measures are going to take place, I think that decision was a major reason for his death on the 15th, and that is as he got sicker, as his heart disease progressed, whether it was because he had more fluid or because it was a natural progression of the heart disease, or some combination, the decision was made not to treat him aggressively and to basically let him die a natural death instead of keeping him alive by extraordinary means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Although he believed the insulin overdose was not a substantial factor in causing Ginsberg\u2019s death, Dr. Scotti opined that, if the insulin overdose had not occurred, given his age and multiple medical conditions, Ginsberg would only have lived anywhere from two weeks to two months. He based this estimate on the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Ginsberg\u2019s congestive heart failure put him at risk for a heart attack, progressively worse congestive failure, pneumonia, a blood clot to his lung, pulmonary embolism, or just a gradual deterioration of his heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">I &amp; II</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Defense counsel argued at trial that this case is one involving increased risk of harm, and, therefore, the standards set forth in <em>Scafidi v. Seiler, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>93, 574 A.2d 398 (1990), were applicable. On the other hand, plaintiff argued that this case is distinguishable from <em>Scafidi, </em>in that Ginsberg had no reasonable chance of recovering from the underlying conditions. She argued that the issue in this instance was the acceleration of the end result, not increasing the risk of the end result occurring or losing the chance of recovery. The trial judge determined that the standards set forth in <em>Scafidi </em>were applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">To recover damages for the negligence of another, a plaintiff must prove that the negligence was a proximate cause of the injury sustained. <em>Catto v. Scknepp, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 511, 298 A.2d 74 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>20, 297 A.2d 841 (1972). \u201cIn the routine case in which the plaintiffs injury can be traced to a single cause, the standard instruction on proximate cause ... describes it as \u2018a cause which necessarily set the other causes in motion and was a substantial factor in bringing the accident about ...,\u2019 and further as a \u2018cause which naturally and probably led to and might have been expected to produce the accident complained of.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scafidi, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 574 A.2d 398, (quoting <em>Model Jury Charges </em>(Civil) \u00a7 7.11). However, where the plaintiff has a preexistent injury or disability and is then adversely affected by a defendant\u2019s negligence, the jury could be confused by a \u201cbut for\u201d instruction as to causation. <em>Ibid. </em>In order to avoid that possibility, the <em>Scafidi </em>Court announced the rule that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff has a preexistent injury or disability and is then adversely affected by a defendant\u2019s negligence, the standard by which the jury evaluates causation must be expressed in terms consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>with the operative facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 574 A.2d 398. The Court explained that this \u201cmodified standard of proximate causation is limited to that class of cases in which a defendant\u2019s negligence combines with the condition to cause harm \u2014 as distinguished from cases in which the deviation alone is the cause of the harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108-109, 574 A.2d 398.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">[T]he jury is first asked to verify, as a matter of medical probability, that the deviation is within the class, <em>ie., </em>that it increased the risk of harm from the preexistent condition, [citations omitted]. Assuming that the jury determines that the deviation increased the risk from the preexistent condition, we use the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test of causation because of the inapplicability of \u201cbut for\u201d causation to eases where the harm is produced by concurrent causes. <em>See Prosser and Keeton on Toiis, </em>\u00a7 41 at 266-268; Malone, Ruminations on Cause-In-Fact, 9 <em>Stan.L.Rev. </em>60, 88-90 (1956). The \u201csubstantial factor\u201d standard requires the jury to determine whether the deviation, in the context of the preexistent condition, is sufficiently significant in relation to the eventual harm to satisfy the requirement of proximate cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">[Id. at 109, 574 A.2d 398.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Applying the foregoing principles to this case, we are satisfied that the <em>Scafidi </em>charge was appropriate. While both plaintiff and defendants conceded that Ginsberg\u2019s underlying condition would ultimately cause his death, plaintiff contended that the insulin overdose combined with his underlying condition to accelerate his death. Defendants, on the other hand, contended that, while the overdose increased the risk of premature death, Ginsberg actually died from his underlying congestive heart failure, and that the overdose was not sufficiently significant in the overall picture to require defendants to be held legally accountable for Ginsberg\u2019s death. The question for the jury to answer, therefore, was whether the overdose of insulin combined with Ginsberg\u2019s pre-existing condition to bring about his premature death, or whether it was his pre-existing condition alone that caused it. The scenario fits squarely within the <em>Scafidi </em>construct of increased risk of harm causation. No doctor testified that the overdose alone would have produced death regardless of Ginsberg\u2019s condition. Had that been the testimony, <em>Scafidi </em>would not have been applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>As we see it, the error in this case was not the decision to charge <em>Scafidi </em>but, rather, requiring the jury to answer interrogatories relevant to both \u201cbut for\u201d causation and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d causation in the same case; failing to tell the jury the difference between the two concepts; permitting improper evidence on the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d aspect of the causation charge; and prohibiting Dr. Green from explaining fully the opinions he formed during the course of treating Ginsberg as to the cause for the conditions that eventuated in his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The pertinent part of the charge on causation was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFd\">[P]laintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s negligence increased the risk of harm and accelerated Mr. Ginsberg\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">To establish proximate cause under these circumstances, first plaintiff must prove by the greater weight of the more believable evidence that the defendant\u2019s negligence increased the risk of harm posed by Mr. Ginsberg\u2019s progressive conditions. Second, plaintiff must prove by the greater weight of the more believable evidence that the increased risk was a substantial factor of accelerating Mr. Ginsberg\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">If the professional negligence, that is the malpractice charged by plaintiff, was itself too remotely or insignificantly related to the ultimate result, then in a legal sense the claim [sic] negligent act by Dr. Truitt or Nurse Lee would not constitute a substantial factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">That is, essentially, the <em>Scafidi </em>charge. However, in special interrogatories the jury was asked to answer the following questions pertaining to proximate cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">3) Would Mr. Ginsberg\u2019s death on or around July 15, 1990 have occurred even if there was not a deviation from accepted standards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">4) Did the deviation increase the risk that Mr. Ginsberg would have died on a date earlier than otherwise would have occurred as a result of his pre-existing conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">5) Was the increased risk a substantial factor in producing his death on a date earlier than otherwise would have occurred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">The third interrogatory is clearly one that addresses \u201cbut for\u201d causation. The jury answered that question \u201cno.\u201d That is, Ginsberg would not have died on July 15, but for Nurse Lee\u2019s negligence. The fourth and fifth interrogatories are <em>Scafidi </em>\u201cincreased risk\u201d questions. The jury answered interrogatory four \u201cyes,\u201d but answered interrogatory five \u201cno.\u201d Considering the jury\u2019s answer to all three questions, it found that plaintiff met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>higher burden of proof but not the lesser one. Thus, the answers are facially inconsistent; undoubtedly the result of mixing the two concepts of causation together without explanation. Had the jury been properly instructed on \u201cbut for\u201d causation (the higher standard of proof) we would consider molding the verdict and remanding only for a trial on the issue of damages. However, the trial judge did not instruct the jury on \u201cbut for\u201d causation, or otherwise explain that an affirmative answer to interrogatory three meant that they did not have to address questions four and five. Thus, we cannot be sure that the jury understood the issue that it was addressing when it answered interrogatory three.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In conclusion, we are satisfied that the judge\u2019s combining the two concepts in the interrogatories confused the jury and was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Plaintiff maintains that the trial judge committed reversible error when she excluded testimony of Dr. Green as to how the overdose resulted in Ginsberg\u2019s death. Dr. Green was only permitted to testify as to what he personally observed and the treatment he rendered for Ginsberg. Because Dr. Green was not named as an expert witness for the plaintiff and had not provided a report to defense counsel, he was not permitted to testify as to his opinions regarding Ginsberg\u2019s condition or what he thought was the cause of Ginsberg\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">It is well settled that treating physicians may testify as to any subject relevant to the evaluation and treatment of them patients. <em>Stigliano v. Connaught Labs., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>305, 658 A.2d 715 (1995). In <em>Stigliano, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the Appellate Division\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding testimony by the plaintiffs treating physician as to the cause of her seizure disorder. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 658 A.2d 715. The Court reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>that \u201c[b]ecause the determination of the cause of a patient\u2019s illness is an essential part of diagnosis and treatment, a treating physician may testify about the cause of a patient\u2019s disease or injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 658 A.2d 715. The principle announced in <em>Stigliano </em>is equally applicable here. Therefore, the exclusion of Dr. Green\u2019s testimony regarding the cause of Mr. Ginsberg\u2019s death on July 15, 1990, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The exclusion of Dr. Green\u2019s proposed testimony was especially unfair and prejudicial in light of the fact that the defense was permitted to use the death certificate that Dr. Green had signed as support for its position. Defense counsel questioned Dr. Green as to the causes of death that he placed on the certificate, but Dr. Green was not permitted to explain how he came to those conclusions. Further, the defense expert alluded to the death certificate as support for his conclusion that the insulin overdose was not a substantial factor in Ginsberg\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Plaintiff also asserts that the trial judge committed reversible error when she: (1) allowed defendants to argue that the family\u2019s decision not to use extraordinary measures was the cause of death; and (2) refused to instruct the jury not to consider the role that the do not resuscitate (DNR) decision played in Ginsberg\u2019s death. In her brief, defendant denies that the defense suggested that the DNR decision was a substantial factor in Ginsberg\u2019s death on July 15. After reviewing the trial record, we agree with plaintiffs position that the argument was made; that is was improper; and that it was capable of producing an unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">When Ginsberg became comatose following the overdose, Dr. Green met with the Ginsberg family, and together they decided whether to employ extraordinary measures in the event of cardiac arrest. The Ginsbergs based their decision not to use extraordinary measures upon Dr. Green\u2019s advice and the quality of Ginsberg\u2019s life in the event such measures were used. When Ginsberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>went into cardiac arrest on July 15, 1990, no extraordinary measures were used to save his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Despite the assertion to the contrary in defendant\u2019s brief, Dr. Scotti testified that the decision not to resuscitate Ginsberg was a substantial factor in his death. Dr. Scotti\u2019s testimony as to this issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">He was put into the intensive care unit to watch his blood sugars and to make sure that he didn\u2019t have a problem with seizures or a heart attack or a rhythm problem, but at the same time when they decided to put him in, the decision was made to make him a no code, or do not resuscitate. Now what that means is no extraordinary measures are going to take place, <em>I think that decision was a major reason for his death on the 15th, </em>and that is as he got sicker, as his heart disease progressed, whether it was because he had more fluid or because it was a natural progression of the heart disease, or some combination, the decision was made not to treat him aggressively and to basically let him die a natural death instead of keeping him alive by extraordinary means, [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Additionally, defense counsel used this point in his summation to infer that the DNR decision was a substantial factor in Ginsberg\u2019s death. The pertinent part of the summation is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">So, was the injection a substantial factor? Dr. Scotti says no, nobody disputes that. I don\u2019t think Dr. Munoz disputes that. I don\u2019t even know if he was asked that question. And we have \u2014 without trying to \u2014 or without wanting to offend anybody, but in the same time \u2014 in the same way wanting to defend my client as I am sworn to do, what about that no code? Was that a cause of Ginsberg\u2019s death? Because Dr. Scotti says that code was reversible. Now we don\u2019t know the quality of Mr. Ginsberg \u2014 what quality of life would have been after that, and no one can say except the Lord whether it would have been reversed, but Dr. Scotti said it was reversible____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">And that decision was made by the Ginsberg family with Dr. Green. The conversation probably words to the effect, ... \u201cIt appears to me, from the point of view of a doctor, with all the diseases and now we have the overdose that perhaps if he has a heart attack we should not call the code team. We should not try to keep Mr. Ginsberg alive, but that Mrs. Ginsberg and Mr. Ginsberg is your decision.\u201d And they decided accordingly. It\u2019s how can you make that decision and then blame it on Mary Lee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The jury\u2019s answer to the fifth interrogatory reflects that it may very well have relied upon Dr. Scotti\u2019s testimony to conclude that there was a factor which was a more substantial cause of Ginsberg\u2019s death on July 15 than the overdose of insulin. Both Dr. Scotti\u2019s testimony and defense counsel\u2019s argument urged that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The DNR decision however, was simply not relevant. The defense\u2019s suggestion that the decision was a substantial factor in Ginsberg\u2019s death was error. There was no suggestion or evidence in this case that the DNR decision was medically or ethically inappropriate. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of Quinlan, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>10, 355 A.2d 647, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>922, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>319, 50 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d 289 (1976); <em>In the Matter of Peter, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>365, 529 A.2d 419 (1987); <em>see also In re Dinnerstein, </em>6 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>466, 380 N.E.2d 134, 139 (1978) (DNR decision found to present a question peculiarly within the competence of the medical profession of what measures are appropriate to ease the imminent passing of an irreversibly, terminally ill patient in light of the patient\u2019s history and condition and the wishes of the family). Nor was there any testimony before the jury as to what Ginsberg\u2019s life would have been like had extraordinary measures been used to resuscitate him. To argue and imply that the family\u2019s decision not to use extraordinary efforts to resuscitate Ginsberg was a substantial factor in his death is not only offensive but contrary to established tort law. It is well settled that a tortfeasor is liable for the natural and probable consequences of the tortious act. <em>Ciluffo v. Middlesex General Hosp., </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 482, 370 A.2d 57 (App.Div.1977). When as here, a medical professional commits an act of negligence having the capacity to accelerate the death of a patient, the medical professional can reasonably foresee that the patient, if competent to do so, or his family with the assistance of health care professionals, may be confronted with decisions affecting the quality of the patient\u2019s life. Where there is a decision not to employ extraordinary means in a situation precipitated in whole or in part by the negligence of the medical professional, such a decision may not be used to relieve the negligent medical professional of responsibility based on any theory of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment under review is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial limited to the issues of proximate causation and, if appropriate, damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-18\"> Plaintiff does not challenge the liability verdict in favor of Dr. Truitt on appeal. The remaining defendants were dismissed prior to trial and are not affected by this appeal. Thus, the only defendant participating in the appeal is defendant Mary Lee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-12\"> Hypergammaglobulinemia is a disturbance of the blood protein so that a certain portion of the body's proteins are elevated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> There was no testimony from any of the physicians describing what Ginsberg\u2019s quality of life would have been if extraordinary efforts were used to keep him alive after the insulin overdose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> It should be noted, however, that Dr. Green was deposed prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
