The issue to be decided is whether Princeton must cover Dr. Chunmuang under its malpractice insurance policy and pay compensatory damages for the emotional distress sustained by Davis resulting from Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s sexual assault on Davis during the course of a gynecological examination. We conclude that the policy covers Dr. Chunmuang for such damages and that Princeton must make payment thereof to Davis. We affirm the judgment under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Davis instituted suit against Dr. Chunmuang alleging medical malpractice, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, sexual assault, and assault and battery, stemming from an examination conducted by Dr. Chunmuang in his office on an unspecified date in October 1992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Davis sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Dr. Chunmuang was apparently served with the complaint but did not file an answer, and a default was entered against him. The Law Division also ordered substituted service on Dr. Chunmuang through his insurer Princeton. Princeton elected not to answer the complaint on his behalf. Instead, Princeton instituted this declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it did not cover Dr. Chunmuang for the damages claimed by Davis. Davis was named as an interested party and answered the complaint. Dr. Chunmuang did not answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">After this action was instituted, Davis arranged for a proof hearing on the default that she had taken against Dr. Chunmuang. Princeton received notice of the hearing and appeared solely for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the purpose of having Davis accept service of its declaratory judgment complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Princeton did not participate in the default hearing but agrees to be bound by the Law Division judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Davis concedes that she is also bound by those findings. At the default proof hearing, Davis testified that, on an unspecified date in November 1992, she visited Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s office.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The purpose of the visit was to have a gynecological examination, since she was experiencing cramping and had not had a menstrual cycle. Davis, who was seventeen years old at the time, had never had a gynecological examination. She said that Dr. Chunmuang started the examination of her vaginal area with an instrument but then began using his fingers and twisting his hand as he did so. During the examination, the doctor asked her whether she had a boy friend and whether she had sex. When Davis said that she had not had sex, the doctor asked her why she did not. Davis developed a feeling that the doctor was going beyond what was necessary to examine her. Consequently, she attempted to withdraw from his touch, but he kept pulling her down on the table toward him. This happened three times over the course of five to ten minutes. When the vaginal examination was completed, Dr. Chunmuang examined her breasts. In doing so, the doctor kept rubbing her breasts. Davis knew from what she had read about breast examinations that the type of rubbing the doctor was doing was not normal. She became \u201cvery upset\u201d during the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Although Dr. Chunmuang wanted Davis to return for another examination in a few weeks, Davis knew that she would never return. She said that the examination made her \u201cfeel dirty\u201d and \u201ckind of ashamed.\u201d She testified that she currently felt \u201cde- . pressed or whatever\u201d when she thinks about having another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>gynecological examination, and, consequently, has not been examined again. At the time of the proof hearing, Davis was almost twenty-one years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The record of the proof hearing also revealed that, shortly after the examination, Davis gave a statement to the county prosecutor. Other patients of Dr. Chunmuang apparently had similar experiences and also reported their experiences to the prosecutor. Dr. Chunmuang was indicted on several counts, including the complaint lodged by Davis. Thereafter, Dr. Chunmuang entered into a plea agreement, wherein he agreed to plead guilty to several counts of the indictment. The count involving Davis, however, was not one of the counts to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The Board of Medical Examiners also presented a verified complaint against Dr. Chunmuang based upon five specific incidents in which he performed gynecological examinations on five different patients, including Davis, for the purpose of \u201cpersonal gratification.\u201d As a result of the administrative hearing concerning the revocation of Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s license, at which Dr. Chunmuang testified, the Board revoked his license to practice medicine in New Jersey. In doing so, the Board adopted the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that \u201cDr. Chunmuang touched and rubbed the vaginas and breasts of four adult female patients in a sexual manner or for sexual purposes, without medical purpose[.]\u201d Although Davis did not testify at the license suspension hearing, she offered the findings of the Board at the default hearing to prove Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s liability as to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Judge Mandak, who presided over the proof hearing, made the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">The Court has considered the testimony of Ms. Davis with respect to the incident with Dr. Chunmuang and is satisfied that that testimony reflects activity and action on the part of the doctor, which were not only a deviation from accepted standards but clearly a criminal act in the sense of amounting to a sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Although \u201cat a loss a little bit as to what the compensatory damages should be,\u201d apparently in light of the sparse testimony on the subject, the judge awarded compensatory damages of $50,000 and punitive damages in the same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The summary judgment motion in this declaratory judgment action was heard by another Law Division judge, Judge McVeigh. She had before her the transcript of the proof hearing, the Princeton insurance policy, and the briefs of the parties. She noted that Judge Mandak had found both an act of medical malpractice and a criminal act resulting from the examination of Davis. Judge McVeigh found it significant, in the context of the coverage issue, that Judge Mandak had awarded compensatory damages for the malpractice and punitive damages for the criminal act. Consequently, she concluded that there was coverage for the compensatory damages under the terms of the Princeton policy. Princeton has appealed from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The question of coverage must necessarily begin with an analysis of the terms of the policy. In the indemnity section of the policy Princeton agreed, in pertinent part, to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah4\">pay all amounts up to the limit of liability which you become legally obligated to pay as a result of injury \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 caused by a \u201cmedical incident\u201d arising out of your supplying ... professional services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The exclusion section of the policy, however, provided that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">insurance does not apply for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">(a) injury resulting from your performance of a criminal act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">A \u201cmedical incident\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201cany act ... in the furnishing of the professional medical ... services by you[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az2\">We construe the Princeton policy to mean that there will be coverage for \u201cinjury\u201d resulting from \u201cprofessional services\u201d unless the \u201cinjury\u201d results from a \u201ccriminal act.\u201d Davis does not dispute the finding that Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s conduct was criminal. However, she maintains that because the sexual assault took place during the course of a consented to gynecological examination, Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s injurious' acts resulted from \u201cprofessional services,\u201d as defined in the policy. Specifically, she argues that the \u201cservices performed and the assault are intertwined and inseparable.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The policy terms here involved have not been construed in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>We agree with the reasoning of <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company v. Asbury, </em>149 <em>Ariz. </em>565, 720 P.2d 540 (Ct.App.1986) on this issue. There the court held that a physician\u2019s intentional and improper manipulations during a gynecological examination were covered by his professional liability policy. The court explained its holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">The claims of Dr. Asbury\u2019s patients that he manipulated their clitorises while performing routine gynecological examination, if true, was tortious conduct committed while providing professional services and covered by his insurance policy. Most of the cases cited to us by St. Paul are distinguishable because the tortious sexual abuse of the patient was not intertwined with and inseparable from the services provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\"><em>[Id., </em>720 <em>P.2d </em>at 542.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The holding in <em>Asbury </em>is supported in other jurisdictions. <em>See St. Paul Fire And Marine Insurance Company v. Shernow, </em>222 <em>Conn. </em>823, 610 A.2d 1281, 1285 (1992); <em>Vigilant Insurance Co. v. Kambly, </em>114 <em>Mich.App. </em>683, 319 N.W.2d 382 (1982); <em>Cotton v. Kambly, </em>101 <em>Mich.App. </em>537, 300 <em>N.W.2d </em>627 (1981). However, it has been considered to be the minority view by one court. <em>Snyder v. Major, </em>789 <em>F.Supp. </em>646, 650 (S.D.N.Y.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The <em>Asbury </em>court, in rejecting the insurance carrier\u2019s argument that the result reached would be against public policy, held that the public policy of the state favored protecting the interests of injured parties, the innocent victims, saying: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>It should be noted that the insurance policy in <em>Asbury </em>did not contain a provision excluding coverage for criminal acts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Finally, St. Paul asks us to reverse the trial court because affirmance would be against public policy and provide indemnification of a physician for performing antisocial, illegal, immoral and unprofessional acts. We disagree and hold that the public policy of Arizona favors protecting the interests of injured parties. As the court stated in <em>Vigilant Insurance v. Kambly, supra:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">\u201cInitially, it is unlikely that the insured was induced to engage in the unlawful conduct by reliance upon the insurability of any claims arising therefrom or that allowing insurance coverage here would induce future similar unlawful conduct by practitioners. Not does it appear that the policy was obtained in contemplation of a violation of the law.... Furthermore, coverage does not allow the wrongdoer unjustly to benefit from his wrong. It is not the insured who will benefit, but the innocent victim who will be provided compensation for her injuries ... In this instance, there is great public interest in protecting the interests of the injured party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\"><em>[Id., </em>720 P.2d at 542 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>New Jersey insurance law likewise is committed to the principle of protecting injured innocent victims by finding coverage in them favor, notwithstanding the fact that to insure the type of conduct of the insured may be against public policy or expressly excluded by the insurance policy itself \u2014 e.g., a criminal or intentional act. See <em>Ambassador Insurance Company v. Montes, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>477, 388 A.2d 603 (1978); <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Company, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 267 A.2d 7 (1970). This is particularly so, where, as here, the conduct is otherwise within the coverage of the policy and is intertwined with and inseparable from the prohibited conduct. <em>See also, St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>164 <em>Ga.App. </em>215, 296 <em>S.E.2d </em>126 (1982) (the liability policy protects not only the insured but also the injured person).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Accordingly, we find no basis for a ruling that the presence of an exclusionary criminal conduct provision here suffices to distinguish this ease from <em>Asbury </em>and the cases that follow it; for that provision is simply an expression of this state\u2019s public policy in accepting the general principle that an insurer may not contract to indemnify an insured against the civil consequences of his own wilful criminal act. <em>Ambassador, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 483, 388 A.2d 603. That exclusionary provision is not without meaning, however. It serves to highlight the inapplicability of the policy where the criminal conduct is not an inseparable part of providing professional services by the insured physician \u2014 e.g., rape, serious assault, robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Whether the exclusion is based on an express provision or on the public policy prohibition of insurance against criminal conduct, the insurer bears a substantial burden of demonstrating that the loss falls outside the scope of coverage. <em>United Rental Equip. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>92, 99, 376 A.2d 1183 (1977). We conclude that, under the facts of this case, the insurer has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The <em>Burd, </em>case, <em>supra, </em>involved a clause excluding coverage for bodily injury \u201ccaused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.\u201d Burd\u2019s home owners policy provided comprehensive personal liability coverage. The issue was whether the policy covered the liability incurred by Burd when he inflicted shotgun wounds on one D\u2019Agostino. The shooting incident led to Burd\u2019s conviction for atrocious assault and battery. D\u2019Agostino\u2019s civil tort complaint against Burd charged both a negligent and intentional firing of a loaded gun by Burd. The carrier refused to defend the civil suit by reason of the exclusion. Burd defended with his own counsel. D\u2019Agostino was awarded $8,500 against Burd in that action. Burd sued the carrier to recover the amount of the award and costs in defending the tort action. In reversing a summary judgment in favor of Burd, the Court held that the carrier was entitled to try the issue whether \u201cin truth the injuries inflicted on D\u2019Agostino were within the exclusion and hence beyond the policy coverage.\u201d 56 <em>N.J. </em>at 396, 267 A.2d 7. But it held that the carrier was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law by reason of the fact that Burd had been convicted of atrocious assault and battery. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">... D\u2019Agostino was made a party to this suit, although we do not know what position, if any, he took. If D\u2019Agostino asserts a claim against the carrier, he could not be concluded by the judgment of conviction. By statute, <em>N.J.S.A. 17:28-2, </em>an injured claimant has an interest in a liability policy ... and is entitled to be heard as to coverage____ A claimant\u2019s interest is derivative of the insured\u2019s (absent a statute providing otherwise) and it is therefore reasonable to admit the judgment of conviction in his suit for whatever evidential worth it may have. But the claimant may not be estopped by a judgment entered in a proceeding begun after he was injured if he was not a party to it. Hence, D\u2019Agostino is not precluded by the criminal conviction ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">But other values are involved in the insurance controversy. The exclusion of intentional injury from coverage stems from a fear that an individual might be encouraged to inflict injury intentionally if he was assured against the dollar consequence. Ruvolo <em>v. American Casualty Co., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>490, 496, 189 A.2d 204 (1963). Pulling the other way is the public interest that the victim be compensated, and the victim\u2019s rights being derivative from the insured\u2019s, the victim is aided by the narrowest view of the policy exclusion consistent with the purpose of not encouraging an intentional attack. And the insured, in his own right, is also entitled to the maximum protection consistent with the public purpose the exclusion is intended to serve. Accordingly, we held in <em>Ruvolo, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>at 498, 189 A.2d 204 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>that the concept of insanity relevant to the exclusion clause of a liability policy was more expansive than the concept of insanity accepted in the defense of a criminal charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">The burden is the carrier\u2019s to bring the case within the policy exclusion____ Thus, as to intoxication, although in the criminal trial the jury was instructed that it was the defendant\u2019s burden to prove and persuade that he was so intoxicated as not to be able to form the intent to commit the atrocious assault and battery, here the burden would be the carrier\u2019s to prove and persuade that the injuries were within the exclusion, i.e., that the insured, notwithstanding his intoxication, formed an intent to injure D\u2019Agostino and fired the gun to that end. The allocation of the burden of persuasion being different, the criminal conviction, although admissible for whatever value a jury may give it, cannot be held to conclude the case against the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[56 <em>N.J. </em>at 397, 398, 399, 267 A.2d 7 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In <em>Ruvolo v. American Cas. Co., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>490, 498, 189 A.2d 204 (1963), the Court said that \u201cthe insured is entitled to protection to the full extent that any reasonable interpretation [of the exclusionary clause] will permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In <em>Ambassador Insurance Company v. Montes, supra, </em>which did not involve an exclusionary clause relating to intentional or criminal acts, Satkin, the insured in a comprehensive general liability policy, had been convicted of arson and felony murder for having intentionally caused a fire, which took four lives. The carrier refused to defend an action against Satkin on behalf of one of the decedents, Perez, whose estate administrator was Montes. It brought a declaratory judgment proceeding in which both Satkin and Montes were defendants. The Appellate Division, noting that the policy did not contain an express exclusion for the consequences of intentional wrongdoing, held that such omission was immaterial because public policy prohibited indemnity for the civil consequences of one\u2019s intentional wrongdoing. It held that since Satkin did not intend to injure or kill anyone, the criteria for such a public policy exclusion from coverage had not been met and there was coverage. It found such criteria to be a specific intent to inflict the injuries that occurred or knowledge that the injuries were substantially certain to follow performance of the intentional act. The Supreme Court agreed with the result reached, but not for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The Court found the carrier\u2019s obligation \u2014 to defend and pay on behalf of the insured the amounts due on account of the injuries and death of Perez \u2014 was obvious on the face of the policy. It then addressed the sole argument of the carrier: that public policy prohibits insurance indemnity for the civil consequences of an insured\u2019s intentional wrongdoing. In rejecting this argument, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[We] have accepted the general principle that an insurer may not contract to indemnify an insured against the civil consequences of his own wilful criminal act</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">However, this principle is not to be applied under all circumstances. Certainly it should not come into play when the wrongdoer is not benefitted and an innocent third person receives the protection afforded by the insurance. Recovery has been allowed to cover losses occasioned by an intentional act of the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">When the insurance company has contracted to pay an innocent person monetary damages due to any liability of the insured, such payment when ascribable to a criminal event should be made so long as the benefit thereof does not enure to the assured. In furtherance of that justifiable end, under most circumstances it is equitable and just that the insurer be indemnified by the insured for the payment to the injured party. In subrogating the insurer to the injured person\u2019s rights so that the insurer may be reimbursed for its payment of the insured\u2019s debt to the injured person, the public policy principle to which we adhere, that the assured may not be relieved of financial responsibility arising out of his criminal act, is honored. The insurer\u2019s discharge of its contractual obligations by payment to an innocent injured third person will further the public interest in compensating the victim. <em>See Burd v. Sussex Mutual Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 393, 267 A.2d 7 (1970)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">Here the comprehensive general liability insurance policy expressly and clearly obligated the plaintiff insurance company to pay on Satkin\u2019s behalf those sums which Satkin was legally indebted to pay as damages because of personal injury to and the death of Marilyn Ortega Perez. The plaintiff insurance company cannot and should not escape from that duty on the ground that the damages were due to its assured\u2019s criminal act. However, Satkin should not receive or be entitled to the benefit of the insurer\u2019s payment and the insurer\u2019s right of subrogation should accomplish that end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 483, 484, 486, 388 A.2d 603 (citations omitted).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">In Ms concurring opinion Justice PasMnan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">... as between the liability insurer and an innocent third party it is better policy to place the risk of loss with the insurer where the intent to injury [his tenants] ... is unclear\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>While the issue need not be reached here, it is my opinion that the so-called public policy against covering an insured for his intentional torts should be reexamined. This is particularly so where, as here, a subrogation theory exists so that the tortfeasor can in no way profit from his intentional wrongful act. With the prospect of criminal sanction and the spectre of civil liability despite coverage facing any wrongdoer, there is little reason to deny coverage which would protect the innocent injured party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 489, 492, 388 A.2d 603.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">A different result \u2014 finding exclusion of coverage \u2014 has properly been found in cases in which the criminal conduct has no relation at all to the professional service rendered. <em>New Mexico Physicians Mutual Liability Co. v. La Mure, </em>116 <em>N.M. </em>92, 860 P.2d 734 (1993). <em>See </em>cases cited in <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Shernow, supra, </em>610 A.2d at 1284; <em>Snyder v. Major, supra </em>789 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 649-650 \u2014 e.g., no coverage where physician sexually abused three boys during treatment for various medical conditions; where dentist drugged a patient and performed sex on him; or where, while treating a wrist injury, physician drugged the patient and performed sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Courts have allowed coverage where psychiatrists or other mental health professionals are involved in sexual acts with patients, predicated on judicial acceptance of the failure of the professional properly to handle the transference and counter-transference phenomenon \u2014 alleged to be a medically recognized condition. These courts consider such transference as an integral part of therapy and thus sexual contact between therapist and patient are seen as foreseeably arising from such professional services. We are inclined to agree with Judge Kimba Wood\u2019s comments in <em>Snyder, supra, </em>that there is no meaningful distinction between \u201cmishandling the transference phenomenon and mishandling a person\u2019s genitals.\u201d 789 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 649-650.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>over, we believe that allowance of coverage for injuries suffered by a victim of a gynecologist\u2019s excessive examination of sexual organs is on a firmer legal footing than the mental health professional coverage based on the psychiatric theory of transference, even though expert evidence supported that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that Judge McVeigh properly found the carrier liable for the malpractice of its insured, Dr. Chunmuang, that resulted in injury to Ms. Davis. It was an injury resulting from a \u201cmedical incident\u201d arising out of [his] supplying of professional services.

F.<em>G. v. Rev. Alex MacDonell, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. 262, </em>677 A.2d 258 (App.Div. 1996), approved lor publication June 14, 1996.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b395-8\">KEEFE, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIlu\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The majority concludes that Princeton must indemnify its insured, Dr. Chunmuang, for the emotional distress damages sustained by the insured\u2019s patient, June Davis, resulting from the insured\u2019s criminal sexual assault during the course of a gynecological examination, despite a clear exclusion in the policy for injuries resulting from such conduct. Princeton\u2019s recourse, according to the majority, is to seek indemnification from its insured. In coming to that conclusion, the majority essentially relies upon <em>Ambassador Insurance Company v. Montes, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>477, 388 A.2d 603 (1978), a case I believe to be clearly inapposite to these facts. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The majority concedes that the Princeton policy provides \u201ccoverage for \u2018injury\u2019 resulting from \u2018professional services\u2019 unless the \u2018injury\u2019 results from a \u2018criminal act.\u2019 \u201d (Op. at 354, 678 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>1146). The majority also acknowledges Davis\u2019s concession that the insured\u2019s conduct was criminal. <em>Ibid. </em>It is clear that the parties and this court are bound by that concession and Princeton\u2019s stipulation that Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s conduct was criminal. <em>Ambassador Insurance, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 480, 388 A.2d 608. Yet, notwithstanding its binding effect on us, the majority concludes, without being asked to do so, that Princeton has failed to carry its burden of \u201cdemonstrating that the loss falls outside the scope of coverage.\u201d (Op. at 356, 678 A.2d at 1147). No explanation for that conclusion is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Inasmuch as both the indemnity clause and the exclusion clause of the subject policy focuses on the cause of the injury, the nature of the injury claimed is an important factor in determining coverage. Simply stated, if the claimed \u201cinjury\u201d results from a \u201ccriminal act\u201d it is not covered by the policy. The majority fails to acknowledge the uncontroverted fact that the injury for which Davis sought compensatory and punitive damages resulted solely from the insured\u2019s criminal act. Stated somewhat differently, but for Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s criminal act, Davis would have suffered no compensable injury. Therefore, on this record, Davis\u2019s injuries are clearly excluded by the plain language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Davis\u2019s argument that the \u201c \u2018services performed and the assault are intertwined and inseparable\u2019 \u201d (Op. at 355, 678 A.2d at 1146), is relevant only in the context of deciding whether Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cprofessional services\u201d within the meaning of the policy. As the majority opinion points out, there is some disagreement in the case law on that issue. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company v. Asbury, </em>149 Ariz. 565, 720 P.2d 540, 542 (App.1986), resolved that issue in favor of the patient in a case where the assault took place during a gynecological examination. The court came to that conclusion \u201cbecause the tortious sexual abuse of the patient was ... intertwined with and inseparable from the services provided.\u201d Regardless of whether <em>Asbury </em>expresses the majority or minority view, I am willing to accept its holding for the purpose of this case. That is to say, the totality of Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s conduct must be viewed as having taken place in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the course of rendering \u201cprofessional services\u201d so as to implicate the indemnity clause of the policy. However, as the majority concedes, \u201cthere will be coverage for \u2018injury\u2019 resulting from \u2018professional services\u2019 unless the \u2018injury\u2019 results from a \u2018criminal act.\u2019 \u201d (Op. at 354, 678 A.2d at 1146). Therefore, this case is distinguishable from <em>Asbury </em>because Princeton\u2019s policy excludes injury resulting from a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Reported cases that have addressed this subject where the insurance policy contains such an exclusion have uniformly held that, although the doctor\u2019s conduct may constitute a professional service, where it is also criminal, the exclusion prevents indemnity. <em>New Mexico Physicians Mut. Liability v. LaMure, </em>116 <em>N.M. </em>92, 860 P.2d 734 (1993); <em>Medical Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc\u2019y v. Azzato, </em>94 <em>Md.App. </em>632, 618 A.2d 274, <em>cert. denied, 330 Md. </em>319, 624 A.2d 491 (1993); <em>Rivera v. Nevada Medical Liab. Ins. Co., </em>107 <em>Nev. </em>450, 814 P.2d 71 (1991); <em>Govar v. Chicago Ins. Co., </em>879 F.2d 1581 (8th Cir.1989). Despite the majority\u2019s effort to distinguish such cases on the ground that the insured\u2019s criminal conduct in each of them was not related to the professional services to be rendered by the insured, I find nothing in those opinions to suggest that the exclusion was enforced on that basis. Rather, the difference in the result turned on the presence of an exclusion against indemnity for criminal acts while Dr. Asbury had no such exclusion in his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The majority concedes that <em>Asbury </em>is distinguishable from this case because of the exclusion but reasons that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">New Jersey insurance law likewise is committed to the principle of protecting injured innocent victims by finding coverage in their favor, notwithstanding the fact that to insure the type of conduct of the insured may be against public policy or expressly excluded by the insurance policy itself \u2014 e.g, a criminal or intentional act. <em>See Ambassador Insurance Company v. Montes, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>477, 388 A.2d 603 (1978); <em>Burd v. Sussex Mutual Insurance Company, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 267 A.2d 7 (1970). This is particularly so, where, as here, the conduct is otherwise within the coverage of the policy and is intertwined with and inseparable from the prohibited conduct. [Opinion at 356, 678 A.2d at 1147.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">I respectfully suggest to my colleagues that neither <em>Ambassador </em>nor <em>Burd </em>stand for the proposition that coverage will be afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>in the face of an exclusion barring indemnity for criminal acts such as occurred in this case. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the <em>Ambassador </em>holding does not apply where, as in this case, the policy contains a specific exclusion for the insured\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Malee, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 514 A.2d 832 (1986). It is clear that the holding in <em>Ambassador </em>which directed the insurer to indemnify against the insured\u2019s intentional behavior while subrogating the insurer to the victims\u2019 rights against the insured, turned on the absence of an exclusion against intentional conduct. The Court in <em>Malee, supra, </em>observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><em>Ambassador </em>was decided by a divided Court. The appeal produced three opinions. Neither time nor the opportunity for further deliberation has altered the conscientiously held views of the remaining members who participated in <em>Ambassador. </em>The Court is therefore not of one mind on the broad policy question whether, <em>in the absence of a specific exclusion, </em>a liability insurer can nevertheless be called on to indemnify a wrongdoer for his intentional misconduct that results in liability to an innocent third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 12, 514 A.2d 832 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Bur\u00f3., supra, </em>is also inapposite to these facts. It simply stands for the proposition that both the insured and the injured claimant have the right to a plenary trial on the question of whether the insured\u2019s conduct fits within the exclusionary language of the policy where the question is whether the insured\u2019s otherwise intentional act was performed with the intention to injure. 56 <em>N.J. </em>at 397-398, 267 A.2d 7. That simply is not the issue in this case. Davis concedes that the insured\u2019s conduct constituted a criminal act, and does not argue that her injuries flowed from any source other than the sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Further, it is clear from this record that Davis had no difficulty separating Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s professional conduct from his criminal conduct in the course of the gynecological examination. It is because she appreciated the difference between the two that she reported the event to the county prosecutor. It is also clear from Davis\u2019s testimony that her emotional distress injury flowed directly from her perception that Dr. Chunmuang went far beyond the scope of his professional services during the examination. Thus, there is no justification for ignoring the clear exclusion in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Princeton policy because of some imagined inability to separate the professional service from the criminal conduct. If a seventeen year old patient had no difficulty doing so, this court should have no difficulty. The patient\u2019s expectations regarding coverage can rise no higher than Dr. Chunmuang\u2019s. Neither could possibly be confused by the policy language as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Inasmuch as an exclusion denying coverage for injuries stemming from criminal acts does not violate public policy, where the facts of the case clearly fit within the exclusion, the insurer should not be required to indemnify its insured against such acts. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Schmitt, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>619, 570 A.2d 488 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>395, 585 A.2d 394 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">I would reverse the judgment under review and direct the entry of judgment for Princeton.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
