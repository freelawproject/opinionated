L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. He is here on an assignment of errors, arguing to us only two of the four that he originally alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">1. The defendant bases his first assignment on G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 343, which makes mandatory upon the respective officers in charge of prisoners that they notify any prisoner currently serving time of any \u201cuntried indictment, information or complaint . . . pending in any court in the commonwealth against . . . [him].\u201d The prisoner then has the right to apply to the court in which the charges are pending for \u201cprompt trial or other disposition\u201d of the charges. The statute further requires that \u201c[a]ny such prisoner shall, within six months after such application is received by the court, be brought into court for trial or other disposition of any . . , indictment, information or complaint, unless the court shall otherwise order.\u201d The defendant contends that the requirements of the statute were not satisfied because he filed such an application on July 3, 1969, while confined at the Correctional Institution at Walpole on an unrelated charge but his trial did not take place until April 6, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">We note, however, that the defendant\u2019s application was with reference to a warrant against him for armed robbery issued from the Municipal Court of the Roxbury District on September 4, 1968. That warrant is not before us, and the sole evidence here that it and the indictment dated October 15,1969, on which the defendant was tried and convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>in the Superior Court in Suffolk County related to the same crime is the bare statement of counsel for the defendant to that effect. In fact, the defendant testified he had never seen the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Assuming, however, that the warrant and the subsequent indictment related to the same offence, there was still no violation of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 72A, which requires that the application under it be to the court in which the charges are pending and that that court bring him to trial \u201cor other disposition\u201d within six months. The Municipal Court from which the 1968 warrant issued had power only to arraign him on the charge of armed robbery (G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>331 Mass. 510) and, in fact, the defendant was arraigned on November 19, 1969, a little over four months after his application. The fact that this arraignment actually occurred in the Superior Court rather than in the Municipal Court is immaterial. Alternatively, if the application is taken as imposing the six months requirement on the Superior Court, its effective date cannot be -until October 15, 1969, when the indictment was returned, and it appears that the trial was held within six months of that date. Thus the defendant\u2019s first argued assignment lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">2. The defendant charges secondly that an in-court identification of him by one Ahearn, a bank guard who witnessed the robbery, was prejudicially tainted by Ahearn\u2019s intervening identification of him at the Superior Court in Plymouth County where the defendant was standing trial with two other men. Assuming that the identification at the court house was improper since the defendant was not aware of it and was not effectively represented by counsel at that time <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263), it is our view that the voir dire held on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress Ahearn\u2019s identification testimony clearly established that the in-court identification was based on Ahearn's observation at the time of the robbery and was not tainted by this subsequent confrontation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. 250. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Cefalo, </em>357 Mass. 255. Ahearn testified at the voir dire that he observed one of the robbers in the bank from an unobstructed vantage point at a distance of twenty-five feet for eight or nine minutes during the course of the robbery, and that he saw the same individual outside the bank immediately following it from a distance of about twenty feet. A week later he selected the defendant\u2019s picture from a group of seventy-five to one hundred photographs shown to him by the police in circumstances of which the defendant does not complain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge\u2019s finding following the voir dire that \u201cthe present in-court identification . . . is . . . untainted by any matters involved in what occurred at the Plymouth Court\u201d was clearly supported by the evidence which he heard and specifically covers the issue which the defendant now raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The defendant attempts to attach significance to the fact that the trial judge also found the Plymouth identification not in violation of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, supra. </em>Without passing upon whether this finding was error, the fact that the judge went on to find the in-court identification \u201cuntainted\u201d by the Plymouth proceedings indicates that, for purposes of the finding, he was in fact assuming that the Plymouth identification was improper under the <em>Wade </em>case. The judge\u2019s finding on this point was thus harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">This identification was well before the suspect identification in the Superior Court in Plymouth County, which occurred over eight months after the robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
