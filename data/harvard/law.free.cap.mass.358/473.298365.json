L. c. 59, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">The appellants (Ellis) own a parcel of land in the town of Acushnet which is licensed and operated as a mobile home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>park pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32B, as amended. On March 13, 1967, the appellants purchased from the manufacturer, Gibraltar Industries, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland, the factory built prefabricated home that the appellants occupy as a permanent dwelling at the mobile home park. The completely fabricated structure was shipped over the road from Baltimore to the appellants\u2019 parcel of land on the vendor\u2019s axle and wheels with the \u201cI\u201d beams serving as a chassis. The appellants were charged S860.45 \u201cover the road fees which included freight tolls, flag fees and setup charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The issue is whether this dwelling on the appellants\u2019 land is a \u201cmobile home\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L, subject to a license fee under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32G, and free from property tax as provided in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Thirty-sixth, or whether the dwelling constitutes \u201creal estate\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 3, and subject to property taxation under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We summarize the facts as found by the Appellate Tax Board from the evidence which includes building specifications and photographs of the dwelling. The dwelling is described as \u201ca structure approximately 60 feet long by 24 feet wide containing 3 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, dining room, utility room, stairwell to cellar and one and a half baths. There are four doorways, about 14 windows, a vent flue pipe and a chimney on the roof. The exterior is of bonded aluminum siding with ahuninum storm windows, doors and window shutters. The exterior pitched roof has asphalt windseal shingles with full gutters and rainspouts. The interior roof is a <em>%\" </em>plywood sub-ceiling with a acoustical tile ceiling underlined with 2\u201d fiberglass insulation. The walls are supported by 2 by 4 studs with hardwood interior paneling and fiberglass insulation. All of the plumbing, sanitary and electrical facilities are factory installed. This home is resting on, and its frame is solidly attached to, a 10\u201d poured concrete foundation with a full cellar. The base frame is manufactured with supporting metal \u2018I\u2019 beams running across as well as the length of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>home. The cellar contains an oil fired hot water heating furnace and separate 275 gallon oil storage tank. There are no wheels, axle, or hitching post attached to this home nor were these items ever purchased by the appellants. The appellants use and occupy the premises as their year round dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Appellate Tax Board found that \u201cin almost every practical respect concerning the design, architecture, size, accommodations, durability, permanence, character, and use, the structure looks like and serves the purpose of a conventional home . . ..\u201d For purposes of tax classification, the board finds, \u201cin so far as it is a question of fact, that this home is identical to any other conventional home which is classified as real estate under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 3, and taxed pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 38.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The Appellate Tax Board stated, \u201cAlthough G. L. c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 32F and 32L, defines the meaning of a mobile park and a mobile home, a literal reading of these statutes does not foreclose the issue of taxation in every instance.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The law is well settled that land and buildings erected thereon or affixed thereto are properly taxed as a unit and this rule is not affected by private agreements or by the degree of physical attachment to the land. <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Metcalfe, </em>307 Mass. 386, 389, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The initial exemption of certain classes of movable dwellings from the real estate tax came about through St. 1952, c. 583, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. Section 1, amending G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32G, subjected a \u201ctrailer coach\u201d to a license fee but exempted it from a property tax. Section 2 added clause Thirty-sixth to c. 59, \u00a7 5, exempting trailer coaches subject to the license fee from the local property tax. The constitutionality of these statutes was upheld in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>331 Mass. 161, 165. In that case this court said, \u201cIt clearly was the purpose of the Legislature to stop what it regarded as unfairness and abuses arising out of the arbitrary classification of all trailer coaches in trailer coach parks as real estate.\u201d In this connection the Appellate Tax Board stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cBased on specific facts concerning the type of \u2018trailer coaches\u2019 as described and applicable to the <em>Wright </em>case and the legislative intent regarding taxation at the time of this decision, it is clear to this board that the facts and the ruling of the court in the <em>Wright </em>case do not apply to the facts and law applicable to the instant case. The reason for the distinction is the essential change in the concept and structure of a \u2018trailer coach\u2019 and a \u2018mobile home\u2019 resulting from gradual evolution in the concept of moveable living quarters or habitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">By St. 1956, c. 444, inserting \u00a7 32L in c. 140, a statutory definition of a trailer coach was added. This definition stated in part, \u201c. . . \u2018trailer coach\u2019 shall mean any vehicle or object on wheels and having no motive power of its own, but which is drawn by, or used in connection with, a motor vehicle, and which is so designed ... as to permit the use ... for human habitation, whether resting on wheels, jacks or other foundation and shall include the type of vehicle commonly known as a mobile home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Statute 1964, c. 592, \u00a7 14, rewrote G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 32L, by striking out that section and substituting a new section, eliminating all reference to \u201ctrailer coaches,\u201d and defining \u201cmobile home\u201d for the first time as follows: \u201cAs used in sections thirty-two A to thirty-two K, inclusive, the words \u2018mobile home\u2019 shall mean a dwelling unit built on a chassis and containing complete electrical, plumbing and sanitary facilities, and designed to be installed on a temporary or permanent foundation for permanent living quarters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The Mobile Homes Commission was created by St. 1962, c. 487, \u00a7 2. The first report of the commission gives a history and evolution from the small mobile camp travel trailer to the present mobile home structure. The commission reported in part, \u201cSince the definition of a trailer coach was adopted in 1956, the travel trailer and the mobile home have become two different products. Now that the Department of Public Health has adopted Sanitary Code, Article VIII, regulating camp grounds, including travel trailer parks, Chapter 140 need no longer refer to travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>trailers. This being the case, it appears very desirable to the commission to have the definition of a mobile home properly describe the current property on the market.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In its reports the commission strongly recommended to the Legislature that mobile homeowners be taxed on the same basis under c. 59, \u00a7 38, as conventional homeowners and the exemption allowed under c. 59, \u00a7 5, Thirty-sixth, be repealed as to certain mobile homes. However, no specific recommendation concerning taxation had been presented by the Mobile Homes Commission to the Legislature before the enactment of St. 1964, c. 592. We conclude from this chronology that the Legislature in St. 1964, c. 592, was not concerned with taxation but rather desired to deal with other problems. A contrary construction of this statute would create a dual standard of taxation and thus present a serious question as to its constitutionality in view of the similarity between the mobile home as described in the legislation and the traditional dwelling subject to a real estate tax. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 724; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>332 Mass. 769, at 779; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>344 Mass. 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Article 10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution states in part, \u201cEach individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standing laws. He is obliged consequently, to contribute his share to the expense of this protection . . ..\u201d In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 724, 729, the court said, \u201cIt seems plain that a tax assessed upon most property at the current rate but upon other property at a lower rate ... is not \u2018proportional\u2019 to property owned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The constitutionality of a statute should be sustained in absence of evidence clearly to the contrary, since not only is a statute presumed to be constitutional but it must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts on that score. All rational presumptions are made in favor of every legislative enactment, and invalidity will be found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>only when a statute is in manifest excess of legislative power. <em>Mansfield Beauty Academy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Hairdressers, </em>326 Mass. 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We conclude that there was no error in the decision of the Appellate Tax Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
