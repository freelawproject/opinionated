L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, seeking review of the decisions of the Department of Public Welfare (department) denying the petitioners\u2019 claims, under G. L. c. 118 and c. 118D respectively,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for counsel fees incurred by them in prosecuting appeals before the department. The trial judge made \"Findings of Fact, Rulings of Law and Orders for Decrees.\u201d Final decrees were entered which \"set aside\u201d the decisions of the department and ordered that the department in each case \"enter a decision that . . . [the petitioner] is entitled to payment for counsel fees in prosecuting an appeal.\u201d The Commissioner of the department (Commissioner) appealed from the final decrees. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The sole issue before the judge was \"whether the [department must order the respective cities\u2019 welfare departments as a matter of law to pay the reasonable counsel fees for services rendered at \u2018fair hearings\u2019 held by the department.\u201d The judge held that counsel was necessary to afford the petitioners a fair hearing under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that they could not have meaningfully prosecuted their appeals from the local agencies without assistance of counsel. The judge found that the petitioners were indigent and ruled that they were entitled to counsel fees incurred in their welfare appeals. He also found that the fees charged were \"fair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The Commissioner contends that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not require the payment of the petitioners\u2019 legal fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In the recent case of <em>Goldberg, Commr. of Social Serv. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U. S. 254, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a welfare recipient is entitled to a pre-termination hearing before welfare benefits are suspended or discontinued and that such hearing must comport with \u201crudimentary\u201d due process standards and afford the recipient \u201can opportunity to confront and cross-examine the witnesses relied on by the department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270. Although recognizing that \u201cjjfjhe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel,\u201d the court nevertheless concluded by stating, \u201cWe do not say that counsel must be provided at the pre-termination hearing, but only that the recipient must be allowed to retain an attorney if he so desires.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We believe that the principles set forth in the Goldberg case are equally applicable to hearings for the determination of original eligibility for public assistance and to hearings for the determination of the propriety of increased disability assistance. While it is clear that the petitioners had the right to retain counsel to prosecute their appeals, \u201cit is elementary that the Constitution does not provide a requirement that the government provide lawyers for litigants in civil matters. Those who suggest the desirability of an American Ombudsman advocate that this be achieved by statute, not because the Constitution ordains it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>McGaughy </em>v. <em>Gardner, Secretary of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, </em>296 F. Supp. 33, 36 (E. D. La).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We perceive no violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in not providing an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>for an appellant at a welfare hearing. The right to appeal is available to all persons, and there is no invidious discrimination in the appeal procedure. The law is equally applicable to all those who wish to pursue \u201cavenues of appellate review.\u201d Compare <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager, Warden, </em>384 U. S. 305, 310-311. This is so irrespective of the fact that some potential recipients may be able to afford counsel and others may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Further, we do not interpret either G. L. c. 118 or c. 118D as being a statutory mandate which entitled the petitioners to payment for legal fees incurred in their welfare appeal hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The decrees are reversed. New decrees are to be entered affirming the decisions of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-10\"> General Laws c. 118 provides, \u201cAid tff\u2019Families with Dependent Children\u201d and c. 118D provides, \u201cAssistance to Persons who are Disabled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> A new regulation by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 34 Fed.
