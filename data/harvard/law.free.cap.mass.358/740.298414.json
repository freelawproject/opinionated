L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from convictions of murder in the first degree of his wife and daughter on or about November 2, 1966. The jury recommended that the death penalty be not imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The defendant argues three points: (a) That the court erred in the admission in evidence of certain incriminating statements made by the defendant on the ground that the defendant was mentally incompetent to make them, (b) That the court erred in admitting hearsay evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition and in not striking out opinion evidence based on this hearsay evidence, (c) That the court erred in submitting to the jury the issue of extreme atrocity and cruelty and in the alternative that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, \u201cis so vague and indefinite, as regards extreme atrocity and cruelty, that it is unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The evidence pertinent to these issues is summarized. The forty-one year old defendant, his wife and four minor children had lived in Kingston, Massachusetts, for several years. The defendant was employed in a local appliance store and enjoyed a favorable reputation in the community. The bodies of the decedents were found in the defendant\u2019s home on November 4, 1966. There was expert testimony that both victims had died approximately twenty-four to forty-eight or as many as seventy-two horns prior to the autopsies performed the evening of November 4. The defendant\u2019s wife Margot Eisen died as the result of an extensive wound over the right eye, inflicted by a heavy, blunt instrument and his fourteen year old daughter Gabrielle Eisen died as a result of multiple (nine) blunt injuries to the head. The examination of an axe found in the defendant\u2019s house revealed the presence of human blood and hairs. Human blood was also found on the defendant\u2019s clothing at the time of his arrest. The defendant was seen by a neighbor going into his house the day following the killings and leaving the house after a brief stay. He was arrested on November 5, 1966, in Connecticut. The defendant was committed for observation to Bridgewater State Hospital on November 7, 1966. On December 2, 1966, no diagnosis had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>made and he. was granted another period of observation. On December 29, 1966, a diagnosis was made of psychotic depressive reaction and he was found to be incompetent to stand trial. Approximately one year later, the defendant was adjudicated as competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Subject to the defendant\u2019s exceptions the following evidence was admitted. On Friday, November 4, 1966, Marcia Reid received a telephone call from the defendant who asked her to call the police; the defendant did not sound excited or disturbed. She turned the telephone over to her husband Kenneth Reid. The defendant told him that he had done something terrible; that his wife and daughter were dead at home, but \u201che couldn\u2019t go through with it with the other children,\u201d and had them locked in a motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">On the morning of November 4, 1966, the defendant telephoned Mrs. Margaret Bernardo and told her that his wife and daughter had been dead at home for two days and that he was in Canada with three of the children. He asked, \u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d On the same day Mrs. Bernardo received a letter in a handwriting similar to the defendant\u2019s. The substance of the letter was that the defendant was in love with Mrs. Bernardo and that he was going to kill himself to prove it. Mrs. Bernardo testified that in early October, 1966, the defendant had forced her car off the road and told her that he hated his wife. \u201cHe wanted me to go away with him, and if I didn\u2019t, that he would kill himself and his wife and his children, because his children and his wife couldn\u2019t get along without him if he were dead.\u201d About one week before November, 1966, Mrs. Bernardo received a telephone call from the defendant who said that he would kill himself and his family if she did not go away with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">James R. Goonan, chief of police of Kingston, testified that on November 5, 1966, the defendant had said to several policemen, \u201cI know I haven\u2019t got to say anything, but I got to say this. How can you people be so nice to me after what I.have done?\u201d One Milton Young, who had been hunting in Connecticut on November 5, 1966, testified that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>fendant approached him and said, \u201cI killed my wife and daughter. Call the police. I\u2019ve had it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Somewhat similar incriminating statements to other people were admitted without objection. Detective Charles Sanga of the Connecticut State police testified that on Saturday, November 5, 1966, he had been called to a State forest in Connecticut. When Detective Sanga saw the defendant, he asked him if be was Karl Eisen, and the defendant replied. \u201cYes I am, I did it, I did it, I did it.\u201d Another State police officer who accompanied Detective Sanga testified to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Dr. Samuel Allen, who was the acting medical director at Bridgewater State Hospital, testified that the defendant was suffering from a psychotic depressive reaction at the time he was admitted to Bridgewater State Hospital on November 7, 1966; that he was rational before that time; and that the onset of the mental illness probably occurred when the defendant became aware that his wife and daughter were dead. In Dr. Allen\u2019s opinion, the principal cause of the illness was the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the deaths and bis possible involvement in them; also for several months the defendant got progressively worse after admission to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Dr. Robert R. Mezer, a psychiatrist called by the de-fence, first saw the defendant on November 11, 1966, and diagnosed his condition as \u201cpsychotic depressive reaction.\u201d This reaction was described as an abnormal sadness, depression and melancholy, a depression where the individual is so ill that he loses contact with reafity and becomes -unaware of what he is doing. In the opinion of Dr. Mezer, the reaction began sometime between March 21, 1966, when Eisen\u2019s wife attempted suicide, and May, 1966, when she was discharged from the hospital. In his opinion, the defendant was suffering from this condition on November 2, 1966, and it prevented the defendant from substantially conforming his behavior to normality or rationality, and the defendant\u2019s confessions and the killings themselves were consistent with a psychotic depressive reaction. If the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>fendant had awakened and found the bodies of his wife and daughter and had had no memory of the events of the preceding evening, in the witness\u2019s opinion, the defendant would have believed that he was responsible for the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The defendant\u2019s past life, as he outlined it to the jury, was fairly uneventful prior to the killings except for a period of years during World War II when he was a German prisoner of war in Russia.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The defendant testified that on Wednesday, November 2, he did not eat all day; late in the evening he bad two small glasses of cognac and a bottle of beer and a sip from a second bottle of beer; he did not feel well \u2014 he was sick to his stomach; he arrived home about 10 or 10:30 p.m.; he felt miserable, he went to bed; the ceiling seemed to be turning. During the night he heard somebody crying. He could not awaken his wife; she did not-move. He went upstairs to his sons\u2019 room and tucked them in bed. He next remembered awakening in broad daylight. He was kneeling by his son Dean\u2019s bed. He went downstairs and saw that his wife was dead. He covered her face with a pillow. He went upstairs and saw that his daughter was dead. The defendant woke up his other children and drove off with them. After completion of the defendant\u2019s direct' testimony counsel moved to strike out the defendant\u2019s \u201cadmissions, confessions or statements.\u201d The court denied the motion and ruled that they were made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"a7b-dedup-0\">In rebuttal for the Commonwealth, Dr. Allen testified that the defendant was normal and rational on November 2 and that on November 3 he was no longer rational, normal and mentally healthy. \u201cI think it came on quite suddenly when he discovered . . . [and] became aware of the enormity of his alleged offense.\u201d Dr. Lawrence J. Barrows, the assistant medical director of the Bridgewater State Hospital testified in rebuttal that the defendant was not suffering from a mental disease or defect on November 2, 1966, and \u201cthat . . . the enormity of the crime involved and the awareness of it suddenly . . . precipitated an acute psychotic depression,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>1. The incriminating statements by the defendant were properly admitted for jury consideration not only as to his guilt but also as evidence of his competency to make them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was for the jury to determine upon all the evidence whether \u201cthe mental infirmities of the defendant deprived him of the faculty of consciousness of the physical acts performed by him, of the power to retain them in his memory, and of the capacity to make a statement of those acts with reasonable accuracy. An insane person is not necessarily an incompetent witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zelenski, </em>287 Mass. 125, 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">2. There is no merit to the contention that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to strike out Dr. Barrows\u2019s opinion evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition. The defendant argues that Dr. Barrows\u2019s opinion was based on hearsay evidence. The short answer to the defendant\u2019s objection is that the hearsay evidence of which he complained was introduced by the defendant while cross-examining Dr. Barrows <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and thereafter the judge properly permitted the prosecution to further question the doctor on the same subject matter. Moreover, as assistant medical director at the Bridgewater State Hospital during the defendant\u2019s confinement, Dr. Barrows had ample basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>for the opinion he expressed concerning the defendant\u2019s mental illness, irrespective of the hearsay evidence. See <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>293 Mass. 454, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">3. The trial judge properly submitted to the jury the issue of extreme atrocity and cruelty. \u201cTo authorize the presiding judge to submit this question to the jury, the evidence must be of such a character as to show that the crime was committed under circumstances indicating something more than ordinary atrocity or cruelty, and manifesting a degree of atrocity or cruelty which must be considered as aggravated and extreme. The nature of a question of this kind is such that it must largely be left to the determination of the jury. Of course, the evidence must be sufficient to justify the judge in submitting the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>265 Mass. 382, 388. In the case at bar, the evidence indicates that Margot Eisen died as the result of an extensive head wound inflicted by a heavy, blunt instrument, perhaps an axe, applied with moderate to severe force. \u201cThis wound was long enough to extend from the hair-covered area of the scalp to the ear; and it had split the skull so that the intracranial cavity, the cavity containing the brain, was open, and one could see the brain through the wound.\u201d The bone of the skull beneath the wound was \u201cfractured to pieces,\u201d and the brain was lacerated deeply. There was medical testimony that the size of the wound indicated that it could have been the result of more than a single blow. Moreover, the jury had the benefit of photographs of the inflicted wound. In the circumstances, we hold that the trial judge did not err in submitting to the jury the question of extreme atrocity or cruelty in the killing of Margot Eisen. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cilbert, </em>165 Mass. 45 (killing apparently done by single blow with an axe); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devereaux, </em>256 Mass. 387, 394 (victim shot once and hit two or three times on the head with a gun. butt); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knowlton, </em>265 Mass. 382, 385, 389 (the victim died from a single severe blow on the head); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>353 Mass. 197, 212-213 (defendants woke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>up the victim, shot him through the chest with a shotgun at close range, and then dragged him to a doorway and let him go, apparently down the stairs).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">4. We hold that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, is not void for vagueness. The statutory language of \u201cextreme atrocity or cruelty\u201d has been applied frequently and for many years. These words convey \u201csufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>332 U. S. 1, 8. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alegata, </em>353 Mass. 287, 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1962, c. 453, \u201cconsigns the facts as well as the law to our consideration, gives us the power and duty exercised by a trial judge on a motion for a new trial, and requires us to consider the whole case broadly to determine whether there was any miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 109. After a very careful examination of the entire record, including more than 700 pages of transcript, \u201cin all aspects of fact and law it is our conclusion that justice does not require another trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>342 Mass. 279, 297, or entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-6\"> Kenneth Reid described his telephone conversation with the defendant on November 4, two days following the homicide. \u201cI\u2019d say at the time he was pretty stable, as far as his voice goes, because I understood everything he told me to do.\u201d The defendant\u2019s voice was no different than the voice he had heard at other times when he talked to him. The witness testified: \u201cHe [the defendant] said that he had done something terrible, that his wife and daughter were dead at the home in Kingston, but he could not go through with it with the other children, that they were locked up in a motel room, they had enough food and drink, and he gave me a telephone number and a room number. ... He just told me to call the police, and he hung up.\u201d This information tallies with that obtained from another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Robert W. Pettit, coowner and manager of a motel in East Hartford, Connecticut, testified that the defendant checked into his motel on November 3, 1966, about 4 p.m.; that he had three children with him; that he inquired as to the location of a drugstore and a restaurant; that on November 4 the defendant inquired as to directions to Cape Cod; and that on both occasions \u201che was neatly dressed, he was shaven, and definitely appeared sober.... He mentioned that he was very tired because he had been driving.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> The judge in reply to defendant\u2019s objection, stated, \u201cOn direct examination he [Dr. Barrows] could not have testified as to any hearsay, but you brought it out in cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
