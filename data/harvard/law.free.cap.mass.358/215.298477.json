His brief, upon his bill of exceptions, argues only that one statement made by him was improperly admitted in evidence. S. J. C. Rule 1:13, 351 Mass. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">Mrs. Gillis testified that she had been married to Gillis in 1958. They had separated many times, most recently in February, 1968. In early April, 1968, she was at her parents\u2019 house. Gillis came to that house about eight days before the assault and was alone with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">The prosecuting attorney asked what discussion she then had carried on with her husband. After objection for Gillis, the prosecuting attorney represented that he would show her to have told Gillis that \u201cshe wanted a divorce,\u201d with the consequence that he became angry and said, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d The judge ruled his statement to be admissible but excluded the rest of the conversation. Gillis\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>saved an exception and then asked that, if any of the conversation were to be admitted, it all be admitted. The judge allowed this to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Mrs. Gillis then testified that she told Gillis she had seen an attorney concerning a divorce and that Gillis \u201chad replied that it would never happen and he would kill her first.\u201d He \u201ctook a large steak knife from . . . ]a] drawer and started to come at her . . . saying, T will kill you. If I can\u2019t have you nobody will.\u2019 \u201d She told him to put down the knife. He then did nothing with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Mrs. Gillis testified also concerning the events on the morning of April 19, 1968. She was with one Jenner and four of her six children in an automobile. The vehicle would not start. Gillis approached the automobile and started fighting with Jenner. She asked Gillis to go into the house. As she walked through the backyard, Gillis \u201cpunched her twice. He kicked in the door.\u201d Inside the house, \u201cshe sat down in a rocking chair . . . with her baby and its bottle in her arms.\u201d She tried to calm Gillis. \u201cHe took a steak knife . . . yelled that he was going to kill her,\u201d and wounded her in the breast and armpit. \u201cThe knife stayed there, and she took it out and threw it towards the kitchen.\u201d He then stabbed her twice in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Gillis relies upon G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20 (as amended through St. 1963, c. 765, \u00a7 3). Tins section reads in part: \u201cAny person of sufficient understanding, although a party, may testify in any proceeding, civil or criminal . . . except as follows: . . . First, Except in a proceeding arising out of ... a contract made by a married woman with her husband and except in a proceeding under . . . [c. 273A] and in a prosecution begun under . . . [\u00a7\u00a7 1-10, inclusive, of c. 273], neither husband nor wife shall testify as to <em>private conversations </em>with the other\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Section 20 has been treated as creating a disqualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>of both spouses to testify to private conversations and not merely a privilege which must be appropriately claimed and may be waived. See <em>Kaye </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>356 Mass. 300, 304. We must decide whether the spontaneous threat (cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>351 Mass. 447, 449-450; <em>Hetel </em>v. <em>Messier\u2019s Diner, Inc. </em>352 Mass. 140, 141-142), in reaction to Mrs. Gillis\u2019s disclosure of her divorce plans, accompanied by the act of seizing a knife, can reasonably be regarded as a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d rather than as essentially an act (see <em>Cashin </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>185 Mass. 543, 545) of abusive verbal assault, which with other evidence permits the inference that Gillis intended to kill his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">No Massachusetts decision in a criminal case appears to be controlling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LePage, </em>352 Mass. 403, 417, fn. 12, and cases cited. In <em>French </em>v: <em>French, </em>14 Gray, 186,188, a libel for divorce, it was said that \u201c[m]ere abusive language addressed by one party to the other, when they were not in conversation, might be the subject of testimony by the party . . . addressed.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jardine, </em>143 Mass. 567, it was held that a wife could testify to exclamations of pain and suffering by her husband when only she was present. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>185 Mass. 96, 97, it was decided that a wife could not testify that her husband, upon coming out of a fit of epilepsy, told her in private that he would drown himself. The court noted that this remark did not come within the language of <em>French </em>v. <em>French, supra, </em>\u201cwhich allows abusive language addressed by a husband in private to his wife to be given in evidence to show abusive treatment.\u201d A private remark by a husband to his wife, that he wished she were dead, was excluded in <em>Sherry </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>265 Mass. 189, 194, as not abusive in character. The statute applies only to private conversations and not to letters. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caponi, </em>155 Mass. 534, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The policy underlying the statutory exclusion of private marital conversations has been much discussed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the policy is to protect the marital relationship or to encourage confidence between spouses (see Wigmore, Evidence [McNaughton rev.] \u00a7\u00a7 2332, 2336), or merely reflects legislative reticence concerning marital confidences (see McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 83, 90), the purpose does not logically extend to words constituting or accompanying abuse, threats, or assaults of which the other spouse is the victim. Statements, not reasonably to be regarded as \u201cconversation,\u201d are not within the statutory prohibition. Even if induced by private conversation, such abusive or threatening words do not have any confidential aspect within the purpose of the protection. We conclude that Gillis\u2019s threats to his wife were not rendered inadmissible by the statute. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"an0-dedup-0\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\"> Clause second of \u00a7 20 reads: \u201cSecond, Except as otherwise provided in ... He. 273, \u00a7 7], neither husband nor wife shall be compelled to testify in the trial of . . . [a] criminal proceeding against the other.\u201d See G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 7, with respect to certain prosecutions under c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10, for desertion and nonsupport.
