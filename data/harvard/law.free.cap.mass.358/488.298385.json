The motion was allowed. The Commonwealth appealed under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, inserted by St. 1967, c, 898, \u00a7 1. The parties stipulated, \u201csolely for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>purposes of . . . [The] motion to dismiss,\u201d that (1) \u201cthe motor vehicle the subject of the larceny alleged . . . was owned by\u201d a resident of Montreal, Canada; (2) the \u201casportation of the . . . vehicle . . . occurred in Montreal . . . and not in Middlesex County\u201d; and (3) there has been no other asportation than that which occurred in Canada. The Commonwealth asserts in its brief, and the defendant does not seem to dispute,* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the motor vehicle, allegedly stolen, was found in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">1. The trial judge obviously dismissed the indictment on the authority of the 1855 decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Uprichard, </em>3 Gray 434. It had previously been stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, 2 </em>Mass. 14, 22-24, that possession in Massachusetts by a thief of goods stolen by him in New Hampshire and transported to Massachusetts constituted larceny in this Commonwealth. See Perkins, Criminal Law, 220-221.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullins, </em>1 Mass. 116, 117; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rand, </em>7 Met. 475-177; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>9 Gray 7; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>123 Mass. 430, 433; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>165 Mass. 526, 538-540; <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>State, </em>258 Atl. 2d (Maine) 269, 270. In the <em>Uprichard </em>case, Chief Justice Shaw, speaking for the court, declined (at p. 439) to extend to a theft, originally taking place in the territory of another nation, the principle that a thief who has brought to Massachusetts goods stolen in another State is guilty of larceny here because of the continuing asportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">When the <em>Uprichard </em>case was decided in 1855, there was little authority concerning the prosecution, in a State of the Union, of a thief who had stolen property in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>country and brought the property into the forum State. In the <em>Uprichard </em>case, this court did not follow <em>State </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>11 Vt. 650, 653-655, which had held that a thief, who had stolen oxen in Canada and taken them to Vermont, could be prosecuted and convicted of larceny in Vermont. The weight of authority, however, now supports the view of the <em>Bartlett </em>case and not that of the <em>Uprichard </em>case. Most decisions, in some instances on the basis of statutory language, have drawn no distinction between instances (a) where the theft originally took place in another State, and (b) where it took place within another nation\u2019s territory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure (1957 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 485, 486, 576; annotation, 156 A. L. R. 862, 877, et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>State, </em>151 Tex. Cr. App. 272, 273-274. For cases dealing with thefts in other States, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Case, </em>49 Cal. 2d 24, 27-28; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pambianchi, </em>139 Conn. 543, 546-547; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palkimas, </em>153 Conn. 555, 561-562; <em>Newlon </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>253 Iowa, 555, 557; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vareen, </em>223 S. C. 34, 35; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutledge, </em>232 S. C. 223, 227-228; <em>Lovelace </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 541, 544-546. Cf. <em>La Vaul </em>v. <em>State, </em>40 Ala. 44, 46-48; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Binney (Pa.) 617; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>24 Ohio St. 166, 171-174.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>2. The distinction drawn in the <em>Uprichard </em>case (3 Gray-434) between bringing into Massachusetts (a) goods stolen in another nation\u2019s territory and (b) goods stolen in another State, is illogical and cannot stand. <em>First, </em>the court\u2019s decision in that case appears to have been largely based (pp. 440-441) on its reluctance to look to the law in force in Nova Scotia to determine in Massachusetts whether the original taking of goods in Nova Scotia constituted larceny under its law. The basis for the court\u2019s reluctance, if indeed it ever was of importance,* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has now been removed by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 233, \u00a7 70, which provides that the courts of the Commonwealth \u201cshall take judicial notice of the law ... of any state ... or of a foreign country whenever the same shall be material.\u201d See <em>De Gategno </em>v. <em>De Gategno, </em>336 Mass. 426, 431. Cf. <em>Tsacoyeanes </em>v. <em>Canadian Pac. Ry. </em>339 Mass. 726, 727-728. <em>Second, </em>the rule laid down in the <em>Uprichard </em>case (even as explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Macloon, </em>101 Mass. 1, 5-6) is inconsistent with the necessities of law enforcement today, when an automobile stolen in Montreal can easily be moved by the thief to Boston the same day. The decision is an unnecessary impediment to effective administration of the criminal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">So far as the <em>Uprichard </em>case draws a distinction between goods stolen outside the United States and those stolen in another State, it no longer represents the law and will not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">3. The defendant suggests in his brief, as a basis for supporting the <em>Uprichard </em>decision, that prosecution and conviction in Massachusetts on the present indictment would not bar a later indictment in Canada for the same alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>theft. The present record presents no question of double jeopardy and the point is not sufficiently argued to require us to consider it. S.J.C. Rule 1:13, 351 Mass. 738. <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 13-14. Nevertheless, we point out that, as early as the <em>Andrews </em>case, 2 Mass. 14, 22, supra, Mr. Justice Sedgwick disposed of this argument summarily.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no suggestion that White has already been tried for larceny in the Province of Quebec. Thus Massachusetts, in any event, is not precluded from trying him. It apparently has taken jurisdiction first and may now proceed to complete the prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>8 Met. 313, 318. We assume, without deciding, that the alleged larceny in Canada and the continuing asportation in Massachusetts are so far separate offences as to permit two prosecutions. See <em>Bartkus </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>359 U. S. 121, 136-139; <em>People ex rel. Heflin </em>v. <em>Silberglitt, </em>2 App. Div. 2d (N. Y.) 767; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lo Cicero, </em>17 App. Div. 2d (N. Y.) 31, 32-35. See also <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>State, </em>109 Ill. 565, 571-576; <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldfarb, </em>97 N. J.

Law Inst., Model Penal Code (Tent, draft no. 5, 1956) \u00a7\u00a7 1.09-1.12, and (proposed official draft, 1962) \u00a7\u00a7 1.07-1.11; Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 485, p. 146; notes 59 Harv.

S. 784, 793-798; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shimman, </em>122 Ohio St. 522, 526-528. We, however, need not determine whether this is the case, in the absence of a prior conviction or acquittal elsewhere based upon some portion of the same alleged sequence of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the stipulation, which seem somewhat inconsistent with the facts as discussed by the parties, may be discharged as improvidently made if in the Superior Court it appears that the defendant stole the motor vehicle in Montreal and brought it, or caused it to be brought, to Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\"> The <em>Andrews </em>case involved a prosecution for receiving stolen goods, not for larceny, but the court\u2019s conclusion on this point is not mere dictum.

The proof of acts elsewhere sufficient to constitute larceny if done in Massachusetts ordinarily (cf. e.g. <em>Banco Nacional de Cuba </em>v. <em>Sabbatino, </em>376 U. S. 398, 413-420) would suffice to show the original taking to be unlawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b505-12\"> The <em>Uprichard </em>case also is somewhat inconsistent with the doctrine (see the <em>Macloon </em>case, <em>supra, </em>pp. 5-8) that one who does a criminal act in one jurisdiction is liable for its continuous operation or its effects in another jurisdiction.
