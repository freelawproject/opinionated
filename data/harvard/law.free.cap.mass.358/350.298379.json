The matter came before the Superior Court in what was essentially a case stated. The plaintiff sought an interpretation of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111D,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which sections have been duly adopted by the city of Holyoke. These sections together provide that police \u201cshall be excused from duty for two days out of every seven without loss of pay\u201d for a total in Holyoke of 104 days in each year \u201cin addition to any annual vacation now or hereafter allowed to . . . [police], and such annual vacation shall not be diminished on account thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">It is the contention of the plaintiff that these provisions read together entitle the police to three or more calendar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>weeks of vacation in addition to their 104 days off in the year. The defendant, however, asserts that the provisions in question entitle the police to only three or more working weeks of vacation; i.e., a twenty-one days\u2019 vacation under c. 41, \u00a7 111D, would include six days of the 104 days off provided by c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The judge held that by the adoption of c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17, the city was \u201crequired to measure the vacation period by calendar-week, which means a seven-day week; and that the 104-day period annually\u201d provided in c. 147, \u00a7 17, \u201cis separate and distinct from the vacation period.\u201d The final decree so provided in substance. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In 1957, five years after the city adopted c. 147, \u00a7 16C, it adopted c. 41, \u00a7 111D, providing for three or four weeks\u2019 vacation for policemen. It seems clear that if the police had no regular days off weekly on the assumption that Holyoke had not previously adopted c. 147, \u00a7 16C, the adoption of c. 41, \u00a7 HID, would entitle them to three or more calendar weeks\u2019 vacation. If, as is argued, in the present posture they are entitled to only three or more working weeks\u2019 vacation, their annual vacation would be diminished on account of the adoption of c. 147, \u00a7 16C, prior to the adoption of c. 41, \u00a7 111D. This would violate the specific terms of c. 147, \u00a7 17, which provides that the days off a year \u201cshall be in addition to any annual vacation now or hereafter allowed to members of said departments, and such annual vacation shall not be diminished on account thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The defendant argues that \u201cweeks\u201d as employed in c. 41, \u00a7 HID, should be construed to mean \u201cworking weeks\u201d rather than \u201ccalendar weeks,\u201d and that the Legislature must have adopted this meaning in enacting St. 1949, c. 384, inserting \u00a7 111D in c. 41. He bases this on our opinion in <em>De Weerdt </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>295 Mass. 523. But this was not the issue in the <em>De Weerdt </em>case. The issue was not the number of days in the vacation week but rather the number of hours in the work week. Were we confronted with a comparative issue in this case we would be deciding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the police, under statutes we were discussing, were entitled to five or seven days\u2019 pay for every week of vacation. In such an event our decision would turn largely on the applicability of \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17 of c. 147, which were not before the court in the <em>De Weerdt </em>case. Thus, we do not consider that case helpful here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The defendant has elaborated on the history of c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 16C and 17, with the intent of demonstrating that these sections were not designed to <em>extend </em>annual vacations for policemen but rather to provide for a normal work week of five days. Clearly the primary purpose of these sections is as the defendant claims. However, the fact that the language now in \u00a7 17 (\u201cthey shall be in addition . . .\u201d) has been in the act since the first provision for days off for police was passed in 1908 would indicate that the proper interpretation is not that urged by the defendant. That section (St. 1908, c. 476) provided for one day off in thirty; successive sections, all permissive like \u00a7 16C (St. 1911, c. 210; St. 1920, c. 166; St. 1937, c. 85, \u00a7 1; St. 1938, c. 426, \u00a7 2, now c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 14-16B) provided for one day off in fifteen, eight, seven and six days respectively. In municipalities which are governed by any of the above sections other than \u00a7 16A, c. 41, \u00a7 111D, must mean calendar weeks rather than working weeks because the regular days off do not occur on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">A further argument of the defendant that the city intended to grant vacations of five day weeks when it adopted c. 41, \u00a7 111D, in 1957 is based on the assertion that the concept of a five day week for police was then firmly established there. Even if this was the intention (and one may doubt it since it appears that the Holyoke police have been taking calendar week vacations for some time), this was not the effect of the action by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">There is no occasion now to consider to what extent the city may adjust its arrangements on time off and vacations. See, however, <em>Brucato </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>338 Mass. 612, 615-616; <em>Chief of Police of Dracut </em>v. <em>Dracut, </em>357 Mass. 492, 496. We hold merely that, if vacations are granted under c. 41, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u00a7 11 ID, they <em>\u201cshall </em>be computed\u201d (emphasis supplied) as provided therein, and that \u201cweeks\u201d means calendar weeks in addition to whatever regularly scheduled days off are given to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> \u201cIn any city or town which accepts this section, all members of its regular police . . . force may be granted a vacation without loss of pay. Such vacations shall be computed in the following manner: \u2014 For five years\u2019 service, but less than ten years\u2019 service, a vacation of three weeks. For ten years\u2019 service or more, a vacation of four weeks.

The chief, superintendent or other officer or board at the head of the police department of any such town may, in case of any public emergency, or of any unusual demand for the services of the police in that town, prevent any member of the department from taking the day off at the time when he is entitled thereto, or at the time assigned therefor, provided that such day off shall be granted to him as soon thereafter as is practicar-ble. In no case shall the number of such days off be less than. . . one hundred and four in each year in a town subject to section sixteen 0, and they shall be in addition to any annual vacation now or hereafter allowed to . . .
