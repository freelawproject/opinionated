(Chelsea), seeks by this bill to enjoin Florence from competing with Raimond Silver Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Raimond),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which is wholly owned by Chelsea. The question arises under a written contract (the purchase contract), dated May 9,1968, to which the parties were Chelsea, Florence, and other vendors of Raimond stock. By final decree, the bill was dismissed. Chelsea appealed. There is a report of material facts. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">Raimond is an \u201citem house\u201d selling metal and glass items to some 12,000 buyers for stores and others. There are only three or four such item houses in the United States. When Florence joined Raimond\u2019s predecessor corporation as manager and chief executive officer in 1956, it had a narrow product line and a small annual sales volume ($53,000). It was losing money. Florence greatly expanded the business. In 1968, Raimond sold over 750 items, and had gross sales of over $5,600,000, and a net income of $385,000 after taxes. Florence had been given stock in the company. By 1967, he had a salary of $52,000 plus a bonus of $20,000. In 1967, partly at least because of the wishes of Raimond\u2019s financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>backer, it was decided that Raimond should be sold. In August, 1967, Florence took steps to get the business appraised, but he was opposed to the terms of a proposed sale to Chelsea.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The purchase contract provided that Chelsea would buy all Raimond\u2019s shares from its stockholders. Chelsea paid $948,830.60 in cash (the fixed price), undertook to pay the lesser of $1,100,000 or 30% of Raimond\u2019s net profits over a seven-year period ending December 31, 1974 (the contingent price), and paid about $385,000 to retire Raimond\u2019s debts outstanding in 1968. Florence received $407,753 for his stock and was to receive 42%% of the contingent price up to $1,000,000 and 85% of the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The purchase contract provided that, simultaneously with the closing, Chelsea would cause Raimond to sign employment contracts with Florence and one Levine in forms set forth in attached schedules. Raimond and Florence did sign such a contract (the employment contract). Both the purchase contract and the employment contract contained covenants (described below) that bound Florence not to compete with Raimond for specified periods. These covenants differ somewhat from one another (fn. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Section 8.07 of the purchase contract reads in part as follows: \"Each Seller agrees (severally . . . ) that he will not, for the period during which . . . [Chelsea] shall be obligated to make any contingency payments . . . and for two years thereafter . . . engage directly or indirectly . . . or participate in the ownership . . . operation or control, or have any interest ... in any organization ... or business engaged substantially in competition with the business now . . . conducted by Raimond; provided, however, . . . [proviso not relevant].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The employment contract provides in part in \u00a7 7 (emphasis supplied): \u201cFlorence agrees that during the term of this Agreement or any extension thereof and for two . . . years thereafter ... he will not engage, directly or indirectly ... or participate in the ownership . . . operation or control, or have any interest ... in any organization . . . <em>engaged in substantial competition with the business now or hereafter operated </em>. . . <em>by </em>. . . [Raimond]] provided\u201d (proviso not relevant).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A closely related provision (\u00a7 4 of the employment contract) reads: \u201cFlorence shall devote ... his full time to advance the interests of . . . [Raimond], and he shall not directly or indirectly ... be engaged in . . . any other companies] ... in the same line of business . . . unless with the written permission\u201d of Raimond. \u201cIn the event this contract is terminated by . . . [Raimond] prior to any of the dates set forth in \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [\u00a7 1]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for any reason <em>other than </em>the illness of Florence <em>or for cause which is substantial and material, </em>. . . [Raimond] agrees that the provisions of . . . [\u00a7 7] shall be null and void\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Section 8.07 of the purchase contract is not in terms subject to any such provision (hereafter called the exculpatory provision, see \u00a7 4) as affects \u00a7 7 of the employment contract and prevents the use of \u00a7 7 if the employment contract is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>terminated \u201cfor any reason other than\u201d Florence\u2019s illness \u201cor for cause which is substantial and material.\u201d Chelsea contends that this exculpatory provision does not apply to \u00a7 8.07 of the purchase contract whereas Florence contends that it does apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Florence worked under the employment contract for about nine months. He was discharged by the three-man board of directors of Raimond on February 24, 1969. David Casty and Norman Dunn voted for the action and Florence voted against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The trial judge concluded: (1) As to Florence, the provisions (concerning competition) in the purchase contract and those in the employment contract \u201cwere intended by the parties ... to be binding as one agreement.\u201d (2) It also \u201cwas intended that the exculpatory provision . . . would apply equally to the non-competition provisions of the . . . [^purchase contract] and the employment\u201d contract. (3) \u201cFlorence in no way\u201d violated \u201chis employment contract\u201d and he was discharged \u201cwithout substantial and material cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Shortly after his discharge, Florence formed Leonard Silver Manufacturing Company, Inc. (Leonard). Florence in his answer admitted, as did his counsel at trial, that Leonard is in competition with Raimond.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">1. Unless the exculpatory provision of the employment contract (\u00a74) also applies to \u00a7 8.07 of the purchase contract, Florence\u2019s activities for Leonard constitute a violation of \u00a7 8.07. That section prohibits Florence from engaging \u201cdirectly or indirectly ... in any . . . business . . . substantially in competition with the business . . . conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>by Raimond.\u201d Under \u00a7 8.07, to commit a violation, Florence need be only substantially in a competing business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">2. The two contracts were part of a single transaction. In construing them, weight must be given to that circumstance. See <em>Lamson &amp; Co. (Inc.) </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>305 Mass. 238, 240. See also <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>330 Mass. 312, 316-317; <em>Bono </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>346 Mass. 355, 359-360. To be sure, the parties to the two contracts were not the same. Florence was one of six persons selling Raimond shares to Chelsea under the purchase contract. His employment contract was with Raimond only.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The contracts, however, were closely interrelated. The employment contract was contemplated by the purchase contract (\u00a7 6.05). Florence\u2019s term of employment (see fn. 4) was tied to a provision of the purchase contract. Section 9 of the employment contract stated that it \u201cand any written agreements entered into at the same date constitute the entire contract between the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chelsea, in connection with the employment contract, gave Florence an option to buy shares of Chelsea and guaranteed to \u201cFlorence during such . . . time as Raimond ... is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chelsea\u201d the payment of all sums to be paid to him under the employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Although \u00a7 8.07 of the purchase contract makes no reference to \u00a7 7 of the employment contract, the two provisions deal in very similar, but not precisely the same, manner with the same subject matter. Sections 7 and 4 seem to be the more specific. We think that these provisions should be taken as controlling. We infer that, for Florence, the employment contract was a major inducement for his entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>into the purchase contract at all. We are not persuaded that each of these provisions was to operate independently of the other, or that each had any significant separate business purpose. Indeed, it would render illusory the protection given to Florence by \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 7 of the employment contract, to hold (as Chelsea suggests) that he, even if discharged without substantial and material cause, remains subject to \u00a7 8.07 of the purchase contract. On such an interpretation, Chelsea for any reason could cause Raimond, its wholly owned subsidiary, to discharge Florence without risk (because of the existence of \u00a7 8.07) that he would be able to compete against Raimond. This interpretation would render the exculpatory provision largely without meaning. See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>329 Mass. 74, 77-78. We hold that \u00a7 8.07 of the purchase agreement is controlled by the exculpatory provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even under our holding, Chelsea could have protected its investment in Raimond (and its purchase of Raimond\u2019s good will) against competition from Florence by seeing that Raimond, its wholly owned subsidiary (see <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. </em>353 Mass. 614, 619), did not discharge Florence without substantial cause. In fact it was Chelsea\u2019s president and board chairman (David Casty) and Chelsea\u2019s executive vice-president and treasurer (Norman Dunn), acting as two of three directors of Raimond, who on February 24, 1969, voted to discharge Florence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">3. The trial judge found four reasons for Florence\u2019s discharge: (1) He had indicated that he would leave Raimond after all the contingency payments had been made to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>(2) David Casty\u2019s son Ronald, who had been made treasurer of Raimond, could not get along with Florence. (3) Florence indicated he would not work with one Vaughn West, who had been made vice-president of operations of Chelsea. (4) Florence wanted Chelsea to buy him out. We think that the trial judge was not plainly wrong (see <em>Chartrand </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>347 Mass. 470, 473) in concluding that no one of these reasons constituted \u201csubstantial and material cause\u2019\u2019 for Florence\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">(a) After Chelsea acquired Raimond, David Casty told Florence, \u201cRonald Casty will be your treasurer.\u2019\u2019 Ronald, then twenty-three years old, had no financial experience. He was not an accountant, a comptroller, or a bookkeeper. Florence told David Casty that he did not think Ronald was qualified. Nevertheless, Ronald was made treasurer, and Florence found him a continuing problem and spoke to Ronald and his father concerning Ronald\u2019s conduct on various occasions. David Casty\u2019s action in hiring Ronald seems to be in conflict with the employment contract (see \u00a7 1 and fn. 4, supra) under which Florence was given \u201ccomplete authority to administer the general operations of . . . [Raimond] including . . . [the] hiring and firing of employees.\u201d Florence\u2019s difficulties with Ronald could reasonably be found not to constitute a substantial and material cause for discharging Florence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">(b) In October, 1968, Vaughn West was hired by Chelsea (a \u201cconglomerate\u201d of some twenty-six companies, including Raimond) as vice-president in charge of all operations of Chelsea and its subsidiaries. Dunn took West to meet Florence and explained West\u2019s responsibilities. In late December, West told Harmon Stone, Florence\u2019s accountant, that Chelsea\u2019s board of directors had given up on Florence, that this was his last chance, and that, if Florence did not work with West, Florence would be discharged. When Florence heard of this conversation, he told West and David Casty that he was not working for West. At Stone\u2019s urging, Florence agreed to try to work with West, but was pot given the opportunity. Florence was discharged on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>February 24, 1969, by formal vote of Raimond\u2019s board without any discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Under the employment contract (see fn. 4), Florence was to \"perform such duties and shall have such authority and powers as were previously . . . performed by him for\u201d Raimond and also \"such other duties that the [b]card of [directors of . . . [Raimond] may reasonably require.\u201d Florence was \u201cto be accountable for his instructions and his performance only to David Casty, [c]hairman of the [b]card of . . . [Raimond], or Norman Dunn, a [v]ice [president of . . . [Raimond] or their successors.\u201d Subject to these provisions, Florence was \"given . . . complete authority to administer . . . [Raimond\u2019s] general operations.\u201d As one witness testified, \"Florence was a loner, had to be running his own business one hundred per cent, couldn\u2019t function within the framework of an organization.\u201d If this was the case, the contract was appropriately expressed to protect him to a considerable extent in his desire to control the operations he was conducting. The trial judge could reasonably conclude that, in the circumstances, putting West in charge of Raimond\u2019s operations was a breach of the employment contract and that Florence was not required to accept West as having greater authority over Raimond\u2019s operations. See <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Bay State Felt Co. </em>227 Mass. 68, 70. See also <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>293 Mass. 386, 390-391.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">(c) Florence indicated that he would quit Raimond after all contingency payments had been made to him. The judge found that Florence had informed David Casty of this intention before executing the employment contract, under which Florence\u2019s obligation to work for Raimond was not to extend beyond \"[t]he date on which . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>^Chelsea] shall have no further obligation to make any payments ... on account of the [VJontingent [police.\u201d The judge reasonably found that Florence\u2019s statements (in effect that he intended to exercise his rights under the employment contract) were not substantial cause for his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">(d) The evidence did not require findings (1) that Florence asked to have his contract bought out before being told by David Casty that he was to leave, or (2) that his discharge was primarily brought about by Florence\u2019s own expressed desire to get out of the business. The trial judge could reasonably conclude that these matters did not amount to a substantial and material cause for Florence\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">(e) Chelsea argues that reasons (other than those found by the trial judge) would justify Florence\u2019s dismissal. (1) Statements by Florence (concerning discussions between David Casty and Harmon Stone), made before the employment contract was executed, could be viewed as not constituting reason for discharge from employment begun thereafter. (2) Statements by Florence that Raimond\u2019s business had been \"stolen\u201d from him could be taken as a \"jocular\u201d way of saying that Chelsea had bought the business \"very cheaply.\u201d (3) A misunderstanding between David Casty and Florence over a bonus could reasonably be regarded as not amounting to material cause for dismissal. Chelsea concedes that Florence \"performed well in enhancing the business of Raimond\u201d and there was testimony that he produced \"around\u201d $980,000 for fiscal year 1968, more than enough to earn his bonus under either his own or Casty\u2019s formula for a bonus. The trial judge could reasonably regard Florence\u2019s statements (sometimes provocative or rude) to and about David Casty (with respect to this misunderstanding) as more of an afterthought by Chelsea officials than a real reason for Florence\u2019s dismissal. An additional $1,000 paid to Florence to attend a trade show during his vacation, at David Casty\u2019s request, could be viewed in the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>4. Chelsea argues that it, as a separate corporate entity, is entitled to equitable relief even if Florence was discharged by Raimond without substantial and material cause. Chelsea\u2019s ownership of all Raimond\u2019s stock, and the existence of overlapping directors and officers, could be found to have made Chelsea in substance responsible for Florence\u2019s discharge. We think that the trial judge, in the circumstances, reasonably denied Chelsea injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\"> For earlier cases dealing with Raimond, or a predecessor or related company, see <em>Massa </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>346 Mass. 67, <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Florence, </em>347 Mass. 707, and <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>351 Mass. 264.

(2) The prohibition against competition in \u00a7 7 (\u201cengaged in substantial competition with the business now or hereafter operated . . . by\u201d Raimond, \u201cits subsidiaries or affiliates\u201d) differs from that in \u00a7 8.07 (\u201cengaged substantially in competition with the business now operated and conducted by Raimond\u201d). (3) Section 8.07 spells out various provisions for damages, whereas \u00a7 7 does not do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\"> Section 7 of the employment contract (see fn. 5 [2]) seems to require \u201csubstantial competition\u201d before there is any violation. The trial judge determined that when the suit \u201cwas commenced, Florence was engaged in a business that competes with a business of . . . [Raimond] although at that time the competition . . . was not substantial in relation to . . . [Raimond\u2019s] business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\"> A somewhat comparable provision (\u00a7 8.05) of the purchase contract refers to \u201cwritten agreements entered into simultaneously herewith between . . . [Chelsea which, as guarantor, at least, was a party to the employment contract] and any other parties signing this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> Chelsea under \u00a7 3.02 of the purchase contract could sell its Raimond stock. The purchase contract contained no provision (as did some other instruments) that the contract was for the benefit of successors and assigns. Chelsea suggests that the benefit of \u00a7 8.07 might not pass to a purchaser from it of Raimond\u2019s stock and that this was a reason for the noncompetition provision in each contract. A purchaser of Raimond\u2019s shares, of course, would receive (through Raimond) indirect protection (against competition by Florence) of \u00a7 7 of the employment contract, as would Chelsea while it retained the stock. If the parties to the purchase contract desired to have \u00a7 8.07 entirely free of the exculpatory provision and to have the unlimited protection of \u00a7 8.07 (even though this would render illusory Florence's benefit from the exculpatory provision), more explicit language could have made that intention clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> Chelsea argues (1) that Florence\u2019s refusal to work with West \u201c disenabled . . . [Raimond] from seeing to a continuity in management\u201d; and_ (2) that Florence\u2019s contract required him \u201cto take his instructions from David Casty, who, in fact, through intermediaries instructed him to work with Vaughn West.\u201d Although Casty could require Florence to work with West \u201cto advance the interests of the company\u201d in many ways, the employment contract in terms prevented a demotion of Florence by giving West greater authority over Raimond\u2019s operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
