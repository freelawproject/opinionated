L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. The case came before the single justice who reserved and reported it without decision upon the pleadings, return and assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">The petition alleges the following facts which are admitted by the answer of the Commonwealth. On January 6, 1968, a complaint was filed in the District Court by one Sarah Bell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>charging, in the form prescribed by G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, that \u201cCamille E. Joyner, a minor, during the three months next before the making of this complaint, was a stubborn child and stubbornly refused to submit to the lawful and reasonable commands of said complainant, said Sarah Bell, whose commands said minor was bound to obey.\u201d The petitioner pleaded not guilty, and was convicted on January 22, 1968. After the filing of an initial petition for a writ of error the case was remanded to the District Court for final disposition, and on March 7, 1969, the petitioner was sentenced to ten days in the house of correction. The sentence was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The petitioner contends, first, that the \u201cstubborn children\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 304, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutionally vague, indefinite and uncertain; second, that the sentence imposed constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and third, that since she was over eighteen years of age at the time of the conduct complained of, she was not a \u201cchild\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We dispose of the case on the third ground, i.e., that the petitioner was not a \u201cchild\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The uses and definitions of the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d are many and varied. See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, 388 (1961). 14 C. J. S., Child or Children, p. 1106. In <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Cushing, 2 </em>Cush. 519, 533-534, the term \u201cchildren\u201d was contrasted with \u201cyouth,\u201d the latter term being characterized as \u201creferring to and embracing young persons of somewhat more advanced age aiid proficiency . , .In G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1, \u201cchild\u201d is defined, for the purposes of the chapter regulating labor and industries, as \u201ca person under eighteen. \u2019 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>pare G. L. c. 76, \u00a7 1; c. 175, \u00a7 128; c. 269, \u00a7 12A; c. 272, \u00a728.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">No definition of \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d is given in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, nor has that provision been judicially construed. The statutory form of complaint, G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, requires an allegation that the person complained of is \u201ca minor.\u201d We do not think, however, that the term \u201cchildren\u201d in c. 272, \u00a7 53, even when read with c. 277, \u00a7 79, can be said to include all those who have not yet reached their twenty-first birthday. In G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 52 (as amended through St. 1960, c. 353, \u00a7 1), a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d is defined as \u201ca child between seven and seventeen who violates any city ordinance or town by-law or who commits any offence against a law of the commonwealth.\u201d A \u201cwayward child\u201d is also defined in terms of \u201ca child between seven and seventeen years of age.\u201d Proceedings against children of those ages are governed by G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52-63, inclusive, and jurisdiction in the first instance lies exclusively in the juvenile session. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 74, as amended through St. 1964, c. 308, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See also <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 648; <em>D\u2019Urbano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>345 Mass. 466. \u201cLimited jurisdiction over juveniles who have passed their seventeenth birthday is provided in \u00a7 72, but it remains expressly only jurisdiction in respect of 'children.\u2019 There is no provision which in terms gives jurisdiction over a child apprehended when under seventeen and not brought to trial until after eighteen. There are indications that jurisdiction ends when the child attains eighteen . . ..\u201d <em>D\u2019Urbano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>at 470.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>It is clear that the term \u201cchildren\u201d in c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 52 et seq., does not include those who have attained their eighteenth birthday. We think that the term should be given the same meaning in c. 272, \u00a7 53. An anomaly would arise if the petitioner could on the one hand, be legally married by a magistrate or clergyman despite the objections of her parents (G. L. c. 207, \u00a7 7), and on the other hand be sentenced to the house of correction for refusing to obey her parents\u2019 command not to see her intended husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In view of the fact that the statute as we construe it does not apply to the petitioner, we need not decide the other issues raised by the petitioner. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Fall River, </em>312 Mass. 523, 526, app. dism. sub nom. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Violette, </em>319 U. S. 581, reh. den. 320 U. S. 810; <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 245, and cases cited; <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Dover, </em>327 Mass. 601, 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and judgment is to be entered for the defendant (petitioner here). The petitioner is entitled to costs to be paid by the county of Middlesex. G. L. c. 250, \u00a7 12. <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 293, 298, 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\"> <em>\u201cStubborn children, </em>runaways, common night walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers, persons who with offensive and disorderly act or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior, idle and disorderly persons, prostitutes, disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction\u201d or by fine or both (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-6\"> The amendment to \u00a7 74 embodied in St. 1967, c. 787, took effect after the petitioner\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\"> Although \u00a7 72 was substantially rewritten by St. 1964, c. 308, \u00a7 3, the above quoted language is still pertinent.

See also G.
