Legg, was conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent on the employee under \u00a7 35A (a) of the Massachusetts Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, G. L. c. 152. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">The employee, who is receiving compensation for total disability under \u00a7 34 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, was married on January 20, 1927, to Alice Legg and they subsequently lived together as husband and wife. For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>past nineteen years, Mrs. Legg has worked, earning about $60 a week. During this period her husband gave her $50 a week, with which she paid the rent, utilities, and food bill for the household. In addition, he paid for all automobile expenses, including the garage rent. Mrs. Legg did not drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">About twice a year since their marriage, the employee would \u201cgo on benders\u201d and his wife would lock him out of the house for about three or four weeks. During these periods he contributed $25 for household expenses and continued to pay the expenses of the car, even though Mrs. Legg retained possession of the car and its keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Early in July, 1964, the employee got drunk for the first time that year and was locked out by his wife. On July 26, 1964, he was injured on his job and remained hospitalized until August 17 of that year at which time he went to a rooming house for five days. On August 22 he was again hospitalized until February 20, 1965, when he was finally released. He returned home, where he has since lived with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The Industrial Accident Board was warranted in finding that Mrs. Legg was conclusively presumed to be dependent on her husband. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35A, as amended through St. 1959, c. 566, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The meaning of the statutory phrase \u201cwith whom she lives\u201d was explained in <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 467, 469: \u201c. . . [it] means living together as husband and wife in the ordinary acceptation and significance of these words in common understanding. They mean maintaining a home and living together in the same household, or actually cohabiting under conditions which would be regarded as constituting a family relation. There may be temporary absences and incidental interruptions arising out of changes in the house or town of residence, or out of travel for business or pleasure. But there must be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>home and a life in it.\u201d In <em>Harrington\u2019s Case, </em>297 Mass. 125, the claimant and her husband regularly lived away from each other five days a week and saw each other only on weekends. This court held (p. 126): \u201c[W]e cannot quite say that this finding . . . [conclusive presumption] was not warranted.\u201d See <em>Lopes\u2019s Case, </em>332 Mass. 39. Cases cited by the insurer, <em>Nelson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 467, <em>Breakey\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 460, and <em>Shaw\u2019s Case, </em>340 Mass. 717, can be distinguished on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">During their thirty-seven years of marriage, there had been a periodic pattern of absences as a result of excessive drinking and each time the employee had returned home to continue living with his wife. During these absences he had regularly contributed to the maintenance of the household. This was their way of life for almost four decades, despite its faults and hardships. There were ample grounds on which to base a finding that there existed \u201ca home and a life in it\u201d for Mr. and Mrs. Legg.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> The applicable provisions of \u00a7 35A are: \u201cFor the purposes of this section the following persons shall be conclusively; presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon an employee: \u2014 (a) A wife upon a husband with whom she lives at the time of his injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
