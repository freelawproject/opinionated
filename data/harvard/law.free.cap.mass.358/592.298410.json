L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from convictions under an indictment in two counts charging attempted extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">There was evidence on which the jury could have found the following: On October 22, 1968, the date of the offence charged in the first count, the defendant and another man, described as a \u201cbig, bald-headed man [who] looked like a wrestler,\u201d met with John Najar\u00edan in the defendant\u2019s automobile. The defendant asked Najar\u00edan if he knew Lou Ricci, and Najar\u00edan replied he did. The defendant then said, \u201cLou Ricci says you owe him $4,000,\u201d that the defendant wanted Najar\u00edan to pay it within ten days, and that if Najar\u00edan did not he would have \u201ccrapped out.\u201d The bald-headed man said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">On November 1, the defendant accompanied by the bald-headed man came to Najarian\u2019s house, but left without speaking to Najar\u00edan. On the evening of November 2, the date of the offence charged in the second count, the defendant telephoned Najar\u00edan and said, \u201cI thought you were in New York. You . . ., I\u2019m coming right up. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen minutes,\u201d About fifteen minutes later, the defendant and the bald-headed man arrived at Najarian\u2019s house. In Najarian\u2019s living room, the defendant sat on the couch about ten feet from Najar\u00edan with his hands on his lap, while the bald-headed man stood about two feet from Najar\u00edan, bent over and snarled at him, and asked him if he had the money. He said he would cut out Najarian\u2019s tongue and shove it up his rectum and would put dynamite up Najarian\u2019s rectum and blow him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">1. The defendant first argues that his motion for exculpatory evidence should have been allowed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion for exculpatory evidence was denied \u201cafter hearing.\u201d What was said or offered at the hearing, either in support of or in opposition to the motion, the record does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>not disclose. The Commonwealth asserts in its brief that it represented to the court that it had no such evidence. The defendant denies this in his brief. At all events, the Commonwealth now represents that it never had and does not now have in its possession, custody, or control, or within the knowledge of any prosecuting officers, any evidence of an exculpatory nature, On the basis of the meager record with respect to this motion, we are unable to say that the judge erred in denying it. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Keogh, </em>391 F. 2d 138, 146-148 (2d Cir.); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wolfson, </em>289 F. Supp. 903, 914-915 (S. D. N. Y.).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">2. The defendant next argues that he was entitled to directed verdicts because the offence should have been charged in one count instead of two. He contends that his crime was a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d and therefore constituted one crime only. In support of this contention he cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stasiun, </em>349 Mass. 38, to the effect that \u201cThe test of single intent or general scheme is just as appropriate for the crime of soliciting bribes as it is for larceny. Solicitation of a bribe may take the form of protracted negotiations. An offer to give or accept a bribe, while it is outstanding, has a continuing effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45. The defendant urges that \u201cthis logic is equally . . . applicable to extortion as to bribery, perhaps more so.\u201d What the defendant overlooks is the following paragraph of that opinion where we said: \u201c[Separate solicitations could, as is well established, be charged as separate offences.\u201d It is this language that we find equally applicable to extortion as to bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The Commonwealth offered evidence that on two separate occasions the defendant threatened Najar\u00edan and demanded payment of money from him. Each threat and demand was separable. On October 22, the defendant threatened Najar\u00edan and demanded payment within ten days. Ten days passed and Najar\u00edan did not pay. Having thus failed in his first attempt, the defendant returned on November 2 to issue a new threat. This time he demanded that Najar\u00edan have the money by the following Monday night. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>were two distinct deadlines for payment and two distinct threats. These were, therefore, separate and distinct of-fences which could be separately charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mannos, </em>311 Mass. 94, 113 (each acceptance of bribe constitutes a separate offence). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>314 Mass. 210, 226 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">3. The defendant further contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the convictions. The elements of the crime charged in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 25, are outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelligrini, </em>283 Mass. 300, 303: \u201cThe essential factors which constitute the crime alleged are, as stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 608, \u2018(1) a malicious threat (2) made to a named person (3) of personal injury to some one (4) with intent to extort money.\u2019 \u201d A malicious threat of bodily injury is criminal even though intended to force the payment of a just debt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>128 Mass. 55, 59. Further, the threat is to be tested objectively; the state of mind of the person threatened is not controlling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcoran, </em>252 Mass. 465, 483-484.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">As to count 1, the defendant argues that of the elements comprising the crime only that of a \u201cnamed person\u2019\u2019 is proved. He bases this argument chiefly on a definition of the phrase \u201ccrap out\u201d taken from a dictionary of American slang, pointing out that neither of the two definitions given connotes infliction of personal injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">It is not, however, the dictionary definition of the words used that is determinative, but the words themselves and the circumstances attending their use. They might mean one thing in the abstract and quite another in a context of the sort here involved. We think that the meaning and intent of the words used was peculiarly a question for the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>to determine. We are also of opinion that it was for the jury to decide whether the threat was made maliciously and with the intent to extort money. Therefore, there was no error in the judge\u2019s refusal to grant a directed verdict on count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Najarian\u2019s testimony that he did not know the meaning of the words \u201ccrapped out,\u201d and that he was not in fact threatened, might properly have been disregarded by the jury. We conclude this because of his apparent hostility toward the Commonwealth which prompted the judge to permit the district attorney to put leading questions to him. Only the defendant\u2019s state of mind is important. In concluding that the defendant intended to threaten Najar\u00edan the jury could have properly also considered the defendant\u2019s physical appearance, the fact that he brought the big, bald-headed man with him each time he came, the type of language used, and the defendant\u2019s inflection and phrasing in the tape recording admitted in evidence as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">As to count 2, the defendant contends that since he remained silent while the unnamed \u201cbig, bald-headed man\u201d made the threat, he should not be held criminally responsible for them. The Commonwealth\u2019s position is that the jury were warranted in finding a \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d based on the evidence that the two were together every time they came to Najarian\u2019s house; that on the occasion of the first threat, the defendant spoke while the bald-headed man was silent; that on the occasion of the second threat, the defendant made the telephone call which preceded the bald-headed man\u2019s threat; and that the defendant made no effort to dissociate himself from those threats. We agree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stasiun, </em>349 Mass. 38, at 49, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">4. The defendant argues finally that he was entitled to directed verdicts because the proof on neither count conformed to the particulars. We are of opinion that this contention is without merit. Even if we agreed that the alleged variances are significant, it is difficult to see how they could have prejudiced the defendant in the preparation of his case for trial. We find support for this conclusion in the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that the defendant made no claim of any prejudice at the trial. Decisive, however, is that he appears to be raising this point here for the first time. This he cannot do. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Dal, Inc. </em>314 Mass. 460, 463. He did not, so far as the record shows, bring to the attention of the trial judge his claim of variance, nor was there anything in his motion for directed verdicts that indicated that it was based on a variance. This failure deprived the Commonwealth of any opportunity to move to amend its bill of particulars which it would otherwise have had under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 40. See <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>D. A. Schulte, Inc. </em>275 Mass. 379, 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> The motion asked that the defendant be furnished \u201cwith all evidence of an exculpatory nature within the possession, custody, control or within the knowledge of the prosecuting officer during the pendency of all matters in regard thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> \u201c1.
