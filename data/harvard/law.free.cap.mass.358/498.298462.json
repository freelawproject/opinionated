Enos is responsible for all marine underwriting decisions of Trans-Atlantic. Trans-Atlantic is empowered on behalf of the . . . companies to make all decisions as to the risks to be accepted, to furnish the insurance, to establish conditions in respect thereof and to set the rates. . . . Owners or operators of vessels procure this insurance. It includes protection and coverage in respect of seamen\u2019s injuries and claims arising therefrom under general maritime and admiralty law and the provisions of the Jones Act. Approximately 75 per cent of the fishing vessels sailing out of the Port of Gloucester are covered by this type of insurance procured through Trans-Atlantic. In 1967 . . . [the plaintiff], while serving as a member of the crew on f/v wild duck, sustained an injury to his hand which required an operation in May, 1968. He returned to his occupation as a fisherman in late summer, 1968 and in the fall that year he became a member of the crew on f/v st. Anthony, worked aboard said vessel until January, 1969 without incident or injury and performed his duties to the satisfaction of the captain. He had . . . been granted regular employment on that vessel. In connection with the injury sustained on f/v wild duck, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>. . . [the plaintiff] consulted . . . attorneys . . . who instituted legal action. The case is pending in the . . . Superior Court. In January, 1969, f/v st. anthony was tied up for conversion from a dragger to a seiner. At that time . . . [the plaintiff] was informed that when the vessel returned to sea, he would be included as part of the ship\u2019s complement. On or about March 7, 1969, Trans-Atlantic, knowing that the plaintiff was serving on the vessel, informed its skipper that protection and indemnity coverage would not extend to . . . [the plaintiff]. As a result, the plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated. . . . [He] has sought employment on a number of other vessels but, since Trans-Atlantic places the insurance on at least 75 per cent of the vessels in Gloucester, he has been unable to obtain any employment at sea\u201d although \u201cthere is a shortage of fishermen to man the vessels sailing from Gloucester.\u201d The plaintiff \u201chas been a fisherman for practically all of his life and possesses no other substantial skills for other types of employment comparable in compensation to that received by him as a fisherman. As a fisherman ... he earned about $7,800.00 a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u201cIt is not the policy or practice of . . . [the defendants] to refuse insurance coverage to a vessel whose crew includes a member who has sustained injury in the course of his employment, nor ... to exclude such an injured seaman from coverage otherwise offered to the vessel.\u201d Enos\u2019s reason for excluding the plaintiff was that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cbaseless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The plaintiff, while a member of the crew, was provided with meals. \u201cAt one of his meals, a lobster was served him which he was opening with a knife which slipped causing injury. The meal was served at a table with collapsible, features.\u201d The judge in his findings stated that the plaintiff \u201ctestified that the fittings which held the table in a rigid position were faulty.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also stated that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cwere justiciable issues in . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] claim relating to whether . . . the injury occurred in the course of his employment and whether . . . the table as part of the vessel was in good condition\u201d; that he was not \u201cin any way deciding whether . . . [the plaintiff] . . . [was] entitled to recover on his claim . . . [and] that the claim and his legal action pending in the Superior Court . . . [was] not baseless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The denial of coverage to the plaintiff was \u201cnot the result of a legitimate . . . business judgment. . . . [T]he real reason . . . was because . . . [the plaintiff] was prosecuting his claim for injuries with legal representation and, more particularly, because he had engaged the services of . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cIn the last year . . . [the defendants] have excluded from insurance coverage seven or eight other Gloucester fishermen who had made claims for personal injuries. All of these men have prosecuted or are prosecuting their claims by retaining\u201d the same attorneys as those who are representing the plaintiff in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">It was \u201creasonably foreseeable that the exclusion of the plaintiff from coverage . . . would result in Ms loss of employment\u201d and \u201cEnos in fact knew that tMs would be the result of Ms actions.\u201d The defendants \u201cintentionally took the action they did well knowing what the result would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The judge ruled that (1) The \u201cactions\u201d of the defendants in respect to the plaintiff \u201cwere done intentionally, maliciously and witMn the technical meaning of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>'malice\u2019 as \u2022 used in our law.\u201d (2) ''The actions of . . . [the defendants] constitute an unjustifiable and actionable interference with . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] employment as a seaman.\u201d (3) The actions of the defendants ''constitute \u00e1 form of coercion which foreseeably may prevent or discourage injured seamen sailing out of Gloucester from seeking legal representation or legal representation of their untrammeled choice.\u201d (4) The plaintiff ''has been deprived of his employment by reason of the actions of\u201d the defendants and is entitled to damages. (5) The plaintiff \u201cis entitled to relief\u201d enjoining the defendants from \u201cengaging in any malicious action which would deprive or interfere with . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] employment as a seaman or fisherman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The first contention of the defendants, dealt with rather summarily in their brief, is that there can be no \u201cconspiracy\u201d because the defendant Enos was the \u201csole authority to determine the courses to be taken and the decisions to be made by way of settlement or otherwise on all claims brought against the company.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the plaintiff\u2019s claim is not based on the theory of conspiracy, nor do the judge\u2019s findings and rulings rest on that theory. Therefore we see no need to engage in a discussion of this point. The defendants concede in their brief that the \u201cmain issue\u201d in the case before us is whether the actions of the defendants constitute an unjustifiable and actionable interference with the plaintiff\u2019s employment as a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The principal thrust of the defendants\u2019 arguments appears to point to the conclusion that they \u201chad the right not to issue protection coverage on individuals they did not want to insure in the absence of statutory or other regulations.\u201d In support of this conclusion they state, inter alla, that the defendant Enos \u201cdid not want to enter into contracts for the benefit of one who, <em>in his opinion, </em>had a baseless claim, and had a physical incapacity.\u201d The latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>statement is in utter disregard of the amply justified findings of the judge that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not a baseless one and that the \u201creal reason\u201d the defendants excluded the plaintiff from coverage was \u201cbecause he was prosecuting his claim for injuries with legal representation and, more particularly, because he had engaged the services\u201d of certain attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The defendants\u2019 arguments on this point also totally ignore the findings of the judge that the defendants have also excluded from coverage seven or eight other Gloucester fishermen who had made claims for personal injuries and were represented by the same attorneys who were retained by the plaintiff in his personal injury claim. This could hardly be termed a coincidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In a somewhat analogous case it was held that \u201cwhere a third party induces an employer to discharge Ms employee who is working under a contract termmable at will, but under wMch the employment would have contmued in\"defimtely in accordance with the desire of the employer, except for such interference, and where the only motive moving the tMrd party is a desire to injure the employee and to benefit Mmself at the expense of the employee by compelling ' the latter to surrender an alleged cause of action ... a cause of action arises in favor of the employee agamst the Third party.\u201d <em>London Guarantee &amp; Acc. Co. </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>206 Ill. 493, 507-508. We think that the rule enunciated in that case is equally applicable to the facts m the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The case of <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>322 Mass. 356, also bears a strong similarity to the mstant one. There we allowed recovery to a \u201cspecial nurse\u201d who charged that \u201cthe defendant, a physician on the staff of a hospital . . . wrongfully, maliciously, unlawfully and with rntent to injure the plaintiff \u2018procured\u2019 the authorities of the hospital to dismiss the plamtiff \u2018from a case . . .\u2019 and to proMbit her from thereafter bemg called as a special nurse at the hospital. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356-357. We held that \u201c[t]he govern-rng principle of law is set forth in Restatement: Torts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u00a7 766, in these words, '. . . one who, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to . . . enter into or continue a business relation with another is hable to the other for the harm caused thereby.\u2019 Our own decisions appear to be in accord with this statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. We added that \u201cthe burden of proof was upon the defendant to establish the existence of ... [a privileged] occasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360. The defendants, however, cite the case of <em>Tye </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>160 F. Supp. 666 (D. Mass.), where the court ruled that \u201c[r]other than for the defendant here to have to prove 'justification,\u2019 . . . the burden is on the plaintiff to prove malice . . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667-668.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">We are satisfied that the plaintiff in the instant case has sustained the burden of proving \u201cmalice\u201d on the part of the defendants. There is no lawful justification or cause for the defendants to decide unilaterally that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was baseless and to attempt to punish or penalize him for prosecuting the claim. While \u201cmalice in common acceptation means ill will against a person ... in its legal sense it means a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse.\u201d <em>McGurk </em>v. <em>Cronenwett, </em>199 Mass. 457, 462. The defendants\u2019 \u201cmotives\u201d may have been \u201cgood\u201d from their point of view, in that their conduct may have been financially beneficial to them, but their conduct can still be held \u201cmalicious in law.\u201d We have held that \u201c[i]f such interference was intentional and without lawful justification it was malicious in law although it arose from good motives and without express malice.\u201d <em>Grammenos </em>v. <em>Zolotas, </em>356 Mass. 594, 597, and cases cited. Applying this standard, the judge was amply justified in concluding that the defendants\u2019 actions were \u201cmalicious in law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendants also seem to argue that \u201cinjunctive relief\u201d may not be \u201can appropriate remedy.\u201d They contend that \u2018' Qr]egardless of whether . . . [they] had refused to issue protection coverage of . . . [the plaintiff, his] employment as a crewman aboard the \u2018St. Anthony\u2019 is not guaranteed to him\u201d and that \u201c[a]n injunction against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>defendants should not be used as a means to give the plaintiff greater rights than he would have had if there had been no alleged interference with his contract of employment.\u201d We do not believe that the plaintiff will obtain \u201cgreater rights\u201d as a result of the injunction granted in this suit than he otherwise would have. Whether he obtains employment in the future may depend upon various factors, but should not be dependent upon the arbitrary action of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Even though the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccontract of employment\u201d may b\u00e9 terminable at the will of either party, the plaintiff is still entitled to appropriate remedies to prevent the defendants from unlawfully interfering with his employment. This right to terminate \u201cdoes not reheve the defendants], whose wrongful act[s] and not the wih of the employer -caused . . . [the plaintiff] to lose a position, in which . . . . [it] could . . . [be found] that so long as his work proved satisfactory his employment would have continued . . ..\u201d <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>210 Mass. 487, 494. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Dunphy, </em>177 Mass. 485, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In a concluding argument, the defendants attempt to invoke \u201cthe countervailing principle of law which states, in short, that the Court will protect the right of an individual to carry on his business free from unreasonable restraint.\u201d We are of opinion that the relief granted the plaintiff does not constitute such \u201cunreasonable restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> \u201cDefendants\u201d herein refers solely to the Trans-Atlantic Marine, Inc. (Trans-Atlantic) and to Ernest A. Enos. The final decree dismissed the bill against a third defendant, The Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> The final decree also stated that \u201cthe plaintiff shall not be barred from establishing any loss or damage occurring after June 30, 1969, by reason of the actions of . . . [the defendants] if this Decree does not become effective until after said date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> The pertinent portion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding that point follows: The table \u201cis a foot wide and five feet long, and then we have what they call leaf table that bends down. When we have to eat, we bring the leaf table up to make the table wider. Now, on the end of this table, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a post that comes down with a chain hooked up on this post and on the end of this chain you are supposed to put the end of this leaf. It has an eye-bolt on the end of that. When you have that, there is a slide that is supposed to go under that on the firm part of the table, and on the leaf part to hold that table level, to hold the leaf level with the stationary table. This boat here did not have any slides to go under this leaf and also the chain that was holding that part of the leaf was loose; in other words, it was longer, it didn\u2019t hold that part of the table snug up to the stationary table. So, when I took my knife out to open a claw of the lobster, I was sitting on the edge. When you sit on the edge, that leaf comes up right tight like this, you don\u2019t get nowhere near, you don\u2019t get two foot away from the central part of the table. When I stuck my knife in the claw of the lobster, the boat gave a lurch and I come up like this, stood right up, the leaf come up with me, and the knife slipped out of the lobster claw and I cut my hand, my finger. When I did cut the finger, I cut it so bad that it crippled the finger altogether.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"><em> </em>There is a brief paragraph in the plaintiff\u2019s bill which states \u201cthat the conduct of the defendants amounCs] to a civil conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
