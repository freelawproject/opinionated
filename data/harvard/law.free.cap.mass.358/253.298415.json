The locus was in a G district (i.e. zoned for general residence use) when a definitive subdivision plan of the locus was approved on March 29, 1965. On December 20, 1965, at a special town meeting, the locus was rezoned for a single residence use.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Permit no. 9949 (for building no. 2) covered lots 838 to 840, inclusive, shown on the plan and related to forty-four units. The total area of these lots is 176,006 square feet. Permit no. 9950 (for building no. 3) dealt with lots 820 to 827, inclusive. These lots contain 217,690 square feet. The permit was for fifty-four units.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">After the permits were issued, land was graded, water and sewer facilities were installed, and storm drains and foundations were provided, at a cost of about $350,000. A total expenditure of $6,000,000 is proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">James J. and Constance Aspell (the Aspells), also defendants in this proceeding, appealed from the action of the building inspector in granting permits nos. 9949 and 9950. The board of appeal, after hearing, voted to request the selectmen to revoke the permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Gardens then brought the present bill in equity under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21 (as amended through St. 1960, c. 365; see later amendments through St. 1970, c. 80). The bill seeks a determination that the board of appeal exceeded its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>authority in reversing the action of the building inspector. The trial judge, in voluntary findings, in effect stated the facts set forth above and made a few independent findings, which (so far as now important) are mentioned below. He then made a somewhat ambiguous summary or quotation of the decision of the board of appeal. We assume that he intended thereby to adopt some of the board\u2019s findings as his own, although he appropriately should have made independent findings after a hearing de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A final decree was entered that no modification of the board\u2019s decision was required. Gardens appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The evidence is reported. The trial judge adopted his voluntary findings as his report of material facts. See <em>Selig </em>v. <em>Wexler, </em>355 Mass. 671, 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">1. The trial judge correctly ruled that the locus is governed by the 1963 zoning by-law in effect at all times from January 18, 1963, until after March 29, 1965, when the definitive subdivision plan was approved. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A (as amended through St. 1964, c. 688; see later amendments through St. 1965, c. 366, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Millis, </em>349 Mass. 691, 696-697; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Ashland, </em>354 Mass. 660, 661-663. Ac - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>cordingly, if Gardens\u2019 project complied with the 1963 zoning by-law, Gardens was entitled (so far as \u00a7 7A is concerned) to the permits which it sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The Aspells contend that Gardens gains no protection from \u00a7 7A because there is no proof that the definitive plan was submitted within seven months of the filing of a preliminary plan (fn. 3), even though Gardens now seeks no protection against any amendment of the zoning by-law occurring before the approval of the definitive plan. The judge adopted the board\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat protection does accrue [to Gardens] under . . . [\u00a7] 7A.\u201d This conclusion implies a finding (warranted by stipulations concerning the definitive subdivision plan and by the absence of dispute before him concerning the proceedings leading to that plan\u2019s approval) that there had been compliance with procedural requirements for obtaining protection under \u00a7 7A. In the circumstances, such issues should not be raised for the first time in this court. See <em>Henchey </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>348 Mass. 742, 747. We thus need not decide whether, in any event, approval of the definitive subdivision plan gave Gardens protection under \u00a7 7A against any amendment of the zoning by-law occurring after such approval, even if more than seven months elapsed between the date on which a preliminary plan was filed and the filing of the definitive plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">2. Section 11, par. A, of the applicable Norwood zoning by-law provides, \u201cNo dwelling shall be constructed . . . on a lot having less frontage ... or less area\u201d than speci-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>fled in Table B attached to \u00a7 11. In a G district, Table B (as in effect on March 29, 1965) states the required lot area to be <em>\u201c2 </em>acres <em>and </em>not less than 4000 sq. ft. per dwelling unit for all units on the lot in buildings for 3 or more families\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The Aspells contend that the italicized \u201cand\u201d makes the space requirement for multi-unit buildings in effect a minimum of two acres plus an additional 4,000 square feet for each dwelling .unit. As an example, they suggest that the \u201carea required . . . for . . . permit [n]o. 9949 is 263,120 square feet . . . <em>(i.e. 2 </em>X 43,560 square feet and 44 X 4000 square feet = 263,120).\u201d They point out that Gardens had only 176,006 square feet for the proposed building covered by the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Although the by-law is not wholly clear, the reasonable interpretation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>'is that, for buildings for three or more families, (a) the lot must be at least two acres in size and (b) for each dwelling unit on the lot there must be at least 4,000 square feet. The consequence would be that on a two acre lot (87,120 square feet) there could be twenty-one dwelling units. The area covered by building no. 2 (176,006 square feet) would permit (at 4,000 square feet a dwelling unit) forty-four units. In the case of the building covered by permit no. 9950, with an area of 217,690 square feet, there could be fifty-four dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Zoning by-laws must be construed reasonably. See <em>Petros </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Bldgs. of Lynn, </em>306 Mass. 368, 371; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>353 Mass. 731, 734, and cases cited. As in the case of other legislative provisions, such by-laws should not be so interpreted as to cause absurd or unreasonable results when the language is susceptible of a sensible meaning. Here, however, we need not rely solely on such general canons of construction, for in another part of Table <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>B, the by-law uses different and clear language<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when the purpose is to reach the result for which the Aspells contend^ The different usage supports our conclusion, as does a decision of the Land Court (August 27, 1969, in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>Misc. No. 55,529) with respect to which no appeal has been perfected. Gardens, in an appendix to its brief, has brought this decision to our attention..</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">3. Section 14 of the by-law provides in par. B, \u201cExcept in the case of authorized group projects, no lot in any district shall be occupied by more than one dwelling.\u201d Section 4, par. A, provides that (with exceptions not pertinent) \u201cno building ... or land shall be Used ... for any purpose other than for one or more of the uses set forth in Table A as permitted in the district in which such building ... or land is located.\u201d Table A, Use Item A4 (as in effect on March 29, 1965), indicates that in a G district, the term \u201cdwelling\u201d or \u201cdwellings\u201d includes a \u201c[b]uilding for occupancy by a total of three or more families including an \u2018attached house\u2019 (in which the dwelling units are side by side, separated by a wall) and an \u2018apartment house\u2019 (in which each dwelling unit is in whole or in part over or under another unit, and/or [sic] shares a common entrance with another unit); provided that in a G [general residence] district, no full dwelling unit shall be above the second floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Each building proposed by Gardens has one roof and one foundation and is two stories high (so that no full dwelling unit is above the second floor). One of the buildings (building no. 2) has four attached segments or sections containing apartments or dwelling units. The other building (building no. 3) has seven such segments or sections. Each dwelling unit is in whole or in part over or under another unit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>shares a common entrance with another unit or units. On the same floor the dwelling units are side by side. The levelling units are separated by walls. The segments or sections of each building also are thus separated. The building inspector testified as to building no. 2 that in his opinion it was \u201cone building with fire walls between the sections to separate them for fire protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The Aspells argue that the structure covered by each permit constitutes a group of buildings subject to \u00a7 14 of the by-law dealing with \u201ca group of two or more dwellings\u201d and to the provisions of par. B of \u00a7 14, already quoted, that (with the exception noted earlier) \u201cno lot in any district shall be occupied by more than one dwelling.\u201d Gardens, we think correctly, takes the position that, under this by-law, each building permit covers only a single building or dwelling, so that \u00a7 14 has no application because only a single building (or a part of a single building) will be on any lot. The provision in Table A, Use Item A4, quoted above, governing the multi-family dwellings permissible in G districts, is broad enough to include within the term \u201cdwelling\u201d single buildings containing sections or segments, each with several apartments or dwelling units, like those shown in the plans in the record. On the evidence, under the by-law, either building was permissible in a G district despite the arrangement of its sections or dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">4. The Aspells contend that Gardens in the applications for building permits made false representations. The alleged misrepresentations are discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">(a) An architect by inadvertence referred to the owner as Norwood Gardens, Inc. The mistake was promptly corrected. The board of appeal agreed that ownership had been established to its satisfaction. See fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">(b) References in the applications in 1968 to the area as a \u201cGR\u201d zone were not misrepresentations but were accurate. Because of c. 40A, \u00a7 7A, the December, 1965, rezoning did not become applicable to the locus. See part 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">(c) In answer to a question, \u201cIs land solid or filled,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>answer was \u201cSolid.\u201d The word \u201cDry\u201d'was checked instead of \u201cWet\u201d immediately thereafter on each application form. There was evidence of the excavation of peat on the locus, of the use of fill, and that the locus was \u201cwet.\u201d Much of this evidence was somewhat general. The building inspector went on the land during excavation before any pouring of concrete was done. He found \u201cHg]ood solid ground\u201d with \u201cstable, unchanged earth at the bottom of the hole.\u201d A little gravel fill was put in which \u201crolled down into a good solid base.\u201d He testified that the area was \u201c[w]et\u201d but, where \u201cthe building was going to be constructed,\u201d the area \u201c[T]his year . . . was dry, most of it.\u201d The evidence strongly suggests that, in the circumstances, where opinions thus differed, there was no material misrepresentation of fact. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the applications \u201cwere substantially conformable to the Qr^uilding [djode\u201d was justified by the evidence. The alleged misrepresentations provide no basis for revocation of the permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">5. The Aspells assert that the permits were properly revoked, because of either (a) specified inadequacies in the plans or (b) Gardens\u2019 failure to comply with certain administrative requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">(a) The Aspells rely upon an agreement by a letter dated March 16, 1965, signed in behalf of a predecessor of Gardens, that the cellar floor of the building on lots 838 and 839 would be one foot above the finished road grade of the adjacent street. The record shows no notation of this agreement-on the recorded subdivision plan approved March 29, 1965. We accept as true the evidence that the individuals now owning the Gardens project first learned of the agreement of March 16, 1965, when the permits were issued to them; that they had no knowledge of it (or of any conditions embodying the agreement) prior to their purchase of the locus; and that no such conditions or agreement appeared of record in the registry of deeds. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81X (as amended through St. 1962, c. 313; see later amendments through St. 1967, c. 248). See also \u00a7 81W (as inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Various provisions of the subdivision control law indicate that such agreements (affecting plans) made with planning boards, or conditions on the approval of plans imposed by planning boards, to be effective as restraints upon the use of land by reason of the subdivision control law (at least as to purchasers of land covered by a subdivision plan without actual notice of the agreement or condition), must be either inscribed on the plan or contained in a separate document referred to on the plan. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U (as amended through St. 1964, c. 105, \u00a7 2; see later amendments by St. 1965, c. 62, and St. 1967, c. 567); \u00a7 81R (as amended through St. 1955, c. 411, \u00a7 1), stipulating limited matters (not here relevant) as to which a planning board may impose conditions; \u00a7 81Y (inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7), as to the duty not to issue permits in violation of conditions indorsed on, or referred to in, a plan. See also <em>Ellen M. Gifford Sheltering Home Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wayland, </em>349 Mass. 292, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">No planning board \u201crule or regulation shall relate to the size, shape ... or use of lots within a subdivision, o\u00bb [with stated exceptions] <em>to the buildings </em>which may be constructed thereon\u201d (emphasis supplied). See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Ashland, </em>354 Mass. 660, 662-663, quoting c. 41, \u00a7 81Q (as amended through St. 1960, c. 417; see later amendments by St. 1965, c. 64, and St. 1969, c. 884, \u00a7 3). We have been referred to no regulations imposing any requirement such as that on which the Aspells rely. See <em>Castle Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Park &amp; Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>344 Mass. 329, 330-334. Prior decisions have discussed the legislative purpose to limit substantially the scope of permissible planning board action and regulations. See <em>Daley Constr. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Randolph, </em>340 Mass. 149,152-156; <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Southborough, </em>340 Mass. 157, 162-164. The subdivision control law found in c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K-81GG (at least in the absence of permissible, applicable regulations, see <em>Rounds </em>v. <em>Board of Water &amp; Sewer Commrs. of Wilmington, </em>347 Mass. 40, 45-47), does not extend to the imposition of conditions relating to the structural aspects of proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>buildings or to other matters not noted, or referred to, on approved plans or by appropriate recorded plan modifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We hold that the agreement of March 16, 1965, provided no basis upon which the board of appeal could order revocation of the permits, and that, in the circumstances shown by the evidence, Gardens is protected from that agreement by the absence of any notation of it on, or reference to it in, the recorded plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">(b) The Aspells contend that the plans (especially Sheet A-18-D-0) show that the buildings will exceed thirty feet, the maximum height allowed in a G district by \u00a7 15, par. A, Table E, of the zoning by-law. Section 15B provides that height is to \u201cbe measured vertically from the average finished grade of the ground adjoining a building ... to the highest point on the roof.\u201d In its reply brief, Gardens argues that the plans, properly read, show a total height of only twenty-nine feet, five inches from ground to roof top. The detailed plans, read as a whole, although not completely clear, appear to confirm Gardens\u2019 analysis. In any event the elevations (Sheets A-202 and A-203-D-O) show that the roof is to be twenty-nine feet, six inches, above ground grade for building no. 2 covered by permit no. 9949. Scaling the elevation plan (Sheets A-302 and A-303-D-O) for building no. 3, covered by permit no. 9950, indicates an even lower height above ground level. As we read the plans and evidence, the board\u2019s decision (on the height of the two buildings), in effect adopted by the trial judge, is not justified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">(c) The Aspells contend that Gardens\u2019 permits should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>be revoked because of an order dated May 18, 1966, of the State Department of Natural Resources (apparently in answer to a notice from a developer, dated April 7, 1966). The order, addressed to a predecessor in title to the locus, required (see G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 117C, inserted by St. 1965, c. 220; later amended by St. 1966, c. 276, and also by St. 1967, c. 802, \u00a7 1, completely revising G. L, c. 131, and covering the subject matter of old \u00a7 117C in new \u00a7 40), certain action with respect to construction then proposed upon the locus. The evidence shows no notice of this order to the present owners of Gardens before they purchased the locus, although they did know of the order before commencing construction. \u2022 The Superior Court, under new \u00a7 40, has jurisdiction in equity to enforce compliance with the section. One of the owners of Gardens testified that they intend to comply with this order before the project is completed. An agreement with the town covering street construction, drainage, water, and other matters, was executed by Gardens in 1968. The trial judge found that there had been compliance with this agreement. Since the project has not been completed, it cannot now be said that there will be violation of the 1966 order. In any event enforcement of the order is not to be accomplished by revocation of the permits as a result of an appeal under c. 40A, \u00a7 13. See the analogous situation in <em>Selectmen of Wrentham </em>v. <em>Monson, </em>355 Mass. 715, 716-718. If there is occasion for enforcement of the order, resort may be had to the remedies provided by new \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">(d) There was no failure to comply with conditions indorsed on the subdivision plan with respect either to filing a bond or to the sale of lots. The bond was filed. The sale of the locus as a whole by one developer to another was not a violation of a provision, in the conditional approval of the subdivision plan, that \u201c|ji]o lot <em>within </em>[the] subdivision shall be sold\u201d (emphasis supplied) until certain improvements should be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">(e) The plans and oral testimony show no proposed violation by Gardens, as to the building most readily to be served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>by each particular parking space, of \u00a7 10D of the zoning by-law which requires that \u201cthe walking distance between the farthest point of the parking area and the main pedestrian entrance\u201d shall not exceed 500 feet.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">(f) There was no failure to comply with G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 54 (inserted by St. 1965, c. 385, \u00a7 1), with respect to the availability of water. The trial judge found that water facilities \u201cwere installed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">6. Examination of the record shows that each ground for revoking the permit relied upon by the board of appeal or argued,in this court by the Aspells was either without support in the evidence or erroneous as matter of law. Because, with the few exceptions noted in this opinion, the judge\u2019s findings merely adopt the reasons stated by the board of appeal, neither the decision of the board of appeal nor the final decree can stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">7. The final decree is reversed. A new final decree is to be entered stating that the decision of the board of appeal is annulled as being in excess of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-13\"> The permits, by mistake, were issued to Norwood Gardens, Inc.

See <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of No. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 680.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\"> Section 7A reads in part, \u201cWhen a preliminary_plan . ._ . [see c. 41, \u00a7 SIS] has been submitted to a planning board, and written notice of the submission of such plan has been given to the . . . town clerk, the land shown on such preliminary plan and on the definitive plan evolved therefrom, or in the absence of a preliminary plan, the land shown on a definitive plan submitted under the provisions of the subdivision control law, shall be governed by applicable provisions of the zoning . . . by-law in effect at the time of submission of the plan first submitted while such plan or plans are being processed under said subdivision control law; and, if said definitive plan becomes approved . . . said provisions of the . . . by-law in effect at the time of the submission of the first submitted plan shall govern the land shown on such approved definitive plan for a period of five years from the date of endorsement of such approval notwithstanding any other provision of law; provided, that if a preliminary plan is submitted, the definitive plan is duly submitted within seven months from the date on which the preliminary plan was submitted.\u201d Although counsel for Gardens stated in his opening that a preliminary subdivision plan was filed in February, 1964, and a definitive plan was filed on June 23, 1964, these matters do not appear to have been brought out in evidence. See, as to the effect of amendments of \u00a7 7A, <em>Building Inspector of Acton </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Acton, </em>348 Mass. 453, 455-457.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> The Aspells\u2019 argument rests on a literal reading of \u00a7 7A, especially the proviso at the end of the portion quoted in fn. 3. Gardens, however, suggests that the \u201cpurpose of the seven-month[s] . . . limit is to make sure that an undue period does not pass during which zoning changes may take place [from which a developer may receive seven years of protection], between the filing of the preliminary plan and the filing of the definitive plan.\u201d This interpretation of the proviso by Gardens would mean, in effect, that any definitive plan, filed more than seven months after a preceding preliminary plan, is to be treated as a new plan, which gains protection under \u00a7 7A only from the date when it is filed and not as of the date of the filing of the preliminary plan. No substantial reason appears for any legislative intention that the proviso should preclude protection under \u00a7 7A from zoning amendments effective only after approval of a definitive plan. The effect and purpose of the ambiguous proviso, with respect to the issue argued, were not decided in <em>Paul Livoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Marlborough, </em>347 Mass. 330, 334-335.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> The interpretation contended for by the Aspells would mean that for four dwelling units, there must be two acres, 87,120 square feet, plus 16,000 square feet (4,000 square feet for each unit), a total of 103,120 square feet or 25,780 square feet for each unit. Even in a single residence (S2) district, Table B requires only 15,000 square feet for each dwelling unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> The required lot area for an A (multi-family) district is \u201c5000 sq. ft. for each dwelling unit in an attached house, double house or duplex house; 10,000 sq. ft. <em>plus an additional </em>2500 sq. ft. per dwelling unit for all units in excess of one ... on the lot for all other dwellings\u201d (emphasis supplied). The italicized words were not used in stating .the required lot area for G districts. There was evidence that, prior to the present case, on ten occasions, the Norwood authorities had construed the by-law provision as we do. See <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc. </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344. Cf. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Mahony, </em>354 Mass. 705, 708.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> It is to be noted also that review under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13, of action by the building inspector (see <em>Bearce v.Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Brockton, </em>351 Mass. 316, 319-320) relates only to his decisions \u201cin violation of . . . <em>this chapter </em>[c. 40A] or any . . . by-law adopted thereunder\u201d (emphasis supplied). A different remedy (a bill in equity in the Superior Court) is provided to deal with violations of a planning board order or condition imposed under the subdivision control law. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81Y.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> Our decision of this aspect of the case rests on our interpretation of the architect\u2019s plans as providing for no part of either building more than thirty feet above the surface of the adjacent ground. Nothing in this decision shall preclude the building inspector from requiring Gardens to clarify its plans to make them clear on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b279-14\"> It would be absurd to treat the driveway leading from the street to the parking space as a part of the parking space for the purpose of measuring distances under \u00a7\u00a7 10D and 10F.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
