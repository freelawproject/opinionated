A. Leone Realty and Development Corporation (Leone). He sought to restrain the housing authority and Leone from making or receiving \u201cany payments for work performed in the construction of\u201d a housing project known as Project Mass-10-7. He also requested a declaration that a letter of intent and contract of sale for the project constituted a contract for the construction of a building, and that such a contract was in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L. The defendants by way of counterclaim sought declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The case was submitted to the judge on a statement of agreed facts and on other evidence. The judge made additional findings and rulings and entered a final decree dismissing the Commissioner\u2019s bill. On the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, the decree declared that \u201cturnkey housing,\u201d the method of developing low-income housing used by the defendants, does not violate the minimum wage provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27D, or the competitive bidding provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In the companion case, eighteen taxpayers of the city of Lawrence brought a bill in equity, purportedly under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53, against the same defendants, as well as against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the city of Lawrence and the Lawrence Redevelopment Authority. The taxpayers\u2019 bill sought to restrain the performance of a \u201cCooperation Agreement\u201d between the city and the housing authority, to restrain the city from expending any funds to carry out Project Mass-10-7, and to restrain the redevelopment authority from conveying certain land to Leone. The judge sustained the defendants\u2019 demurrer, allowed their pleas in abatement and in bar, and entered a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The Commissioner and the taxpayers have appealed. Since the issue in both cases is the same, we need not review the interlocutory decrees in the taxpayers\u2019 case, but will decide both cases on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Both suits involve the implementation by the housing authority of a plan for the development, in connection with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), of a low-rent housing project. On January 20, 1969, the housing authority and HUD concluded an amendment (no. 7) to their \u201cconsolidated annual contributions contract.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the terms of the amendment, HUD agreed to assist the housing authority in acquiring and operating a low-rent housing project, designated as Project Mass-10-7, consisting of 105 dwelling units for the elderly. The housing authority was to acquire the project in accordance with a technique, known as \u201cturnkey housing,\u201d developed by HUD for providing low-cost public housing. Under this technique, a developer who owns or has an option on an appropriate site retains his own architect to draw preliminary plans and specifications for the construction or rehabilitation of housing units. The plans are submitted to the local housing authority. If the proposal is acceptable to the housing authority and to HUD, the housing authority and the developer will execute a \u201cletter of intent,\u201d which sets forth the plans and \u00e1 cost estimate. If the parties agree on a price, the developer retains a registered architect to prepare detailed \u201cworking\u201d plans and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>specifications. When these have been approved by HUD, the developer and the housing authority execute a contract of sale which contains provisions as to materials and the completion date, and in which the housing authority agrees to purchase the completed housing. HUD assures the availability of the purchase money upon completion of the project, and assures the developer that, if the housing authority should fail to carry out its contract obligations, HUD will assume the rights and obligations of the housing authority under the contract. The housing authority pays the developer upon completion of construction and the \u201cturning over of the keys.\u201d See U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Buying from Developers: A Guide to the \u201cTurnkey\u201d Method of Public Housing Construction, at pp. 4-6; Ledbetter, Public Housing \u2014 A Social Experiment Seeks Acceptance, 32 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 490, 517-518; Burstein, New Techniques in Public Housing, 32 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 528, 529-535. See also <em>Lehigh Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Orange, </em>56 N. J., 447, 450-457.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Pursuant to its contributions contract with HUD, the housing authority executed a letter of intent with Leone. Leone agreed to construct housing units, on property owned or to be acquired by Leone, in accordance with plans and specifications to be drawn by Leone and approved by the housing authority and HUD. The housing authority agreed to purchase the completed project if it complied with the approved plans and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">1. The Commissioner was directed by former G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26T (now substantially contained in G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 29, inserted by St. 1969, c. 751, \u00a7 1), to set wage rates in accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, of the several classifications of persons, including architects and laborers, employed in \u201cthe development or administration of a project.\u201d See <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>345 Mass. 406, 411-412. By G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 44K, his department is charged with enforcing the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, which require competitive bidding for contracts to be awarded by governmental units \u201cfor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, repair or demolition of any building\u201d (\u00a7 44A, as amended through St. 1967, c. 535, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The Commissioner maintains that the housing authority\u2019s letter of intent and proposed contract of sale with Leone amount to a contract for the construction of a building by a governmental unit within the meaning of G. L. c. 149, \u00a744A, and for the construction of public works within \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, and is also the \u201cdevelopment\u201d of a housing project within the meaning of former G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26T (see now G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 29). On that basis the Commissioner argues that the contract should have been awarded in accordance with the competitive bidding laws, c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, and the wages of those engaged in the construction of the project are to be determined by him in accordance with c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27. The defendants on the other hand maintain that their agreement constitutes a contract for the acquisition by the housing authority of a completed project rather than for the construction of one, and they accordingly argue that <em>wader </em>former c. 121<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as under the present housing authority law, c. 121B,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>acquisition contracts aie differentiated from construction contracts, so that the competitive bidding and minimum wage provisions of c. 149 do not apply to the type of transaction here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The turnkey method of housing development is clearly something more than the usual \u201cacquisition\u201d of realty and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>buildings. Under this method, before construction commences, the housing authority reviews and approves the plans for the project and in general thereafter exercises more control over the developer than is customarily exercised by a prospective purchaser of land and buildings. The turnkey method is also unlike the usual \u201cconstruction\u201d project, in that under the turnkey method the developer, rather than the housing authority, initiates the basic design for the project and retains the architect and contractor. The completed project or \u201cend product\u201d is purchased by the housing authority only if the project meets its requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8 We need not decide whether, in circumstances other than those of the instant case, an arrangement similar to the turnkey procedure would constitute a contract for the construction of a public building or public works. The cases may be more readily disposed of on another ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">2. We are of opinion that, as the defendants also argue, the case is controlled by our decision in <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>345 Mass. 406. In that case a local housing authority, pursuant to the United States Housing Act (42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1435 [1958], as amended, \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1436 [Supp. III, 1962]), and the State housing authority law (former G. L. c. 121, \u00a7\u00a7 26I etseq.), had entered into a \u201c contributions contract\u201d with the Federal Public Housing Administration (Federal Administration) prohibiting expenditures on the operation of a housing project in excess of an operating budget submitted to and approved by the Federal Administration. We held that local housing authorities had been authorized by G. L. c. 121, \u00a7\u00a7 26P and 26Y, to make contracts and to cooperate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the Federal government in low-rent housing projects, and that the housing authority was not required to increase its wage expenditures to comply with the Commissioner\u2019s determination pursuant to c. 121, \u00a7 26T, and c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26, 27, unless the increase (in view of housing authority\u2019s contract with the Federal Administration) was approved by that Administration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">One of the grounds for our decision in the <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>case was that \u201cQQhe State housing authority law . . . was enacted with full legislative cognizance of the United States Housing Act,\u201d and there was \u201cthus very direct State legislative consent to the type of contract which the authority\u201d had made with the Federal Administration. 345 Mass, at 413. A construction of c. 121 permitting the Commissioner under \u00a7 26T to compel the housing authority to increase its expenditures would have caused the housing authority \u201cto commit a 'substantial breach\u2019 of a contract which the Legislature . . . [had] authorized,\u201d and would raise the question \u201cwhether \u00a7 26T, and the commissioner\u2019s orders under it, impair the obligation of the contract. See U. S. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">It appears that the Federal government first announced its plan to utilize the turnkey procedure in the development of low-rent housing in 1966. See Burstein, <em>supra, </em>32 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Regulations governing the procedure were promulgated under the broad rule-making power granted HUD by 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1408 (Supp. IV 1965-1968), and now appear in HUD\u2019s publication entitled, Low-Rent Housing Turnkey Handbook.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is clear that if a housing authority decides to develop a project by means of the turnkey method it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>comply with the requirements of the Handbook, in which no provision is made for competitive bidding, but which does contain HIJD\u2019s own provisions regarding salaries or wages of those employed in the construction of a project.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The turnkey procedure obviously could not have been known to the Legislature at the time former c. 121 was enacted. Nevertheless, we think the authorization given local housing authorities in both former c. 121 and present c. 121B to cooperate with the Federal government is sufficiently broad to encompass the utilization of the turnkey procedure. Section 26P of c. 121, as appearing in St. 1946, c. 574, \u00a7 1, authorized local housing authorities \u201c(a) ... to receive loans, grants, and annual or other periodic contributions from the federal government,\u201d and \u201c(b) . . . <em>to act as agent of, </em>or to co-operate with the federal government in any . . . housing project\u201d (emphasis supplied). Substantially the same language appears in the present housing authority law, c. 121B, \u00a7 11 (c), (b), inserted by St. 1969, c. 751, \u00a7 1. See also former c. 121, \u00a7 26Y,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the similar language now in c. 121B, \u00a7 11 (k). In its recent decision in <em>Lehigh Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authy. of Orange, </em>56 N. J. 447, 459-463, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that the State housing authority law of New Jersey, enacted in 1938, was sufficiently broad to allow local authorities to engage in turnkey housing despite the terms of the State competitive bidding statute. The language of the New Jersey housing authority law is somewhat more explicit than the Massachusetts law with regard to obtaining Federal assistance.9 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we think it is clear that the Legislature intended that local housing authorities be able to take advantage of any available Federal assistance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>developing low-rent projects, including programs of Federal assistance not envisaged when c. 121 was enacted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Pursuant to legislative authorization, G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26P (a), (b), and c. 121B, \u00a7 11 (c), (b), the housing authority in these cases is acting \u201cas agent of\u201d HUD in performing a Federal function. The Commissioner, therefore, has no more power to require the housing authority to comply with the competitive bidding and minimum wage laws than he would have were HUD itself contracting with Leone. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The final decree in the pnricipal suit should not have dismissed the bill and is reversed. <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>325 Mass. 334, 336. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>328 Mass. 59, 62-63. A new final decree is to be entered in that suit declaring on both the bill and the counterclaim that the minimum wage provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27D, and the competitive bidding provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L do not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>federally assisted \u201cturnkey housing\u201d project involved in the suit. The interlocutory and final decrees in the taxpayers\u2019 suit are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> See 42 U.
