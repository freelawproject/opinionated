After the defendants failed to appear for their court-ordered depositions, the plaintiffs moved pursuant to CPLR 3126 to strike the answer or for a judgment by default. The defendants opposed the motion. By order entered February 3, 2012, the Supreme Court conditionally granted that branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion which was to strike the answer unless, inter alia, the defendants appeared for depositions within a specified time. When the defendants failed to appear for their depositions within the specified time period, the plaintiffs moved, in effect, to strike the answer and for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The defendants opposed the motion. The Supreme Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">A court may, inter alia, issue an order \u201cstriking out pleadings or . . . rendering a judgment by default\u201d as a sanction against a party who \u201crefuses to obey an order for disclosure or wilfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>fails to disclose information which the court finds ought to have been disclosed\u201d (CPLR 3126 [3]). While actions should be resolved on the merits when possible, a court may strike an answer upon a clear showing that the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with a disclosure order was the result of willful and contumacious conduct <em>(see Carabello v Luna, </em>49 AD3d 679 [2008]; <em>Maignan v Nahar, </em>37 AD3d 557 [2007]; <em>Espinal v City of New York, </em>264 AD2d 806 [1999]). Here, defense counsel asserted that he could not produce the individual defendant for deposition because he could not secure his cooperation or locate him. The defendants failed to substantiate a reasonable excuse for the individual defendant\u2019s failure to appear for a court-ordered deposition (see <em>Sadoyan v Castro, </em>102 AD3d 666, 667 [2013]; <em>Carabello v Luna, </em>49 AD3d at 680; <em>Duncan v Hebb, </em>47 AD3d 871 [2008]; <em>Maignan v Nahar, </em>37 AD3d at 557; <em>Bates v Baez, </em>299 AD2d 382 [2002]; <em>Robinson v Rollins Leasing Corp., </em>288 AD2d 367 [2001]). Furthermore, the defendants failed to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for the corporate defendant\u2019s failure to appear for a court-ordered deposition (see <em>Vaz v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>85 AD3d 902, 903 [2011]; <em>Commisso v Orshan, </em>85 AD3d 845 [2011]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in issuing a conditional order requiring the defendants, inter alia, to appear for depositions within a specified time or face the sanction of striking their answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">When the defendants failed to appear for their court-ordered depositions within the specified time, the conditional order entered February 3, 2012, became absolute <em>(see Wilson v Galicia Contr. &amp; Restoration Corp., </em>10 NY3d 827, 830 [2008]; <em>Zouev v City of New York, </em>32 AD3d 850 [2006]; <em>Marrone v Orson Holding Corp., </em>302 AD2d 371, 371-372 [2003]). To be relieved of the adverse impact of the order striking their answer, the defendants were required to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for their failure to appear for depositions and a potentially meritorious defense <em>(see Gibbs v St. Barnabas Hosp., </em>16 NY3d 74, 80 [2010]; <em>Zouev v City of New York, </em>32 AD3d 850 [2006]; <em>Macancela v Pekurar, </em>286 AJD2d 320 [2001]). The defendants failed to demonstrate either. Thus, their answer was properly stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">As a result of having their answer stricken, the defendants were deemed to admit all traversable allegations in the complaint, including the basic allegation of liability <em>(see Wilson v Galicia Contr. &amp; Restoration Corp., </em>10 NY3d at 830; <em>Curiale v Ardra Ins. Co., </em>88 NY2d 268, 269 [1996]; <em>Rokina Opt. Co. v Camera King, </em>63 NY2d 728, 730 [1984]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted that branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>motion which was for summary judgment on the issue of liability <em>(see Francesco v Empress Ambulance Serv., Inc., </em>100 AD3d 589 [2012]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AikR\">Skelos, J.P, Chambers, Sgroi and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
