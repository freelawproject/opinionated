Hawley Insurance Company\u2019s (Mt. Hawley) motion for summary judgment declaring that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify plaintiff in the underlying personal injury action, granted defendant Metropolitan Opera Association, Inc.\u2019s (the Met) motion for summary judgment declaring that Mt. Hawley is obligated to defend and indemnify the Met in an underlying personal injury action, denied Mt. Hawley\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment declaring that it is not obligated to defend or indemnify the Met in the underlying action, and dismissed the Met\u2019s second and third cross claims against Mt. Hawley on the basis that they were abandoned; as amended by the order, same court and Justice, entered October 16, 2012, upon reargument, reinstating the Met\u2019s second and third cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>claims on the basis that they were not abandoned; as further amended by order, same court and Justice, entered October 16, 2012, upon reargument, declaring that Mt. Hawley\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify is conditioned upon a finding of negligence by plaintiff or those acting on plaintiffs behalf, unanimously modified, on the law, to (1) deny Mt. Hawley\u2019s motion for the dismissal of the complaint as against it upon the declaration that Mt. Hawley has no duty to defend and indemnify plaintiff, (2) to dismiss the Met\u2019s third cross claim against Mt. Hawley for expenses incurred in this action, (3) to delete that portion of the court\u2019s October 16, 2012 order upon reargument that conditioned Mt. Hawley\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify the Met upon a finding of negligence by plaintiff in the underlying action and to declare that Mt. Hawley\u2019s duty to defend the Met shall arise and be conditioned upon a finding of an act or omission by plaintiff or one acting on plaintiffs behalf, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The court properly determined that Mt. Hawley is obligated to defend and indemnify the Met in the underlying personal injury action. It is undisputed that there was a contract between plaintiff and the Met and that the contract required plaintiff to purchase insurance coverage naming the Met as an additional insured. It is also undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s commercial general liability (CGL) policy from Mt. Hawley contained an additional insured endorsement. The court correctly rejected Mt. Hawley\u2019s interpretation of the contract language, as it would be inconsistent with the terms of the contract and the policy <em>(Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Co., L.R v Marsh USA, Inc., </em>87 AD3d 65, 70 [1st Dept 2011]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The court also properly rejected Mt. Hawley\u2019s argument that it timely disclaimed coverage to the Met on the basis of late notice. The only letters sent by Mt. Hawley to the Met were those intended to preserve its right to disclaim. These letters were insufficient to actually disclaim coverage <em>(see Hartford Ins. Co. v County of Nassau, </em>46 NY2d 1028, 1029 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The wording of the court\u2019s declaration that the Met is entitled to defense and indemnity in the underlying action must be altered, however, to exclude the necessity of a finding of negligence by plaintiff in the underlying action. The additional insured endorsement speaks in terms of \u201cacts or omissions,\u201d not negligence. Thus, in the unlikely event that it would be found that some nonnegligent act by plaintiff caused the accident, the Met would still be entitled to coverage under the additional insured endorsement <em>(see Admiral Ins. Co. v Joy Contrs., Inc., </em>81 AD3d 521, 523 [1st Dept 2011], <em>mod on other grounds </em>19 NY3d 448 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The Met is not entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in this action <em>(see New York Univ. v Continental Ins. Co., </em>87 NY2d 308, 324 [1995]).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The court properly found that Mt. Hawley is not required to defend and indemnify plaintiff in the underlying action. Plaintiffs notice of the accident to Mt. Hawley was untimely as a matter of law, and Mt. Hawley timely disclaimed coverage on that ground. Plaintiffs notice to its broker did not provide timely notice to Mt. Hawley. There is no indication that plaintiffs broker acted as an agent for Mt. Hawley or that the CGL policy listed plaintiffs broker as its agent <em>(cf. Mighty Midgets v Centennial Ins. Co., </em>47 NY2d 12 [1979]). Nor was plaintiffs alleged belief of nonliability reasonable under the circumstances <em>(see Hermitage Ins. Co. v JDG Lexington Corp., </em>99 AD3d 428 [1st Dept 2012]). Mt. Hawley was entitled to a declaration in its favor, but the complaint should not have been dismissed as against it <em>(see Lanza v Wagner, </em>11 NY2d 317, 334, 340 [1962], <em>cert denied </em>371 US 901 [1962]).</p>\n<judges id=\"A3ba\">Concur\u2014Friedman, J.P, Moskowitz, DeGrasse, Richter and Gische, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
