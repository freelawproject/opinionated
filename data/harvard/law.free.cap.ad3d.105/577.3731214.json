Defendant, who asserts that he would derive certain benefits from being resentenced, argues that he should still be resentenced to his original prison term, without adding PRS. Since this appeal was not taken from a sentence or a resentence, but rather, from the denial of resentencing, it must be dismissed <em>(see People v Pagan, </em>19 NY3d 368 [2012]; <em>People v De Jesus, </em>54 NY2d 447 [1981]). \u201c[N]o appeal lies from an order arising out of a criminal proceeding absent specific statutory authorization\u201d <em>(People v Santos, </em>64 NY2d 702, 704 [1984]).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">Defendant\u2019s further contention that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty is not properly before this Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"Afl\">Concur\u2014Tom, J.P, Sweeny, Saxe, Rom\u00e1n and Feinman, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
