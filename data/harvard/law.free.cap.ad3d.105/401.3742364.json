Kern, J.], entered October 20, 2010), dismissed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that petitioner intentionally failed to report approximately $30,000 of income earned by her daughter during a three-year period is supported by substantial evidence <em>(see Matter of Purdy v Kreisberg, </em>47 NY2d 354, 358 [1979]). He also found that while petitioner would not be able to afford the apartment without assistance, she will not be rendered homeless as a result of the termination of the subsidy, and that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficient to warrant reversal of HPD\u2019s termination of the benefits. Here, as in <em>Matter of Perez v Rhea </em>(20 NY3d 399, 405 [2013]), \u201ctermination of petitioner\u2019s tenancy was not \u2018so disproportionate to the offense, in the light of all the circumstances, as to be shocking to one\u2019s sense of fairness.\u2019 \u201d As noted by the Court in <em>Perez, </em>\u201c[a] vital public interest underlies the need to enforce income rules pertaining to public housing. . . . The deterrent value of eviction ... is clearly significant and supports the purposes of the limited supply of publicly-supported housing.\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 405.) Notwithstanding the hardship to petitioner, the penalty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>termination is confirmed <em>(see Matter of Cubilete v Morales, </em>92 AD3d 470 [1st Dept 2012]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AOT\">Concur\u2014Tom, J.E, Andrias, Acosta, Moskowitz and Abdus-Salaam, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
