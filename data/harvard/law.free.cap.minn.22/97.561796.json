The alleged defalcation in each term is stated as a separate cause of action, and a fifth cause of action is added, in which he is charged with the receipt and conversion, during his several terms of office, of the sum of $41,000.00, being the aggregate of the defalcations alleged in the statements of the four first causes of action. For a sixth cause of action it is alleged that during his several terms of office the defendant rendered to the commissioners and auditor of the county false statements and accounts of the moneys received and paid out by him as such treasurer; and that the amount of his receipts over and above the payments was greater, by the sum of $41,000.00, than the amount reported by him in his-said statements and accounts ; and it is further alleged that the fraud and conversion so committed by defendant were not discovered by plaintiff until one year previous to the commencement of this action, which was brought in the district court for Mower county in September, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">In the statement of each of the five first causes of action the - defendant is alleged to have received \u201c of state funds, school funds, interest, fines, redemptions, licenses, general and special taxes, and various other sources as provided by law,\u201d the sum he is therein charged with converting. In each of the four first causes of action it is alleged, though with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>some slight variations in phraseology, that the\" defendant \u201c was the lawful recipient and custodian of the moneys so received until duly transferred to the proper authorities, or officers authorized by law to receive the same, or to his successor in office,\u201d and that he 44 did wilfully and wrongfully neglect and refuse to account for and pay over any part \u25a0thereof to the proper authorities and officers authorized to receive the same, and did convert the same to his own use.\u201d In the statement of the first cause of action the money is alleged to have been \u201cpart of the funds and property of said county and state, and money belonging in the treasury thereof,\u201d and defendant is charged with failure \u201cto account for and pay over and return said money to said county and state.\u201d In the statement of the second cause of action the money is alleged to have been 4 4 part of the funds belonging to said county and state,\u201d and defendant is chai\u2019ged with failure \u201cto pay and disburse the same, or any part thereof, to the officers and authorities of towns and school districts in said county, and to said county and state, such portions of said money, or any part thereof, which they or each of them were entitled by law to receive.\u201d In the statement of the third cause of action the money is alleged to have been 44 a part of the funds belonging to the various towns and school districts of said county, and to said state;\u201d and it is charged that the defendant, 4 4 at the expiration of his said term of office, and at the time fixed by law for treasurers to make settlement with said state, town, county and school districts,, and pay over the money to them belonging, did wilfully and wrongfully neglect to account for and transfer to the proper.authorities and officers authorized to receive the same such moneys and the whole thereof, and did fail and neglect to pay said county of Mower the portions of such moneys belonging to the special funds raised therein by levy of special tax, and did fail to pay over to the state such portions of such money as to it belonged.\u201d In the statement of the fourth cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the money is alleged to have been \u201c a part of the funds belonging to the several towns and school districts in said county, and to said state,\u201d and the defendant is charged with failure \u201cto pay to said county of Mower, to said state, and to the several towns and school districts in said county, the funds and the portions of said money to each belonging.\u201d In the statement of-the fifth cause of action the $41,000.00, which defendant is charged with converting during his four terms of office, is stated to have \u201c belonged to the several funds of the treasury of the said county of Mower, to towns, school districts, county, and to said state funds ;\u201d and it- is charged that the defendant, \u2018\u2018 at the expiration of his said term of office, and at the various times provided by law for county treasurers to make settlement with, and pay over to, towns, school districts, county and state the various sums of money to them and each of them belonging, did wilfully and corruptly neglect and refuse to pay over and transfer to his successors, and to the several towns and precincts aforesaid, and the said county and state, the moiiey in his custody, and to them and each of them belonging, and did wilfully, corruptly and without authoi'ity convert and appropriate said money to his own use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\">The defendant included in his notice of appearance a demand of \u201c a copy of the account or bill of particulars of the demand upon which this action is founded,\u201d which-was not complied'with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">The answer contains a general denial of all the allegations in the complaint, (except the allegation that defendant was county treasurer,) a denial of the conversions-charged, a plea of the statute of limitations to the two first causes of action, and an averment that defendant, during-all the time he was treasurer, and at the times required by law, duly and fully accounted to and with the plaintiff for all moneys by him received as such treasurer, and settled with the plaintiff therefor, and duly and fully paid over to the proper authorities and persons, as required by law, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>such moneys by him received. The answer further alleges \u201c that during all the time, and each and every time, that he held said office, embracing all the period covered by the complaint, he did, at each of the times prescribed by law for the county treasurer to make settlements with the auditor or county commissioners, make settlements with said \u2022authorities of all his business, accounts and transactions as county treasurer, and render to them, at each of said times, \u2022a stated account in writing of all said transactions, which was examined by said auditor and county commissioners, \u2022\u25a0and approved and adopted and accepted by them, and said accounts respectively settled and adjusted by and between \u25a0said authorities and this defendant as such treasurer, and \u25a0all balances found to be due from him as such treasurer, upon said accounting and settlement, were then and there \u25a0duly and fully paid by this defendant, as required by law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\">By consent of parties the action was referred to three referees, who were engaged for several months in the hearing and determination of it, a great amount of testimony being taken. At the beginning of the trial the defendant moved for a dismissal on the ground that the action could not be brought by the plaintiff, but only by the auditor of the count}', and for the failure of plaintiff to serve a bill of particulars in compliance with defendant\u2019s demand. He also, on this last ground, objected to the admission of any evidence. The motion and the objection were overruled, \u25a0and exceptions duly noted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">The plaintiff, to prove the collection of taxes by the defendant, offered in evidence the collector\u2019s books, or grand duplicates, for the several towns in the county, with the word \u201cpaid,\u201d and the name of the defendant, written in the margin of each book, opposite items of taxes. The defendant \u25a0objected to the evidence, \u201c 1, on the ground that no evidence is admissible under the pleadings that seeks to go behind, \u25a0or overturn, the annual settlements and stated accounts made by plaintiff and defendant: 2, that no bill of particulars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>has been furnished; and, 3, that there is no evidence that the name of the defendant, with the word \u201cpaid\u201d so written in the margin, opposite items of taxes, is the signature of defendant. The objection was overruled, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved for a dismissal for want of evidence to warrant a finding for plaintiff, and because \u201c there is proof, uncontradicted, that all accounts were stated between the parties each year while defendant was in office, and it cannot be impeached in this-action.\u201d The motion was denied, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">The defendant then offered evidence tending to prove that, in very many instances,his name, with the word \u201cpaid,\u201d in the margin of the grand duplicates, was not his signature, nor written with his authority, and tending to prove annual statements and settlements of his accounts as treasurer between himself and the county commissioners, and a like statement and settlement when he retired from office. The plaintiff, in rebuttal, offered evidence to disprove the evidence introduced by defendant to show the forgeries of his name in the grand duplicates. Thereupon, the plaintiff' having rested, the defendant again moved for a dismissal \u201con the ground that the defence has clearly proved a stated and settled account, and that the evidence is not contradicted, and the same cannot be sivreharged, falsified, or opened, under this complaint, or in this form of action.\u201d The motion was denied, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The referees found, among other things, that during his-entire term of office the defendant, as treasurer, collected and converted to his own use $17,144.97, \u201c but at what particular times, and out of what particular fund or funds, the referees are unable to determine from the evidence, and the evidence does not disclose.\u201d They also found that during the time the defendant was treasurer \u201c there was no settlement and balancing of accounts, such as are required by law, between the defendant and the county commission<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ers, or the defendant and county auditor of said county,\u201d and ordered judgment for plaintiff for the amount so found to have been converted, with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-3\">A motion for a new trial, made before <em>Waite, </em>J., of the sixth district, (the judge of the tenth district having been an attorney in the action,) was denied, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-4\"><em>Gordon E.

St. ch. 66, \u00a7 26, every action must be brought in the name of the real party in interest, except when the plaintiff is an executor or administrator, a trustee of an express trust, or a person expressly authorized by* statute to sue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">The plaintiff is not the real party in interest. The complaint itself shows that the money alleged to have been converted did not all belong to the county, and there is nothing in the facts or findings to show that the county is \u2018 \u2018 the real party in interest \u201d as to a single dollar of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">The county is interested in but a small paid of the moneys in the hands of the treasurer, and is not responsible to the state, towns, school districts, etc., for the taxes due them. As to these, the county officers act as agents of the state, towns, etc., and not as agents of the county. Nor is the county the trustee of an express trust, as that term is used in the statute. If any one is such trustee it is the state, in whose name the treasurer\u2019s bond may be prosecuted for the benefit of all parties interested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">The statute has provided a remedy in a case like this by suit on the treasurer\u2019s bond, and it must be followed.

Counties have no common law right to sue and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>sued. They can only sue when and in the manner authorized by statute. <em>Schuyler Co. </em>v. <em>Mercer Co., </em>4 Gilm. 20; <em>County of Rock Island </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>31 Ill. 543.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-4\">The treasurer\u2019s bond runs to the state, and any person or body politic entitled to the benefit of the security, or injured by his misconduct, may sue on the bond to recover the amount to which he is entitled; but, to prevent the treasurer being overwhelmed by a multitude of suits, any plaintiff other than the state must first obtain leave of the district court, (which was not done in this case,) the state, as trustee, being the proper party plaintiff, and suits by others being exceptional, and their right to sue depending on the sound discretion of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">If a county treasurer fails to account for or pay over all moneys with which he stands charged, the county auditor, on receiving instructions for that purpose from the state auditor or the county commissioners, shall cause an action to be brought against the treasurer and his sureties. Gen. St. ch 8, \u00a7 136. Specific remedies are also provided in Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 135, 143, 144; ch. 11, \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">\u201cThe commissioners shall exercise no other powers than those given by law and shall have the management of the county funds and business, except in cases otherwise provided for.\u201d Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 104. The case of a defaulting treasurer is \u201c otherwise provided for.\u201d The only power conferred on counties as to suits is the general corporate power \u201cto sue and be sued,\u201d (Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 75,) leaving the mode in which, and the cases when, to be otherwise provided for. When a county sues in the' exercise of its general powers, it must sue in the name of its board of commissioners, \u201c but this provision shall not prevent other county officers, when authorized by law, from suing in their name of office for the benefit of the county,\u201d (Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 80,) thus excluding the cases where the county auditor is required to cause suit to be brought against the treasurer and his sureties. There being no power conferred on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>-commissioners to bring suit, or have the management of the \u2022county funds, in cases otherwise provided for by law, this Action cannot be sustained. <em>Hunter v.

Taxes and assessments are purely creatures of statute, and the statutes already cited furnish the only Remedy for a diversion of them by a collector from the county treasury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-4\">2. If plaintiff can recover at all, it can only be for county funds. The judgment in this action could not be pleaded in bar to a suit on the treasurer\u2019s bond, brought by the \u2022state, or by any town or school district, for there is no privity between them and the plaintiff, nor is plaintiff trustee of an express trust for their benefit, nor authorized by statute to bring this suit on their b\u00e9half. But in the absence -of legislation, or some peculiar reason giving duplicate Actions, a right of action for the same thing cannot exist at the same time in two independent corporations or individuals. People <em>v. Ingersoll, </em>58 N. Y. 1, 20. An action on the bond against the treasurer and his sureties cannot exist in \u2022one, and against the treasurer alone, in a common law action in another, to recover for the same defalcation. If judgment is rendered in this action for $17,000.00 in gross, it cannot be ascertained from the pleadings or the judgment how much \u2022of the money converted was county funds, and how much belonged to the several towns and school districts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-5\">The county treasurer is a public officer, elected pursuant to general laws, performing various services for different bodies politic. The county, as such, is not responsible for his acts, except so far as he acts as its agent. The county is not the custodian of any funds collected by him, except those ^belonging to the county itself, and the county is not responsible to the state or school districts for money in his hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>belonging to them. <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Town of Monroe, </em>11 NY. 392; <em>People v. Supervisors Chenango Co., </em>11 N Y. 563 ; <em>Town of Fishkill </em>v. <em>Plank Poad Co., </em>22 Barb. 634; <em>Town of Galen </em>v. <em>Plank Road Co., </em>27 Barb. 523; <em>Sherbourne </em>v. <em>Yuba Co., </em>21 Cal. 113; <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>San Joaquin. Co., </em>21 Cal. 426. The later decisions in New York, while holding that taxes illegally levied, collected and paid into the treasury of a town or county, and used by it, may be-recovered back, put this not on the ground that the county or town was responsible for the acts of revenue officers, holding office under general laws, but on the ground that the funds sued for had gone into the treasury of the town or county, and been used by it. <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Town of Monroe, </em>11 N. Y. 392; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Supervisors Livingston Co., </em>45 N. Y. 676 ; <em>Bank of Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>43 N. Y. 184. But if the county can recover, in this action, for more than its own funds, it must be because the treashrer acted as its agent, and it is, therefore, responsible to other-bodies politic for moneys collected and converted by him. The case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery Co., </em>26 Ind. 522, is not in point, for in Indiana the county is by statute made responsible to the state for default of the treasurer to pay over state moneys. In <em>Sacramento Co. </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>31 Cal. 46, the action ivas sustained on the ground that it was-brought for county funds only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-4\">3. The defendant was clearly entitled to a bill of particulars, the action being upon a long and complicated account, and an attempt to overturn an account stated, Avith nothing in the pleadings to advise defendant of the nature of the-alleged deficit. <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Sackett, </em>1 Cow. 571, and note. If a pleader, claiming on an account stated, is required to furnish a bill of particulars under the statute, <em>a fortiori' </em>should it be required of one avIio seeks to overturn and go behind such an account, without surcharging it, or affording by his pleadings any information or notice of the deficit. Gen. St. ch. 66, \u00a7 88 ; <em>Goings </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>17 Abb. Pr. 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">4. The uncontradicted proof shows that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>rendered to the commissioners and the auditor statements in exact compliance with the statute. The complaint itself affirmatively alleges that he made such statements, and charges only that they were untrue. The complaint, therefore, if treated as a bill in equity seeking to surcharge the accounts, is fatally defective in not setting out the particular matters in which such statements are alleged to be untrue. If the complaint proceeds on the theory of ignoring the account stated, then, upon the proof made of the stated and settled account expressly pleaded in the answer, the action should have been dismissed. Certainly no evidence seeking to go behind the account was competent until plaintiff amended the complaint by setting out the specific items of deficit claimed. 1 Dan. Ch. Pr. 371; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Myrick, </em>16 Minn. 91; <em>Weed </em>v. <em>Smull, </em>7 Paige, 573 ; <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Market Bank, </em>48 Barb. 302 ; <em>Chappedelaine </em>v. <em>DeChenaux, </em>4 Cranch, 306 ; <em>Bruen </em>v. <em>Hone, </em>2 Barb. 586 ; <em>Stoughton </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>2 John.

Ch. 1; <em>Supervisors Iowa Co. </em>v. <em>Vivian, </em>31 Wis. 217 ; <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Page, </em>7 How. 819. The plea, being of a <em>settled </em>as well as stated account, need not show the balance. Sto. Eq. Pl. \u00a7 798. In <em>Lockwood v. Thorne, </em>18 N. Y. 285, an action to recover a single item alleged to have been allowed by mistake, it is merely held that a stated and settled account is not an absolute estoppel, and the court expressly approve the doctrine for which we contend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-3\">The objection of the statute of limitations was met by the claim that this was an equitable action for relief on the ground of fraud, and that the action was brought within six years after discovery of the fraud, and the referees so held. This holding can only be sustained on the ground that this is an equitable action to set aside the stated accounts for fraud, and not a common law action to recover an alleged deficit. If this be true, then the plaintiff, having alleged a. stated account which he seeks to set aside for fraud, must-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>first allege and then proye the particulars of the deficit; otherwise the stated account is conclusive. If this was not the form of action, then it was a common law action to recover a deficit, ignoring any stated account, and it would be for defendant to prove the account were it not admitted in the complaint; but in such action the plaintiff would be barred by the statute of limitations. Both rulings cannot stand. <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Van Etten, </em>12 Minn. 522.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-4\">5.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0\">This is an action against the defendant, ex-treasurer of the county of Mower, for failing to account for and pay over, and for converting, moneys belonging in the treasury of the county. In the complaint ar\u00e9 five causes of action, or counts, the first four relating to as many different terms of office of defendant, and the fifth covering all of them. The aggregate amount claimed in the complaint is $41,000.00, alleged to have belonged to the various funds in the treasury \u2014 state, county, town and school funds \u2014 the amount belonging to each not being stated. The referees find by their report that, during his terms of office, the defendant appropriated, and converted to his own use, $17,144.97 from the county treasury; but at what particular times, or from what particular fund or funds, the}'- say they are unable to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendant makes, and argues with great ability, the \u2022objection that the board of county commissioners is not the proper party plaintiff in a suit of this kind, and this we deem the most important question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The statute (Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 75;) makes each organized county a body politic and corporate, with capacity to sue and be sued, without any specification of the cases in which it may sue and be sued, and by \u00a7 80 the name by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>which it is to sue or be sued is \u201cThe Board of County Commissioners \u201d of the county. The case is different from that of <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Comm\u2019rs of Mercer County, </em>10 Ohio St. 515, for in that state counties are not bodies corporate, and general authority to. sue and be sued is not conferred on them by statute ; but the statute of that state expressly specifies the cases in which the boards of county commissioners may sue or be sued. In this state the county may sue or be sued in any matter pertaining to the business or interests of the county, with no limitation other than would apply to any corporation. That the county commissioners may sue a defaulting treasurer, without reference to his official bond, is held in <em>Comm\u2019rs of McLeod County </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>19 Minn. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">The principal argument used to show that the county is not the proper plaintiff is, that the moneys abstracted from the county treasury belong, not to the county, but to the state, towns and school districts, and that, therefore, the county is not the real party in interest; and that, because the statute prescribes that the treasurer\u2019s bond shall run, not to the county, but to the state, the latter and not the former is the trustee of the various funds in the treasury; and that if suit is to be brought by any but the real parties in interest \u2014 that is, the various' corporations or <em>quasi </em>corporations'to whom the various funds belong \u2014 then it must be brought by, or in the name of, the state, as the trustee of an express trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">This suit is not upon the bond, but upon the defendant\u2019s liability, independent of it. This liability does not arise upon the bond, nor are the rights of the county as against the defendant created by it. It is required, not for the purpose of defining the rights and liabilities of the parties, but as security to rights and obligations that would exist if no bond were given. But the provisions of statute in regard to such bonds, and the enforcement of them, are material and controlling, as showing the relations of the state, county,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>towns, school districts, etc., to the, moneys intended to be secured by them; and we think that whoever would be a proper plaintiff in a suit upon such a bond would be a proper plaintiff in a suit not on the bond to enforce the liability which the bond is given to secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">By Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 126, the bonds of county treasurers are \u201cpayable to the state of Minnesota, and conditioned for the safe-keeping and paying over, according to law, of all moneys which come into his hands for state, county, township, school, road, bridge, poor, town, and all other purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Section 1, ch. 78, Gen. St., provides that \u201cthe official bond, or other security, of a public officer to the state, or any municipal body or corporation, whether with or without sureties, is to b.e construed as security to all persons, severally, for the official delinquencies against which it is intended to provide, as well as to the state, body or corporation designated therein; provided, that when no other provision is made by law, it shall run to the state of Minnesota.\u201d Section 2. \u201cWhen a public officer, by official 'misconduct or neglect, forfeits his official bond, or renders his sureties liable upon an official security, any person injured thereby, or avIio is by law entitled to the benefit of the security, may bring an action thereon in his oavii name,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">This statute makes the decisions cited from <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>2 Ind. 40, and <em>Snyder v. State, </em>21 Ind. 77, inapplicable, because in that state, so far as we can discover from those cases, there is no provision of statute like the one Ave have just quoted, and suits on official bonds, which are required to run to the state as obligee, must be brought in the name of the state, being governed wholly by the rules of the common law. According to the provisions of these statutes the state, in the greater number of official bonds, is only a nominal, and not the actual, obligee. This, however, shows no more than that the state need not, simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>b&gt;y reason of its being named as obligee in tbe bond, be the plaintiff in a suit on it. Any person entitled to its security may sue upon it after obtaining leave of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">It is not necessary to determine whether the state, or any \u2022city, town or school district,may, by reason of its interest, and not by reason of the statute directing suit to be brought, sue, either on the bond or independently of it, for the portion of the abstracted moneys to which it is entitled. The question is, does the statute intend that the county may sue to enforce a restoration to its treasury of all moneys unlawfully taken or withheld from it? It does not follow that because one may sue, the other cannot. The right of the .general owner of property, and of one having a special property in it, to sue for a conversion of it, is an instance of a right at common law in two different persons to sue for the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">N\u00f3r does the right of the county to sue depend on its being strictly the trustee of an express trust within the meaning of Gen. St. ch. 66, \u00a7 28. The county is expressly Authorized by statute to bring suit, and if the recovery to its treasury of moneys belonging in it comes within the legitimate business of the county, it is a person expressly Authorized to sue, mentioned in \u00a7 28. That the care over the county treasury, and all the moneys in it, is intended by statute to be part of the business of the county organization, is evident from the different provisions made in regard to it. All taxes, when collected, belong in the county treasury. The treasurer is required by Gen. St. ch. 11, \u00a7 86, to \u201cplace the same, when collected, to the credit of the county.\u201d They are to remain in the treasury until drawn out according to law. The accounts of the treasurer are rendered to the county commissioners and county auditor if the commissioners are in session; if they are not in session, then to the auditor alone. All the treasurer\u2019s books, accounts and vouchers, and all moneys in the treasury, are to be at all times subject to the inspection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>examination of the commissioners, or any committee thereof-Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 132. The settlements are to be made-with the county auditor or county commissioners. Gen-St. ch. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 103, 133, 134; ch. 11, \u00a7 102. They may require the treasurer to give a new bond, and if he fail to-do so, his office is declared vacant. Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 141, 142. ' When an action is commenced against him they may remove him. Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 137. They may order suit to be commenced on his bond, (Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 136,).and in such suit judgment may be rendered against him and his-sureties, not for the amount due the county fund alone, but for the whole amount due from the treasurer. When the money is collected in such suit, it is to be paid into the treasury of the county to which it is due. Gen. St. ch. 8, \u00a7 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">It is provided that the state shall, except where otherwise expressly provided, be the obligee in all official bonds ; but that it was thereby intended to make the state the trustee of an express trust in all such cases, so as to be the only proper party plaintiff in a suit on such bond, is negatived by the provisions that the bond shall be construed as security to all persons severally for the official delinquencies against which it is intended to provide, as -well as to the state, etc., and that any person entitled to the security may bring an action thereon in his own name, etc. Such bonds are required to run to the state only as a matter of convenience, to establish a uniform rule and prevent doubts- or mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">That the state auditor may instruct the county auditor to-cause an action to be commenced on the bond does not. show that the action must be in the name of the state, but rather tends to show the reverse ; for if it was intended by the statute that the action can only be brought by the state and in its name, we would naturally expect that the state auditor should cause, or should direct the attorney general or some other state officer to cause, it to be commenced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and that the control over, and prosecution of, it should be entrusted to some officer of the state. The purpose of this provision was, undoubtedly, to prevent the \u00a1irosecution of such bonds being in the uncontrolled discretion of the board, of county commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\">If it had been intended that the state, as trustee of an-express trust, must sue for all the funds, provision would have been made for payment of the moneys collected on the judgment into the state treasury, and for distribution of it, by the <em>trustee, </em>among the <em>cestuis que trust; </em>and had it been intended that each corporation, or <em>quasi </em>corporation, interested in the funds must sue for the portion to which it is entitled, provision would surely have been made for the commencement of the action by some officer of such corporation, or <em>quasi </em>corporation, and for the payment to it of the money when collected by means of the action. Instead of this the legislature has provided for an action to be commenced by county officers to recover moneys belonging in the county treasury, and for the restoration to that treasury of such moneys when collected. The only connection which any but county officers can, under the statute, have with such action is that the state auditor may instruct the county auditor to cause it to be commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The great multiplicity of suits that would have been made necessaiy by it, and the difficulty, in many instances, of proving what portion of any sum abstracted from the treasury each plaintiff would be entitled to, make it highly improbable that the legislature intended it as a general rule that the state, county, cities, towns and school districts must necessarily sue, each for its own portion of the funds, for such delinquency by county treasurers. We have no doubt that it was intended that the county may sue in such cases, and recover the whole amount of the delinquency, unless, perhaps, where the state, or some of the corporations, or <em>quasi </em>corporations, has recovered for its. portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The only case to which we have been referred which realty covers the point is <em>Supervisors of Albany Co. </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>9 Paige, 182. That was a suit, in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill, to enforce the payment of taxes. It was held that although the taxes, when collected, were to be paid in to the county treasurer, the supervisors were the proper parties to enforce the payment. Certainty, if the supervisors or county commissioners may bring suit to collect the taxes, and bring them into the treasury, they can sue and compel a return of the money upon an unlawful abstraction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Within the proper time after the service of the complaint the defendant demanded a bill of particulars, which demand was not complied with; and at the commencement of the trial the defendant moved to dismiss the action on that ground, and also objected to the admission of any evidence on the same ground. The motion was denied, and the objection overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The action is not one in which the defendant is entitled, of right, to a bill of particulars. It is an action for conversion of moneys, and not on an account alleged, and if the complaint does not set forth sufficient particulars of the moneys alleged to have been converted to enable defendant adequately to defend himself, his remedy is by motion to make it more definite and certain. <em>Blackie </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>6 Bosw. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">On the trial .the defendant moved to dismiss, and also objected to any evidence being given, because, as claimed by the defendant, the action is substantially one to impeach the accounts or settlements of the treasurer, and the complaint does not state the particulars in which it is claimed that the accounts or settlements are incorrect. The action, as we have stated, is for conversion of moneys, and the complaint does not allege any accounting or settlement, such as the law requires of the treasurer. If there was any, it was matter of fact to be pleaded; and, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>did not appear from the complaint, it was for the defendant, -if he relied upon it, to set it up in the answer, which he has done. Such a defence requires no reply, and, upon proof of the defence being offered at the trial, the plaintiff might controvert it, or avoid it, by proof impeaching the account or settlement for fraud or mistake. It could not avail as a defence at law if founded in fraud or mistake. An account stated or settled * is a mere admission that the account is correct. It is not an estoppel. The account is still open to impeachment for mistakes or errors. <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>18 N. Y. <em>285, 292.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">If the defendant, occupying, as he did, a fiduciary relation to the county, converted the moneys, it was a fraud within the rule in <em>(Cock </em>v. <em>Van Etten, 12 </em>Minn. <em>522, </em>and the time limited for the commencement of the action began to run upon the discovery by plaintiff of the fraud, or notice to it of such facts and circumstances as, if investigated, would lead to such discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">To charge the defendant with moneys received, the plaintiffs offered a great number of what were called \u201cgrand duplicates,\u201d but which appear to have been the assessment or tax books of towns, opposite many of the items of tax in which was written, in the margin, the word \u201c paid \u2019 \u2019 and the name of defendant. These marginal entries were objected to because there was no evidence that the name of defendant, written in connection, with the word \u201c paid \u201d opposite the various items, was his signature. The entries were received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">There is no law requiring such entries to be made, and, therefore, they do not stand as official records. There was no proof that the entries were in the books when in custody of defendant, and so there could be no presumption of their genuineness from the fact that they came from his possession. Such memoranda are not \u201c written instruments\u201d within the meaning of Laws 1867, ch. 64. The written instruments meant by that statute are formal instruments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>or agreements, and do not include mere entries made only for the use or convenience of the party making them. It was error to admit these entries without proof of their authenticity. We have carefully examined the case to ascertain if there is any evidence curing this error, and find none, and for this reason a new trial must be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Judge Page was judge of the district (the tenth) in which the action was pending, and resided at Austin, the' county seat of the county iu which the action was pending. The motion for a new trial was noticed for hearing at Mankato, before Judge Waite, of the sixth (an adjoining) district. The respondent makes the objection that the latter has no jurisdiction to hear the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Section 4, ch. 67, Laws 1867, provides that \u00a3\u00a3 motions must be made in the district in which the action is pending, or in an adjoining district, provided that no motion shall be made in an adjoining district, which shall require the hearing of such a motion, at a greater distance from the county seat where the action is pending in which the motion is made than the residence of the judge of the district wherein such action is pending from such county seat.\u201d The act of 1867 does not in terms repeal Gen. St. ch. 64, \u00a7 5. That section provides that \u201c whenever a district judge is a party, or otherwise interested, in any cause, another district judge, in an adjoining district, shall, within his district, transact, any <em>ex parte </em>business, hear and determine motions,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Except under this provision the parties, in a cause where, the judge of the district in ivhich it is pending is disqualified to act, can make no applications *in vacation. We cannot hold, by implication, that the act of 1867 was intended to take away their right to make such applications, and think the right given in ch. 64, \u00a7 5, is preserved. Judge Page was disqualified by reason of having been attorney in the' cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Many other questions of little importance are made by the defendant; but as a new trial must be had for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>reason stated, upon which trial those questions are not very likely to arise, we pass them over.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
