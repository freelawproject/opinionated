Code, \u00a7\u00a7 65590 &amp; 65590.1) imposes a mandatory duty on local governments to require developers to replace residential units, or pay an in-lieu fee, whenever they demolish or convert dwelling units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons in the coastal zone. Appellants, the Venice Town Council, Inc., the Barton-Hill Neighborhood Association and Carol Berman, a low-income tenant who resides in Venice, contend the Mello act imposes such a duty. Respondent, the City of Los Angeles (City), argues the Mello act imposes no mandatory duties on local governments. It claims the Mello act only requires replacement dwelling units when the City in its discretion determines replacement of low- or moderate-income housing is \u201cfeasible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">We conclude the City\u2019s interpretation of its responsibilities under the Mello act is erroneous. The plain language of the statute imposes a mandatory duty on the City in certain circumstances to require replacement housing for low- or moderate-income persons or families where units occupied by qualifying persons are converted or destroyed. We further conclude the City has no discretion to allow a developer to escape the requirement of providing affordable replacement units whenever the City permits a non-coastal dependent commercial structure to replace existing affordable residential units. Because the trial court based its ruling on the City\u2019s erroneous interpretation of its duties under the Mello act, we reverse the judgment of dismissal with directions to overrule the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">In 1981 the Legislature enacted Government Code section 65590.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision is known as the Mello act and its purpose is to preserve residential housing units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>the coastal zone. The Mello act applies to condominium conversions, demolitions, new construction, conversions from residential to nonresidential uses and new residential developments in the coastal zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Section 65590, subdivision (a) specifies all local governments having coastal zones must comply with the Mello act. This subdivision provides \u201c[e]ach respective local government shall comply with the requirements of this section in that portion of its jurisdiction which is located within the coastal zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Subdivision (b) of section 65590 is the provision which imposes a mandatory duty on local governments to require replacement housing as a condition of granting a permit to demolish or convert housing units which are occupied by low or moderate income persons or families. Subdivision (b) provides \u201c[t]he conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied by persons and families of low or moderate income, . . . , <em>shall not be authorized unless provision has been made for the replacement of those dwelling units </em>with units for persons and families of low or moderate income.\u201d (Italics added.) The replacement units may be erected either on the same site, elsewhere within the coastal zone or within three miles of the coastal zone, whichever location proves most feasible. (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">There are certain narrow circumstances where the mandatory requirement for replacement of converted or demolished affordable housing units is subject to a finding replacement of the affordable housing is \u201cfeasible.\" The types of conversions or demolitions which may be reviewed for feasibility of replacement with affordable housing are (1) single-family dwellings, duplexes, or 10 or fewer units of multiple residential structures (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b)(1)); (2) residential units replaced by coastal dependent or coastal related uses (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b)(2));<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) converted or demolished residential units in a jurisdiction with less than 50 acres of available privately owned vacant land in the coastal zone (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b)(3)); (4) payment of a fee in lieu of affordable replacement housing, provided the local government has a program to ensure the fees will be used to build replacement units in, or within three miles of, the coastal zone (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b)(4)); and (5) residential units which have been declared a public nuisance (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Even if one of these special circumstances applies, however, and the local government finds the further fact that it is feasible for the developer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>replace some or all of the converted or demolished affordable housing units, \u201creplacement dwelling units <em>shall </em>be required.\u201d (\u00a7 65590, subd. (b), italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>Subdivision (c) of section 65590 also imposes a mandatory duty on local governments to require replacement housing when they determine <em>any </em>residential structure is no longer feasible in a certain location and permit a noncoastal dependent use to be built in its place. This subdivision provides: \u201cThe conversion or demolition of <em>any residential structure </em>for purposes of a nonresidential use which is not \u2018coastal dependent\u2019 . . . shall not be authorized unless the local government has first determined that a residential use is no longer feasible in that location. If a local government makes this determination and authorizes the conversion or demolition of the residential structure, <em>it shall require </em>replacement of any dwelling units occupied by persons and families of low or moderate income pursuant to the applicable provisions of subdivision (b).\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Section 65590, subdivision (d) pertains to new housing developments. With new housing developments residential units for low or moderate income persons are required if the local government determines such units are feasible within the new development, within the coastal zone or within three miles of the coastal zone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Section 65590, subdivision (g)(3) defines the term \u201cfeasible\u201d as \u201ccapable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technical factors.\u201d Any \u201cfeasibility\u201d determination may be reviewed by administrative mandate. (\u00a7 65590, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The Legislature in section 65590, subdivision (h)(3) specified the Mello Act was not intended, nor should be construed, as requiring any local government to adopt individual ordinances or programs to implement the various provisions of the Mello act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In 1982 the Los Angeles City Council adopted a formal policy to implement the Mello act. It directed the City\u2019s planning department to require, on a one-for-one basis, the replacement of any rental units occupied by low or moderate income persons converted or demolished in the coastal zone. In addition, the city council directed that as an interim measure, the planning department was to use interpretative guidelines the coastal commission established for new construction as its guideline when determining the feasibility of requiring low or moderate income housing as a condition of granting permits for new housing construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">In February 1993, the City approved an application by owners of an apartment building at 615 Ocean Front Walk in Venice to convert three ground floor residential units of the apartment building to commercial uses. The City granted the application based on its finding residential use of the ground floor units abutting the Venice board walk was no longer feasible at that location. The City also found the new retail stores were \u201ccoastal dependent.\u201d (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>Several persons challenged the City\u2019s approval permitting demolition of the existing residential units without making an in-lieu fee or replacement of those units a condition of approval. The City\u2019s approval of this permit apparently triggered the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Appellants filed an action against the City and the owners of 615 Ocean Front Walk for traditional writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085), administrative mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5), injunctive and declaratory relief. The City twice demurred to the complaint, arguing the remedies appellants sought were unavailable. The trial court sustained the City\u2019s demurrer to appellants\u2019 first amended complaint with leave to amend. In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>order the trial court found appellants had \u201cnot alleged failure to perform [a] mandatory duty.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The City demurred to appellants\u2019 second amended complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief and traditional mandate, claiming the Mello Act imposed no mandatory duties on the City. The City argued each of its determinations under the Mello act required a finding of \u201cfeasibility.\u201d It claimed the decision whether a certain project is \u201cfeasible\u201d is necessarily discretionary because the determination rests on a case by case factual analysis. Therefore, the City argued appellants\u2019 complaint stated no claim for relief because its actions under the Mello act are only reviewable in an action for administrative mandate. However, the City claimed the statute of limitations for administrative review barred all but five of appellants\u2019 claims, and with regard to those five, appellants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit. Finally, the City argued appellants lacked standing to enforce the Mello act.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The trial court sustained the City\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend on the \u201cgrounds stated in the moving papers.\u201d Appellants appeal from the subsequent judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">I. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">For purposes of this appeal we accept as true the properly pled factual allegations of the complaint. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) Furthermore, the allegations of the complaint must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and liberally construed with a view to attaining substantial justice among the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 452; <em>King </em>v. <em>Central Bank </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 840, 843 [135 Cal.Rptr. 771, 558 P.2d 857].) With these considerations in mind, we review the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a right to relief under any legal theory. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Houston Funeral Home </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131-1132 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 169]; 5 Witkin Cal.

Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) \u2018upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested,\u2019 in cases \u2018where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.) The writ will issue against a county, city or other public body or against a public officer. <em>(Housing Authority </em>v. <em>City of L. A. </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 853, 869-871 [243 P.2d 515], cert. den.

However, the writ will not lie to control discretion conferred upon a public officer or agency. <em>(Lindell Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Permit Appeals </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 303, 315 [144 P.2d 4]; <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 317, 326 [253 P.2d 659].) Two basic requirements are essential to the issuance of the writ; (1) A clear, present and usually ministerial duty upon the part of the respondent <em>(Faulkner </em>v. <em>Cal. Toll Bridge Authority, </em>supra; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Quinn </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 661, 664 [192 P.2d 17]; <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Dow </em>(1923) 60 Cal.App. 680, 682 [213 P. 707]); and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Bowron </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 344, 351 [254 P.2d 6]). . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 480, 490-491 [96 Cal.Rptr. 553, 487 P.2d 1193], fn. omitted; see also 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 65, pp. 702-704; Cal. Civil Writs Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 1987) \u00a7\u00a7 5.1-5.3, pp. 147-153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In this case appellants\u2019 complaint alleges the City has a clear duty imposed by law by section 65590. As noted, section 65590, subdivision (b) mandates the City require replacement of low- or moderate-income housing as a condition of approval of their conversion or demolition. This provision creates a mandatory duty to require replacement housing, or an in-lieu fee, unless the City makes express factual determinations the project falls within specific statutory categories, which in turn still mandate replacement unless the City makes an express factual determination replacement housing is not feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The complaint alleges the City has both failed to make the necessary factual determinations, and to require replacement housing in cases which do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>not implicate any of the special factual circumstances. Paragraph 18 of the complaint alleges \u201cGovernment Code \u00a7 65590 (b) prohibits defendant City from authorizing the conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied by persons and families of low or moderate income, unless provision has been made for the replacement of those dwelling units with units for persons and families of low or moderate income. Said duty is mandatory and not subject to the exercise of discretion. Defendant City\u2019s planning department has failed to enforce Section 65590 (b), and has enacted a de facto policy which violates the statute by requiring replacement of affordable housing, only if the cost of replacing the housing is feasible\u2014a condition not required by the statute.\u201d Paragraphs 19 through 23 of the complaint list numerous specific examples of locations in the coastal zone for which the City has allegedly issued permits for the conversion or demolition of affordable housing without complying with section 65590, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, appellants alleged the City had authorized the demolition of at least 271 affordable housing units and only required 5 to be replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Paragraph 13 of the complaint alleges whenever a developer seeks a permit to demolish or convert existing residential units in the coastal zone the City has a mandatory, ministerial duty to make certain factual findings, specifically, (1) whether the units are, or have been within the past year, occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families; (2) whether a proposed nonresidential use is coastal dependent or related; and, (3) whether the residential use is still feasible at that location. Paragraph 24 of the complaint details numerous circumstances in which appellants allege the City issued permits to demolish existing housing units without making the threshold determination whether the residences were occupied by low- or moderate-income persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">As noted, section 65590, subdivision (c) mandates the City to require replacement housing any time existing residential units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons are replaced by noncoastal dependent commercial uses. Contrary to the City\u2019s argument, this subdivision permits the City no discretion to determine whether replacement units are feasible in this circumstance. If a noncoastal dependent commercial use replaces residential units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families, replacement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>of those affordable housing units are required, either within the coastal zone or within three miles of the coastal zone. Thus, contrary to the City\u2019s apparent policies, argument in the trial court and in this court, when dwelling units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families are replaced by noncoastal dependent commercial uses, replacement of these units or payment of an in-lieu fee is mandatory and is not dependent on a finding replacement is feasible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Paragraphs 25 through 26 of the complaint allege the City has issued demolition permits in violation of section 65590, subdivision (c) by failing to make the necessary findings whether the proposed commercial use is coastal dependent, or whether the existing residential structure is still a feasible use in that location. The complaint gives nine examples of locations in the Venice coastal zone where the City issued permits allegedly in violation of section 65590, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Section 65590, subdivision (d) pertains to new housing developments in the coastal zone. As noted, this section specifies new developments \u201cshall\u201d include units for low- or moderate-income persons and families where feasible. Appellant\u2019s complaint alleges the City fails to determine whether requiring affordable housing for a particular project is feasible. The complaint lists several new construction projects in the coastal zone for which the City allegedly failed to make the necessary findings prior to issuing permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In addition, the complaint alleges the City has a policy of automatically exempting any developer who challenges the condition when the City does require affordable housing to be included in a new housing development. Paragraph 16 of the complaint alleges \u201c[t]he de facto policy of the defendant City is to grant all requests for exemption from the low/moderate-income requirements imposed by the Mello Act on new construction in the Coastal Zone. Attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018B\u2019 and incorporated by reference . . . is a memorandum from the Chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals to the Mayor of defendant City, dated August 1, 1990, entitled \u201c\u201cMello Bill\u2019\u201d Low/ Moderate Income Housing Policy\u2019 which admits and delineates the defendant City's policy of non-enforcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>The memorandum from the chair of the board of zoning appeals complains the requirements of the Mello act are too vague, subjective, speculative and subject to abuse. The letter informs the mayor that until specific guidelines or procedures are adopted to implement the Mello act requirements the zoning appeals board \u201cunanimously adopted a policy to approve, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, all applicant appeals which request exemption from the Mello Bill low/moderate-income housing requirements relative to parcel maps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In sum, a liberal construction of the complaint adequately alleges the Mello act imposes on the City the mandatory, ministerial duties to, at a minimum, (1) make the threshold factual determination whether proposed residential units slated for demolition or conversion in the coastal zone are, or in the past year have been, occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families; (2) and, if so, to require an in lieu fee, or replacement of affordable housing units at that location, within the coastal zone or within three miles of the coastal zone; or (3) to make the requisite factual findings a proposed commercial use is coastal related or dependent; or (4) if not coastal dependent, to require replacement housing for low- or moderate-income persons and families in, or within three miles of, the coastal zone; and, (5) to make the additional factual determinations whether a residential unit slated for demolition is still feasible at the location, whether affordable housing units are feasible for a given new housing development, and the other express determinations required by statute prior to the issuance of conversion, demolition or construction permits within the coastal zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Accordingly, the trial court erred in sustaining the City\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend on the ground the complaint failed to allege the Mello act imposed mandatory duties on the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The City attempts to avoid this conclusion. It points to certain provisions in the prayer of the complaint and argues the Mello act does not impose a duty to adopt procedures or guidelines to implement the Mello act, nor does the act require the City to require deed restrictions in perpetuity or to establish a monitoring program to ensure occupancy by only low- or moderate-income persons in replacement housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">We agree the Legislature in section 65590, subdivision (h)(3) clarified this section was not to be construed as requiring a local government to adopt any ordinances or programs to implement the provisions of the Mello act. We agree certain aspects of the prayer of the complaint conflict with this provision, or improperly impinge on the City\u2019s exercise of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>selecting specific procedures or guidelines to enforce the Mello act.  However, a demurrer tests the sufficiency of the factual allegations of the complaint rather than the relief suggested in the prayer of the complaint. <em>(Siciliano </em>v. <em>Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 745, 751 [133 Cal.Rptr. 376]; <em>Grieves </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166, fn. 9 [203 Cal.Rptr. 556] [the prayer of a complaint is not subject to demurrer]; see also <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 893 [157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d 854] [the issues are framed by the allegations of the complaint]; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Pleading, \u00a7 907, pp. 345-346, and cases cited.) On remand, the prayer of the complaint may be amended to conform with the statutory requirements and the statements expressed in this opinion if deemed desirable by the parties or trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Next, the City contends the City\u2019s enforcement of the Mello act does not violate the act. It argues the factual allegations of the complaint are not borne out by the official records of the City. This argument misses the mark. This appeal is not from an order granting summary judgment, or from a judgment after trial. As noted, on appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the factual allegations of the complaint are deemed true by the City\u2019s demurrer. (See, e.g., <em>Californians for Native Salmon etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 1419, 1428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Finally, the City contends appellants\u2019 proper remedy is to seek review of the City\u2019s enforcement policies under the Mello act through administrative mandate. It argues each project must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and for this reason each decision should be reviewed on its own merits through administrative proceedings. In addition, the City argues the factual determinations such as \u201cfeasibility,\u201d \u201ccoastal related,\u201d or \u201ccoastal dependent\u201d are fact based and are therefore necessarily discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We agree each application for a permit requires certain factual determinations. We also agree the question of \u201cfeasibility\u201d requires the exercise of discretion. However, we disagree with the City that each aspect of the fact finding process is synonymous with a discretionary determination. A truly discretionary decision requires the exercise of judgment in resolving a particular issue by balancing various factors and selecting among various approaches to the same problem. On the other hand, many factual determinations are based strictly on objective data. For example the factual determination whether residential units are occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families is based on fixed mathematical criteria. There is no discretion to be exercised in making this mathematical comparison. (See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>e.g., <em>Glendale City Employees' Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 344 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609] [the ministerial act of computing and paying salaries admits of no discretion].) As noted, the complaint alleges the City has in numerous instances failed to make these preliminary and ministerial factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We conclude appellants\u2019 complaint alleges several mandatory, ministerial duties under the Mello Act which may be enforced by writ of mandate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">B. <em>Appellants Have Standing to Seek the Relief Sought in the Complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">The City urges several reasons why appellants lack standing to seek a writ of mandate. It argues appellants have no taxpayer standing under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a because they do not seek to prevent an illegal expenditure or waste of public funds. The City also claims appellants lack any beneficial interest in the subject matter of the suit to warrant the granting of a writ. The City points out appellants do not allege they or their members are low- or moderate-income tenants who were either displaced due to the City\u2019s failure to comply with its responsibilities under the Mello act, or had a right to live-in units which would have been created but for the City\u2019s failure to perform its duties under the Mello act. Finally, the City contends appellants do not fall within the public duty exception to acquire standing to seek a writ of mandate because it claims appellants can allege no mandatory duty which it failed to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">We have determined the complaint adequately alleged several mandatory duties under the Mello act which the City allegedly failed to perform. Accordingly, we reject the City\u2019s latter contention as without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">We also find it unnecessary to reach the question whether appellants have standing to seek an injunction or declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a as taxpayers because there is an independent basis for permitting them to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The ultimate relief sought in this action includes a traditional writ of mandate compelling the City to require replacement housing somewhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>within or without the coastal zone whenever units occupied by low- or moderate-income persons or families are converted or demolished. Ordinarily a writ of mandate will be issued only to persons who are \u201cbeneficially interested.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.) However, our Supreme Court has recognized an exception to this general rule. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[W]here the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of a public duty, the relator need not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result, since it is sufficient that he is interested as a citizen in having the laws executed and the duty in question enforced.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The exception promotes the policy of guaranteeing citizens the opportunity to ensure that no governmental body impairs or defeats the purpose of legislation establishing a public right. ...\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 144 [172 Cal.Rptr. 206, 624 P.2d 256]; see also <em>Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 432, 439; <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>Hastings College of the Law </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 877, 892-893 [230 Cal.Rptr. 176]; 8 Witkin, Cal.

(See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 65009, subd. (a), 65580, subd. (c), 65589.5, subd. (a)(1) and 65913, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The issue in this case involves an important public right to preserve affordable housing in the coastal zone. Appellants, who are interested as citizens in having the laws and the duty in question enforced, have standing to seek its vindication. As such, appellants also have standing to seek a preliminary injunction to enforce the requirements of the Mello act if necessary.  \u201cThe purpose of a standing requirement is to ensure that the courts will decide only actual controversies between parties with a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the dispute to press their case with vigor. [Citations.] This purpose is met when, as here, plaintiffs possess standing to have the underlying controversy adjudicated and the desired relief granted after a trial on the merits; no greater interest is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>required to seek the same relief on an interim basis. . . . Accordingly, it is unnecessary for plaintiffs to show a separate basis for standing to obtain a preliminary injunction, distinct from the basis for their standing to seek a writ of mandate at a trial on the merits.\u201d <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 432, 439-440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">In sum, appellants have standing to seek extraordinary relief in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">C. <em>The Complaint States a Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The City claims appellants\u2019 complaint fails to state a cause of action for declaratory relief because the allegations of the complaint fail to demonstrate a present and actual controversy concerning the rights and duties of the respective parties. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1060.) The City claims the allegations of the complaint are too general and fail to establish any specific rights which the Mello act confers on appellants. Therefore, the City again argues if appellants want to challenge any specific determination their proper remedy is through administrative mandate and not through declaratory or injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">\u201cThe material factual allegations of appellants\u2019 complaint are admitted by respondents\u2019 demurrer. ... If these facts show the existence of an actual controversy between appellants and respondents, appellants have \u2018stated a legally sufficient complaint\u2019 for declaratory relief and it was an abuse of discretion to dismiss the action. . . . \u2018Where, therefore, a case is properly before the trial court, under a complaint which is legally sufficient and sets forth facts and circumstances showing that a declaratory adjudication is entirely appropriate, the trial court may not properly refuse to assume jurisdiction; ... if it does enter a dismissal, it will be directed by an appellate tribunal to entertain the action. Declaratory relief must be granted when the facts justifying that course are sufficiently alleged.\u2019 \u2018Any doubt should be resolved in favor of granting declaratory relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Californians for Native Salmon etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1426-1427, citations omitted; 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Actions, \u00a7 48, p. 79.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The allegations of the complaint establish at a minimum two actual and ongoing controversies between the parties. Appellants\u2019 complaint alleges the City has misinterpreted portions of section 65590 by subjecting every decision to a feasibility standard. Appellants\u2019 complaint also alleges that, despite the city council\u2019s formal policy, the City has an informal policy of nonenforcement in violation of the Mello act. Although potentially cumulative to their right to traditional mandate, these allegations are sufficient to entitle appellants to declaratory relief. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1062; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number><em>Californians for Native Salmon etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Generally, a specific decision or order of an administrative agency can only be reviewed by a petition for administrative mandamus. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; <em>Californians for Native Salmon etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1428-1429; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 245 et seq., p. 869 et seq.; Cal. Civil Writs Practice, <em>supra, </em>Writ Review of Nonjudicial Decisions, \u00a7 5.5 et seq., p. 154 et seq.) However, appellants\u2019 action has a more fundamental purpose. They do not challenge any particular decision or order. Although the complaint cites alleged violations in numerous individual permit applications, it pleads them as \u201csymptomatic of the much broader problem the action is designed to relieve.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Knoff </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 184, 199 [81 Cal.Rptr. 683].) Instead, appellants seek to resolve the City\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding of its responsibilities under the Mello Act to avoid continued violations or nonenforcement in the future. Declaratory relief has been held to be the proper remedy when it is alleged an agency has a policy of ignoring or violating applicable laws. (See, e.g., <em>Californians for Native Salmon etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry, supra, 221 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 1428-1429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of a declaratory judgment is \u201cto serve some practical end in quieting or stabilizing an uncertain or disputed jural relation\u201d . . .\u2019 Another purpose is to liquidate doubts with respect to uncertainties or controversies which might otherwise result in subsequent litigation . . . .\u201d <em>(Bess </em>v. <em>Park </em>(1955) 132 Cal.App.2d 49, 52 [281 P.2d 556], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Appellants\u2019 complaint properly alleges a present and actual controversy whether the City\u2019s interpretation of section 65590 and the duties that statute imposes on local governments is erroneous, and whether it has an informal policy of nonenforcement of the Mello act. The City\u2019s interpretation of its responsibilities under the Mello act is a recurring problem and one involving the interpretation of a statute. The proper interpretation of a statute is a particularly appropriate subject for judicial resolution. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 635, 641, fn. 5 [63 Cal.Rptr. 391, 433 P.2d 183] [construction of a statute is a judicial rather than an administrative function]; <em>Bess </em>v. <em>Park, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.2d at p. 53; see authorities cited in 2 Am.Jur.2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7\u00a7 523, 524, pp. 510-512 and 22A Am.Jur.2d, Declaratory Judgments, \u00a7 68, pp. 726-727.)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">In addition, judicial economy strongly favors the use of declaratory relief to avoid a multiplicity of actions to challenge the City\u2019s statutory interpretation or alleged policies. <em>(Bess </em>v. <em>Park, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.2d at p. 52-53; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number><em>Union of American Physicians &amp; Dentists </em>v. <em>Kizer </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 490, 503 [272 Cal.Rptr. 886].) As against the piecemeal review of similar issues by individual challenges to specific permit applications, the present action appears singularly economical. (See also <em>Californians for Native Salmon etc. Assn </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 1419, 1428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Accordingly, we conclude appellants\u2019 complaint states a cause of action for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">D. <em>Appellants Were Not Required to Exhaust Administrative Remedies Prior to Filing Suit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The City continues to assert appellants\u2019 only remedy for review of the City\u2019s land-use decisions under the Mello act was through administrative review. It claims the statute of limitations bars review of all but five of the permits listed in appellants\u2019 complaint, and as to those five, appellants are not entitled to relief because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">\u201c \u2018[W]here an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.\u2019 . . . When no exception applies, the exhaustion of an administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts. . . . \u2018[T]he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has not hardened into inflexible dogma. It contains its own exceptions, as when the subject matter of the controversy lies outside the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction, when pursuit of an administrative remedy would result in irreparable harm, when the administrative agency cannot grant an adequate remedy, and when the aggrieved party can positively state what the administrative agency\u2019s decision in his particular case would be.\u2019 \u201d <em>(County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 62, 73 [222 Cal.Rptr. 750], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">The complaint in the case at bar constitutes an exception to the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to judicial review of the City\u2019s actions. Appellants do not challenge any of the City\u2019s past land use decisions which implicate the Mello act. Instead, appellants\u2019 complaint seeks review of the City\u2019s overarching policies in implementing the requirements of the Mello act and seeks to correct the City\u2019s interpretation of its responsibilities under that statute. Consequently, they were not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit. <em>(Knoff v. City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 184, 199; see also authorities cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>in 22A Am.Jur.2d, Declaratory Judgments, \u00a7 84, pp. 739-741 and in 2 Am.Jur.2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7\u00a7 523-524, pp. 510-513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In addition, because appellants do not challenge any specific decision under the Mello act, the three-year statute of limitations of Code of Civil Procedure section 338 to enforce a liability created by statute applies, and the 90-day statute of limitations for review of administrative decisions (\u00a7 65907) is inapplicable. (See 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7\u00a7 271, 272, pp. 900-901; Cal. Civil Writ Practice, <em>supra, </em>Writ Review of Nonjudicial Decisions, \u00a7 5.23, pp. 167-168.) Again, because appellants do not seek review of any particular permit approval, they were not required to join \u201cindispensable parties\u201d as the City alleges. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 389, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Moreover, because the City at all times maintained whether it would require replacement housing depended on whether replacement of low- or moderate-income housing was \u201cfeasible,\u201d any challenge by appellants at the administrative level would have been futile. (See, e.g., <em>Union of American Physicians &amp; Dentists </em>v. <em>Kizer, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.3d 490, 503; see also <em>Glendale City Employees' Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 328, 342-343 [administrative remedies designed to review individual problems arising under an agreement are manifestly inadequate to handle a dispute of the effect of underlying agreement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Thus none of these additional grounds asserted by the City can justify dismissal of the complaint in this case, which does not seek review of any particular decision, but instead seeks review of the City\u2019s overall policies in implementing the Mello act.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">The judgment is reversed and remanded with directions to overrule the demurrer to the complaint and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Appellants to recover their costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Lillie, P. J., and Woods, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 22, 1996, and the opinion was modified to read as printed as printed above.
