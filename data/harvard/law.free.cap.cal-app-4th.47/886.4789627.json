(Crib), among others, as a defendant. Crib cross-complained against appellant NBS/Lowry, Inc. (NBS) seeking equitable indemnity and contribution. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint naming NBS as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Discovery proceedings demonstrated that the claims of plaintiffs and Crib against NBS were meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, NBS made a Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 998 offer to plaintiffs and Crib to compromise their claims. The offer proposed that NBS would waive its right to costs in exchange for a dismissal of all actions and cross-actions against it. Plaintiffs accepted the offer to compromise but Crib did not. NBS then sought and obtained under section 877.6 an order approving the NBS settlement with the plaintiffs as a \u201cgood faith settlement.\u201d NBS also obtained an order dismissing Crib\u2019s cross-complaint against NBS.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">NBS filed its cost bill against Crib for $9,233.89. Crib moved to tax costs, arguing (1) the cost bill was premature because no judgment had been entered dismissing Crib\u2019s cross-complaint, and (2) a court has discretion to refuse to grant \u201cprevailing party\u201d status to a party receiving a dismissal as part of a negotiated settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The trial court concluded, based on \u201cbalancing the equities,\u201d that NBS was barred from collecting its costs, and it granted the motion to tax costs in its entirety. The order of the trial court stated: \u201cMotion granted; to engraft the provisions of [Code of Civil Procedure section] 1032 (a)(4) into the scenario of a good faith settlement would be to inject a discordant note into a procedure clearly designed to promote resolution by compromise versus contested litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The issue on appeal is whether NBS is entitled to collect its costs from Crib following the dismissal of the cross-complaint filed by Crib against NBS.  The right to recover costs is wholly dependent on statute. <em>(La Mesa-Spring Valley School Dist. </em>v. <em>Otsuka </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 309, 312 [19 Cal.Rptr. 479, 369 P.2d 7].)  Section 1032, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>proceeding.\u201d Section 1032, subdivision (a)(4) defines a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to include a party \u201cin whose favor a dismissal is entered.\u201d Here NBS is a party \u201cin whose favor a dismissal is entered\u201d: Crib\u2019s cross-complaint against NBS was dismissed following the order approving the plaintiffs\u2019 settlement with NBS as a \u201cgood faith settlement.\u201d (Cf. <em>Adler </em>v. <em>Vaicius </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1770, 1776-1777 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 32] [voluntary dismissal of defendant entitled defendant to \u201cprevailing party\u201d status].) Accordingly, NBS is entitled to costs as a matter of right under section 1032 unless another statute otherwise provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We have not been cited, nor has our independent research uncovered, any statute or other authority that grants a trial court discretion to deny costs otherwise recoverable under section 1032<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d because the dismissal was the result of a section 877.6 order approving a good faith settlement. Analogous case law supports the award of costs. In <em>Rappenecker </em>v. <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256 [155 Cal.Rptr. 516], the plaintiff filed a section 998 <em>offer, </em>which the defendant accepted, and which provided that the plaintiff obtain a monetary judgment against the defendant. At that time, costs under section 1032 were permitted to a plaintiff \u201cupon a judgment in his favor ... in an action for the recovery of . . . damages; . . .\u201d The defendant objected to plaintiff\u2019s subsequently filed cost bill, arguing the judgment was merely a settlement agreement which did not include an agreement to pay costs. The court rejected the argument, reasoning that on entry of a judgment, whether obtained by litigation or consent, the cost provisions of section 1032 applied: \u201cThus, one should not read into the statute allowing costs a restriction which has not been placed there. \u2018In general, a court should not look beyond the plain meaning of a statute when its language is clear and unambiguous, and there is no uncertainty or doubt as to the legislative intent. [Citation.]\u2019 [Quoting <em>Teachers Management &amp; Inv. Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 438, 446 (134 Cal.Rptr. 523).] Defendant has failed to provide any persuasive showing of legislative intent to exclude costs in compromise settlements.\u201d <em>(Rappenecker </em>v. <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Thus, <em>Rappenecker </em>cautions against engrafting exceptions onto the clear language of section 1032, even if the judgment results from a settlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Although <em>Rappenecker </em>is not directly applicable because the language of section 1032 was substantially amended as part of the 1986 revisions to the cost statutes (see Stats. 1986, ch. 377, \u00a7 6, pp. 1578-1579), the revised language is more compelling, in that it indicates the prevailing party is \u201centitled as a matter of right\u201d to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">NBS\u2019s entitlement to costs pursuant to section 1032 is also supported by negative implication from section 1038, a sister statute enacted as part of the same 1986 legislative revisions that included section 1032. <em>(In re Marriage of Pinto </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 86, 89 [104 Cal.Rptr. 371] [statutory interpretation may include examination of other in pari materia statutes enacted at the same time].) Section 1038 provides that when a party named as a cross-defendant in a cross-complaint seeking express or implied indemnity obtains dismissal of the cross-complaint by certain summary methods (e.g., summary judgment motion, nonsuit, directed verdict or motion under \u00a7 631.8), the cross-defendant may be entitled to recover a broad category of otherwise nonrecoverable costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, section 1038, subdivision (a) conditions recovery of those costs on the court\u2019s finding that the cross-complaint was not brought in good faith and with reasonable cause. By negative implication, when a dismissed cross-defendant in an indemnity action does <em>not </em>seek those broader costs and instead limits the request to ordinary costs, the cross-defendant need <em>not </em>obtain prior court approval or findings and is entitled to ordinary costs as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The order granting the motion to tax costs is reversed with directions to enter a new order denying the motion to tax costs.

Because of this bar, NBS properly obtained an order dismissing Crib\u2019s cross-complaint against NBS. <em>(Greshko </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 822, 830 [239 Cal.Rptr. 846].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Our analysis is limited to those items of costs, recoverable pursuant to section 1032 \u201cas a matter of right,\u201d which are listed in section 1033.5, subdivision (a).
