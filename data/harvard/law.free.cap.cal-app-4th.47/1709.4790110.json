He contends that the court erred in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1712\">*1712</page-number>award him presentence custody credit for the time he spent on bail subject to certain restrictions. We disagree. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">After appellant\u2019s arrest on December 1, 1993, the San Mateo District Attorney charged him by complaint with 12 counts of committing a lewd or lascivious act with a child (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and alleged that he was ineligible for probation because he occupied a position of special trust with the victims (former \u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(9)). The municipal court set bail at $200,000. On December 8, the district attorney filed an amended complaint alleging 38 counts under section 288 and appellant\u2019s probation ineligibility under former section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(9), as to 37 of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">At a December 8, 1993, bail status hearing, the prosecution asked that the court increase bail to at least $400,000 in light of the additional charges. The court rejected this request and permitted appellant to post bail by way of property bond. In so doing, the court imposed additional conditions on appellant\u2019s release, including the following: \u201cI want to have the O.R. [Own Recognizance] Project involved in this. I want regular contact made with [appellant] and when bail is posted, [appellant] is either going to reside at his present address or at the home of his mother, and he may not reside in any other place.\u201d The court later continued: \u201cYou may not be in any place other than your place of residence, the place of employment, or a place related to the preparation of this case or pertaining to these charges and these issues. You must remain at home unless you are engaged in business pertaining to this case or in your employment.\u201d Appellant accepted these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Appellant remained on bail subject to these conditions until the court modified them on March 16, 1994.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion to have two supervised visits with his natural daughter through the family visitation center. The court later denied appellant\u2019s request for unsupervised visitation with his daughter. However, on April 15, 1994, it again modified appellant\u2019s bail conditions by allowing him to attend counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">On May 18, 1994, appellant pleaded no contest to 19 of the charged counts and admitted the truth of 1 probation ineligibility allegation. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1713\">*1713</page-number>part of a plea agreement, the court was to dismiss the remaining charges and consider imposing \u201ca sentence range of 15 to 24 years\u201d in prison. On July 22, 1994, the court imposed a 20-year prison sentence and remanded appellant into custody. In imposing sentence, the court rejected appellant\u2019s claim that he should receive custody credit pursuant to section 2900.5 for the time he was released on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Appellant then formally moved for an award of further custody credit under section 2900.5. In opposing the motion, the prosecution submitted the declaration of a deputy district attorney recounting his conversation with Debbie Keller, the O.R. Project (Project) representative who monitored appellant during his bail release.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Keller told the deputy district attorney the following: (1) appellant \u201cwas required to call into the [Project] twice a week and to personally appear at the [Project] once a month\u201d; (2) appellant \u201cwas very reliable\u201d and \u201cnever missed a phone call or an appearance\u201d; (3) because she did \u201cnot have the physical ability to go out and visit her various defendants on a daily basis since she has 80 cases, and in part because [appellant] was so reliable, she never went out to personally check to see if he was where he was supposed to be\u201d; (4) she twice \u201ccalled [appellant\u2019s] mother\u2019s house to see if [appellant] was there,\u201d and both times she \u201ctalked to [appellant\u2019s] mother and was told that he was there\u201d; (5) appellant once called her \u201cand asked her if he could go out and have dinner with his friends, and she told him that he could not\u201d; (6) appellant informed her \u201cwhen he was going to the dentist\u201d; and (7) appellant \u201chad a job working at a ranch\u201d that she believed appellant\u2019s mother owned, and he said that he went out to pick things up as part of his job. After hearing, the court denied the motion. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the court erred in refusing to award further custody credit under section 2900.5 for the time he was on bail release. Subdivision (a) of section 2900.5 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all felony and misdemeanor convictions, either by plea or by verdict, when the defendant has been in custody, including, but not limited to, any time spent in a jail, camp, work furlough facility, halfway house, rehabilitation facility, hospital, prison, juvenile detention facility, similar residential institution, or home detention program, all days of custody of the defendant . . . shall be credited upon his or her term of imprisonment . . . .\u201d Appellant does not argue that he was participating in a \u201chome detention program\u201d under section 2900.5, but asserts that principles of equal protection require that he receive custody credits under the section because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1714\">*1714</page-number>the terms of his release were no less restrictive than the terms of such programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In making his argument, appellant principally relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Lapaille </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1159 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 390] <em>(Lapaille). </em>There, the municipal court released defendant Lapaille, who was charged with drug- and-weapons-related offenses, on his own recognizance on condition that he not leave his residence except to visit his lawyer and make court appearances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1162.) The trial court later modified Lapaille\u2019s release terms by allowing him to leave his home for approximately 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon to accompany his daughter to and from the bus stop. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1163.) Lapaille sought custody credit under section 2900.5 for the time he spent confined to his residence, arguing that his confinement was part of a \u201chome detention program\u201d under subdivision (a) of that section. <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1163-1164.) On appeal, the court disagreed, finding \u201c[t]hat in referring to \u2018home detention programs\u2019 in [section 2900.5], the Legislature meant only electronic home detention programs established under section 1203.016, in which the prisoner is permitted to be at his or her home but must wear an electronic tracking device at all times, and submit to other statutory restrictions . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">However, <em>Lapaille </em>further held that principles of equal protection required that Lapaille receive custody credit under section 2900.5 because he \u201cwas subject to restraints at least as confining as those placed on persons in electronic home detention programs, so that his house arrest was just as \u2018custodial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.) The court based its conclusion on the following factors: \u201cThe trial court ordered [Lapaille] to remain at his home, except for visits to his lawyer and court appearances. At some time during his lengthy home confinement, the [trial] court gave him permission to leave his home to walk his daughter to and from the school bus. The probation department or release clerk called [Lapaille] to verify that he was complying with his confinement. There is no indication that [Lapaille] ever left his home to attend medical or dental appointments, or to participate in any counseling sessions. He was on complete disability due to his heart condition, and thus did not work.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Comparing Lapaille\u2019s confinement to that of participants in electronic home detention programs (hereafter section 1203.016 participants), the court found the \u201conly real difference[]\u201d to be the method for verifying a defendant\u2019s whereabouts; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1715\">*1715</page-number>latter involved electronic tracking, while the former involved \u201ctelephone calls to the residence.\u201d <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1170.) The court concluded that this \u201cprocedural difference[]\u201d was not a legitimate basis \u201cfor treating [Lapaille] differently from those placed in electronic home detention programs . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid.) </em>Citing <em>Lapaille, </em>appellant argues that he is entitled to further custody credit as a matter of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The basic principle of equal protection is \u201cthat persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law [must] receive like treatment.\u201d <em>(Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 566, 578 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645, 38 A.L.R.3d 1194].) This principle, however, \u201cdoes not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.\u201d <em>(Tigner </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 141, 147 [84 L.Ed. 1124, 1128, 60 S.Ct. 879, 130 A.L.R. 1321].) \u201cNeither the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States nor the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 7; art. IV, \u00a7 16) precludes legislative classification with respect to persons who are different. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 797, 802 [204 Cal.Rptr. 234].) Accordingly, \u201c[t]he first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more <em>similarly situated </em>groups in an unequal manner. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 530 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549], fn. omitted.) Absent this showing, appellant cannot prevail on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Applying these precepts, we reject appellant\u2019s equal protection claim because he is not similarly situated to section 1203.016 participants with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law.  Section 2900.5 has a \u201cdual legislative purpose of \u2018eliminating] the unequal treatment suffered by indigent defendants who, because of their inability to post bail, served a longer overall confinement than their wealthier counterparts\u2019 [citation] and equalizing the actual time served in custody for given offenses. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Atiles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 805, 812 [191 Cal.Rptr. 452, 662 P.2d 910], overruled on other grounds in <em>In re Joyner </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 487, 495 [256 Cal.Rptr. 785, 769 P.2d 967].) The statute \u201c \u2018. . . reflects] the basic philosophy that when a person is incarcerated he is being punished by the reality of incarceration. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Riolo </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 223, 228 [188 Cal.Rptr. 371, 655 P.2d 723].)  Thus, to show that he is similarly situated with respect to these purposes, appellant must show that \u201chis confinement to his home was as custodial\u201d as the confinement of section 1203.016 participants. <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1716\">*1716</page-number>We agree with respondent that appellant\u2019s confinement was not as custodial as that of section 1203.016 participants. Initially, the confinements involve different residential limitations and methods of compliance monitoring. Here, the court simply required appellant generally to \u201cremain at home\u201d and have \u201cregular contact\u201d with the Project. As implemented, the latter condition required appellant to contact the Project only twice a week by telephone and once a month in person. By contrast, a participant in an electronic home monitoring program must \u201cbe supervised\u201d (\u00a7 1203.016, subd. (j)(2)), and must, <em>at minimum, </em>abide by the following restrictions: (1) \u201c[Rjemain within the interior premises of his or her residence during the hours designated by the correctional administrator\u201d;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) \u201c. . . admit any person or agent designated by the correctional administrator into his or her residence at any time for purposes of verifying [his or her] compliance with the conditions of. . . detention\u201d; and (3) \u201c. . . agree to the use of electronic monitoring or supervising devices for the purpose of helping to verify his or her compliance with the rules and regulations of the home detention program.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.016, subd. (b)(1-3).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the electronic devices may be used to monitor or record \u201ca conversation between the participant and the person supervising the participant... for the purposes of voice identification.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.016, subd. (b)(3).) The participant must also agree that the correctional administrator \u201cmay, without further order of the court, immediately retake [him or her] into custody to serve the balance of his or her sentence if the electronic monitoring or supervising devices are unable . . . to . . . perform their function . . . , [or] if [he or she] fails to remain within the place of home detention . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1203.016, subd. (b)(4).) Section 1203.016, subdivision (c), further authorizes the supervising peace officer, \u201cunder general or specific authorization of the correctional administrator, and without a warrant of arrest, [to] retake the [participant] into custody to complete the remainder of the original sentence\u201d upon \u201c. . . reasonable cause to believe that the participant is not complying with the rules or conditions of the program, or that the electronic monitoring devices are unable to function properly . . . .\u201d These conditions restrict the freedom and privacy of section 1203.016 participants far more than the court\u2019s conditions restricted appellant\u2019s freedom and privacy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>Section 1203.016 also imposes on participants additional penal consequences for failures to observe program release terms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under section 1203.016, subdivision (f), \u201cunauthorized departures from the place of home detention are punishable\u201d as escapes under section 4532. Section 4532, subdivision (a), defines a punishable escape to include a section 1203.016 participant\u2019s \u201cwillful failure ... to return to the place of confinement not later than the expiration of a period during which . . . he or she is authorized to be away from that place of confinement. . . .\u201d Such escapes carry penal consequences of up to one year in county jail or more than one year in prison.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u00a7 4532, subd. (a).) Appellant, by contrast, did not face punishment for escape if he violated the restrictions the court imposed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The differences that we have identified establish that the confinement of section 1203.016 participants is significantly more custodial than appellant\u2019s, and that appellant\u2019s equal protection claim fails because he is not similarly situated to such persons. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 639 [139 Cal.Rptr. 594, 566 P.2d 228] [citing fact that escapes from narcotics commitment are separately punishable with a prison term in finding that beyond a reasonable doubt standard applies in commitment proceedings].)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Finally, we disagree with appellant that he was in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of section 2900.5 simply because he was subject to \u201cconstraints not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1718\">*1718</page-number>shared by the general public.\u201d  As the court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reinertson </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 320, 327 [223 Cal.Rptr. 670], in denying a claim similar to appellant\u2019s: \u201c[T]he concept of custody generally connotes a facility rather than a home. It includes some aspect of regulation of behavior. It also includes supervision in a structured life style.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Citing the Legislature\u2019s subsequent amendment of section 2900.5, subdivision (a), to include section 1203.016 programs, appellant challenges Reinertson's observation that the concept of custody generally connotes a facility. We agree that, in light of the amendment, the mere fact detention occurs at home does not preclude an award of credit. However, the lesson of <em>Reinertson </em>is that credit is available under section 2900.5 only where the imposed restrictions render the placement <em>akin </em>to confinement in a facility or institution. Appellant\u2019s home detention no more met this requirement than did the defendant\u2019s home detention in Reinertson.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Debra S. </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 378, 385-386 [185 Cal.Rptr. 219] [refusing to award custody credit to juvenile subject to probation conditions that she live at home, attend school daily, participate in therapy and an after-school program, advise her mother of her whereabouts at all times, and observe a 6 p.m. curfew].)</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">The legislative history of section 2900.5 and its judicial application support this interpretation of the custody requirement. As originally enacted, section 2900.5 awarded credit only to defendants who had been \u201cin custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1719\">*1719</page-number>in any . . . county jail . . . (Stats. 1971, ch. 1732, \u00a7 2, p. 3686.) The statute\u2019s purpose was \u201cto eliminate the unequal treatment suffered by indigent defendants who, because of their <em>inability to post bail, </em>served a longer overall confinement than their wealthier counterparts. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Rojas </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 152, 156 [151 Cal.Rptr. 649, 588 P.2d 789], italics added.) Thus, the Legislature enacted section 2900.5 to address pretrial \u201cincarceration\u201d <em>(In re Watson </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 646, 651 [139 Cal.Rptr. 609, 566 P.2d 243]), and to \u201creflect the basic philosophy that when a person is <em>incarcerated </em>he is being punished by the reality of incarceration.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 720, 723 [125 Cal.Rptr. 901], italics added.) The statute embodied a \u201cpolicy decision . . . that for purposes of credit, precommitment detention should be equated with postcommitment <em>imprisonment.\u201d (In re Kapperman </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 542, 547 [114 Cal.Rptr. 97, 522 P.2d 657], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">\u201cRecognizing that defendants may be in pretrial custody <em>in institutions </em>other than \u2018jails\u2019 for reasons other than indigency, the Legislature and the courts . . . extended subdivision (a) of the statute to include a broad range of custodial situations for which credit must be granted upon conviction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Rojas, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 156, italics added.) Thus, in their early application of the statute, courts emphasized the fact of a defendant\u2019s presentence custody \u201cregardless of the particular locale, institution, facility or environment of his <em>incarceration.\u201d (In re Watson, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 651-652, italics added.) Consistent with these rulings, the Legislature amended the statute in 1976 by expanding its coverage to defendants who were \u201cin custody, including but not limited to any time spent in a jail, camp, work furlough facility, halfway house, rehabilitation facility, hospital, prison, or similar <em>institution </em>. . . .\u201d (Stats. 1976, ch. 1045, \u00a7 2, p. 4665, italics added.) Two years later, the Legislature added \u201cjuvenile detention facilities]\u201d to this list and restricted the final, catch-all category to \u201csimilar residential institution^] . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1978, ch. 304, \u00a7 1, p. 632.) Through enactment of the statute and its amendments, \u201cthe Legislature addressed situations where defendants were <em>confined </em>to a facility (be it penal or rehabilitative) by court order.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tafoya, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 4, italics original.) Given the restrictive characteristics of section 1203.016 programs, including the constant electronic monitoring and the prospect of punishment for escape, the Legislature\u2019s express inclusion of such programs in section 2900.5 evinces no intent to expand the section\u2019s coverage beyond its historical limits, i.e., placements that are akin to confinement in a facility or institution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As we have already explained, appellant\u2019s confinement does not meet this test.

An electronic home detention program administrator may authorize program participants to leave their residences \u201cto seek and retain employment in the community, attend psychological counseling sessions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1717\">*1717</page-number>or educational or vocational training classes, or seek medical and dental assistance.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.016, subd. (f).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Notably, <em>Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at pages 1168-1170, did not consider this factor in reaching a conclusion contrary to ours. The court identified only what it characterized as \u201cprocedural differences\u201d between Lapaille\u2019s detention and that of section 1203.016 participants. <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1170.) The additional criminal penalty to which section 1203.016 participants are subject is not simply a procedural difference. On the other hand, the court did consider that Lapaille \u201cwas on complete disability due to his heart condition . . . .\u201d <em>(Lapaille, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.) However, under section 2900.5, only <em>court-imposed </em>confinement constitutes custody. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tafoya </em>(1987) 194 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 4-5 [239 Cal.Rptr. 458].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b969-8\">The prison options are a term of one year and one day for escapes that are \u201cnot by force or violence,\u201d and a term of two, four, or six years for escapes that are \u201cby force or violence,\u201d to be served consecutively to the underlying sentence the person is then serving. (\u00a7 4532, subd. (a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Nor would a failure by appellant to observe the restrictions have been separately punishable as a violation of section 1320.5, which applies to those who willfully fail to appear in court in order to evade the court\u2019s process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Appellant urges that we must review his equal protection claim under a strict scrutiny standard requiring a \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d to justify the denial of custody credits for his home detention. Before considering the issue of the proper standard for constitutional review of an equal protection claim, a court must address the threshold question of whether or not the person claiming unequal treatment is similarly situated with other persons subject to the law or government action in question. We have concluded that appellant is not similarly situated with section 1203.016 participants for equal protection purposes. Therefore, we need not address the question of the proper standard for constitutional review of the distinction made between appellant and section 1203.016 participants with regard to custody credits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Reinertson, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at pages 324-325, the defendant sought custody credit for time he spent on probation subject to the condition that he remain at home at all times except for purposes of employment, counseling and education.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument traces back to our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodgers </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 26 [144 Cal.Rptr. 602] <em>(Rodgers). </em>There, we discussed an arguably broader definition of \u201ccustody\u201d in holding that section 2900.5 entitled defendant to credit for time spent in a residential treatment program. <em>(Rodgers, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d at pp. 30-32.) However, in that case, the People had stipulated that the facility in question was \u201ca \u2018halfway house, rehabilitation facility ... or similar institution\u2019 within the meaning of section 2900.5.\u201d <em>(Rodgers, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d at p. 29.) Thus, interpretation of the statute as to <em>home </em>detention was simply not at issue. Also, in <em>Rodgers, </em>we borrowed an \u201cexpanded\u201d concept of custody from habeas corpus law, under which \u201canyone subject to restraints not shared by the \u2018public generally\u2019 \u201d may seek the writ, including \u201cpersons free on bail, on their own recognizance, on parole, on probation, and the like. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 31, italics omitted.) This expanded concept is obviously too broad as to section 2900.5; everyone released on bail is subject to some restraint that the general public does not share and thus would be entitled to credit. Indeed, federal courts interpreting the federal custody credit statute have consistently refused to borrow from habeas corpus law in defining the term \u201ccustody.\u201d <em>(Dawson </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(11th Cir. 1995) 50 F.3d 884, 888-889, fn. 8; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Insley </em>(4th Cir. 1991) 927 F.2d 185, 187; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(10th Cir. 1989) 888 F.2d 653, 655; <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>Brennan </em>(7th Cir. 1989) 878 F.2d 995, 996; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Mares </em>(5th Cir. 1989) 868 F.2d 151, 152; <em>Villaume </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Justice </em>(8th Cir. 1986) 804 F.2d 498, 499.) Finally, in <em>Rodgers, </em>we relied in part on legislative history specifically showing an intent to award credit for time spent in live-in drug rehabilitation programs. <em>(Rodgers, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.3d at pp. 32-33.) For all of these reasons, we conclude that <em>Rodgers </em>does not require a different result in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Citing section 2900.5 and section 2 of the chapter that enacted section 1203.016 (Stats. 1988, ch. 1603, \u00a7 2, pp. 5803-5804), appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he Legislature has recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1720\">*1720</page-number>home detention programs as a safe and cost-effective alternative form of <em>incarceration.\u201d </em>This assertion supports our conclusion that the Legislature\u2019s inclusion in section 2900.5 of electronic home detention programs did not expand the meaning of \u201ccustody\u201d under that section beyond placements that are akin to confinement in a facility or institution.
