J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASF\">The Housing Group is a small housing developer in Orange County. In the period 1983 through 1984 it had a primary comprehensive general liability policy with Central Mutual Insurance Company. The Central Mutual primary policy had no \u201cproducts\u201d exclusion. During the same period, The Housing Group also had an umbrella policy with Mission National Insurance Company, which listed the Central Mutual policy in its schedule of \u201cunderlying\u201d insurance. Mission\u2019s umbrella policy <em>did </em>have a products exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The umbrella policy also had a \u201cbroad as primary\u201d endorsement which provided: \u201cIn the event that the insured suffers a loss which is covered under the policies of underlying insurance set out in the schedule attached to this policy, the excess of which would be payable under this policy except for terms and conditions of this policy which are not consistent with the underlying insurance, then notwithstanding anything in this policy to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>contrary, this policy is amended to follow and be subject to the terms and conditions of such underlying insurance in respect of such loss.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Housing Group was sued in September 1990 for various causes of action arising out of the allegedly defective construction of a home in San Ramon in 1983. By this time the primary Central Mutual policy had been exhausted by other claims. The policyholder requested a defense of the lawsuit. The defense was denied by the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), which, because Mission had been declared insolvent in 1987, now stood in Mission\u2019s shoes. After a defense verdict in the underlying action, The Housing Group brought this declaratory relief action for the costs of defending the underlying suit. After a trial on stipulated facts and exhibits, the judge awarded it damages and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">CIGA now appeals the judgment, contending that the broad as primary endorsement obviates the products exclusion in its policy only when a <em>particular </em>loss involves payment by <em>both </em>the primary and umbrella policies. The primary policy having been exhausted, CIGA contends, the underlying lawsuit here did not involve a potential loss which would have required payment by both policies; and, accordingly, the products exclusion in the umbrella policy would have been effective to preclude coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">We do not reach any issue concerning the products exclusion itself because the argument concerning the broad as primary endorsement is not persuasive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The key language in this particular \u201cbroad as primary\u201d endorsement is the phrase \u201ca loss which is covered under the policies of underlying insurance.\u201d The umbrella insurer\u2019s argument rests on the assumption that the underlying primary Central Mutual policy did not \u201ccover\u201d the loss alleged in the underlying lawsuit because the broad as primary endorsement only applies when there is a single loss which requires the primary policy to pay something.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The word \u201ccover,\u201d however, is itself ambiguous in the context of <em>this </em>insurance coverage case. In <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Assn. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 936, 948-949. [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 537], the court had the occasion to examine the meaning of the word \u201ccovered\u201d in a dispute over whether a third level excess insurer would drop down to assume the obligations of a second level excess insurer which had become insolvent. The second level excess insurer\u2019s policy provided it would be liable only for the \u201cnet loss\u201d over either (a) the underlying policy \u201cin respect of each occurrence covered by\u201d that policy, or (b) a $10,000 deductible \u201cin respect of each occurrence not covered by\u201d the underlying policy. The policyholder in <em>Wells Fargo </em>argued that the term \u201ccovered\u201d as used in the second level excess insurer\u2019s policy, should have included the idea of the insurer <em>paying </em>for a loss as well as the idea of a loss simply being within the \u201cscope\u201d of that policy\u2019s protection. (See <em>Wells Fargo, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 940 &amp; 948.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Not so, said the <em>Wells Fargo </em>court. The ordinary dictionary definition of the verb \u201ccover\u201d means having \u201c \u2018sufficient <em>scope </em>to include or take into account\u2019 \u201d something. The noun \u201ccoverage\u201d means \u201c \u2018inclusion within <em>the scope </em>of an insurance policy or protective plan.\u2019 \u201d (38 Cal.App.4th at p. 948, original italics, quoting Webster's New Collegiate Dict. (1977) pp. 262-263.) Thus a layperson would understand the phrases \u201ccovered by said underlying insurance\u201d and \u201cnot covered by said underlying insurance,\u201d as used in the second level excess insurer\u2019s policy, to refer to the <em>\u201cscope\u201d (Wells Fargo </em>court\u2019s italics) of the underlying insurance, not whether the loss was <em>actually paid. </em>The court buttressed its conclusion by citing <em>Bernard Lumber </em>v. <em>Louisiana Ins. Guar. </em>(La.Ct.App. 1991) 563 So.2d 261, 266, which stated that coverage in such a context \u201c \u2018refers to being insured against a specified risk or loss\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018has nothing to do with \u201ccollectibility,\u201d or the ability to take in payment.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 949.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In light of <em>Wells Fargo </em>(or, for that matter, the ordinary dictionary meanings of \u201ccover\u201d) the phrase \u201ca loss which is covered\u201d should include a loss which is within the <em>scope </em>(our italics this time) of the underlying policy as well as actually paid by the underlying policy. And if the phrase does entail such losses, then there is nothing in the language of the broad as primary endorsement which confines the endorsement to just claims on which the underlying policy makes payment. The broad as primary endorsement would apply to <em>any </em>loss which was within the scope of the primary\u2019s coverage, regardless of whether there was actual payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The next question is whether such a reading is objectively reasonable, such that it would comport with how the insurer would believe the policyholder understood it. (See <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) The answer is yes; indeed, such a reading is the more reasonable of the two alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The usual course of events is that excess coverage begins <em>only after exhaustion, </em>and umbrella coverage fills in gaps left open by the primary insurance. (See <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at p. 940, fn. 2.) CIGA\u2019s interpretation of the umbrella policy here does exactly the opposite\u2014terminating with exhaustion of the primary and opening gaps otherwise closed in the primary. Hence it would be highly anomalous and counterintuitive for an umbrella policy to exclude a loss within the scope of the primary policy just because the primary policy\u2019s limits were exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">More significantly, CIGA\u2019s interpretation would have the effect, where the broad as primary endorsement could make a difference, of exhausting the <em>umbrella </em>when any one claim exhausted the primary\u2019s limits, even though the umbrella\u2019s limits were otherwise untouched and even though the umbrella\u2019s limits never had been touched. The broad as primary endorsement would thus be of benefit to the policyholder only once\u2014in the particular claim that used up the primary\u2019s limits <em>and </em>required some payout by the umbrella.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Finally, under CIGA\u2019s interpretation, its defense obligations would also be rendered illusory except for one claim\u2014and maybe not even in that one\u2014in situations where the broad as primary endorsement made a difference. Generally, an excess insurer has no duty to participate in a policyholder\u2019s defense until primary coverages are exhausted. <em>(Nabisco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 831, 836 [192 Cal.Rptr. 207].) Yet CIGA would have us hold that the broad as primary endorsement does not apply unless the primary coverage is <em>not </em>exhausted. And by the same token, if the primary coverage was not exhausted, the primary insurer would <em>remain </em>reponsible for defenses expenses attributable to its coverage. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The effect would be to render the broad as primary endorsement almost, if not totally, meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">CIGA further claims that applying the broad as primary endorsement to the underlying claim here violates the stricture against interpretations which make words redundant, in particular the words \u201cthe excess of\u2019 (as in the phrase \u201ca loss which is covered ... the excess of which would be payable . . .\u201d). The point is not persuasive, however, because there is nothing in the word \u201cexcess\u201d which <em>necessarily </em>requires <em>payment </em>by the underlying policy, as distinct from mere <em>coverage. </em>\u201cExcess\u201d can just as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>easily mean the amount over zero (zero because of exhaustion) as it does the amount over any other number. Indeed, such a reading is buttressed by the juxtaposition of the word \u201ccovered\u201d to apply to \u201ca loss\u201d under the underlying policy with the word \u201cpayable\u201d to apply to the <em>umbrella </em>policy (\u201cthe excess of which would be payable under <em>this </em>[i.e., the umbrella] policy\u201d). If the drafters had wanted to limit the broad as primary endorsement to situations where the \u201closs\u201d was \u201cpayable,\u201d as distinct from \u201ccovered,\u201d they could have written, \u201cIn the event the insured suffers a loss which is <em>payable </em>under the policies of underlying insurance . . . .\u201d The word was certainly at their disposal. They did not use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Along the same lines, CIGA argues that if the broad as primary endorsement is read to include claims where the primary is exhausted, then the \u201cseparate\u201d exclusions of the umbrella policy are rendered void, which is contrary to the basic rule against interpretations which render words surplus. Thus CIGA asks why, if the intent was to have the umbrella \u201csimply follow\u201d the primary, did the umbrella contain its own set of exclusions? The answer, of course, is that the umbrella policy was a standard policy, and the policyholder might not have purchased a separate broad as primary endorsement. In that light it is obvious that the <em>whole point </em>of the broad as primary endorsement was to expand the umbrella so that its coverage was as \u201cbroad\u201d as the primary\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">CIGA also contends the Mission policy was known (by whom it does not specify) as a \u201cstand alone\u201d policy which is meaningfully different from \u201cfollowing form\u201d policies: \u201cStand alone\u201d policies have their own terms and conditions which may vary from the primary. In this regard CIGA points to a separate \u201cfollowing form\u201d endorsement in the Mission policy for real estate errors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Why have a broad as primary endorsement, CIGA asks, when the same job might have been accomplished with a following form endorsement?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">To the degree that CIGA\u2019s argument relies merely on the categorization of its policy as a \u201cstand alone\u201d policy, it is a mere tautology (i.e., the Mission policy was a stand alone policy, therefore it stood alone). CIGA points to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>nothing in the text of the policy which shows the umbrella was intended to stand alone after the inclusion of the broad as primary endorsement. Again, if Mission had designed the policy with the broad as primary endorsement to stand alone, it could have said so, instead of issuing an endorsement that would lead any ordinary person to believe that the umbrella\u2019s coverage was, to be literal about it, as \u201cbroad\u201d as the primary\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">To the degree that CIGA\u2019s argument rests on the existence of the alternative of a following form endorsement, it fails because following form endorsements serve not only the function of conforming the coverage of an excess policy with that of the primary policy, but also typically exempt certain items as well. (See <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Columbia Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1183 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 643], citing 2 Cal. Liability Insurance Practice: Claims &amp; Litigation (Cont.Ed.Bar 1991) \u00a7 17.3, p. 17-5.) Following form endorsements often exempt items such as premium, liability limits, and the obligation to investigate or in some way defend. (See <em>ibid.) </em>Indeed, such exemptions were set forth in the following form endorsement used in <em>Coca Cola Bottling, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at page 1182, footnote 1 (limits and premium excepted), and in the case here (excepting premium, obligation to investigate, amounts and limits of liability, renewal agreements and optional extension periods). By contrast, the broad as primary endorsement here was a broader instrument which, on its face, exempted nothing, and used the sweeping phrase \u201cnotwithstanding <em>anything </em>in this [the umbrella] policy to the contrary.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Finally, CIGA points to a provision of its policy which provides that \u201cin the event of exhaustion\u201d of the primary, the umbrella shall \u201ccontinue in force as underlying insurance,\u201d \u201csubject to all terms, conditions and definitions hereof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> From this text CIGA assumes when the primary exhausts, the umbrella\u2019s terms <em>without </em>the broad as primary endorsement control. This argument is not persuasive because there is nothing in the phrases \u201call terms, conditions and definitions hereof\u2019 or \u201ccontinue in force as underlying insurance\u201d which necessarily excludes the broad as primary endorsement. CIGA forgets that the broad as primary endorsement <em>itself </em>was part of the \u201cterms, conditions and definitions\u201d of the umbrella policy. If, in the event of primary exhaustion, the umbrella insurer had wanted the terms of its policy to revert back to what they <em>otherwise </em>might have been <em>without </em>the broad as primary endorsement, it could have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.

Only a small handful of cases even mention such endorsements. The typical context in which such endorsements play a role (if two cases can be said to make a typical context) is whether an excess insurer whose policy includes a broad as primary endorsement is bound to pay for a claim which was not covered by the primary policy when the excess policy was issued, but is covered by the primary after it was later reformed. (See R.W. <em>Beck &amp; Assoc. </em>v. <em>City and Borough of Sitka </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 27 F.3d 1475; <em>L. E. Myers Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins.
