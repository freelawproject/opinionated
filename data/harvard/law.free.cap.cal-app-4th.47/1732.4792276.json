J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7O\">Defendant Jose Maria Nava appeals from the judgment following his conviction for possession of a weapon in jail and assault with a deadly weapon. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4574, subd. (a) &amp; 245, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found that defendant had been previously convicted of carjacking (\u00a7 215, subd. (a)), with the personal use of a firearm (\u00a7 12022.5). The trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term of eight years, by doubling the upper term of four years for the weapon possession conviction and running concurrently the term for the assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">On appeal, defendant contends the trial court: (1) erroneously instructed on reasonable doubt, (2) improperly characterized his prior conviction for carjacking as a \u201cstrike\u201d under section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1), a portion of the initiative version of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law, and (3) failed to stay imposition of sentence on the assault conviction. We will modify the judgment and affirm it as modified. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that a felony such as carjacking which was not in existence on June 30, 1993, may nevertheless constitute a qualifying prior violent or serious felony under section 1170.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">On December 8, 1994, defendant was incarcerated at the Tulare County jail in cell 313, tier 1. From the control box at the end of the tier, Deputy Walter Koerber, who was supervising the inmates\u2019 release for showers, opened defendant\u2019s cell door. Instead of going toward the showers, defendant went to a cell occupied by an inmate named Tell. Then, with a long, rounded, spear-like object, appellant made jabbing motions into Tell\u2019s cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">Deputy Koerber entered the tier, met appellant, who had returned to his own cell, and took the object from him. It was made from rolled newspapers, wrapped with pieces of sheet, and hardened with either wax or toothpaste and water. A sharpened pencil was embedded in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1735\">*1735</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">I. <em>Reasonable Doubt </em>Instruction<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">II. <em>Three Strikes</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXR\">A. <em>\u201cJune 30, </em>1993\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The initiative version (Proposition 184) of the Three Strikes law is found in section 1170.12.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This statute constituted section 1 of the initiative. In part it describes a \u201cstrike\u201d as \u201cany offense defined in subdivision (c) of section 667.5 as a violent felony or any offense defined in subdivision (c) of section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.12, subd. (b)(1).) Section 2 of the initiative (section 2), which is not a part of section 1170.12, provided that \u201c[a]ll references to existing statutes are to statutes as they existed on June 30, 1993.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Ballot Pamp., text of Prop. 184 as presented to voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994) p. 65.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">On June 30, 1993, both section 667.5, subdivision (c), and section 1192.7, subdivision (c), included a number of specific offenses, such as murder and attempted murder, in their respective listings of violent and serious felonies. Each statute also included several species of generic criminal conduct, such as <em>any felony </em>in which the defendant personally used a firearm. (\u00a7\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(8) &amp; 1192.7, subd. (c)(8); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 832 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736] .)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1736\">*1736</page-number>Carjacking first became a felony offense on October 1, 1993, when the Legislature enacted section 215. (Stats. 1993, ch. 611, \u00a7 6.) At the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1737\">*1737</page-number>time, the Legislature added \u201ccarjacking\u201d by name to the list of violent felonies in section 665, subdivision (c), and to the list of serious felonies in section 1192.7. (Stats. 1993, ch. 611, \u00a7\u00a7 11 &amp; 18.5.) Because carjacking did not exist as a distinct crime on June 30, 1993, it was not on that date identified by name in either section 667.5, subdivision (c), or section 1192.7, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Defendant contends the trial court erred when it deemed his 1994 carjacking conviction to be a \u201cstrike\u201d for sentencing purposes. He reads section 2 of the initiative as effectively defining qualifying violent or serious priors as only those felonies which existed as specific \u201cnamed\u201d crimes on June 30, 1993, and were then enumerated in section 667.5, subdivision (c), or section 1192.7, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">When construing a statute or an initiative measure, we are obliged to give effect to every phrase and paragraph of the law, leaving no part useless or deprived of meaning. <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 826, 832.) By the same token, however, we are not free to read into the law a stricture which does not exist. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182 [217 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">We do not find any support for defendant\u2019s position in section 2 of the initiative. Section 2, when applied to section 1170.12, subdivision (b)(1), does not limit qualifying priors to only those \u201cnamed\u201d felonies in existence on June 30, 1993, and expressly listed in either section 667.5, subdivision (c), or section 1192.7, subdivision (c). Rather, with respect to the definition of a qualifying prior conviction, section 2 simply adverts to the statutory lists of violent and serious felonies in effect on June 30, 1993. (See <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1310, fn. 6 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 144] [commenting on section 667, subdivision (h), a provision of the legislative version of the Three Strikes law comparable to section 2 of Proposition 184].) Thus, whether a defendant has suffered a \u201cstrike\u201d is to be determined by referring to the June 30, 1993, texts of section 667.5, subdivision (c), and section 1192.7, subdivision (c), and applying them as of the date the defendant is sentenced under section 1170.12. To adopt defendant\u2019s view of section 2 would emasculate the references to \u201cany felony\u201d in the two definitional statutes by effectively amending them to read, for example, . . any felony <em>[which existed as a named crime on June </em>30,1993] in which the defendant personally uses a firearm . . . .\u201d Such a construction finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1738\">*1738</page-number>no justification in the actual language of either the initiative or sections 667.5, subdivision (c), and 1192.7, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Defendant\u2019s contention also ignores the intent of the voters in passing Proposition 184. While we need not inquire into the electorate\u2019s intent when, as in this instance, the language of an initiative measure is clear and unambiguous <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 735), it is worth noting that the voters sought to deter recidivism or, in the vernacular of the ballot pamphlet, to keep \u201ccareer criminals . . . behind bars.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Prop. 184 as presented to voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1994) p. 36.) There is nothing in the ballot argument favoring Proposition 184 to suggest the voters wished to target only those serious or violent felonies which were on the books as \u201cnamed\u201d crimes on June 30, 1993, and thereby disqualify conduct which, although made criminal after the June 30, 1993, date, is nevertheless a felony when committed and is described by the language of one or more of the catchall provisions found in the June 30, 1993, versions of section 667.5, subdivision (c), or section 1192.7, subdivision (c). To the contrary, the ballot pamphlet supports the conclusion that section 2 authorizes a sentencing court to apply the initiative version of the Three Strikes law when the defendant has been previously convicted of a felony which the Legislature established after June 30, 1993, if the offense comes within one of the general provisions in the two lists of qualifying priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Applying our holding to the present case, we find the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant under the provisions of section 1170.12. Defendant\u2019s 1994 conviction for carjacking was a felony (\u00a7 215). In addition, the prosecutor in the trial court introduced evidence, in the form of the 1994 abstract of judgment, which demonstrated that defendant was expressly found to have personally used a firearm in the commission of the crime (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)). The carjacking conviction was therefore both a \u201cviolent felony\u201d and a \u201cserious felony\u201d within the June 30, 1993, version of section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8), and of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">B. <em>\u201cDetermination </em>Clause\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">III. <em>Section 654*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1739\">*1739</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">The judgment is modified to provide that the term imposed for count 2 is stayed pending the finality of the judgment and defendant\u2019s service of the term imposed for count 1, when such stay shall become permanent. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court shall prepare an amended abstract of judgment and provide it to the appropriate authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Vartabedian, J., and Harris, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 26, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1732.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The People have asked this court to take judicial notice of that portion of the 1994 ballot pamphlet which addressed Proposition 184.
