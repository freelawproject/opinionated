Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)). An allegation that defendant had a prior serious felony conviction (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)) was found true.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Defendant\u2019s prior conviction brought him within the \u201csecond strike\u201d provisions of the three strikes law. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i).) The trial court sentenced him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">(1) On count 1, the principal term: eight years (the upper term), doubled due to the \u201cstrike,\u201d to make sixteen years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">(2) On counts 2 through 5: two years (one-third the midterm) on each, doubled due to the \u201cstrike,\u201d to make four years on each, to be served consecutively;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">(3) On the prior conviction allegation: five years, to be served consecutively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">Thus, defendant\u2019s total sentence was 37 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">Defendant does not challenge his conviction of the underlying offenses. Instead, he focuses on the true finding on the \u201cstrike\u201d prior, the validity of the three strikes law, and the application of the three strikes law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">We reject most of defendant\u2019s contentions. However, we agree that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion to strike or dismiss the \u201cstrike\u201d prior under Penal Code section 1385 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628] so that the case must be remanded for resentencing. We also find two other minor sentencing errors, which the People either concede or do not dispute. The trial court should remedy these on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1531\">*1531</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">\n<em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence That Defendant Had a Prior Conviction for a Serious Felony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">To prove defendant\u2019s prior conviction, the prosecution introduced a copy of the Washington first degree rape statute, plus certified copies of documents obtained from the Spokane County Superior Court and the Washington Department of Corrections. These documents showed that on May 27, 1977, one \u201cBerklin Howard\u201d was charged with first degree rape under Washington law. On June 16, 1977, after pleading guilty as charged, he was convicted and sentenced to prison. In the plea form, he stated (as best we can tell; his handwriting is not entirely clear): \u201cI entered the apt without being asked and then had intercourse with a female that was in the apt without her permission.\u201d On September 8, 1980, he was paroled to California. The documents gave \u201cBerklin Howard\u2019s\u201d height, weight, and date of birth (May 28, 1959); they included his fingerprints, and two booking photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The trial court found that the Washington first degree rape statute included elements not included in the California rape statute and therefore set \u201ca higher standard,\u201d and that all elements of rape under California law had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The trial court further found that each photograph \u201cappears to be photograph of the defendant in this case, Berkeley Howard, although more youthful appearing.\u201d It concluded that defendant was the person convicted of the 1977 Washington prior.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">A. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence Identifying Defendant as the Person Convicted of the </em>Prior.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">B. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence That the 1977 Washington Prior Was a \u201cSerious Felony.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Defendant contends that his prior conviction for first degree rape under Washington law did not qualify as a serious felony for purposes of either a prior serious felony enhancement, or a \u201cstrike\u201d under the three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">In determining whether an out-of-state prior is a serious felony, \u201cthe trier of fact may consider the entire record of the proceedings leading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1532\">*1532</page-number>to imposition of judgment on the prior conviction to determine whether the offense of which the defendant was previously convicted involved conduct which satisfies all of the elements of the comparable California serious felony offense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1193, 1195 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 858 P.2d 301]; see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1), 668.) \u201c \u2018[W]hen the record does not disclose any of the facts of the offense actually committed\u2019 [citation], a presumption arises that the prior conviction was for the least offense punishable. [Citation.] However, the record need only contain additional evidence from which the court can reasonably presume that an element of the crime was adjudicated in the prior conviction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1541,1548 [285 Cal.Rptr. 394], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 352 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150].) The same approach applies in determining whether an out-of-state prior is a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of the three strikes law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Purata </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 489, 493 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 664]; see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(2), 668.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Rape, as defined by California law, is a serious felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (a)(4), (d)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(3).) Under Washington law: \u201cA person is guilty of rape in the first degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person by forcible compulsion where the perpetrator or an accessory: [^] . . . Feloniously enters into the building or vehicle where the victim is situated.\u201d (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.44.040, subd.

(6).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">1. <em>Reasonable and Good Faith Belief in Consent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Defendant argues that under California law but not under Washington law, the intent element of rape includes lack of a reasonable and good faith belief that the victim consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In California, \u201cthere is a defense of mistake of fact where a defendant alleges he had a good faith, reasonable belief that the victim voluntarily consented to engage in sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 315, 344 [253 Cal.Rptr. 199, 763 P.2d 1289]; see generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 155 [125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337].) In one sense, such a belief is an affirmative defense. Thus, the defendant has the burden of producing evidence that \u201che had a bona fide and reasonable belief that the [victim] consented ... to sexual intercourse\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 157); and, in the absence of such evidence, the trial court need not instruct the jury on the issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 354, 361 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 841 P.2d 961].) In another sense, however, such a belief negates an element of the crime. Accordingly, the ultimate burden of persuasion remains on the People; and the defendant is \u201conly required to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he had such a belief.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 157; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1353 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 304] [discussion of justification and excuse both as negating an element of the crime, and as affirmative defenses].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Under Washington law, it appears that a good faith, reasonable belief in consent is not a defense. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1940) 3 Wn.2d 543, 552-553 [101 P.2d 298]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1995) 78 Wn.App. 891, 894-896 [899 P.2d 34], review den. (1996) 128 Wn.2d 1021 [913 P.2d 815]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Walden </em>(1992) 67 Wn.App. 891, 894-896 [841 P.2d 81]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Elmore </em>(1989) 54 Wn.App. 54, 55-57 [771 P.2d 1192].) Washington courts deem it \u201cludicrous . . . that a perpetrator could be exonerated simply by arguing that he did not know the victim\u2019s expressed lack of consent was genuine or that he did not intend to have nonconsensual sexual intercourse with the victim.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Elmore, supra, </em>771 P.2d at p. 1193, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1534\">*1534</page-number>Nevertheless, here the trial court properly determined that the prior constituted rape under California law, for two reasons. First, there is no requirement that the defenses to the out-of-state crime be the same as under California law. This is so even when it can be argued that the defense is one which negates an element of the crime. This follows from the decision by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 197 [281 Cal.Rptr. 205]. There, the defendant was charged with murder with the special circumstance that he had been previously convicted of murder in Texas. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 199.) For the purpose of this special circumstance, \u201c. . . an offense committed in another jurisdiction, which if committed in California would be punishable as first or second degree murder shall be deemed murder in the first or second degree.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2).) At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate struck the special circumstance because Texas did not recognize imperfect self-defense under <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1]\u2014i.e., an honest but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense\u2014as a defense to murder. (230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 200-201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We reversed, holding that: \u201c[W]hether Texas does or does not recognize a <em>Flannel </em>defense is irrelevant in determining whether defendant\u2019s Texas murder conviction was for \u2018an offense which if committed in California would be punishable as first or second degree murder\u2019 .... We conclude . . . that the relevant inquiry ... is limited to determining whether the elements of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the foreign jurisdiction include the elements of either first or second degree murder under California law.\u201d (230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 201-202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We explained: \u201c[T]he magistrate and trial court . . . apparently interpreted the phrase \u2018would be punishable\u2019 as requiring \u2018certainty of punishment\u2019 rather than \u2018the capacity therefor.\u2019 Under <em>Andrews,</em><footnotemark><em>[3]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the relevant inquiry is whether the offense of which the defendant was convicted in Texas includes the elements of first or second degree murder in California such that the Texas offense was one which had the capacity for punishment as first or second degree murder. The concept of imperfect self-defense . . . is not an element of either first or second degree murder in California, but rather is a mitigating factor, which, when raised by sufficient evidence, <em>negates </em>an element of murder, specifically, malice. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 202-203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Here, similarly, the statutory focus is on the \u201celements\u201d of the crime (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subds. (a)(1), (d)(2)), and on whether the defendant \u201ccould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1535\">*1535</page-number>have been punished\u201d for the crime if it had been committed in California. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 668.) The <em>Mayberry </em>defense (an honest and reasonable belief in consent) is closely analogous to the <em>Flannel </em>defense (an honest but unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense). We conclude that even though Washington might not have recognized a <em>Mayberry </em>defense, defendant\u2019s prior has the same elements as rape under California law and can be used as an enhancement or a \u201cstrike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Second, and alternatively, defendant\u2019s written statement of the facts underlying the plea evidenced the lack of a good faith, reasonable belief that the victim consented. Defendant admitted that he both entered the victim\u2019s apartment and had intercourse with her without her consent. The trial court could properly find this inconsistent with a reasonable belief in consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">2. <em>Meaning of \u201cSexual Intercourse\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Waiver of His Right to Be Present at the Hearing on the Prior</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court erroneously accepted an oral, rather than written, waiver of his right to be present at the hearing on the prior serious felony conviction allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The trial court bifurcated the trial of the prior conviction allegation. After the jury returned its verdict on all other charges, defendant waived a jury trial on the prior. The trial court dismissed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The following proceedings were then had on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">\u201cThe Court: The record should reflect that we\u2019re in the holding area behind the courtroom, and the attorneys are present and Mr. Howard is present in the cell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-13\">\u201cYour attorney advises me that you didn\u2019t want to come out for the remaining portion, the issue of whether or not you have this prior conviction; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1536\">*1536</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Okay. Do you understand you have an absolute right to be there and to assist your attorney, to hear the evidence and so forth? Do you understand all that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">\u201cThe Court: And you don\u2019t want to be in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">\u201cThe Court: You waive your right to be there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-9\">\u201cThe Court: And [defense counsel], anything you wanted to add to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, your Honor. I\u2019ve explained all those rights to Mr. Howard, and he is aware of them, and I believe it is his desire not to come back into the courtroom today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-11\">\u201cThe Court: You understand I will proceed with the trial on that issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-13\">\u201cThe Court: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">A bench trial on the prior went forward in defendant\u2019s absence. Defendant never executed a written waiver of his right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">A criminal defendant has a right to be present at trial under the federal Constitution (U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 730, 745 [96 L.Ed.2d 631, 647, 107 S.Ct. 2658]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gagnon </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 522, 526 [84 L.Ed.2d 486, 490, 105 S.Ct. 1482]), the state Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15), and state statutes (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 977, subd. (b), 1043). (See generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 17 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1115, 1140 [282 Cal.Rptr. 465, 811 P.2d 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">The federal right exists only at a \u201cstage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome,\u201d and then only when the defendant\u2019s presence \u201cwould contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\u201d <em>(Kentucky </em>v. <em>Stincer, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 745 [96 L.Ed.2d at p. 647]; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 747, fn. 21.) Moreover, although the right to be present for the commencement of trial arguably cannot be waived (see <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1993) 506 U.S. 255, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1537\">*1537</page-number>258-262 [122 L.Ed.2d 25, 30-33, 113 S.Ct. 748]), the right to be present thereafter is waived if (1) the defendant is disruptive <em>(Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 337 [25 L.Ed.2d 353, 90 S.Ct. 1057]), or (2) the defendant is voluntarily absent. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 17, 18-20 [38 L.Ed.2d 174, 176-178, 94 S.Ct. 194].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Much like the federal right, the state right is not violated (or its violation is deemed harmless) \u201c \u2018in situations where [the defendant\u2019s] presence does not bear a \u201creasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 18 [harmless], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 746, 782 [254 Cal.Rptr. 257, 765 P.2d 419]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 1012 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099] [not violated]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 178 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781] [harmless]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 825 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865] [not violated].) The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that his absence prejudiced his case or denied him a fair and impartial trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 1141; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 517 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 783; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333, 360 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 310 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Also, again much like the federal right, the state right can be waived. Penal Code section 977, subdivision (b)(1) (hereafter section 977) provides: \u201cIn all cases in which a felony is charged, the accused shall be present at the arraignment, at the time of plea, during the preliminary hearing, <em>during those portions of the trial when evidence is taken before the trier of fact, </em>and at the time of the imposition of sentence. The accused shall be personally present <em>at all other proceedings </em>unless he or she shall, with leave of court, execute in open court, a written waiver of his or her right to be personally present . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Reading this section in isolation, it might appear that the defendant\u2019s presence at certain critical stages of a criminal proceeding\u2014including the presentation of evidence to the trier of fact\u2014cannot be waived, even in writing. Section 977, however, must be read in combination with other statutory provisions. For example, despite the seemingly unqualified provision of section 977 that \u201cthe accused shall be present... at the time of the imposition of sentence,\u201d Penal Code section 1193 permits a trial court to sentence a defendant in absentia if (1) the defendant executes, and the court approves, a notarized written waiver of the right to be present, or (2) \u201cafter the exercise of reasonable diligence to procure the presence of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>the court shall find that it will be in the interest of justice that judgment be pronounced in his or her absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Similarly, Penal Code section 1043 (hereafter section 1043) permits a trial to go forward in the defendant\u2019s absence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 810 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436].) It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the defendant in a felony case shall be personally present at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201c(b) The absence of the defendant in a felony case after the trial has commenced in his presence shall not prevent continuing the trial to, and including, the return of the verdict in any of the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201c(1) Any case in which the defendant, after he has been warned by the judge that he will be removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that the trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201c(2) Any prosecution for an offense which is not punishable by death in which the defendant is voluntarily absent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u201c(d) Subdivisions (a) and (b) shall not limit the right of a defendant to waive his right to be present in accordance with Section 977.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">California cases have consistently held that a defendant can waive the right to be present at trial under section 1043. Thus, disruption, standing alone, waives the right to be present. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 405-406 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sully </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1195, 1239-1241 [283 Cal.Rptr. 144, 812 P.2d 163].) Similarly, voluntary absence, standing alone, even without any written waiver, constitutes a waiver of the right to be present at trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 267, 276-279 [192 Cal.Rptr. 257]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 195, 199-201 [128 Cal.Rptr. 297]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 516, 524-526 [126 Cal.Rptr. 88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">In a case decided by this court, <em>People </em>v. <em>Connolly </em>(1973) 36 Cal.App.3d 379 [111 Cal.Rptr. 409], the defendant, who was on bail, was present for the first day of trial; the next day, he failed to show up. After a hearing into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s absence, the trial court found that he was absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>voluntarily, and ordered trial to proceed. The jury returned a verdict against him that same day. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 382-383.) We held that under section 1043, the issue on appeal was whether, on the whole record, the defendant\u2019s absence was knowing and voluntary. (36 Cal.App.3d at p. 385.) We upheld the judgment, finding that \u201c. . . the evidence supports the conclusion of the court that defendant knowingly and voluntarily was absent from court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We recognize that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 746, where the defendant orally waived his right to be present when the trial court responded to two requests from the jury, the Supreme Court stated, \u201cdefendant\u2019s oral waiver does not comply with the writing requirement of . . . section [977]. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 782.) However, the court went on to hold that the error was not prejudicial. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, the question of whether there was error at all was not essential to its holding. Also, no one appears to have been arguing that under section 1043, the defendant\u2019s voluntary absence made compliance with the writing requirement of section 977 unnecessary.  \u201cObviously, cases are not authority for propositions not considered therein.\u201d <em>(Roberts </em>v. <em>City of Palmdale </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 363, 372 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 330, 853 P.2d 496], and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Here, the People purport to concede that under section 977, defendant\u2019s waiver had to be in writing, although they contend that the error was harmless. This concession is unwarranted, and we decline to accept it. There is no dispute that defendant knowingly and voluntarily absented himself from trial. The trial court properly proceeded with trial in his absence. No written waiver was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">As an alternative ground for our decision, however, we agree that any error was harmless. Defendant cannot demonstrate that his absence prejudiced his case or denied him a fair and impartial trial. Defendant speculates that he \u201cmight have been able\u201d to produce other photographs of himself, or to show that he was not in Washington in 1977, or to introduce evidence that he had never been known as \u201cBerklin,\u201d but these are all matters defendant\u2019s attorney could have shown in defendant\u2019s absence. Defendant also claims he \u201ccould have chosen to testify on his own behalf regarding the truth of the alleged prior . . . .\u201d This is artfully worded; it neatly sidesteps any claim that defendant could have testified he in fact <em>was not convicted </em>of the prior. Defendant did testify at the jury trial on the underlying offenses; it strains credulity to suppose he was unaware of his ability to testify in his own behalf at the bench trial on the prior. Also, if defendant could truthfully have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1540\">*1540</page-number>denied being convicted of the prior, we cannot believe his counsel would have acceded so readily to his wish to be absent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In sum, we hold that the trial court did not err by going forward with trial in defendant\u2019s absence, even without a written waiver, because defendant\u2019s absence was voluntary; and that even if a written waiver was otherwise required, the lack of one in this case was harmless because defendant\u2019s presence had no relationship to the fullness of his opportunity to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">IV-VIII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The sentence is reversed, and the case is remanded for resentencing. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Hollenhorst, Acting P.
