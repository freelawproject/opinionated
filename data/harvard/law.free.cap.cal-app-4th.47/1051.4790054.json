(Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to prison for the term of 15 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Appellant contends that during deliberations the trial court improperly excused a juror who believed in appellant\u2019s innocence. We reverse the judgment and remand the matter for a new trial based on the trial court\u2019s prejudicial failure to conduct a sufficient inquiry into the allegations of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">\u201cOn appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the People and must presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103].) That evidence showed that appellant operated a towing service out of his home with the assistance of his wife, Hortensia. She wanted appellant to sell the business and retire. They had frequent heavy discussions because appellant wanted to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">Appellant, who enjoyed gambling, often \u201clost his shorts\u201d on trips to Las Vegas. At one time, he attempted to borrow $15,000 from his daughter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>Sandra Saenz. Saenz refused because she had worked hard to save money. Appellant replied, \u201c T know you have it. You are like your mother. You know how to save.\u2019 \u201d Hortensia was concerned about going into debt. Sandra refused his renewed request for money. He was upset that she would not give him a loan. Sandra later told Hortensia about their conversation. Hortensia was surprised about his request for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">On September 12, 1993, about 5:30 or 6 p.m., appellant and Hortensia unexpectedly stopped for a visit at the residence of Lydia Villalavazo, appellant\u2019s sister. Hortensia told appellant that she wanted him to retire because she wanted to travel. Hortensia and appellant argued about his retirement but they did not seem upset and spoke in a normal manner. They left around 7 or 7:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">A month or two before, Henry Castore\u00f1a, Jr., the son of Hortensia, and appellant\u2019s stepson, observed appellant and Hortensia in a minor argument in the kitchen. After Hortensia turned her back, appellant made a gesture as if he were choking her. He then tried to laugh it off as a joke when he saw Henry. Turning around, Hortensia said, \u201c \u2018You wish you could do that to me don\u2019t you?\u2019 \u201d Appellant denied any such intent. On a subsequent occasion around that time, unaware that Henry was watching, appellant made the same motion when Hortensia\u2019s back was turned. On a different occasion Sandra saw appellant gesture behind Hortensia\u2019s back as if he were strangling her. Turning, Hortensia said, \u201c \u2018Yeah, you would like to do that; wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Sometime around 10 or 11 p.m. on September 12, 1993, appellant strangled Hortensia. About 8:30 a.m. the next day, Henry arrived and used his keys to unlock their residence because no one was there. He thought it strange that his mother was not present. When appellant appeared about 15 to 20 minutes later, Henry asked about his mother. Appellant replied that she had things to do and he saw her leave early that morning. Appellant\u2019s hands appeared swollen, and he looked as if he had been up most or all of the night. He had a reddish bruise on his left cheek, and there was a scratch on the right side of his face by his nose and scratches on his back. When asked what had happened, appellant said he hurt himself while working on the truck. This explanation, however, was odd because what he had been doing could cause someone to become dirty or burned by exhaust, but not scratched.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Around 9 p.m., Michael Lugo, the grandson of Hortensia and appellant, asked about Hortensia. Appellant said she had not yet returned home. He then left and returned with food. When Michael asked why he did not bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>any food for Hortensia, he replied that she would not be eating that night and she was not going to come home.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">About 10 or 10:30 p.m., Sandra arrived and asked about Hortensia because it was not like her to be gone the entire day. Appellant told her that she left early that morning and he did not know where she was. He did not appear concerned. Appellant, however, normally told Hortensia when she could go on an errand, and she would do as he desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Around 11 p.m., Yolanda Lugo arrived at the residence. She was Michael\u2019s mother and Hortensia\u2019s daughter. She had threatened to call the police if appellant did not. Los Angeles Police Officer George Marentes responded to appellant\u2019s missing person call. Appellant met him at the front property line and did not express any emotion during their conversation. He told the officer that he did not know what Hortensia had been wearing because he left before she exited the bathroom, that she had never done anything like this before, and that they did not have any type of argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The next day Yolanda, Sandra, and Joseph searched the residence for clues about Hortensia\u2019s whereabouts. The bedding normally on the bed shared by appellant and Hortensia was missing and could not be found in the house. Although Sandra found Hortensia\u2019s purse, her glasses were missing as well as her keys and her wallet. In the bedroom Yolanda found blue pajama bottoms with blood on the upper right hand portion near the waistband. A pair of bloodstained socks belonging to appellant were found in his exclusive hamper. A living room curtain also had blood on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Joseph Castore\u00f1a, Henry\u2019s son and appellant\u2019s grandson, noticed bloodstains only on his grandmother\u2019s side of the bed. Under the bed there appeared to be bloodstains on the carpet and more bloodstains were on pictures, a box for a portable radio, and a bra hanging over a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">On November 13, 1993, Yolanda\u2019s husband John found Hortensia\u2019s remains under the house. The body, which was highly decomposed, mummified and partially skeletonized, was wrapped in a large sheepskin which was tied with rope around the shoulder area and the neck with more rope encircling the waist. She was wearing blue pajama tops which matched the bloodstained bottoms found at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The body suffered four fractures, two of the thyroid cartilage larynx, one of the hyoid bone high in the neck, and one of the cricoid cartilage. These fractures were consistent with strangulation commonly caused with the hands rather than by a ligature such as a rope. Although the exact cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>death could not be determined because of the decomposition, these fractures in a living person could be fatal, and there was no evidence of any other fatal injuries to the body. The rope around the neck could not have caused the fractures. Some of the fingernails had broken ragged edges. The scratches on appellant were consistent with wounds which might be found on a strangler.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Appellant presented a defense based on accident and heat of passion. Doctor Ronald Komblum testified that based on the medical evidence, a heart attack could not be ruled out as a cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Around 5 or 6 p.m. on September 12, 1993, appellant and Hortensia had dinner at a restaurant before proceeding to his sister\u2019s house. En route Hortensia complained that his $ 7 or $ 8 tip on the $ 26 or $ 27 dollar check was too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Although the argument ceased upon arrival at their destination, Hortensia resumed her complaint in their bedroom sometime after they returned home around 8 p.m. When he said they could talk about it the next day, she insisted the matter be settled that night. He announced that he was going to the upstairs bedroom and began to rise. Hortensia kicked him in the groin. She had never done anything like that before. He kicked her back and she went off the bed. When she said, \u201c \u2018You hurt me. I am bleeding,\u2019 \u201d he went around to help her get up. He backed away, however, when she told him not to touch her.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Getting up, she lunged at him and scratched his face. He tried to hold her around the waist while she was scratching and trying to kick him. They both fell down. When they got up, he walked to the front of the bed so they could talk. She came from behind and scratched his back. During the ensuing struggle, they fell down two more times. When she finally stopped struggling, appellant, thinking she was tired, lay her down on the floor. He became scared, however, when he checked for her pulse and heart beat without success. Instead of calling 911, he waited several hours before wrapping her body in a sheepskin blanket secured with ropes, dragging her body through a crawl space and burying her under the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Appellant contends that during deliberations the trial court improperly excused Juror Patricia S. simply because she disagreed with the other jurors. We conclude the record reflects the trial court abused its discretion in failing to conduct a sufficient inquiry into the allegations of juror misconduct, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>this error was prejudicial, and that reversal of the judgment for a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Jury deliberations began on the afternoon of November 16, 1994. On November 23, 1994, at 3:10 p.m., the court informed counsel that it had received two notes from the jury. The first requested an explanation of malice aforethought and indicated \u201c[tjhere is one [jjuror that understand^] the [instructions and the evidence, yet [is no]t whole heartedly [convinced that Malice Aforethought existed ([p]resent or [p]ast).\u201d The second note asked for the readback of appellant\u2019s testimony regarding what transpired after he and the victim left his sister\u2019s until he obtained the sheepskin.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">After rereading CALJIC No. 8.11, which defines malice aforethought, the trial court informed the jury that because \u201c[i]t sounds from your note as if you are sort of 11 to 1 on this issue as to whether it is malice aforethought[,] . . . I will send you back into the jury \"room to deliberate on this. I don\u2019t know whether reading the instructions helped. If you absolutely can\u2019t agree and come to a verdict, send us a note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">On November 29, 1994, at 11:10 a.m., the court informed counsel about two new notes from the jury. One asked for the legal definitions of \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cdeliberate\u201d and a clarification as to whether the two words were interchangeable. The other was a note submitted by the jury foreperson Charles C. but written by juror No. 12, Denise H. The noted stated: \u201cI believe we have a juror who is not using the evidence of the case and the instructions of the law to base her opinion. I also believe she is not deliberating to express her opinions and reasons why she believes the way she does. [^Q It is also my opinion that I am not the only person who feels this way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Outside the presence of the jury, the court held a hearing on the second note. It announced that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s inquiry is whether this particular juror is deliberating, whether she is\u2014whether she is engaging in a give and take and expressing a reason for her views and engaging in a give and take, not the content. [U I don\u2019t want to know the content of what anyone is saying in there.\u201d The court first questioned the foreperson. He identified the juror who allegedly was not deliberating as Patricia S., who was juror No. 6. When asked whether she was deliberating back and forth, stating what her views were and the reasons for them, Charles C. responded, \u201cI believe she is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>deliberating.\u201d When asked if the juror was stating what she feels to the other jurors, he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">After excusing the foreperson, the court questioned Denise H. When asked why she thought Patricia S. was not deliberating, Denise H. replied that with regard to CALJIC No. 2.21.2, which pertains to a witness willfully false, \u201c[tjhere are certain things that we have to take as fact by other testimony, and I don\u2019t believe she can substantiate her claim by other testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The court explained that \u201c[i]f it is a case where you don\u2019t agree with the juror, you think the juror is off the wall, stupid, coming out of left field, if you think any of those, that doesn\u2019t itself mean she is not deliberating. [fl] Not deliberating] means she will not engage in a give and take.\u201d Denise H. replied, \u201cShe is saying the ten words but in a different phrase every single time. She is not explaining herself. It is straight ahead. She says her opinion. There is nothing elaborate about it. We have tried so hard. [1] The only time we have gotten a little bit out of her was right before our lunch today when I sent the note to you because I felt she is not explaining herself. Why is she feeling this way?\u201d She told Patricia S. that she wanted her \u201cto explain it to us why you feel it. She just can\u2019t explain it. [fl] We all have to express our views and opinions, and we have all done that [with] her. And [she] can\u2019t express or explain her opinion [to] us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">When asked if any other jurors felt the same way, Denise H. identified juror No. 9, Kuuipo C., No. 4, Dianne R., and No. 11, Robert S. Denise H. explained that these jurors \u201chave expressed the same as what I have[,] that she is not giving us enough information to substantiate her claim or her opinion. . . . It is like we have said or we have expressed our view, ... by facts from the witness stand. She expresses her view, but she won\u2019t or doesn\u2019t explain herself or back up her opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The court then asked her to explain what she meant by the statement in the note, \u201c T believe the juror is not using the evidence of the case and not using the law to base her opinion.\u2019 \u201d Denise H. stated that she believed Patricia S. was speculating as to evidence that was not before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The court excused Denise H. and called Kuuipo C. When asked if she agreed with the statements in the note about a juror not deliberating, Kuuipo C. stated there was a juror who was not willing to express her opinion and identified the juror as Patricia S. She explained that when the jurors became stuck, Kuuipo C. pulled out and read from the green jury instruction packet the directives that if they arrived at a point where no agreement could be reached, everybody needed to express his or her opinions and reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>therefor. Patricia S. responded, \u201cNo. I am not the person on trial. I don\u2019t have to tell you.\u201d Kuuipo C. also stated that on the preceding day, Patricia S. \u201csaid four times[,] I am not on trial. I do not have to tell you[,]\u201d meaning her opinion and the reasons therefor. Kuuipo C. further stated that they asked in many different ways for her opinions and reasons, explaining to her, \u201c[i]f you can\u2019t share with us, then we can\u2019t understand.\u201d She added that whenever Patricia S. actually says something, she couches it in terms of \u201cI have a feeling about this. I have a feeling about that.\u201d When asked for the evidence which led to that feeling, she would say, \u201cI don\u2019t need evidence. I have a feeling.\u201d She identified No. 7, Alexander R., and No. 11, Robert S., as jurors who shared her opinion of Patricia S.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The court then excused Kuuipo C. and called Dianne R. Dianne R. agreed that Patricia S. was not expressing her views in a back and forth manner adding, \u201cWe heard a statement over and over. \u2018Well, I am just not convinced.\u2019 <em>[% </em>It was hard for us. We kept asking could you tell us why you are not convinced? Could you tell us what evidence you are looking at that makes you think that way[?]\u201d Dianne R. believed that what Patricia S. meant was that \u201cthe evidence was not enough, or it wasn\u2019t presented to her in such a way. Well, it wasn\u2019t shown to me.\u201d She stated there were other jurors who felt the same way but did not know their numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In his interview Robert S. began by stating he \u201cwould have to honestly say that everyone has been deliberating.\u201d However, when he tried to qualify that statement by saying, \u201cTo the extent I might not think someone has not deliberated enough\u2014\u201d the court interrupted and asked specifically about Patricia S. Robert S. replied, \u201cMy personal opinion there is that she is judging the case on her feelings and not the evidence.\u201d He added, \u201cI have heard the testimony. I heard it twice. I guess she is not hearing or doesn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Marilu D., juror No. 10, informed the court that she did not \u201cthink there has been a complete back and forth exchange.\u201d When asked if she meant the entire jury or simply one or more jurors, she specifically named Patricia S. Although she thought Patricia S. believed she was deliberating, Marilu D. disagreed. She explained, \u201cI don\u2019t think she is open to\u2014I think she is listening to what we are sharing[, but] I don\u2019t think she is taking it and thinking about it and putting it into how she is feeling. [*][] I don\u2019t believe she is giving us\u2014she started to a little bit more this morning. I don\u2019t think she is giving us the specifics of why she is feeling or believing what she is feeling. [11 don\u2019t believe that she is basing all of her\u2014all of the few things on facts that have been presented.\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t believe they are based on facts or the evidence that has been presented in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>The court then informed counsel that it had \u201cheard enough to tell the entire jury[,] to admonish them to deliberate.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[i]t is clear we have a juror who is not deliberating. I will explain they have to exchange facts.\u201d The prosecutor then moved for excusal of Patricia S. for good cause based on her failure to deliberate. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued that this was not a case of failing to deliberate but rather of someone who disagreed with others but was unable to articulate to the satisfaction of these others. The court reiterated its finding that it was \u201cobvious we have a failure to deliberate!]\u201d and indicated it would give Patricia S. a warning and a chance but if the problem continued, she would be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">In this regard, the court informed the jury: \u201cI received another note that alleges that a juror is not deliberating and not basing her opinion or his or her opinion on the law and the evidence that came from the words of the witnesses on the witness stand. []D I went over with all of you when you were questioned as to whether you were jurors in the case whether you would deliberate, and you are all under a duty to deliberate. To deliberate means what you state what you feel and how you will feel. []\u25a1 You must be prepared to exchange your views on the law and the evidence in the case, the evidence that came out of the words of the witnesses and the documents that you have in front of you. That\u2019s a requirement. []Q Every juror must deliberate. I am going to admonish the entire jury that you must deliberate. I will send you back. If there is any further problem, I would like to be advised of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">On November 30, 1994, the next day, around 2:35 p.m., the prosecutor renewed her motion to excuse Patricia S. because that juror now knew the other jurors had reported her and she would become more defensive and entrenched in her position. The court disagreed, pointing out that if there were any further problems, the jurors were directed to bring them to the court\u2019s attention. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">After appellant\u2019s attorney reminded the court that it had agreed to instruct the jury that deliberating did not mean agreeing, the court recalled the jury and gave the following admonition: \u201c[Yjesterday when I brought you out here, I told you that each and every juror on the panel has a duty to deliberate. I wanted to also mention that you shouldn\u2019t surrender any strongly held views, but you have to base your verdict on, as I told you many times when I was picking this jury, base your verdict on the evidence in the case and the jury instructions.\u201d When the court asked if everyone understood, the jurors all answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">On December 1, 1994, at 11:05 a.m., the court informed counsel that it had received another note, which read, \u201cI, Denise H[.] believe that juror # 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>Patricia [S.] is not following the law specifically [CALJIC No.] 2.21.2. We cannot get beyond this point. She is not explaining her views based on the evidence\u2014it\u2019s based on her feeling.\u201d When the court announced its intent to call Patricia S. and ask whether she was deliberating, appellant\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary to call the jurors out. I think that basically the juror is explaining in this note that she doesn\u2019t like the fact that one juror is not following an instruction.\u201d After commenting that the instruction was not mandatory, he offered to share his view \u201cas to what is going on back there.\u201d The court admonished him not to speculate. Appellant\u2019s attorney repeated that he \u201cwould say it is not even required to bring any jurors out to make any inquiry. It seems clear that the jurors disagree.\u201d He then moved for a mistrial on the ground that the jury was deadlocked, that there was \u201can honest disagreement based upon the evidence as to this length of time deliberating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The court denied the motion and made \u201ca finding of misconduct on juror number six[, Patricia S.]\u201d The court did not agree that the jury was deadlocked and concluded that it was necessary to conduct an inquiry into whether Patricia S. was in fact deliberating. When asked if Patricia S. was deliberating, Denise H. stated that she was \u201cdeliberating to a point. It is hard to explain to you what she is not doing.\u201d When the court explained that juror misconduct does not arise simply because someone does not agree with the other 11, Denise H. responded, \u201c I totally understand that.\u201d She then stated that although she states her opinions she does not say what evidence she is basing her opinion upon. When asked about the evidence, Patricia S. would respond, \u201c \u2018This is what I feel. This is my opinion. I believe this to be true.\u2019 \u201d When asked for the evidence to make the others believe that her feeling was true, she would respond, \u201c T don\u2019t have to make you believe anything. I am not on trial here.\u2019 \u201d Denise H. added that Patricia S. was not basing her opinion on the facts in the case, the inferences drawn therefrom, and the jury instructions. When asked if there were any other jurors who might have knowledge one way or the other about this, Denise H. identified Alexander R. , Kuuipo C., Diane R., and Robert S.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">When asked if Patricia S. were deliberating, Kuuipo C. informed the court that although she expressed her opinion, she was not using the testimony presented at trial. Instead, she \u201csaid she is using her feelings.\u201d When Kuuipo C. asked her many times for the exact evidence used to arrive at her opinion, Patricia S. would simply say, \u201cI have a feeling.\u201d Although there was more sharing of opinions, no reason was given about how the opinion was reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Alexander R. informed the court that beginning the previous day Patricia S. had been deliberating but not before then. At first he answered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>affirmative when the court asked if she were giving her opinions and reasons for her opinions during deliberation. However, he then asked the court to rephrase the question and expressed some concern about the reliability of his memory at that moment. When pressed by the court, he stated that he did not remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Dianne R. explained that although Patricia S. gave her opinions, she did not back those opinions with any evidence or interferences drawn therefrom. Her opinion \u201cseems to be more of a belief rather than based on the evidence at a certain point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Robert S. agreed that Patricia S. was stating her opinions to the other jurors. He added that on occasions she would also give the evidentiary basis for her opinion. However, she did not do so \u201cconsistently[,]\u201d sometimes she did and sometimes she did not. Moreover, there were occasions where he asked her point blank about her opinion and she would not give it.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">When the prosecutor asked the court whether it wanted to question Juror Marilu D., whom the court had previously questioned, the court responded that \u201cthe situation is clear from the record we have already. I don\u2019t personally see the need to do that.\u201d The prosecutor then renewed her motion to excuse Patricia S. Appellant\u2019s attorney opposed her removal on the ground that a miscarriage of justice would result. He argued that there was no evidence of failure to deliberate because Charles C., the foreperson, stated that she was deliberating, Robert S. felt she was deliberating on and off, and she was sharing her opinions rather than simply stating she made up her mind and did not care what the evidence showed. He further argued that the problem was disagreement with a viewpoint, not failure to deliberate. The court characterized his argument as speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The court then found a clear case of juror misconduct based on Patricia S.\u2019s failure to deliberate and indicated its intent to remove her and substitute an alternate juror. It explained: \u201cThe first time I questioned the jurors day before yesterday, I did make a finding of juror misconduct. The foreperson concluded that she was deliberating without stating any facts. I didn\u2019t specifically inquire further. [&lt;][] [Patricia S.] said she wasn\u2019t explaining herself. She was using the same\u2014I am sorry. [Denise H.] said that. She has no\u2014strike that. [*]\u25a1 [Kuuipo C.] said that [Patricia S.] said I am not on trial. I don\u2019t have to tell you my opinions and reasons for the opinions. I have a feeling about this or that. I don\u2019t need evidence. I have a feeling. HU There was not a give or take or sharing of opinions and testimony with [Patricia S.], juror number six. [\u00b6] [Dianne R.] said that [Patricia S.] said I am not convinced. I won\u2019t tell you why. [Robert S.] said that [Patricia S.] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>judging the case on feelings and not the evidence. [Marilu D.] said she was not giving the other jurors specifics as to why she is feeling or believing what she is feeling. We had a number of jurors that stated flat out that [Patricia S.] is not stating her opinions or the reasons which is a fundamental requirement of jury deliberation. [*][] I made a finding that she was not deliberating. ... [D I decided to admonish the jury that they had to deliberate in the case, and I sent them back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The court added, \u201cThe next day in the afternoon we got a note that indicated that there was a possibility that this conduct was continuing. Based on the jurors that I just interviewed, I think that it is pretty clear the misconduct is continuing. [&lt;][] [Denise H.] said that [Patricia S.] said, \u2018This is what I feel. I don\u2019t have to tell you. I am not on trial here.\u2019 [H [Patricia S.] said, T have a feeling.\u2019 She is giving her opinion and not the reasons for the opinions. [&lt;fl] [Alexander R.] when asked if she was giving the opinion and reasons for opinions when she was asked during the last 48 hours in every instance said he didn\u2019t remember. [&lt;JQ [Dianne R.] said that [Patricia S.] is saying that\u2019s just what I believe in response to questions for the basis for the opinion. HD [Robert S.] says she gives her opinion sometimes and sometimes not. Sometimes she won\u2019t respond to point blank requests for her opinions. Sometimes she will give her reasons, and sometimes she won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">After acknowledging the court had already ruled, appellant\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cBefore the court takes the drastic measure, I would ask either the juror herself be questioned or the other jurors be questioned and/or an inquiry be made with regards [szc] to what it is that they think she is stating her opinion on that we are speculating, because what they are saying is true and accurate that she is stating her opinion based upon feelings. [U Her feeling may be based upon the evidence. We are speculating that these jurors know exactly what is required under the law.\u201d The court responded by finding good cause under section 233 of the Code of Civil Procedure to discharge Patricia S., adding \u201cI think we have enough on the record. It certainly has convinced me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The court directed the clerk to bring out the jury. Upon her return the clerk announced that the foreperson informed her that they were close to reaching a verdict. A recess was taken until 1:30 p.m. When the proceedings resumed, the court informed counsel that it had received a 15-page note from Patricia S., which she apparently drafted during the lunch break. The court found that \u201c[t]he note is further juror misconduct [in that it is] communicating the substance of the jury deliberations to the court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel disagreed and urged she may have been merely voicing her feeling that she was badgered by the other jurors and renewed his motion for a mistrial based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>the coercion applied on Patricia S., whom he considered to be a holdout juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">After denying the motion, the court noted that it had previously made a finding of juror misconduct based on the failure to deliberate and found \u201cfurther misconduct [based on her] sending the court a detailed note about the substance of the discussions.\u201d The court then allowed counsel to read the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">After Patricia S. was excused, Cleo H., an alternate juror, was sworn as her replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On December 2, 1994, appellant\u2019s attorney filed a motion for a mistrial based on the 15-page note from Patricia S. He argued that the letter showed that she was in fact deliberating, i.e., explaining her views and the reasons based on the evidence therefor, and that the reason she was accused of not doing so was her disagreement with the other jurors. He also argued that based on the letter it was clear that Patricia S. was the only one who understood the instruction about a witness being willfully false. She believed part of appellant\u2019s testimony and disbelieved the remainder, which she was entitled to do. He further argued that the jurors had deliberated for five days before any accusation of nondeliberation arose and that the letter revealed the accusation was based on Patricia S.\u2019s suggestion that they inform the court that they were \u201chung,\u201d which Denise H. refused to do. Appellant\u2019s attorney added that before Patricia S. was excused the court should have asked her and the other jurors who were never questioned about the nondeliberation allegations and given them an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The court stated that it had considered the letter before excusing Patricia S. and found that the letter constituted additional misconduct. Appellant\u2019s attorney concluded by arguing that a mistrial should be declared because the jury was hung after five days of deliberation based on what Patricia S. stated in her letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The court denied the motion for mistrial, explaining: \u201cI have seven to eight jurors telling me the same thing in essence. I made a finding of good cause that good cause existed [and] that she had committed misconduct. Based upon two separate interviews after warning the whole jury and giving her a second chance, the jurors were coming back and telling me the same thing. HO Her letter does not contradict anything those jurors told me in terms of the only relevant inquiry on the misconduct based upon failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>deliberate, whether she gave her opinions and reasons based on the evidence.\" The court then marked the letter as defense exhibit D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">\u201cThe decision whether to investigate the possibility of juror bias, incompetence, or misconduct\u2014like the ultimate decision to retain or discharge a juror\u2014rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beeler </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 953, 980 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 891 P.2d 153]) The court does not abuse its discretion simply because it fails to investigate any and all new information obtained about a juror during trial. . . . [*][] [A] hearing is required only where the court possesses information which, if proven to be true, would constitute \u2018good cause\u2019 to doubt a juror\u2019s ability to perform his duties and would justify his removal from the case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 343 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Moreover, a trial court\u2019s failure to question each juror privately regarding a juror misconduct claim presents an issue of abuse of discretion, not one of constitutional magnitude, such as whether the defendant was denied his or her right to a fair trial under the federal or state Constitutions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pinholster </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 865, 927-928 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 824 P.2d 571].) <em>Pinholster </em>explained, \u201cCertainly, when there is a claim of juror misconduct, the court must conduct \u2018an inquiry sufficient to determine the facts . . . whenever the court is put on notice that good cause to discharge a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>juror may exist.\u2019 . . . But failure to conduct a sufficient inquiry is ordinarily viewed as an abuse of discretion, rather than as constitutional error. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 928, citations omitted.) <em>Pinholster </em>added, \u201c. . . while individual questioning may have been preferable, we have never held that it is constitutionally required.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nonetheless, the failure to conduct an adequate inquiry may be prejudicial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>Application of Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Mindful of these principles, we conclude that regardless of whether Patricia S. should have been questioned after receipt of each of the two notes, the trial court clearly abused its discretion in failing to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of juror misconduct following its receipt\u2014prior to removal of Patricia S. as a sitting juror\u2014of the fifteen-page document which contained new information bearing upon and contradicting the earlier allegations of misconduct on the part of Patricia S. and raising new allegations of juror misconduct on the part of Denise H. Absent such inquiry, the court did not have the requisite facts upon which to decide whether Patricia S. in fact failed to carry out her duty as a juror to deliberate or whether the jury\u2019s inability to reach a verdict was due, instead, simply to Patricia S.\u2019s legitimate disagreement with the other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The abuse was prejudicial. Although the inquiry might have produced sufficient evidence to allow the court to disbelieve Patricia S.\u2019s version of what had transpired, we cannot speculate about what facts might have been adduced if the inquiry had been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The record contains ample evidence corroborating Patricia S.\u2019s allegations that the jury was deadlocked on the issue of malice aforethought and that the claim of nondeliberation arose only after Patricia S. refused to change her view. The first note received from the jury requested an explanation of the term malice aforethought because one juror, who understood the evidence and instructions, was not convinced malice aforethought existed. No juror contradicted the court when it announced that \u201c[i]t sounds from your note as if you are sort of 11 to 1 on this issue as to whether it is malice aforethought[.]\u201d The companion note requested a readback of that portion of appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the circumstances leading up to the victim\u2019s death, the manner of her death, and his actions thereafter until he obtained the sheepskin. These notes and the court\u2019s undisputed comment reflect that all members of the jury, including Patricia S., had been deliberating and that Patricia S. believed at that juncture that something in appellant\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>negated the element of malice aforethought. It was not until days later that Denise H.\u2019s initial note alleging Patricia S.\u2019s failure to deliberate was forwarded to the court. This evidence lends credence to Patricia S.\u2019s averment in her 15-page note that she in fact was deliberating to render the absence of the requisite inquiry prejudicial. A contrary conclusion is not compelled by reason of the foreperson\u2019s communication to the court clerk that the jury was close to reaching a verdict. We cannot discern from the silent record whether Patricia S. simply gave up, whether she was convinced by the other 11 jurors that malice aforethought existed, or even what verdict the jury had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Vogel (C. S.), P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 2, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-15\">All further section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The 15-page handwritten document was addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d and signed by Patricia S. In the note Patricia S. recounted her version of her experience on the jury. Specifically, at pages 2 and 3 she wrote: \u201cWe deliberated, we dissected we reconnected, we move[d] the evidence in every direction you can think of. I have participated fully in each and every form of the deliberation process. I have read and understand the jury\u2019s [sic] instructions. I understand each and every portion of the law that was presented to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Patricia S. stated that the accusations that she had failed to deliberate were fabricated to force her off the jury. The accusations started five days after deliberations began and were the direct result of her refusal to be intimidated by other jurors, specifically Denise H., into changing her mind. Patricia S. did not feel that defendant was guilty of second degree murder since she was not fully convinced that malice aforethought existed. She focused on appellant\u2019s testimony that his wife attacked him, kicked him in the groin, and scratched him. Although deliberations were at a standstill at least five times and Patricia S. wanted to notify the judge that the jury was deadlocked eleven to one, Denise H. disagreed, explaining she was not leaving the room without a verdict, otherwise she would feel like she had been wasting her time. When Patricia S. stated she was tired, Denise H. told her if she went home, they would get an alternate seated and have a unanimous verdict. Patricia S. felt that she was not entitled to have an opinion, i.e., she had to agree even though she happened to see it differently. However, she did indicate that besides her belief, there were eight who \u201cstrongly believe\u201d the opposite, and \u201cthree who are in between[.]\u201d In concluding, Patricia S. requested the court read the note and then make its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
