We hold (1) the one-year statute of limitations contained in Labor Code section 5500.5, subdivision (e) (further statutory references are to the Labor Code, unless otherwise indicated) applies to such a claim, (2) Fireman\u2019s did not satisfy the requirement of the statute by merely joining General as an additional party in the workers\u2019 comepnsation action, and (3) General was not estopped from relying on the statute of limitations. We therefore conclude General is entitled to the requested relief and grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">On January 23, 1990, Patricio Loterstein, an employee of R &amp; H Designs, Inc. (R &amp; H), filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim alleging he had suffered a continuous trauma injury commencing August 1, 1989. General provided workers\u2019 compensation coverage to R &amp; H between September 1988 and December 18, 1989; Fireman\u2019s between December 22, 1989, and December 22, 1990. Loterstein\u2019s claim named Fireman\u2019s as R &amp; H\u2019s carrier; Fireman\u2019s settled the matter with Loterstein and the WCAB approved the compromise and release on February 25, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">One of Fireman\u2019s employees telephoned a General employee on February 20 and discussed General\u2019s participating in the settlement. General\u2019s representative told Fireman\u2019s it would have to join General in the proceedings and demand contribution. On February 25, a General employee telephoned Fireman\u2019s and asked it to send a \u201ccontribution letter,\u201d to request reimbursement. At Fireman\u2019s request, the WCAB issued an order joining General as a party defendant on March 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Almost a year later, Fireman\u2019s sent General a letter itemizing the medical and legal costs paid by it, and the amount of its settlement with Loterstein. The letter requested contribution. Over the next year and a half, Fireman\u2019s sent General four additional written requests for contribution. General\u2019s only response was to inform Fireman\u2019s that its requests were being forwarded to its Northern California office.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Fireman\u2019s did not file an application for adjudication of its contribution claim against General with the WCAB until January 1994. General objected, asserting Fireman\u2019s failed to file a timely petition for contribution. After an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>evidentiary hearing, the workers\u2019 compensation judge found Fireman\u2019s was entitled to proceed against General for contribution. In his findings, the judge held section 5500.5, subdivision (e) did not apply \u201c[bjecause the . . . statute refers specifically to employer,\u201d and this case involved two insurance carriers. The judge also noted General was joined as a party in March 1991. Thus, he concluded: \u201cHere we have a single employer with two different carriers covering one period of asserted injurious exposure. In light of that, coupled with the fact that defendant General. . . was aware of its potential involvement in this claim, nearly from the moment of the settlement agreement, it cannot be concluded that General ... has been prejudiced in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">General petitioned the WCAB to reconsider the ruling. The workers\u2019 compensation judge recommended the request be denied, reiterating verbatim his reasons for the initial ruling. The WCAB denied General\u2019s petition, \u201c[b]ased on our review of the record, and for the reasons stated in [the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s] report. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">1. <em>Section 5500.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">This case concerns the scope of section 5500.5, which governs the procedure to be employed in cases where an employee suffers either an occupational disease or a cumulative injury. Section 5500.5 is a codification of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 79 [172 P.2d 884], <em>(City of Torrance </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 371, 374-375 [185 Cal.Rptr. 645, 659 P.2d 1162]; <em>Flesher </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 322, 327 [152 Cal.Rptr. 459, 590 P.2d 35].) There, an employee who contracted silicosis in the course of his employment, sought to recover against the carrier covering the employer when the disease manifested itself. The conditions causing the disease existed throughout his employment and the employer was covered by 11 different carriers during that time.  The Supreme Court held that, in cases involving \u201cprogressive occupational diseases,\u201d an \u201cemployee may . . . obtain an award for the entire disability against any one or more of successive employers or successive insurance carriers if the disease and disability were contributed to by the employment furnished by the employer chosen or during the period covered by the insurance even though the particular employment is not the sole cause of the disability.\u201d <em>(Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d at p. 82.) Thereafter, \u201c[t]he successive carriers or employers should properly have the burden of adjusting the share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>that each should bear and that should be done by them in an independent proceeding between themselves.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Under section 5500.5, an employee suffering from an occupational disease or cumulative injury resulting from employment by more than one employer \u201cmay elect to proceed against any one or more of the employers.\u201d (\u00a7 5500.5, subd. (c).) The other employers may be joined during the pendency of the proceeding, but their \u201cliability . . . shall not be determined until supplemental proceedings are instituted.\u201d (\u00a7 5500.5, subds. (b) &amp; (c); see also <em>Flesher </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 325-326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The supplemental proceeding to determine contribution and apportionment is governed by section 5500.5, subdivision (e) which provides: \u201cAt any time within one year after the appeals board has made an award for compensation benefits in connection with an occupational disease or cumulative injury, any employer held liable under the award may institute proceedings before the appeals board for the purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or right of contribution. The proceeding shall not diminish, restrict, or alter in any way the recovery previously allowed the employee . . . , but shall be limited to a determination of the respective contribution rights, interest or liabilities of all the employers joined in the proceeding, either initially or supplementally. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">2. <em>Section 5500.5\u2019s Application to Multiple Insurers of a Single Employer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The WCAB concluded section 5500.5, subdivision (e) was inapplicable because it expressly refers only to an \u201cemployer,\u201d while this case concerned contribution between two carriers for the same employer. A review of the overall statutory scheme in workers\u2019 compensation matters and section 5500.5\u2019s construction by the courts shows that such a literal interpretation of the statute is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">\u201c \u2018The fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] Moreover, \u201cevery statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.\u201d [Citation.] If possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of legislative purpose. [Citation.] Such purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the act. [Citations.]\u2019\u201d <em>(Tidewater Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 950, 956 [137 Cal.Rptr. 36]; also see <em>Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>Insurance Code section 11662 provides that when an employer acquires workers\u2019 compensation insurance, the \u201cinsurer is subrogated to the rights of the employer to recover losses arising out of\u2019 the insurer\u2019s \u201c[assuming the liability of the employer for\u201d workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or \u201c[p]ayment of\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201cfor which the employer is liable.\u201d Since section 5500.5, subdivision (e) permits an employer liable for an award of benefits \u201cin connection with an occupational disease or cumulative injury\u201d to \u201cinstitute proceedings ... for the purpose of determining an apportionment of liability or right of contribution,\u201d where an employer\u2019s insurer has paid the award it is subrogated to the employer\u2019s contribution rights. Such an insurer is thus entitled to the same remedies as those which accrue to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">For example, in <em>State of Calif. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 354 [317 P.2d 8], several insurance carriers successfully obtained a reimbursement award under section 5500.5 against the state\u2019s Subsequent Injuries Fund. The state challenged the award, claiming \u201c. . . the language of the statute does not authorize reimbursement to an insurance carrier as distinguished from an employer.\u201d (49 Cal.2d at pp. 355-356.) The Supreme Court affirmed the award, noting \u201cvarious other statutory provisions indicate that no distinction is intended as between the employer and the carrier with respect to reimbursement rights.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 356.) In addition, the court stated: \u201cTo deny to the carriers the reimbursement provided by section 5500.5 would likewise deny to employers who must pay the higher premiums which would then follow, the relief contemplated by the section. Such results clearly would <em>pro tanto </em>defeat rather than carry out the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In <em>Republic Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 361 [171 Cal.Rptr. 265], the Court of Appeal held section 5500.5, subdivision (e) barred an insurance carrier\u2019s contribution proceeding against another carrier for the same employer where it failed to file the action timely. (115 Cal.App.3d at pp. 366-368.) The <em>Republic </em>court was called upon to decide when section 5500.5, subdivision (e)\u2019s one-year limitation commences. The case did not expressly consider whether the statute applied in a proceeding between two carriers of the same employer. Thus, it does not resolve the question presented by this case. Nonetheless, the mere fact the court applied section 5500.5, subdivision (e) in a case concerning two insurers of one employer suggests it did not consider the statute to be limited to contribution proceedings between employers. Also, as we noted, section 5500.5 codified <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 79, a case which involved multiple insurance carriers for a single employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>We therefore conclude section 5500.5, subdivision (e) applies where, as here, the supplemental proceeding concerns multiple insurers for a single employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">3. <em>Joinder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">At our request, the parties briefed whether Fireman\u2019s joinder of General satisfied section 5500.5, subdivision (e). We conclude the statute\u2019s requirement a party \u201cinstitute proceedings\u201d within one year after an award is not satisfied by the mere joinder of another employer or carrier subsequent to the approval of a compromise and release. A separate supplemental proceeding is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The language of section 5500.5 itself supports this conclusion. Subdivision (b) provides for joinder of necessary and proper parties in an occupational disease or cumulative injury benefits proceeding even after a hearing on the employee\u2019s claim. The last sentence of the subdivision provides: \u201cSubsequent to the first hearing the appeals board shall <em>join </em>as a party defendant any additional employer when it appears that the employer is a proper party, <em>but the liability of the employer shall not be determined until supplemental proceedings are </em>instituted.\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (c) permits the employee to elect to proceed against \u201cany one or more of the employers.\u201d However, \u201c[i]f, during the pendency of any claim wherein the employee or his or her dependents has made an election to proceed against one or more employers, it should appear that there is another proper party not yet joined, the additional party shall be <em>joined </em>as a defendant by the appeals board . . . , <em>but the liability of the employer shall not be determined until supplemental proceedings are instituted. . . </em>.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Finally, subdivision (e), after declaring the employer previously held liable must institute a supplemental proceeding within one year, states that proceeding \u201cshall be limited to a determination of the respective contribution rights, interest or liabilities of all the employers <em>joined in the proceeding, either initially or supplementally. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">A review of the case law points to the same result. <em>Colonial Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>29 Cal.2d 79, from which section 5500.5 is derived, held the reimbursement and contribution rights of carriers and employers shall be decided \u201cin an independent proceeding between themselves.\u201d (29 Cal.2d at p. 82.) A WCAB decision also held that the mere joinder of another employer or carrier is not sufficient to satisfy section 5500.5, subdivision (e). <em>(Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>WCAB (Young) </em>(1978) 43 Cal.Comp. Cases 1143, 1144-1145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>The rules of procedure adopted by the WCAB also support our conclusion. California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 10450 provides: \u201cA request for action by the [WCAB], other than an Application for Adjudication, an Answer or Declaration of Readiness, shall be made by petition. . . .\u201d In addition, secondary authorities on workers\u2019 compensation law declare a supplemental proceeding under section 5500.5, subdivision (e) should be commenced by a separate petition. (See Cal. Workers' Compensation Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1985) Supplemental Proceedings, \u00a7\u00a7 12.36, 12.37, pp. 478-479; 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries &amp; Workers' Compensation (2d ed. rev. 1996) \u00a7 31.13[2][a], p. 31-39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Thus, we conclude Fireman\u2019s joinder of General did not satisfy section 5500.5, subdivision (e)\u2019s one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">4. <em>Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Fireman\u2019s argues General is estopped from relying on section 5500.5, subdivision (e) because its employees made oral representations which Fireman\u2019s reasonably interpreted as an agreement for contribution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Generally, the question of whether a party\u2019s actions amounted to an estoppel precluding reliance on the statute of limitations presents a factual question. <em>(City etc. of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1001, 1015-1016 [88 Cal.Rptr. 371, 472 P.2d 459].) However, here the evidence establishes the inapplicability of estoppel as a matter of law. While Fireman\u2019s asked General to join in the proceedings and Fireman\u2019s sent a letter requesting reimbursement, these requests alone cannot support an inference Fireman\u2019s was misled into believing General had agreed to contribute towards the Loterstein claim. Unlike the cases cited by Fireman\u2019s where unsophisticated claimants were lulled into inaction by the representations of more experienced employers or carriers, this case involves communications between presumably experienced employees of two licensed insurance carriers. Under these circumstances, a more compelling showing must be made to prove an estoppel claim. Furthermore, nothing General\u2019s employees said explains why Fireman\u2019s waited nearly a year to send General information concerning the amount of reimbursement demanded and waited almost two more years before seeking to adjudicate the contribution claim. We conclude the WCAB\u2019s implied rejection of Fireman\u2019s estoppel claim is supported by the record. (\u00a7 5953; <em>Belmontez </em>v. <em>Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 786, 796 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 405].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">The WCAB\u2019s order denying General\u2019s petition for reconsideration is annulled and the matter remanded to the WCAB with directions to enter an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>order dismissing Fireman\u2019s contribution claim as barred by section 5500.5, subdivision (e). General shall recover its costs in pursuing this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Sills, P. J., and Sonenshine, J., concurred,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
