Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for race discrimination in employment in connection with the position of facilities manager of a high school district. The appeal is from a summary judgment in favor of the employer and several of plaintiff\u2019s supervisors. Keith L. Cole, plaintiff, a Black male, was employed under a one-year contract by the Antelope Valley Union High School District, defendant, as director of maintenance and operations. Also named as defendants were: Kenneth Brummel, the school district superintendent; E. Michael Rossi, assistant superintendent for personnel services; and Darlene Hinkel, assistant superintendent of business. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s one-year tenure, his contract was not renewed. Instead, his position was eliminated. A new position was created, that of facilities manager. The facilities manager job consolidated plaintiff\u2019s duties with those of the construction manager, whose position was also eliminated. Plaintiff applied but was not hired for the position of facilities manager. The former construction manager, a White male, was chosen for the position. Plaintiff alleged <em>both </em>the elimination of his position and the refusal to hire him for the new job were racially motivated. The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court concluded: \u201cThere is insufficient evidence which demonstrates that defendants\u2019 reasons for not renewing plaintiff[\u2019s] contract or for not hiring plaintiff for the Facilities Manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>position [were] pretextual and that the real reason for defendants\u2019 conduct was an intent to discriminate against plaintiff on the basis of his race . . . We respectfully disagree and find a triable issue of material fact remained. Therefore, in the unpublished portion of this opinion, we reverse the summary judgment as to the school district and Mr. Rossi. However, in the published portion of this opinion, we affirm the summary judgment as to Dr. Brummel and Ms. Hinkel on the ground, as to them, plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">A. <em>Exhaustion of Administrative </em>Remedies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The individual defendants\u2014Dr. Brummel, Mr. Rossi, and Ms. Hinkel\u2014sought a summary judgment on the ground plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to them. The material facts were undisputed. Dr. Brummel and Ms. Hinkel were not named in either the caption or the body of plaintiff\u2019s initial and amended charges filed with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). Mr. Rossi, on the other hand, was named in the body, but not the caption, of both the initial and amended charges. The DFEH interviewed plaintiff. It found there was not a \u201csufficient basis to accept a formal complaint for investigation.\u201d The DFEH accepted plaintiff\u2019s discrimination charge \u201cfor \u2018filing purposes\u2019 only.\u201d Plaintiff did not prepare the original or amended DFEH complaints; he believed they were prepared by DFEH personnel. The caption of the DFEH complaint form stated: \u201cNamed Is the Employer, Labor Organization, Employment Agency, Apprenticeship Committee, State or Local Government Agency Who Discriminated Against Me . . . Antelope Valley Union High School District.\u201d Consistent with the caption of the charge, only the district was named in the DFEH\u2019s right-to-sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The failure to name individual defendants in charges filed with the DFEH has been discussed in three Court of Appeal cases. In <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1060-1061 [282 Cal.Rptr. 726], Division Seven of this appellate district held, as a matter of first impression in California, that individuals who were not named in either the caption or the body of the DFEH charge could not be held accountable in a civil lawsuit. The court reasoned: \u201c[I]t is . . . consonant with the [FEHA] to require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1510\">*1510</page-number>exhaustion of administrative remedies (by charging all those who are sought to be accountable) to enable a speedy resolution of violations of the [FEHA] without the delays attendant to a lengthy civil trial. For a claimant to withhold naming of known or reasonably obtainable defendants at the administrative complaint level is neither fair under the [FEHA] in its purpose of advancing speedy resolutions of claims nor fair to known, but unnamed individuals, who at a later date are called upon to \u2018personally\u2019 account in a civil lawsuit without having been afforded a right to participate at the administrative level.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The question was next considered in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Fisher </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 118, 119-123 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 922]. In <em>Martin, </em>an individual defendant was named in the body of the plaintiff\u2019s DFEH charge, but not in the caption of the document, nor in the right-to-sue letter. There was evidence the defendant had learned of the charges through his employer and had participated in the administrative investigation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 120, 122.) He had not been served with copies of the administrative charge or the right-to-sue letter. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 120.) Division Two of this appellate district held that as a supervisory employee, the defendant\u2019s interests were essentially those of the employer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 122.) The court also held it was error to dismiss the claims against the individual defendant for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because he <em>was named in the body of the administrative charge. </em>Further, our colleagues in Division Two of this appellate district noted the individual had <em>participated in the administrative investigation. (Id. </em>at p. 123.) The court stated: \u201cThe function of an administrative complaint is to provide the basis for an investigation into an employee\u2019s claim of discrimination against an employer, and not to limit access to the courts. A strict rule [that only a party named in the caption of the administrative complaint may be sued, regardless of any other circumstances] would harm victims of discrimination without providing legitimate protection to individuals who are made aware of the charges through the administrative proceeding. If [individual defendants] are described in the charge as the perpetrators of the harm, they can certainly anticipate they will be named as parties in any ensuing lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, in an opinion authored by our colleague, Associate Justice Sheila Sonenshine, followed <em>Martin </em>in <em>Saavedra </em>v. <em>Orange County Consolidated Transportation etc. Agency </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 824, 826-828 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 282]. The court held an individual not delineated as the offending party, but described in the body of the administrative charge as the perpetrator of the discrimination, was properly the subject of a civil lawsuit. The court found the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>was put on notice of the charges and had an opportunity to participate in the administrative process. Associate Justice Sonenshine based her conclusion on another reason as well. She noted the DFEH form was ambiguous in that it requested the name of the <em>employer </em>which discriminated against the plaintiff, but did not request the names of individuals who discriminated. The DFEH charge form stated, in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Named Is the Employer, Labor Organization, Employment Agency[,] Apprenticeship Committee, State or Local Government Agency Who Discriminated Against Me.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 828.) Associate Justice Sonenshine reasoned the plaintiff could not be barred from suing the individual defendant when the DFEH charge did not ask her to name him. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 827-828.) Consistent with <em>Valdez, Martin, </em>and <em>Saavedra, </em>we conclude plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit is viable as against Mr. Rossi because he was named in the body of the administrative charge as a person who discriminated against plaintiff. If there had been an administrative investigation, Mr. Rossi would have been put on notice of the charges, and would have had an opportunity to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">We turn to the question whether plaintiff can proceed against Dr. Brummel and Ms. Hinkel, who were not mentioned in the administrative charge at all. We conclude plaintiff is barred from suing those individual defendants for failure to name them in the DFEH charge. We rely on the language of section 12960. That statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cAny person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful practice may file with the department a verified complaint in writing <em>which shall state the name and address of the person, </em>employer, labor organization or employment agency alleged to have committed the unlawful practice complained of . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The legislative directive is clear and unambiguous. As a result, there is no need for construction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163]; <em>Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 65, 73 [276 Cal.Rptr. 130, 801 P.2d 373]; <em>Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) Moreover, as used in the Government Code, \u201c \u2018[s]hall\u2019 is mandatory and \u2018may\u2019 is permissive\u201d (\u00a7 14), \u201c[u]nless the provision or context otherwise requires . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 5). There is nothing in section 12960 which requires or even permits us to construe the word \u201cshall\u201d as other than mandatory. (Cf. <em>Governing Board </em>v. <em>Felt </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 156, 161-163 [127 Cal.Rptr. 381] [Ed. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 36, 13413].)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Even if we assume we are required or permitted to construe the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in section 12960, we conclude the statutory language is mandatory. The Supreme Court has held, with regard to the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in a statute: \u201c \u2018It is, of course, difficult to lay down a general rule to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>determine in all cases when the provisions of a statute are merely directory and when mandatory or imperative, but of all the rules mentioned, the test most satisfactory and conclusive is whether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or, in other words, whether it relates to matters material or immaterial\u2014to matter of convenience or of substance.\u2019 This rule appears to have met general approval in this state, as well as elsewhere [citation]. Another rule equally well recognized in the construction of such a statute is that whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the legislative intent as ascertained from the consideration of the whole act [citation].\u201d <em>(Francis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 19, 28 [43 P.2d 300], quoting <em>Gallup </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1890) 59 Conn. 354 [22 A. 334, 335, 12 L.R.A. 353]; accord, <em>Fort Emory Cove Boatowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Cowett </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 508, 516 [270 Cal.Rptr. 527]; <em>Friends of the Library of Monterey Park </em>v. <em>City of Monterey Park </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 358, 379 [259 Cal.Rptr. 358]; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1358, 1364 [243 Cal.Rptr. 572].) Construction of the word \u201cshall\u201d as used in a statute was discussed in <em>Hogya </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 122, 133 [142 Cal.Rptr. 325]. The Court of Appeal, construing subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 1781, stated: \u201cThe word \u2018shall\u2019 is ordinarily \u2018used in laws, regulations, or directives to express what is mandatory.\u2019 (Webster's New Internat. Dict., Unabridged (3d ed. 1966) p. 2085, col. 3; see Black's Law Dict. (rev. 4th ed. 1968) p. 1541, col. 2 [citations].) \u2018May,\u2019 on the other hand, is usually permissive. The Legislature is very aware of this distinction and used \u2018shall\u2019 to describe the court\u2019s obligation under [Civil Code] section 1781, subdivision (b). This recognized meaning of \u2018shall\u2019 supports petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute. If the Legislature intended [a different meaning], it should have used the word \u2018may\u2019 to describe the court\u2019s duty.\u201d (75 Cal.App.3d at p. 133, fns. omitted.) The court also noted the Legislature had used both \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d in Civil Code section 1781. The court stated: \u201cIt has been held where the Legislature has used both words in the same section it must be presumed to have attached to them their ordinary meanings [citations].\u201d (75 Cal.App.3d at p. 133, fn. 8; <em>In re Richard E. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 349, 353-354 [146 Cal.Rptr. 604, 579 P.2d 495]; <em>Abbett Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Storek </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1460, 1470 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 845].) The <em>Hogya </em>court further explained: \u201cHowever, justice is not the slave of grammar, and \u2018shall\u2019 has sometimes been judicially construed as directory or permissive [citation]. The pertinent principles of construction in this regard were summarized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>145 Cal.App.2d 767 . . . : \u2018\u201cIt is true that \u2018shall,\u2019 used in a statute, does not always import that its provisions are mandatory, <em>although in most cases it does. </em>...\u201d [Citation.] The test is this: \u201cIf to construe it as directory would render it ineffective and meaningless it should not receive that construction.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019\u201d (75 Cal.App.3d at p. 134.) The test applied in <em>Hogya </em>has been adopted in numerous cases. (E.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number><em>Austin </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 305, 309 [249 Cal.Rptr. 618]; <em>Morin </em>v. <em>ABA Recovery Service, Inc. </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 200, 205-206 [240 Cal.Rptr. 509], disapproved on another point in <em>Lakin </em>v. <em>Watkins Associated Industries </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 863 P.2d 179]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heisler </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 504, 506-507 [237 Cal.Rptr. 452]; <em>California State Psychological Assn. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 849, 859 [198 Cal.Rptr. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Applying these rules of construction to section 12960 compels the conclusion the word \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory. First, the Legislature used both \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d in section 12960. Therefore, it must be presumed the Legislature attached to them their ordinary meaning. <em>(Rice </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 81, 86 [185 Cal.Rptr. 853]; <em>Hogya </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.3d at p. 133, fn. 8; <em>National Automobile etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Garrison </em>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 415, 417 [173 P.2d 67].) Second, the Legislature is very aware of the distinction between \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d; if the Legislature intended the language \u201cshall\u201d as used in section 12960 to mean something other than that the requirement is mandatory, it would have used a different word. <em>(Austin </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 309; <em>Hogya </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.3d at p. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Moreover, considering the purpose and provisions of the statutory scheme as a whole, the requirement that a DFEH complaint include the name and address of persons who allegedly discriminated against the complainant serves an important function. The purpose of the FEHA \u201cis to provide effective remedies which will eliminate discriminatory practices. (\u00a7 12920.)\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Dyna-Med, Inc.: </em>\u201c \u2018The law establishes that freedom from job discrimination on specified grounds, ... is a civil right. (\u00a7 12921.) It declares that such discrimination is against public policy (\u00a7 12920) and an unlawful employment practice (\u00a7 12940). [Fn. omitted.]\u2019 [Citation.] The statute creates two administrative bodies: the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (the department) (\u00a7 12901), whose function is to investigate, conciliate, and seek redress of claimed discrimination (\u00a7 12930), and the commission, which performs adjudicatory and rulemaking functions (\u00a7 12935; see also \u00a7 12903). An aggrieved person may file a complaint with the department (\u00a7 12960), which must promptly investigate (\u00a7 12963). If the department deems a claim valid it seeks to resolve the matter\u2014in confidence \u2014by conference, conciliation, and persuasion. (\u00a7 12963.7.) If that fails or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>seems inappropriate, the department may issue an accusation to be heard by the commission. (\u00a7\u00a7 12965, subd. (a), 12969.) The department acts as prosecutor on the accusation and argues the complainant\u2019s case before the commission. [Citations.] [*][] If an accusation is not issued within 150 days after the filing of the complaint or if the department earlier determines not to prosecute the case and the matter is not otherwise resolved, the department must give the complainant a \u2018right to sue\u2019 letter. The complainant may then bring a civil suit in superior court. (\u00a7 12965, subd. (b); [citation].)\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1383-1384.) Our Supreme Court explained the process when an accusation issues in <em>Peralta Community College Dist. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 40, 45-46 [276 Cal.Rptr. 114, 801 P.2d 357], as follows: \u201cWhen ... an accusation issues, the Commission holds a hearing. The hearings are full evidentiary proceedings governed by the California rules of evidence and conducted in accordance with the California Administrative Procedure Act (\u00a7 11500 et seq.). (\u00a7 12972.) The Department serves as prosecutor and advocate on the complainant\u2019s behalf and also bears the costs of the hearing. (\u00a7 12969.) The hearing is presided over by an administrative law judge (ALJ) (\u00a7 11512, subd. (a)), who renders a proposed decision to the Commission, which then either adopts the decision as its own or, after reviewing the administrative record, adopts a different decision (\u00a7 11517). Either party can petition the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus. (\u00a7 11523; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) [\u2018JD If the Commission finds that the respondent employer or labor union has engaged in an unlawful discrimination practice, it is required to state its findings of fact and determination and to issue and serve on the parties a cease and desist order. (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a).) In addition, pursuant to section 12970, subdivision (a), the Commission is authorized to require the respondent to [take remedial action].\u201d By requiring that a DFEH charge include the names and addresses of persons who allegedly discriminated against the complainant, the Legislature insured that the administrative investigation, conciliation attempts, and evidentiary proceedings would encompass the entire sphere of the alleged discrimination. To allow a complainant to sue individuals in a state court action on a FEHA cause of action without having brought them within the scope of the comprehensive administrative process by naming them as perpetrators of discrimination at the outset would undermine the purposes of the fair employment statute. The Legislature certainly did not intend that the administrative process should be circumvented by allowing a civil lawsuit under the FEHA against individuals who allegedly discriminated but who were not mentioned in the administrative charge. (See <em>Yurick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1116, 1120-1123 [257 Cal.Rptr. 665], cited with approval in <em>Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>[plaintiff whose DFEH charge alleged <em>gender </em>discrimination against her employer, a hospital, could not bring a civil lawsuit under the FEHA alleging <em>age </em>discrimination against her supervisor].) For these reasons, a claimant is required to exhaust his or her administrative remedies. <em>(Rojo </em>v. <em>Kliger, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">We conclude section 12960 clearly mandates that aggrieved persons set forth in their DFEH complaint the names of <em>persons </em>alleged to have committed the unlawful discrimination. In order to bring a civil lawsuit under the FEHA, the defendants must have been named in the caption or body of the DFEH charge. We agree with our colleagues in Division Seven of this court that this rule \u201cwill lead to more speedy resolution of disputes at the administrative level and is in keeping with the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d <em>(Valdez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1061.) It follows that Dr. Brummel and Ms. Hinkel were entitled to a summary judgment and that this lawsuit must be dismissed as against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Plaintiff asserts a letter he wrote to the DFEH, prior to filing his administrative charge and in which he alleged discrimination by all three individual defendants, \u201cperformed the necessary function of providing the DFEH with information\u201d he was alleging discrimination by those individuals. However, plaintiff cites no legal authority for the proposition his letter can substitute for a formal charge, and we have found no such authority. Further, section 12960 mandates the filing of a \u201cverified complaint in writing\u201d naming all persons alleged to have discriminated against the complainant. The statute does not authorize any alternative to the requirement of the filing of a \u201cverified complaint in writing.\u201d Moreover, it would not be practical to allow an employee to substitute unverified information relayed to the DFEH in correspondence, or orally, for a formal administrative charge. The requirement of a \u201cverified complaint in writing\u201d ensures that all interested parties are on notice as to the substance of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Plaintiff also refers, briefly, to evidence the DFEH prepared the original and amended administrative complaints in this case. He states: \u201cWhen [plaintiff] filed both his initial and amended charges against the District, the DFEH rather than [plaintiff] prepared them.\u201d However, even though plaintiff did not prepare the charges himself, he did sign the charges, and there is no evidence he was prevented from amending the allegations contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>Having previously written an unverified letter to the DFEH outlining his discrimination claims, plaintiff cannot claim he was unaware the original and amended administrative verified complaints were incomplete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">B. <em>The Merits of the Discrimination </em>Claim<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The summary judgment is reversed as to defendants, the Antelope Valley Union High School District and E. Michael Rossi. The summary judgment is affirmed as to the remaining defendants, Kenneth Brummel and Darlene Hinkel. Plaintiff, Keith L.

As noted above, the form does not request the names of <em>individuals </em>who allegedly discriminated against the employee. The form states: \u201cNamed Is the Employer, Labor Organization, Employment Agency, Apprenticeship Committee, State or Local Government Agency Who Discriminated Against Me (If more than one list below.)\u201d That language has been repeatedly criticized as ambiguous in failing to request, consistent with section 12960, the names of <em>persons </em>as well. <em>(Saavedra </em>v. <em>Orange County Consolidated Transportation etc. Agency, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at pp. 827-828; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Fisher, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.4th at p. 122; <em>Valdez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1062-1063 (dis. opn. of Johnson, J.).) We agree that the language should be changed. However, it is of no consequence here. We do not hold an employee must name all potential defendants in the caption of the administrative charge; we hold only that they must at least be named in the body of the \u201cverified complaint\u201d filed with the DFEH.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1505.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b774-9\">ARMSTRONG, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AZmP\">I concur in the majority opinion insofar as it affirms the summary judgment as to Dr. Brummel and Mrs. Hinkel on the ground that as to them plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. I dissent from that part of the opinion which reverses the summary judgment as to the district and Mr. Rossi on the discrimination claim, for I conclude that as a matter of law, plaintiff has failed to \u201cdemonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>decision.\" <em>(McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 792, 805 [36 L.Ed.2d 668, 679, 93 S.Ct. 1817].)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b775-5\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1505.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
