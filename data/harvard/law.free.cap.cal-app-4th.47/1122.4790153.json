J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">In this appeal, we are asked to determine whether a county may levy escape assessments more than four years after July 1 of the year in which a change of ownership occurs. We hold that it may. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the plaintiff\u2019s request for a refund of escape assessments paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">The pertinent facts are undisputed. Under Proposition 13 (Cal. Const., art. XIII A), county assessors must reassess real property upon a change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>ownership, except in certain limited circumstances not applicable here. In June 1988, plaintiff acquired leasehold interests in five parcels of commercial real property in Santa Clara County. The acquisitions resulted in a change of ownership of those properties within the meaning of Proposition 13. Plaintiff promptly notified the State Board of Equalization (SBE) and the Santa Clara County Assessor\u2019s Office (County).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Although it received notice of the change in ownership in 1988, County did not reassess the five subject properties until late 1992 and early 1993. Shortly thereafter, in April 1993, it billed plaintiff for additional taxes on the five properties for the 1989-1990, 1990-1991, 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 tax years. It did not seek additional taxes for the 1988-1989 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Plaintiff paid the taxes under protest and then filed this action for a refund. After a trial, which was submitted on a stipulated statement of facts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>the briefs of the parties, and the arguments of counsel, the court ruled in favor of County. Relying on Revenue and Taxation Code sections 532 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>51.5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the case of <em>Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1009 [277 Cal.Rptr. 251], the court held that the additional tax billings (\u201cescape assessments\u201d) were not time barred. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>\n<em>Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u201cThe county assessor is required annually to discover all taxable property within [the] county, to assess it at its \u2018full value\u2019 on the lien date (generally Mar. 1), to enter that value on the assessment roll, and to deliver the assessment roll to the auditor by July 1. (\u00a7\u00a7 110, 110.5, 401.3, 405, 601-617, 2192.) \u2018Full value\u2019 of real property was defined, prior to the adoption of Proposition 13 (Cal. Const., art. XIII A), as \u2018fair market value\u2019 or \u2018full cash value\u2019 or \u2018the amount of cash or its equivalent which property would bring if exposed for sale in the open market. . . .\u2019 (\u00a7 110.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\u201cIf the assessor, after certifying the assessment roll, found that a property had been assessed over or under its current fair market value, [the assessor] could make adjustments in the form of refunds of taxes, if the property was overassessed, or in the form of additional tax billings, called escape assessments, if the property was underassessed. ([Citation]; \u00a7\u00a7 469, 531, 533.) These refunds or escape assessments could be issued for as many years as permitted by statute, usually four. (\u00a7\u00a7 532, 4831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">\u201cProposition 13, which limited ad valorem property taxes to a maximum of 1 percent, changed the standard for determining the \u2018full value\u2019 of real property. It limited full cash value to the lower of fair market value or the property\u2019s \u2018base year value.\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 2, subd. (b); \u00a7 51.) Base year value was defined as the county assessor\u2019s valuation as shown on the 1975-1976 tax bill or, if the property was newly constructed or changed ownership thereafter, the fair market value as determined under previous law on the date of the purchase, new construction, or change of ownership. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 2, subd. (a); \u00a7 110, 110.1.) Increases in the base year value were limited to a maximum of 2 percent per year. (Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 2, subd. (b); \u00a7\u00a7 51, 110.1, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\u201cThe Legislature provided that where 1975 base year values were incorrect, assessors had until June 30, 1980, to correct them (by reassessing the property) and to levy escape assessments. (\u00a7 110.1, subd. (c).) However, until 1988, the Legislature provided no guidelines to assessors for correcting post-1975 base year values which were incorrect due to a change of ownership or new construction. . . .\u201d <em>(Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1013-1014.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Effective January 1, 1988, the Legislature enacted section 51.5 \u201cpermitting assessors to correct on discovery any base year valuation or error not involving the exercise of the assessor\u2019s judgment. (\u00a7 51.5, subd. (a),) In those cases, there is no limitations period to revise the base year value; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>however, escape assessments may be levied for only four years where there has been no taxpayer fraud. On the other hand, where the underassessment was the result of an \u2018assessor\u2019s judgment as to value,\u2019 any correction must be made \u2018within four years after July 1 of the assessment year for which the base year value was first established.\u2019 (\u00a7 51.5, subd. (b).) Expressly excluded from the four-year limitations period are errors and omissions resulting from taxpayer fraud, concealment, misrepresentation or failure to furnish information, or assessor errors which \u2018resulted in a base year value that was not intended by the assessor at the time it was determined.\u2019 (\u00a751.5, subd. (f)(2).) The Legislature reiterated that \u2018assessment year\u2019 meant \u2018assessment year\u2019 as defined in section 118, rather than, as [a Court of Appeal had held in <em>Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1174 (224 Cal.Rptr. 285)], the year when the base value of the property was determined. (\u00a7\u00a7 51.5, 531.2, 532.)\u201d <em>(Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1015.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Prior to 1983, reassessments due to changes in ownership or new construction were not made until the following year. This resulted in a delay of from four months to sixteen months from the date of the triggering event. The Legislature found this was \u201can unwarranted reduction of taxes for some taxpayers with a proportionate and inequitable shift of the tax burden to other taxpayers.\u201d (\u00a7 75.) Accordingly, it enacted in July 1983 a new \u201csupplemental assessment\u201d rule. Under the new legislation, the assessor was required to appraise property effective \u201cthe date the change in ownership occurs or the new construction is completed. The value so determined shall be the new base year value of the property or the new construction.\u201d (\u00a7 75.10.) A supplemental assessment would then be placed on the supplemental roll representing \u201cthe difference between the new base year value and the taxable value on the current roll.\u201d (\u00a7 75.11, subds. (a), (b).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In 1992, the Legislature set a limitations period on the assessor\u2019s right to levy supplemental assessments. Effective September 14, 1992, a supplemental assessment was invalid unless placed on the supplemental roll by \u201c[t]he fourth July 1 following the July 1 of the assessment year in which the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>giving rise to the supplemental assessment occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 75.11, subd. (d)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Legislature specifically noted that the new limitations period for levying supplemental assessments did not in any way affect limitations periods applicable to escape assessments. Statutes of 1992, chapter 663 provides: \u201cSEC. 3. It is the intent of the Legislature that the amendments made by Section 1 of this act to Section 75.11 of the Revenue and Taxation Code shall not be construed to alter in any way the application of the limitations period for escape assessments, established in Section 532 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and interpreted in the case of Blackwell Homes v. County of Santa Clara, 226 Cal.App.3d 1009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Finally, in amendments not applicable in the instant case, the Legislature in 1994 and 1995 amended section 532, which contains the statute of limitations for levying escape assessments. The revisions provide that where property has escaped taxation following a change of ownership, the limitations period will not commence \u201cuntil July 1 of the assessment year in which either a change in ownership statement, as required by Section 480, 480.1, or 480.2, or a preliminary change in ownership report, as required by Section 480.3, is filed with respect to the event giving rise to the escape assessment or underassessment.\u201d (\u00a7 532, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Plaintiff frames the following issues on appeal: (1) whether section 532 bars escape assessments made more than four years after July 1 of the year in which a change of ownership occurs; (2) whether sections 51.5 and 75.11, subdivision (d), allow assessors to determine a new base year value more than four years after July 1 of the year in which a change of ownership occurs; (3) whether, if escape assessments are not barred by sections 51.5, 75.11 and 532, they are barred by Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a); (4) whether escape assessments should be barred by equitable principles; and (5) whether valuation of property following a change of ownership involves exercise of the assessor\u2019s judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">We will address issues one, two and five together. Before we begin, however, we shall recapitulate the pertinent facts: (1) a change in ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>occurred in June 1988, (2) plaintiff immediately notified SBE and County, but (3) County did not reassess the properties, revise base year values, and bill plaintiff for underassessments based on the difference between the old and new base year values until April 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Issues One, Two and Five: <em>Propriety of revising base year values and levying escape assessments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">1. <em>Could County Levy Supplemental Assessments for the 1988-1989 Assessment </em>Year?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Based on these facts, the answer is no. Section 75.11, which governs supplemental assessments, provided in 1993, in pertinent part: \u201c(d) No supplemental assessment authorized by this section shall be valid, or have any force or effect, unless it is placed on the supplemental roll on or before the applicable date specified in paragraph (1), (2) or (3), as follows: [^Q (1) The fourth July 1 following the July 1 of the assessment year in which the event giving rise to the supplemental assessment occurred. . . . [H For the purposes of this subdivision, \u2018assessment year\u2019 means the period beginning annually as of 12:01 a.m. on the first day of March and ending immediately prior to the succeeding first day of March. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Applying section 75.11, subdivision (d), to the facts of this case, \u201cthe event giving rise to the supplemental assessment\u201d was a change in ownership, which \u201coccurred\u201d June 21, 1988. The assessment year in which \u201cthe event . . . occurred\u201d was the assessment year \u201cbeginning ... on the first day of March [1988] and ending immediately prior to the succeeding first day of March [1989].\u201d The July 1 of the March 1, 1988, to February 28, 1989, assessment year was July 1, 1988. \u201cThe fourth July 1 following\u201d July 1, 1988, was July 1, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">In order to \u201cbe valid, or [to] have any force or effect,\u201d supplemental assessments would have had to have been levied by July 1, 1992, the fourth July 1 following July 1, 1988. As they were not, County is forever barred from seeking supplemental assessments from plaintiff for the 1988-1989 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">2. <em>Could County Levy Escape Assessments for Subsequent </em>Years?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Plaintiff argues that because County delayed too long in seeking supplemental assessments, it is also barred from changing the properties\u2019 base year values and from seeking escape assessments. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">As noted earlier, when the Legislature set a limitations period on the assessor\u2019s right to recover supplemental assessments, it was careful to note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>that the change did not affect the limitations period for levying escape assessments. \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that the amendments made by Section 1 of this act to Section 75.11 of the Revenue and Taxation Code shall not be construed to alter in any way the application of the limitations period for escape assessments, established in Section 532 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, and interpreted in the case of Blackwell Homes v. County of Santa Clara, 226 Cal.App.3d 1009 [277 Cal.Rptr. 251].\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 663, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Before we turn to section 532 and the case of <em>Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 1009, however, we must first examine the statute that enables assessors to correct base year values and to levy escape assessments. Section 51.5, subdivision (a) provides that \u201cany error or omission in the determination of a base year value .... including the failure to establish that base year value, which does not involve the exercise of an assessor\u2019s judgment as to value, shall be corrected in <em>any </em>assessment year in which the error or omission is discovered.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Where the correction \u201cincreases the base year value, appropriate escape assessments shall be imposed in accordance with this division.\u201d (\u00a7 51.5, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">A. <em>Base Year Values Can Be Corrected at Any Time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Section 51.5, subdivision (a) thus allows assessors who have not exercised their judgment as to value to correct base year values \u201cwhenever it is discovered that a base-year value does not reflect applicable constitutional or statutory valuation standards or the base-year value was omitted. Any limitations imposed upon the assessor\u2019s authority to correct these errors would result in a system of taxation which, on the one hand, denies the benefits of Article XIII A of the California Constitution to some taxpayers where the barred error or correction would reduce the base-year value and, on the other hand, encourages even the most honest person to engage in deception and concealment in order to delay discovery of changes in ownership or new construction beyond the point where a correction of the base-year value can be made.\u201d (Stats. 1987, ch. 537, \u00a7 1, subd. (a), p. 1834.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">B. <em>Escape Assessments Can Be Levied Only Within the Time Limits Specified in Sections 51.5, Subdivision (a) (or (b)) and 532.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The fact that there is no limitations period for correcting base year values (not involving the assessor\u2019s exercise of judgment as to value) does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>mean, however, that there is no limitations period for levying escape assessments based on the changed base year value. Section 51.5, subdivision (d), permits assessors to levy only \u201cappropriate escape assessments\u201d when revaluation results in an increase in the base year value.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">This is where section 532 comes into play. It explains which escape assessments are \u201cappropriate,\u201d i.e., timely, and which are not. The 1993 version of section 532 provided that escape assessments not subject to a penalty \u201cshall be made within four years after July 1 of the assessment year in which the property escaped taxation or was underassessed. \u2018Assessment year\u2019 means the period defined in Section 118.\u201d (Stats. 1987, ch. 537, \u00a7 5, p. 1837.) Section 118 defines \u201c[assessment year\u201d as \u201cthe period beginning with a lien date and ending immediately prior to the succeeding lien date for taxes levied by the same agency.\u201d This definition presupposes a new \u201cassessment year\u201d every year. As soon as one ends, another begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">To determine whether an escape assessment for a particular assessment year is valid and timely, two criteria must be met. First, the property must have escaped taxation or been underassessed in that year because the taxes were calculated based on an earlier and lower base year value. Second, the county must have billed the property owner for escape assessments \u201cwithin four years after July 1\u201d of this particular assessment year.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">By way of illustration, let us assume there was a change in ownership or new construction in June 1980 that was promptly reported, but the assessor did not revise the base year value or levy escape assessments until June 1990. Because the taxpayer was paying property taxes based on a prior and lower base year value, his or her property was escaping taxation or was underassessed in each of the assessment years since 1980. However, the assessor would not be permitted to levy escape assessments in June 1990 for the 1980-1981, 1981-1982, 1982-1983, 1983-1984, 1984-1985, and 1985-1986 assessment years as such assessments would not have been made \u201cwithin four years after July 1\u201d of any of those years. On the other hand, the assessor could bill the taxpayer for the 1986-1987 assessment year and subsequent years as such assessments would be made \u201cwithin four years after July 1\u201d of each of those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Plaintiff here relies heavily upon a 1986 opinion of the First District, <em>Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1174 [224 Cal.Rptr. 285]. In that case, the court concluded that section 532, which preceded Proposition 13, was in some ways inconsistent with it. To harmonize the two, the court held that (1) the \u201clien date\u201d (i.e., March 1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>should be substituted for the \u201cJuly 1\u201d date referred to section 532, and (2) \u201cthe year when the base value of the property was determined pursuant to\u201d Proposition 13 should be substituted for the term \u201cthe assessment year\u201d in section 532. (178 Cal.App.3d at p. 1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In <em>Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at page 1017, we disagreed with the <em>Dreyer\u2019s </em>court\u2019s interpretation of section 532. We concluded there was no inconsistency between Proposition 13 and section 532. Thus, in our view, \u201cassessment year\u201d meant assessment year, and \u201cJuly 1\u201d meant July 1. We noted that the Legislature had expressly found \u201c \u2018that the provisions of law relating to escape assessments are in no way inconsistent with Article XIII A of the California Constitution. An escape assessment merely reflects the amount by which the property has been underassessed and is a mechanism which permits the correction of the effects of that underassessment. The amount of the underassessment must be determined, however, in accordance with the applicable statutory valuation standards. Thus, an escape assessment is merely a mechanism for implementing existing property tax law and cannot be in conflict with it.\u2019 (Stats. 1987, ch. 537, \u00a7 1, p. 466.)\u201d <em>(Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1015-1016.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">As the court observed in <em>Sea World, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1390 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 194], \u201cThe legislative analysis for Senate Bill No. 587 reveals it was drafted in response to <em>Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Alameda[, supra,] </em>178 Cal.App.3d 1174, which determined the assessor could not correct a post-1975 base year value where the correction was made more than four years after March 1 of the year for which the base year value was established. While <em>Dreyer\u2019s </em>concerned an error in an assessor\u2019s value judgment concerning a base year value, the Legislature wanted to clarify other types of corrections and the differences between escape assessments applying to property which was underassessed and that which had totally escaped assessment. (SBE, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 587, <em>supra.) </em>\u2018In view of the serious interpretational questions raised by the <em>Dreyer\u2019s </em>decision, it is necessary for the Legislature to adopt clear guidelines for the correction of post-1975 base year values and to restore the statutory meaning of the terms used in the escape assessment provisions.\u2019 <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara[, supra,] </em>226 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1014-1016.)\u201d <em>(Sea World, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 1399, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The Legislature\u2019s intent to \u201crestore the statutory meaning of the terms used in the escape assessment provisions\u201d clearly applied to the key term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>\u201cassessment year,\u201d and the controlling date, \u201cJuly 1.\u201d By restoring the statutory meaning to these words, the Legislature permitted assessors to seek escape assessments even in situations where the base year value was corrected more than four years after the triggering event. This is because there is a new assessment year each and every year while there is only one year when the base year value of a particular property is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In the instant case, had the <em>Dreyer\u2019s </em>interpretation prevailed, no escape assessments could have been levied. That is because, under <em>Dreyer\u2019s, </em>the only timely escape assessments are those made within four years of the year when the new base year value was determined. On the other hand, applying this court\u2019s interpretation in <em>Blackwell Homes </em>and the language of section 532, escape assessments for the last four years are timely.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with that taken by the SBE in its January 7, 1993, letter to assessors discussing the new time limits for imposing supplemental assessments pursuant to section 75.11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letter states: <em>\u201cTime Limits for Escape Assessments are Unaffected </em>[\u2018JO Chapter 663 contains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>Statement of Legislative Intent which makes clear that the newly added time limits for making supplemental assessments do not affect the existing statute of limitations under Section 532 for making escape assessments. [^] Thus, for example, where new construction was completed April 1, 1989, the (two) supplemental assessments would have to be enrolled by July 1, 1993 since, as in the example above, that would be the fourth July 1 following the assessment year in which the event giving rise to the supplemental assessment occurred. But even if the supplemental assessments were not made by July 1, 1993, the assessor would still be obligated to enroll escape assessments for any years still open under Section 532. Specifically, if the new construction went undiscovered until July 2, 1993 (so that no supplemental assessments and no escape assessments were made by that date), the assessor would still be required to levy an assessment for the current roll year, 1993-94, and escape assessments for the 1990-91, 1991-92, and the 1992-93 assessment^ years, despite the fact that the supplemental assessments would now be barred. (Under Section 532, the 1990-91 escape assessments would have to be made by July 1, 1994.)\u201d (See also 1 Ehrman &amp; Flavin, Taxing Cal. Property (3d ed., 1996 supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 12:09 &amp; 14:02.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">This analysis is predicated on the proposition that the assessor did not exercise his or her judgment as to value when it failed to do anything at all to revise the base year values on the five properties. Plaintiff takes issue with this proposition. Plaintiff contends the assessor does exercise his or her judgment as to value when he or she enters a figure on the county\u2019s assessment rolls. As noted in our discussion of the statutory scheme governing real property taxation, an assessor is required to enter a value for every property within the county on the county assessment rolls each year. (\u00a7\u00a7 401, 401.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">However, after a property\u2019s base year value is determined, subsequent entries onto the assessment rolls are done pro forma without the need to exercise one\u2019s judgment as to value, simply by applying an inflation factor to the previous year\u2019s entry. Section 51 specifies that \u201cfor each lien date after the lien date in which the base year value is determined pursuant to Section 110.1, the taxable value of real property shall, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b) or (c), be the lesser of: [U (1) Its base year value, compounded annually since the base year by an inflation factor\u201d or its full cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>Here, the assessor\u2019s initial failure to establish a base year value could not have been an error involving the assessor\u2019s judgment as to value within the meaning of section 51.5, subdivision (b), because the assessor did not determine a new base year value until late 1992 and early 1993, when the escape assessments were levied. The Legislature specifically provided in section 51.5, subdivision (a) that \u201cany error or omission in the determination of a base year value . . . , <em>including the failure to establish that base year value, </em>which does not involve the exercise of an assessor\u2019s judgment as to value, shall be corrected in any assessment year in which the error or omission is discovered.\u201d Under these circumstances, we hold that where the assessor has taken no action to adjust the base year value, he or she has not exercised his or her judgment as to value.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the escape assessments levied in this case were timely because they did not involve the assessor\u2019s judgment as to value and because they were made within four years of July 1 of the assessment years involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Issue Two: <em>Are the Escape Assessments Barred by Code of Civil Procedure Section 338, Subdivision (a)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Plaintiff contends that if the escape assessments are not barred by section 51.5, 75.11, subdivision (d), or 532, they are nevertheless barred by Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a) provides that civil actions \u201cupon a liability created by statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture\u201d must be brought \u201c[wjithin three years.\u201d This statute has no applicability here. County has not brought a civil action against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">As has been noted in earlier sections of this opinion, the assessor\u2019s authority to levy real property taxes is exhaustively set forth in the Revenue and Taxation Code. Sections 51.5 and 532 specifically deal with the time limits for imposing escape assessments. The assessor does not need to file a civil action in order to perfect the county\u2019s lien for taxes levied. By operation of law a tax lien is imposed on the subject property. (\u00a7 2187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The opinion plaintiff cites to support its argument that Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (a), applies is inapposite. In <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 905 [103 Cal.Rptr. 576], a taxpayer brought an action in 1970 to recover, on behalf of the county, personal property (not real property) taxes that allegedly should have been paid by a business enterprise for the years 1961 and 1962. The complaint alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>county assessor and others conspired to permit the underassessment, that the assessor had been indicted for conspiracy and bribery in connection with the same incident, but that after the trial resulted in an acquittal, the county refused to take any action to collect the unpaid taxes. The trial court sustained general demurrers without leave to amend and the Court of Appeal affirmed. As to the property owner involved, the court held the time for imposition of additional taxes for the years in question had expired before plaintiff\u2019s action was commenced. Thus, this was a case involving the appropriate limitations period in which to commence a civil action. It has no application whatsoever under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Issue Three: <em>Should the Escape Assessments Be Barred by Equitable Principles?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s final contention is that \u201cequity requires that the escapes are barred after four years. This is because the taxpayer may not change the base year values under Section 80 after four years. ['JO The rationale which the County and the Trial Court follow would permit an assessment to be made at any time, e.g., one hundred years from July 1, 1988. This approach is contrary to Article XIIIA, its implementing legislation and the fact that statutes are to be construed against the taxing authority. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">We discern two equitable arguments. The first is that it is unfair that counties can change base year values indefinitely because a taxpayer can only challenge the value established for four years. Where a county changes the base year value more than four years after the event triggering the revaluation, a taxpayer, plaintiff implies, is permanently precluded from challenging the value established. Plaintiff, however, is mistaken. Section 80 provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) An application for reduction in the base year value of an assessment on the current local roll may be filed during the regular filing period for that year as set forth in Section 1603 or Section 1840, subject to the following limitations: . . . ['JD (4) The base-year value determined pursuant to Section 51.5 shall be conclusively presumed to be the base-year value unless an application for equalization is filed during the appropriate equalization period <em>for the year in which the error is corrected or in any of the three succeeding years. </em>Once an application is filed, the base-year value determined pursuant to that application shall be conclusively presumed to be the base-year value for that assessment.\u201d (Italics added.) Here, the base year values were corrected in late 1992 or early 1993. Consequently, plaintiff has until late 1996 or early 1997 to contest the valuations. It is the year when the error is corrected that triggers the limitations period in section 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s second equitable argument is that revaluations made \u201cat any time,\u201d even 100 years after the event giving rise to the revaluation, are inherently unfair. We disagree. The Legislature has pointed out that what is inherently unfair is that some real property owners fail to pay their fair share of property taxes as mandated by Proposition 13.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the extreme situation cited by plaintiff where a property is not reassessed until 100 years after the triggering event, the property owner has received a substantial windfall\u201496 years of paying less than its fair share of property taxes. However, for the last four years, the property owner must pay taxes based on the corrected base year value. In addition, the taxpayer retains the right for a period of four years after the error is corrected to challenge the new base year value.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Under these circumstances, we hold that equitable principles do not bar application of sections 51.5 and 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Bamattre-Manoukian, J., and Mihara, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 20, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The stipulated facts are as follows: \u201c1.

All of the above-described assessor\u2019s parcels contain both land and improvements which were leased by the plaintiff for a term which under the provisions of California Revenue &amp; Taxation Code \u00a7 61(c)(1) exceeded a term of 35 years or more, including renewal options, such that upon a change of control of a corporation as defined within \u00a7 64(c) of the Revenue &amp; Taxation Code, a change of ownership within the definition of Revenue &amp; Taxation Code \u00a7 60 would occur. On or about the 23rd day of June 1988, such a change of ownership as defined in Revenue &amp; Taxation Code \u00a7 60 did occur. [1 6. As required by Revenue &amp; Taxation Code \u00a7 480.1, statements of change in control of ownership of legal entities were filed with the California State Board of Equalization on or about July 7, 1988, which did, on or about September 8, 1988, advise the assessor of the County of Santa Clara that the above-described property was subject to revaluation pursuant to the provisions of Article XIIIA (Proposition 13) and its implementing legislation. Additionally, the assessor was directly advised by the plaintiff of the change of ownership on or about August 10, 1988. [j] 7. On September 18, 1992, the Assessor of the County of Santa Clara sent a \u2018Notification of Changed Assessment\u2019 relative to APN 209-35-005 to the Plaintiff which stated that corrected values were enrolled. Said \u2018Notification\u2019 set forth corrected assessed values for the referenced property for the years</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>1989/90; 1990/91; 1991/92 and 1992/93. On October 22, 1992, the Assessor sent to the Plaintiff a \u2018Notification of Supplemental Assessment\u2019 relative to APN 209-35-005. Said Notification stated a new base year value for the 1988/89 tax year as a result of the transfer on June 23, 1988. [QQ With respect to APN 592-19-006, on February 19, 1993, the Assessor sent to the Plaintiff\u2019s lessor a \u2018Notification of Corrected Assessment\u2019 which stated that incorrect values had been enrolled. Said \u2018Notification\u2019 then set forth corrected assessed values for each of the years 1989/90; 1990/91; 1991/92; and 1992/93. [H With respect to APN 592-19-020, on February 19,1993, the Assessor sent to the Plaintiff\u2019s lessor a \u2018Notification of Corrected Assessment\u2019 which stated that incorrect values had been enrolled. Said \u2018Notification\u2019 then set forth corrected assessed values for each of the years 1989/90; 1990/91; 1991/92; and 1992/93. [1 The \u2018corrected values\u2019 set forth on the \u2018Notifications of Corrected Assessments\u2019 for each of the three aforementioned parcels were determined by the Assessor by appraising each property as of the time of transfer in June of 1988. After that value was determined the Assessor then applied to it the inflation factor of two percent (2%) per year and thereafter the Assessor then applied the same factor for each of the four years 1989/90 through 1992/93. [CJD On April 23, 1993, the Assessor sent to the Plaintiff\u2019s lessor a \u2018Notification of Supplemental Assessment\u2019 relative to APN 592-19-006 which stated the new base year value. No Notification of Supplemental Assessment relative to APN 592-19-20 has been sent to the Plaintiff. HD 8. With respect to APNs 307-11-008 and 307-11-009, Notices of Supplemental Assessment were sent to the Plaintiff\u2019s lessor on January 22, 1993. [QQ 9. In the case of APN 209-35-005, the records show that the Assessor appraised Wards LEOP (Legal Entity Ownership Program), which corrects a previous entry in which a two parcel event was not factored for the 1989 roll. [QQ In respect of assessor\u2019s parcels 307-11-008 and 307-11-009, assessments were made for the years 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 increasing the values for the foregoing years. There is a notation \u2018Supplemental Deleted by SB-9581 prior to 2/89 Beyond Statute of Limitations.\u2019 Assessment calculations disclose that Wards Store, Wards TBA and a portion of common area parking have all been increased as a result of the change of ownership of Wards. The notations with respect to parcel 307-11-009 on the total property information form show an increase for 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 tax years, but bear the notation that \u2018Sup. Deleted by S.B. 9583 - Prior to 2/89: Beyond Statute of Limitations.\u2019 The assessment calculations which show an increase attributable to Wards LEOP 6/88 demonstrate how that calculation was made.

For parcel 020, the base year record, the notation is made that \u2018not timely for supplemental roll.\u2019 Increases are listed for years 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. There are set forth valuations commencing with 1989. The accompanying assessment calculations show a 6/23/88 reappraisal attributable to Wards change of ownership. [IQ 10. At the time set for hearing before the Assessment Appeals Board of the County of Santa Clara in connection with the applications of plaintiff, County Counsel did advise the Board and the Board did find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the legal issues relating to the limitations on making of assessments.

There the triggering event (a change in ownership) occurred on July 31, 1982. However, because there were no provisions for levying supplemental assessments at that time, the property was not reassessed until the following year. Thus, the assessor could seek back taxes for the first time in 1983, as that was the first year in which the property escaped taxation. Had the new rule allowing for supplemental assessments been in effect, the property could have been reassessed in 1982, and the assessor could have sought a supplemental assessment for that year (provided the assessor levied the supplemental assessment in a timely manner).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Exceptions were made (1) if the assessment was subject to a penalty assessment, in which case the limitations period was increased to six years, or (2) if the change in ownership or new construction went unrecorded and was not reported, in which case the limitations period was eight years. The statute\u2019s wording was slightly altered in 1994 and the eight-year limitations period was eliminated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\">On the other hand, where the error or an omission \u201cinvolves the exercise of an assessor\u2019s judgment as to value,\u201d the assessor may correct it \u201conly if it is placed on the current roll or roll being prepared, or is otherwise corrected, within four years after July 1 of the assessment year for which the base year value was first established.\u201d (\u00a7 51.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">PIaintiff purports to rely upon <em>Blackwell Homes, </em>quoting the following statement from our opinion: \u201cSince the property in this case was first underassessed in the 1983-1984 assessment year, the assessor had four years from July 1, 1983\u2014i.e., until July 1, 1987\u2014in which to levy escape assessments for the intervening years. Since the escape assessments here were levied before July 1, 1987, they were within the statutory period.\u201d <em>(Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1016.) Plaintiff surmises that \u201chad escape assessments been levied <em>after </em>July 1, 1987, such assessments would have been untimely.\u201d This, however, is not the case as we explained more fully in <em>Blackwell Homes. </em>Of the four intervening years, only the first would be beyond the statute of limitations set forth in section 532 if the assessor did not levy escape assessments until after July 1, 1987 (assuming the assessments were made by June 30, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Plaintiff also quotes the following language from our opinion: \u201cThus, we conclude that for all cases arising before the enactment of [section 51.5], the better rule to follow is to strictly adhere to the statutory language, permitting the levy of any escape assessment \u2018made within four years after July 1 of the assessment year in which the property escaped taxation or was underassessed.\u2019 (\u00a7 532.) The assessor may revise base year values and levy escape assessments for the preceding four years, but no others, no matter when the underassessment is discovered. The only reasonable exception to this rule should be in the situation where the assessor has already had one \u2018bite [at] the apple,\u2019 i.e., where he has once exercised his judgment as to value of the property and now wants to change his mind. In that situation, we agree with <em>Dreyer\u2019s </em>and current legislation that he should do it within four years or not at all.\u201d <em>(Blackwell Homes </em>v. <em>County of Santa Clara, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d at p. 1017.) Plaintiff points out, \"Thus, the Court of Appeal in <em>Blackwell Homes </em>recognized that some assessments may be permanently barred.\u201d Those assessments that may be permanently barred, however, are those where the assessor has already exercised his or her judgment as to value.
