J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALl\">This appeal involves the second prong of the question posed in <em>Stacy &amp; Witbeck, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1074 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 805] <em>(Stacy I):</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>whether a publication filed for a litigation and a nonlitigation purpose is privileged in both the judicial and administrative arenas. The publication in question is a contract claim for overages purportedly incurred on a public works project. In <em>Stacy I </em>we held that the litigation privilege did not bar use of the publication in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>administrative action to declare a contractor an irresponsible bidder due to its filing a false claim with the contracting municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Today we hold that the municipality can prosecute a judicial action under the False Claims Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on that same contract claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in favor of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">In May 1991, pursuant to its competitive bidding process, the City awarded Stacy a contract to construct a project known as Muni Metro System Castro No. 10 Double Crossover (the Muni Project). Clause 89 of the contract specified that as a prerequisite to entitlement to additional compensation \u201cfor the happening of any event, thing, occurrence, or other cause,\u201d the contractor must give written notice of the potential claim to the engineer, setting forth the reasons the contractor believes additional compensation will or may be due, the nature of the costs involved and, so far as possible, the amount of the potential claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Problems developed with the Muni Project. On December 5, 1991, Stacy served the City with a Government Code claim asking for damages for breach of contract. Breaches were described in general terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">Then, on January 14, 1992, Stacy submitted to the City a preliminary construction contract claim and request for equitable contract adjustment. In the cover letter Stacy explained that the city engineer advised the contractor that change order requests would be subject to a \u201cContract Claim\u201d procedure following project completion. Nonetheless, Stacy decided to submit a preliminary breakdown of damages \u201cbecause the multiplicity of Changes to the work made by the City has and is resulting in monumental extra cost. . . . We have made every effort to keep the City abreast of these changes and concomitant Potential Claims in accordance with the Change provisions of the Contract. [D In accordance with the early advice of the Engineer, we hereby submit a description of damages known at this time. . . . [JD This letter represents an effort on our part to avoid litigation by way of settling individual and collective issues through the process of negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">David Stacy, president of Stacy, testified in deposition that the City\u2019s manager for the job said any legitimate extra work would have to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>presented as a claim, and the parties would \u201csit down and negotiate.\u201d So, they \u201csubmitted a claim fastly [sz'c].\u201d And further: \u201cSo by sitting down, putting a claim in\u2014not for a legal claim, and this is exactly what I told in my deposition. That this claim was put there because we were directed by Mr. Highfill [from the City] to do it and they would look at it, we would get together and we would settle our differences, and this never happened.\u201d \u201cWe were directed by the city to submit our legitimate changes as a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Stacy sued the City in March 1992. The City cross-complained and, in its third amended pleading filed January 1993, alleged a cause of action under the FCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court granted summary adjudication in favor of Stacy on this cause of action, ruling that the alleged false claim was \u201cabsolutely privileged\u201d under Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b), because it was submitted to the City in anticipation of litigation. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">A. <em>The Litigation Privilege Is No Impediment to City\u2019s FCA Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The issue on appeal is whether the litigation privilege, found at Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> precludes the City\u2019s FCA cause of action. We conclude it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The absolute protection under section 47(b) covers any publication or statement \u201c(1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that [has] some connection or logical relation to the action.\u201d <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>786 P.2d 365].) Moreover, publications in the course of a judicial proceeding can include communications made <em>prior to </em>commencement of a lawsuit. <em>(Wilton </em>v. <em>Mountain Wood Homeowners Assn. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 565, 569 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The privilege furthers the policy of affording litigants and witnesses unimpeded access to our courts without fear of harassment from derivative tort suits. The assumption is that the external threat of liability will undermine the free communication so essential to the effective administration of justice. The privilege limits civil liability stemming from the protected communication, precluding the use of such communication as the basis for any tort action, save malicious prosecution. <em>(Silberg </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 213, 215-216; <em>Stacy I, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1090.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044], our Supreme Court extended the protective policy of section 47(b) to embrace suits for injunctive relief, including those seeking to enjoin statutory violations. (4 Cal.4th at pp. 1201-1203 [holding that the privilege sweeps broadly to immunize an effort to enjoin an unfair business practice under Business and Professions Code section 17204].) In so holding, the court acknowledged the conflicting policies at play, namely, the policy of permitting citizens to police the spectrum of \u201cunfair competition\u201d and that of affording litigants open access to the courts. The court came down on the side of the privilege, exhorting that \u201c[i]f the policies underlying section 47(b) are sufficiently strong to support an absolute privilege, the resulting immunity should not evaporate merely because the plaintiff discovers a conveniently different label for pleading what is in substance an identical grievance arising from the identical conduct as that protected by section 47(b).\u201d (4 Cal.4th at p. 1203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Defending the judgment, Stacy asserts that the section 47(b) shoe fits because the four <em>Silberg </em>criteria, quoted above, are met. We see it somewhat differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">As we pointed out in <em>Stacy I, </em>filing the contract claim <em>fulfilled two independent functions and served dual purposes. (Stacy I, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1090.) First, the filing was called for under clause 89 of the contract and, according to President Stacy, it was submitted pursuant to the early advice of the City\u2019s project engineer. Indeed, Stacy was \u201cdirected\u201d to submit its change order requests as a claim under the contract. This procedure had a life of its own wholly apart from any judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>On the other hand, the contract claim followed on the heels of Stacy\u2019s presentation to the City of its Government Code claim<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for material breaches of contract. Once that claim was \u201cdeemed rejected,\u201d Stacy initiated its breach of contract action for the alleged damages documented and detailed in the contract claim. In this sense the contract claim also served a litigation purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Unquestionably, had Stacy not pursued litigation against the City, it still would have had to present the contract claim for overages in order to receive any compensation above the contractual amount. Once it submitted the contract claim, the City would have a good faith reciprocal obligation to review and evaluate the claim to determine whether the contractor was entitled to the additional compensation set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Moreover, under the FCA, the prosecuting authority of a city or county <em>is obligated </em>to investigate diligently violations under the FCA\u2014including the presentation of false claims\u2014that involve that entity\u2019s funds. (\u00a7 12652, subd. (b)(1).) Upon finding a violation, the prosecuting authority <em>may </em>bring a civil action. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, even if Stacy had not sued the City, upon suspecting falsities in the claim, the City would have been obligated to undergo further investigation, with discretion to file its own suit. And, if the City failed to investigate, mandamus would lie to compel investigation and, in certain cases, perhaps to compel the exercise of discretion on the issue of whether to sue under the FCA or not. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1085, 1086.) Finally, the FCA is to \u201cbe liberally construed and applied to promote the public interest.\u201d (\u00a7 12655, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Where, as here, a public contractor delivers a contract claim for overages according to the administrative procedures prescribed by the contract and the public agency, that claim does not become privileged simply because the contractor also anticipated suing the agency for the sums detailed in the contract claim. The paper trail of contractual performance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>course of dealing between parties under a contract cannot be immunized from use in later judicial proceedings just because that paper trail is also a publication that serves a litigation purpose. If that same paper trail amounts to wrongful performance or conduct under the contract, it escapes section 47(b). The litigation privilege encompasses only the communicative act; it does not privilege tortious courses of conduct. <em>(Kimmel </em>v. <em>Goland </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 202, 211 [271 Cal.Rptr. 191, 793 P.2d 524]; <em>Stacy I, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th at p. 1091.)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Since the document in question wears both the conduct and publication hats, our task is more complicated than merely deciding whether the nonapplication of section 47(b) would dilute the healthy policy of crushing derivative tort actions. We must concern ourselves also with the rights, remedies and obligations of the other contracting party. These must be preserved, including rights and obligations emanating from the FCA. The litigation privilege was never meant to spin out from judicial action a party\u2019s performance and course of conduct under a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">B. <em>The FCA Applies to the Contract Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Amici curiae in support of Stacy<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> propose an alternative basis for affirming the judgment. They posit that \u201ccontract claims against public entities are expressly excluded from the application of the FCA.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Section 12651, subdivision (e), creates an exception to the list of acts that would subject persons to treble damages for filing a false claim. It states: \u201cThis section does not apply to claims, records, or statements made pursuant to Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810) of Title I . ...\u201d In other words, section 12651, subdivision (e) does not apply to claims under the Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Amici curiae call our attention to what appear to be consultant reports prepared in advance of committee hearings on the initial bill that ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>became the FCA. They urge us to consider these documents as indicia of legislative intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">First, we seriously question whether these reports are \u201cofficial acts\u201d of the Legislature which qualify them for discretionary judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c). Amici curiae cite no authority for such proposition, nor do they support the request with sufficient foundation to establish the credibility of the reports such that we could rely on them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, we do not find these reports to be reliable indicators of legislative intent. The identity and qualifications of the author are not clearly spelled out, the purpose for which they were prepared is not clearly delineated nor is there any statement concerning the extent, if any, of the legislators\u2019 reliance thereon. Third, the language of section 12651, subdivision (e) is without ambiguity and we have no need to further explore the intent of its authors. In other words, courts are not concerned with why the Legislature acted but, rather, with what the Legislature enacted; when the latter is clear, the former is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Straight and simple: under section 12651, subdivision (e), Stacy\u2019s Government Code claim cannot serve as the basis for action under the FCA. However, also straight and simple, the contract claim is not the Government Code claim. First, it was lodged with the City separately, after Stacy had filed its Government Code claim. Second, the Government Code claim is an independent item, with statutory requirements governing its contents. (\u00a7 910.) The contract claim does not begin to resemble the claim described in section 910. In particular, the section 910 claim must describe the damages or indebtedness <em>in general terms, </em>and where the claim is for more than $10,000, <em>no dollar amount should be included in the claim. </em>In contrast, the contract claim is comprised of pages and pages of detailed overages, with direct costs and indirect costs separately portrayed, numerous exhibits and a \u201cpreliminary quantum summary\u201d showing a claim to date of $790,277.22. This claim was required under the contract and course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>dealing between the parties and, while it served a litigation purpose as well, it clearly was not a claim, record or statement made pursuant to the Tort Claims Act. (\u00a7 12651, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The judgment is reversed. Parties to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Poch\u00e9, J., and Hanlon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 16, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-13\">As in <em>Stacy I, </em>defendant and appellant herein is City and County of San Francisco (City); plaintiffs and respondents are Stacy &amp; Witbeck, Inc., and Nationwide Construction Company, Inc.

(\u00a7\u00a7 12650, 12651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">Specifically, the eighth cause of action recited that in its contract claim Stacy contended that on a number of days, entire crews were prevented from working on the project because of the City\u2019s actions. According to the cross-complaint, on some of those days, Stacy asserted that crews \u201cwere precluded from working in excess of 24 hours in a period of time that is at maximum 24 hours. In some or all cases, any difficulties on the job site did not prevent a [szc] entire crew from working. The use of a \u2018crew hour\u2019 as the time standard for lost work constitutes a false claim as [Stacy] did not lose the ability to have some or all of the crew provide work services on the job when difficulties arose.\u201d Additionally, the eighth cause alleged that Stacy\u2019s application of a 5 percent mark-up for certain work attributed to the entire joint venture claim also constituted a false claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b27-12\">The statute provides: \u201cA privileged publication or broadcast is one made: [H ...

This is part of what is commonly referred to as the \u201cTort Claims Act\u201d found at section 810 et seq. (See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>San Francisco Redevelopment Agency </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 555, 557 [138 Cal.Rptr. 720, 564 P.2d 872]; Cal. Government Tort Liability Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 1992) \u00a7 2.1, pp. 69-70.) Under the act, and subject to certain exceptions not pertinent to this case, all claims for money or damages against a local public entity must be presented in accordance with the statutory provisions. (\u00a7\u00a7 905, 945.4.) Among other things, the claim must show the date, place and other circumstances of the transaction giving rise to the asserted claim, as well as a general description of the obligation, injury or damages. (\u00a7 910.) If, as was the case here, the amount of the claim exceeds $10,000, the claim shall not include a dollar amount. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It is only after the claim is acted upon or deemed to have been rejected by the governing body of the local entity that an action may be pursued in court.
