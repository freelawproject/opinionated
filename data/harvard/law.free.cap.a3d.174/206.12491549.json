On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly rejected his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Specifically, he asserts that his trial counsel, Richard Silverstein, rendered ineffective assistance because he (1) failed to meaningfully present and explain the state's pretrial plea offers and (2) failed to consult with or present an expert at the petitioner's trial regarding the extreme emotional disturbance defense. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the petitioner's claims. After a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of murder in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35, and criminal violation of a protective order in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-110b (a) (now \u00a7 53a-223).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner was sentenced to sixty years of incarceration for murder, one year concurrent for carrying a pistol without a permit, and one year concurrent for criminal violation of a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The petitioner's conviction was the subject of a direct appeal before this court.

Specifically, the petitioner alleged that Silverstein advised him to reject a thirty year plea agreement because he could win the case at trial. On the basis of this advice, he rejected the state's offer, went to trial, and was convicted. On June 18, 2015, the petitioner, represented by appointed counsel, filed an amended petition, in which he alleged that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel as a result of Silverstein's (1) deficient performance in plea negotiations and (2) failure to consult with an expert on the extreme emotional disturbance defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner first claimed that: \"(a) [Silverstein] failed to inform the petitioner that the state made a pretrial offer in an attempt to resolve the case; (b) [Silverstein] failed to meaningfully and adequately advise the petitioner with respect to the state's pretrial offer; (c) [Silverstein] rejected the state's pretrial offer without the authorization or consent of the petitioner; and/or (d) assuming [Silverstein] did relay the offer to the petitioner, he advised the petitioner to reject the offer and proceed to trial.\" The petitioner claimed that but for his counsel's deficient performance relating to the plea offers, \"there is a reasonable probability that ... the results of the proceedings would have been more favorable to [him] in that [he] would have accepted the state's offer, and the trial court would have imposed the sentence pursuant\n   to the offer.\" Second, the petitioner claimed that Silverstein pursued an unreasonable legal strategy in presenting the extreme emotional disturbance affirmative defense, more particularly, by \"fail[ing] to obtain the opinion of an expert or get the [petitioner] evaluated by an expert,\" and that this \"unreasonable legal strategy prejudiced the petitioner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The habeas trial was held on November 18, 2015, and March 2, 2016. The petitioner presented testimony from Silverstein, the prosecutor in the petitioner's criminal trial, Attorney James Dinnan, and the petitioner's expert in criminal defense, Attorney J. Patten Brown. The petitioner also testified. On June 21, 2016, the habeas court,\n   <em>\n    Oliver, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a written memorandum of decision denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, finding that the petitioner\n   had failed to prove that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel under the two-pronged test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

It wasn't independent of the relationship.\" From speaking with many people who knew the petitioner, Silverstein learned that \"he was in love with a woman who didn't love him, who was seeing other people, who had a child that he had a very close bond with, who he took care of, and that, in my mind, you know, he couldn't control the jealousy, the rage, the anger he was feeling towards her.\" On the basis of these interviews, Silverstein determined that he did not believe it would be prudent to call an expert witness when the petitioner and lay witnesses could testify to the same evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Silverstein was also concerned that the jury would look unfavorably on an expert who was paid to testify on the petitioner's behalf. He testified, \"I had a way, an idea how I was going to argue the case, and putting an expert up there who I'd pay to say that he is depressed is not going to help me or [the petitioner], in my mind.... [I]f you're calling an expert in on a psychological type of thing or to testify about extreme emotional distress ... they know I'm paying them. Their conclusions are, you know, if not borne out by the facts, don't really help and it gives the state's attorney an opportunity to get up there and say, you know: He calls in an expert who's now going to tell you that he acted under extreme emotional distress. He paid this expert. The expert saw him nine months after the incident. What else is the expert going to say?\" On the basis of this testimony, the habeas court properly\n   found that it was not objectively unreasonable for Silverstein to choose not to call an expert for the extreme emotional disturbance defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court's determination of reasonableness is also supported by the record, specifically, the testimony of Dinnan and Brown. When asked if the petitioner had\n   presented an expert in support of his extreme emotional disturbance defense, Dinnan testified, \"I don't recall any expert, which isn't unusual for that particular defense.\" When the court questioned him further on this, Dinnan responded: \"That's just my experience. They put on the facts surrounding it, the history of the particular relationship, and that's ... again, that's what I recall happening in this particular case.\" Furthermore, the habeas court was not persuaded by the testimony of the petitioner's expert, Brown, as he stated it was unreasonable for Silverstein to fail to consult an expert in this case, but admitted that he had never raised the defense at trial and had only used it during pretrial negotiations to advocate for a better deal for his client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The petitioner also claims that the defense itself was an unreasonable trial strategy, and that if Silverstein had consulted with an expert, he may not have pursued the defense at all. But, as Silverstein testified, \"it was the only defense he had,\" based on the strength of the evidence against the petitioner and the state's unwillingness to reduce the charge from murder to manslaughter. Facing this scenario, the habeas court found that Silverstein's decision to move forward with the extreme\n   emotional disturbance defense was a \"necessity, compelled by an offer of an unacceptably lengthy prison term based on compelling evidence of guilt.\" Therefore, we conclude that the habeas court's finding that \"the defense presented by underlying counsel was not unreasonable in light of all of the evidence\" was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even if Silverstein was deficient in his performance by failing to consult with an expert on the extreme emotional disturbance defense, the petitioner did not show that this allegedly deficient performance prejudiced him. \"It is well established that a petitioner in a habeas proceeding cannot rely on mere conjecture or speculation to satisfy either the performance or prejudice prong but must instead offer demonstrable evidence in support of his claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415835\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/142/53/#p59\">\n    142 Conn.

The petitioner has simply speculated that the result might have been different had Silverstein chosen to utilize an expert witness. We also note the substantial evidence in the record that would support the jury's guilty verdict. Specifically, the victim and the petitioner had a long history of domestic violence incidents, and witnesses testified at trial that the victim screamed in terror as the petitioner pursued her before shooting her five times at\n   close range.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kellman\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"443971\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/56/279/\">\n    56 Conn.

The petitioner subsequently confessed to firing the shots that killed the victim to numerous people, including members of the New Haven Police Department. On the basis of the strength of the evidence presented to the jury, we conclude that the petitioner has not met his burden of showing that the jury verdict might have been different without counsel's allegedly deficient performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we hold that the court's factual findings and legal conclusions are sufficiently supported by the record. We therefore hold that the court did not err in determining that the petitioner failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While the habeas pleadings refer to the petitioner as \"Carmine,\" the petitioner testified at the habeas trial that his first name is \"Carmi,\" and this court's direct appeal decision refers to him as \"Carmi.\" See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kellman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"443971\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/56/279/\">\n     56 Conn.
