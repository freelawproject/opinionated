The indictment was amended in June 1994 to charge eight counts of aggravated sexual battery, two counts of attempted aggravated sexual battery, and three counts of possession of child pornography for acts alleged to have occurred in 1993. In August 1994, Dietrich pleaded guilty to all of the amended counts and was sentenced to thirty years' incarceration followed by a period of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act (\"Virginia Act\") requires those convicted of a \"sexually violent offense\" to register for life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va.

Dietrich was released from prison after serving fifteen years of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March 2009, Dietrich moved to Maryland, where he completed his supervised probation. At that time, Maryland required registration for those offenders who met the definition of \"child sexual offender\" and who, before moving to Maryland, were required to register in another state for an offense occurring before July 1, 1995.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.

Specifically, Dietrich contends that the statute, as applied retroactively to him, violates his rights under Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Doe I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716866\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/535/\">\n    430 Md. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716866\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/430/535/\">\n    62 A.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State responds that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in its favor because at the time Dietrich moved to Maryland, the sex offender registration statute mandated registration for any child sex offender who was required to register in another state for an offense occurring before July 1, 1995. The State argues that because the lifetime registration requirement existed before Dietrich came to Maryland, he was on notice when he chose to move to Maryland\n   that he would be required to register as a sex offender for life in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 1995, the General Assembly first enacted the Maryland Act, which provided for a single classification of sex offenders,\n   and required that offenders register annually for ten years from the date of their release from prison. 1995 Md.

After moving to Indiana in 2012, Zerbe challenged his status as a sex offender as an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation of the Indiana Constitution because, at the time he committed the underlying offense, neither Michigan nor Indiana had adopted sex offender registration laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20Ind.%20Acts%202318\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Supreme Court of Indiana upheld Zerbe's registration requirement, holding that \"it is not Zerbe's\n   <em>\n    crime\n   </em>\n   that triggers his obligation to register as a sex offender in Indiana; rather, it is his\n   <em>\n    Michigan registry requirement\n   </em>\n   that does so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 370. (Emphasis in original). The court further explained that the scope of its analysis was limited to \"determining whether the 2006 definitional amendment to our Act imposes a punitive burden on Zerbe beyond that which the State of\n   Michigan has already imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To that end, the court concluded that, \"although the amended definition results in the affirmative obligation to notify another state government and in potential exposure to increased stigma, the significant responsibilities with respect to Zerbe's registration are merely maintained across state lines, to be fulfilled where he currently lives and works.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 371.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the present case, as in\n   <em>\n    Zerbe\n   </em>\n   , Dietrich was on notice of the Maryland registration requirement at the time he moved to Maryland. Because Dietrich was already under a lifetime registration requirement, the Maryland statute imposed no additional punishment on him. Accordingly, requiring Dietrich to comply with the Maryland sex offender statute is not an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Privileges and Immunities Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dietrich argues that requiring him to register as a sex offender in Maryland based solely on his obligation to register in\n   Virginia violates his right to interstate travel under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The State responds that Dietrich failed to include this argument in his complaint for declaratory relief, and accordingly, this issue is not preserved for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Rule 8-131(a) (\"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears ... to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dietrich's complaint in the circuit court alleged that the Maryland Act, as applied to him, violated Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and that the \"application of the October 1, 2010 law [to him] violates his procedural and substantive rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his opposition to the State's motion for summary judgment and cross-motion\n   for summary judgment, Dietrich raised the argument for the first time that the application of the Maryland Act to him violated his right to interstate travel guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A trial court's authority to act in a case is \"limited by the issues framed by the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Gatuso v.
