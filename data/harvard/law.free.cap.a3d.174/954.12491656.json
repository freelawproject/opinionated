At least, it should have been simple. The appellant, Lamont Jeffery Geiger, was convicted in the Circuit Court for Charles County by Judge Amy J. Bragunier, sitting without a jury, of theft pursuant to Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, Sect. 7-104. For penalty purposes, it was a theft of property with a\n   value of at least $1,000 but less than $10,000, pursuant to subsection 7-104(g)(i). The\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of the crime poses no problem. The problem is that of establishing criminal agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    The Basic Crime\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 23, 2015, Leanne Ayers, an employee of Southern Tire in Waldorf, received a telephone call from an individual, giving his name as Brian Johnson, requesting the purchase of four Continental tires. The caller gave a credit card number over the phone and used it to charge an $85 deposit for the tires, which were to be installed the following day. On the next day, June 24, the ostensible Mr. Johnson came in and had the four tires installed on his car. After the work was completed, the purchaser used the same card number used the day before to charge the remaining balance of $939.53. Because \"Mr. Johnson\" did not have a physical credit card on hand, he showed his ostensible North Carolina driver's license as identifying security. Ms. Ayers took and kept a photograph of that North Carolina driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the appellant's trial on September 8, 2016, Ms. Ayers identified the appellant as the ostensible Brian Johnson who purchased the tires from her on June 24, 2015. On cross-examination, she attested that her identification was one made with 99% certainty. It is not now challenged. It is only disparaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's second witness was Tiro Joson, who worked in the Accounts Receivable section for Southern Tire. He testified that on July 15, 2015 he received notice from the credit card company that the company was issuing a \"charge back\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   against Southern Tire for the $1024.53 on the credit charges of June 23 and 24, 2015. The credit card number had been fraudulently used. Southern Tire immediately notified the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the trial on September 8, 2016, the State also introduced, in addition to Ms. Ayers's identification of the appellant, a copy of the Maryland driver's license issued to the appellant in his proper name of Lamont Jeffery Geiger and showing his\n   photograph. It had also introduced a copy of the ostensible North Carolina driver's license bearing the name of Brian Johnson but showing a photograph of the appellant. Judge Bragunier found as a fact that the picture of \"Brian Johnson\" on the North Carolina license and the picture of Lamont Jeffery Geiger on the Maryland license depicted the same man, to wit, the appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the merits, it is not without significance that the appellant did not testify and that he offered neither any witnesses nor other evidence in his defense. Judge Bragunier did not hesitate in finding that the appellant was the criminal agent in this theft of property. The case was open and shut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We have rephrased the appellate challenge as essentially the two contentions\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. that the State used inadmissible hearsay evidence in establishing that there was no legitimate North Carolina driver's license issued to a Brian Johnson; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. that the State used inadmissible hearsay evidence in proving that a facial recognition analysis had identified the face on the North Carolina driver's license as that of the appellant, thereby revealing the appellant's name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    To Find Nothing Is To Discover Something\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The obvious first investigative step for Detective Matthew Kelly was to attempt to locate the \"Brian Johnson\" listed on the North Carolina driver's license. Ms. Ayers informed him that the picture on the license was that of the man who had purchased the tires. Accordingly, Detective Kelly presented the information on the ostensible North Carolina driver's license to the desk clerk at the Charles County Sheriff's Office. As a regular investigative resource, the Sheriff's Office has access to the databases kept by the motor vehicle administrations of various states, including that of North Carolina. With Detective Kelly looking on and supplying information, the clerk searched the North Carolina database. There had\n   been no driver's license issued in North Carolina for a Brian Johnson with the birthdate listed on the license. The license was a fake and a theft by deception had obviously been perpetrated on Southern Tire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The appellant's first contention grasps at straws. In the first place, he characterizes the negative information obtained from the database as inadmissible hearsay. It is not that. Maryland Rule of Procedure 5-803(b)(10) is very clear that among those things \"not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness\" is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (10)\n   <em>\n    Absence of Public Record or Entry\n   </em>\n   . Unless the circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness,\n   <em>\n    evidence in the form of testimony\n   </em>\n   or a certification in accordance with Rule 5-902\n   <em>\n    that a diligent search has failed to disclose a record, report, statement, or data compilation made by a public agency\n   </em>\n   , or an entry therein,\n   <em>\n    when offered to prove the absence of such a record or entry\n   </em>\n   or the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter about which a record was regularly\n   made and preserved by the public agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The search of a database which reveals the absence of a particular record is an event to which the searcher may testify directly. The testimony \"I searched and found nothing\" does not involve inadmissible hearsay. It is a recognized exception to the Rule Against Hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Detective Kelly Spoke For Himself\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The appellant next tries a variation on that theme. He poses a trial scenario that Judge Bragunier did not buy and that we do not buy. The appellant insists that the search of the North Carolina database was conducted not by Detective Kelly, even in part, but by the anonymous desk clerk at the Charles County Sheriff's Department exclusively. The appellant insists that the anonymous desk clerk, as an out-of-court declarant, simply reported to Detective Kelly that the search of the North Carolina database revealed no record of a Brian Johnson and that that assertion, therefore, was the sole source\n   of Detective Kelly's knowledge. The appellant's contention is that Detective Kelly later offered that out-of-court assertion by the desk clerk in court for the truth of the matter asserted. That, of course, would be hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As the appellant spins the story, Detective Kelly could well have been in another room. He was not. What the appellant is disinclined to accept is that the search of a database need not be a solo performance. Two or more might participate in a joint search. In a case of doubt, how many might qualify for having participated in a given search might be an issue of fact to be determined by the factfinder on the basis of the totality of the pertinent circumstances. Judge Bragunier found as a matter of fact that Detective Kelly jointly participated with the anonymous desk clerk in the search of the North Carolina database and that he was, therefore, fully competent to testify about it. That finding was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As Detective Kelly began to testify about the search of the database, appellant's counsel said that he was \"going to object if there is no personal knowledge, if it's the desk clerk.\" Judge Bragunier asked the prosecutor to \"just clear that up.\" The prosecutor did so.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Now, Detective Kelly, first, let's ... let's back up. This is the desk clerk in the Charles County Sheriff's Office station?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and the system ...\n   <em>\n    were you present at that time?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY:\n   <em>\n    Yes.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Alright,\n   <em>\n    were you there with this desk clerk?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY:\n   <em>\n    Yes.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and can you describe what specifically was being done?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: Um ... their computer system is a little bit different than ours, but\n   <em>\n    generally if we ever have a request, we'll stand with them at the front desk and just\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    explain what it is that we need checked. The information, we'll provide that to them\n   </em>\n   , and they will conduct the check and explain any findings that they have as a result of that search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and this is done ... you were ...\n   <em>\n    you were seeing the results of the search?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY:\n   <em>\n    Yeah, I was standing with the individual at the front desk.\n   </em>\n   I was not monitoring every single move that they made, but\n   <em>\n    I stood with them.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, okay, and this system ... this is a system that the\n   Charles County Sheriff's Office has, where the desk clerk was-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: One of the systems they utilize, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And does it access ... um ... department, or vehicles, or MVA of different states?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay, and was the search that you requested and there with, was that of North Carolina?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The appellant again objected, attempting to analogize the relationship between the anonymous clerk and Detective Kelly to the relationship between the doctor who performs an autopsy and a mere observer of the autopsy. The appellant again ignored the fact that Detective Kelly and the clerk both participated in the search of the North Carolina database. The clerk's fingers may have touched the keys on the keyboard, but it was the information dictated by Detective Kelly that guided the fingers on the keyboard and that guided the inquiry. Detective Kelly testified as to what he did, what he saw, and what he knew. He was no mere conduit for the anonymous clerk. Judge Bragunier agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   JUDGE BRAGUNIER: Well,\n   <em>\n    he can testify as to what he asked her to do, and what she did, and what [he] saw.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Detective Kelly was the indisputable source of the information that guided that search.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   JUDGE BRAGUNIER:\n   <em>\n    I'm going to allow him to say what he was looking for\n   </em>\n   , what he ... and\n   <em>\n    what was part of the investigation.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right, but the issue is, Your Honor, they're looking for something that is done out of state in North Carolina, you know?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   JUDGE BRAGUNIER: Okay,\n   <em>\n    it's part of their investigative tools. I'm going to allow it.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And so\n   <em>\n    there was a search made of\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    of what\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY:\n   <em>\n    The copy of the North Carolina driver's license that I was provided.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay ... um ... I am giving you back [the license].\n   <em>\n    Is that what you used in your search?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY:\n   <em>\n    That is correct.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Okay ... um ... what specifically?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: Um ...\n   <em>\n    I would have provided the front desk\n   </em>\n   ... um ...\n   <em>\n    clerk the name and the birth date of the individual, the state in which it was numbered, which is indicated near the top right side of the driver's license.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Judge Bragunier ruled that Detective Kelly was no stranger to the search of the North Carolina database and that he was competent to testify as to its negative result.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And\n   <em>\n    were you able to confirm or get a return on Brian Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the individual ... um ... in the ID copy on State's Exhibit Five?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY:\n   <em>\n    No.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Our holding that no error was committed by Judge Bragunier is reinforced by the fact that evidentiary rulings such as this are regularly entrusted to the wide, wide discretion of the trial judge. When what is involved is a judgment call on the field, appellate courts are routinely extremely deferential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    The Quintessence Of Harmlessness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Even if, purely\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , we were to assume that error had somehow occurred,\n   it would be hard to conceive of an error more harmless than this. Legally sufficient proof of the fraudulent deception that the appellant practiced on Southern Tire in furtherance of his theft of four automobile tires worth over $1,000 did not in the remotest way depend on the search of the North Carolina database. The false driver's license that the appellant gave to Leanne Ayers at Southern Tire\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   established the appellant's larcenous deception beyond any reasonable doubt. It contained his picture on an ostensible North Carolina driver's license coupled with the palpably false name of Brian Johnson. That act of deception would be beyond challenge even if a North Carolina database had never existed. Once it was known that the face on the North Carolina driver's license was the face of the appellant (as the factfinding judge found it to be), all else was benignly redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We note simply in passing that a finding of harmless error is, if anything, even easier to make in a case such as this, where there is not so much as a murmur of affirmative defense or even mitigation. It is in cases where the facts are hotly contested and where contradictory credibilities clash with one another that a trial error might readily shift the balance. In this case, nobody's credibility was even in issue. Procedural tiffs are of tamer stuff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   If any further minimization of harm were even possible, it would be in a case such as this where the verdict has been rendered not by a panel of twelve unpredictable jurors but by\n   a veteran trial judge sitting without a jury. In assessing the possible effect of an erroneous ruling on a factfinder, a volatile jury and a legally trained and steadfast judge are very different tribunals. That difference can be a decisive factor in harmless error analysis. We cannot imagine how the appellant here could genuinely believe that Judge Bragunier's verdict would have been different if a search of the North Carolina database had never been made. Leanne Ayers's identification of him and his picture on the fake driver's license told the entire story, a story the appellant never contested. In any event, we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Judge Bragunier's verdict of guilty would not have been different if no mention of the North Carolina database had ever been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Sitting In The Dock\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   It is difficult to decipher just what the second contention is actually contending. As the thief drove away from Southern Tire on June 24, 2015, with $1,000 worth of stolen tires, his identity was unknown. As he sat in the dock of the Charles County Courthouse on September 8, 2016, however, the thief was indisputably identified as Lamont Jeffery Geiger, the appellant. How did this change from unknown to known come about? Both the testimony of the deceived saleslady, Leanne Ayers, and the photograph on the fake driver's license the thief had used at the scene solidly established that the tire-stealing thief and the defendant in the dock were one and the same. The investigative odyssey by way of which the unknown became the known and by way of which the defendant came to be sitting in the dock, albeit narratively interesting perhaps, was legally immaterial. If the man sitting in the dock did it, we really don't need to know how he came to be sitting in the dock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   How do the police routinely discover an unknown criminal's identity? Or his whereabouts? With Elizabeth Barrett Browning, let us count the ways. Perhaps a police \"hotline\" receives a tip, anonymous or otherwise, from a good citizen. Perhaps the police, by cash or other inducement, pay for a tip from a\n   snitch, to wit, a confidential informant. Perhaps the crime victim randomly spots the culprit on a crowded street or in Times Square on New Year's\n   Eve. Perhaps the fugitive becomes an instant celebrity by winning the lottery. Perhaps it is the prescience of a Gypsy fortune-teller or the wisdom of the tea leaves. Perhaps it is just dumb luck. Or perhaps law enforcement has available to it, as does Maryland in the present case, latter-day facial profiling technology. Like Shakespeare's Cleopatra, Dame Fortune is possessed of \"infinite variety\" in how she points her finger at the avatar of guilt. The point is that the\n   <em>\n    modus operandi\n   </em>\n   just doesn't matter. Even if reading the entrails of birds is a questionable technique for identifying a suspect, a suspect thus identified most assuredly does not go free.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The law's essential indifference to such finger-pointing happenstance enjoys a long pedigree, reaching back into the first presidency of Grover Cleveland. In\n   <em>\n    Ker v. Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299948\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/436/\">\n    119 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299948,8299741\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/7/225/\">\n    7 S.Ct. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299948\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/436/\">\n    30 L.Ed. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1886), Ker was ultimately convicted of larceny in Chicago. Before the United States Supreme Court, he claimed that he had been denied due process of law when he was \"forcibly and with violence\" kidnapped from Lima, Peru and brought to stand trial in Illinois. The Supreme Court was emphatic that the due process inquiry was tightly focused within the four corners of the Illinois trial transcript and was unconcerned with the antecedent events by which Ker was brought to Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The 'due process of law' here guarantied is complied with when the party is regularly indicted by the proper grand jury in the state court, has a trial according to the forms and modes prescribed for such trials, and when, in that trial and proceedings, he is deprived of no rights to which he is lawfully entitled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299948\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/119/436/\">\n    119 U.S. at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8299948,8299741\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/7/225/\">\n    7 S.Ct. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Even conceded irregularities in the antecedent procedure of the authorities would be of no avail to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    [F]or mere irregularities in the manner in which he may be brought into custody of the law, we do not think he is\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    entitled to say that he should not be tried at all for the crime with which he is charged in a regular indictment.\n   </em>\n   He may be arrested for a very heinous offense by persons without any warrant, or without any previous complaint, and brought before a proper officer; and this may be, in some sense, said to be 'without due process of law.'

A photograph of a face, such as the one from the fake North Carolina driver's license in this case, is fed into the system. The system then compares that photograph with the thousands or even millions of known faces already in the system, as it searches for a counterpart. It is akin to computerized searching for identical fingerprints. Precisely how the computer does this is something well beyond our ken. There is no suggestion, however, that these computerized identification methodologies are not now perfectly reliable investigative tools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Reliability does not matter, however, because the computerized identification is not ultimately evidence in court. It is simply a guide to put the investigator on the right track. The only evidentiary identification that mattered was the one-on-one identification made in the courtroom between the face on the fake North Carolina driver's license and the face on the appellant's known Maryland driver's license or, perhaps, the comparison between the face on the fake North Carolina driver's license and the face of the defendant sitting in the dock. That was the evidence that was before Judge Bragunier in her factfinding capacity. She was never asked to rely upon the computerized identification. How Detective Kelly found his\n   way to the appellant's Maryland driver's license, therefore, was immaterial. That license spoke for itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Detective Kelly himself did not testify in any way about facial profiling technology. The State never questioned him about such technology. Information about facial profiling technology, against which the appellant rails now as fatally contaminating, did not come from the mouth of Detective Kelly. It came only from the mouth of defense counsel. The entire subject was mentioned only by defense counsel in the course of arguing to the court. If Judge Bragunier was influenced by repeated references to such technology, it was defense counsel who did the referencing. The State never mentioned the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Instead of allowing Detective Kelly to proceed, as the law clearly directs, on the basis of \"information received,\" defense counsel continued to insist that there must be a full explanation as to how the \"information received\" was generated and by whom.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: So, Your Honor ... Your Honor,\n   <em>\n    he has no personal knowledge, nor can he tell the Court how he generated this information, he can only rely on what somebody else did.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   And that's where we are today, it's just ... there is no link, no connection. Nobody is testifying as to how that information was generated. The State is just giving you a picture of a Motor, you know, a Motor Vehicle picture and saying, \"Well, you know, this is what he did.\" And\n   <em>\n    we don't have all the other pictures that were generated\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The State replied, \"The way that the suspect was developed in this case is completely irrelevant.\" Judge Bragunier agreed with the State and overruled appellant's objection. In this, we see no error. Every mention of facial profile technology was made by the appellant and not by the State. Virtually every even indirect allusion to it was made by the appellant and not by the State. Only a trial judge, of course, can commit reversible error, and the appellant does not identify any ruling\n   by Judge Bragunier that constitutes reversible error. All we have is undifferentiated angst.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    Harmless Error Redux\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Even if, again purely\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , Judge Bragunier committed some conceivable error in dealing with how Detective Kelly came to locate the appellant, such presumptive error would have been transcendently harmless. We are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that even if Judge Bragunier had never had an inkling as to how Detective Kelly had been led to the appellant's Maryland driver's license, her verdict of guilty would have been precisely the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    A Reader's Guide To\n    <em>\n     Zemo v.

The appellant objects to Detective Kelly's testimony at two different levels, and we will respond with respect to each. At the initial admissibility level, the appellant objected to the admissibility of the search made of the North Carolina database that revealed that the driver's license used by the appellant to perpetrate his theft by deception had been a fake. In addition to contending that the search of the database had been conducted by the clerk of the Charles County Sheriff's Office acting alone and not in conjunction with Detective Kelly, the appellant, in reply brief, argues strenuously that the search violated the Rule Against Hearsay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    In order for the hearsay exception to apply, Md.

Kelly's testimony that he was \"standing with the individual at the front desk,\"\n   </em>\n   and \"I was not monitoring every single move that they made,\"\n   <em>\n    is not equivalent to Det.

In this case, by stark contrast, 1) the information that the North Carolina license presented to the theft victim was a fake and 2) the identification of the anonymous thief as the appellant were both highly relevant matters as to which evidence would have been admissible. What Detective Augerinos introduced in\n   <em>\n    Zemo\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, was irrelevant and inadmissible. What Detective Kelly introduced was properly in the present case.

The appellant refers to this testimony's having happened over the course of six pages of the trial transcript. We have examined these pages and find that this phase of the State's case did, indeed, stretch over 129 lines of transcript. Detective Kelly, however, only got to speak 39 of those lines and seven of those 39 lines consisted only of a monosyllabic \"Yes\" or \"No.\" The rest was procedural wrangling among the defense attorney, the prosecuting attorney, and the trial judge. Detective Kelly sat quietly and modestly in the eye of that forensic hurricane. No Greek chorus was he. This quantitative analysis, moreover, is one above and beyond the other disparity that Detective Kelly's testimony in this case was admissible whereas Detective Augerinos's testimony in\n   <em>\n    Zemo\n   </em>\n   was inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   With respect to the State's use of facial profiling technology, to any insight into how such technology works, or to the significance of any identification made by the technology, Detective Kelly was interrupted in mid-sentence almost before he began.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Is there anything else that you did in terms of this investigation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   DETECTIVE KELLY: Yes, I made contact with ... a crime analyst, Mr. Rodriguez ...

Detective Kelly never even got to mention the name or the subject of facial profiling technology or to describe its modality in any way.

The testimony of Detective Augerinos in\n   <em>\n    Zemo\n   </em>\n   and of Detective Kelly in this case are in no way analogues of each other.
