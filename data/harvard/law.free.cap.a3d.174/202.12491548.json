After further review, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are pertinent to our decision. At trial, the court gave the following instruction to the jury concerning reasonable doubt: \"The meaning of reasonable doubt can be arrived at by emphasizing the word reasonable.\n   <em>\n    It is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture.\n   </em>\n   It is not a doubt raised by anyone simply for the sake of raising a doubt.\n   <em>\n    It is such a doubt as in serious affairs that concern you, you would pay attention to; that is, such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance.\n   </em>\n   It is not a hesitation springing from any feelings of pity or sympathy for the accused or any other person who might be affected by your decision.\n   <em>\n    It is, in other words, a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has ... its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence.\n   </em>\n   It is doubt that is honestly entertained and is reasonable in light of the evidence after a fair comparison and careful examination of the entire evidence.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant claims that the following portions of that instruction constitute plain error: that reasonable doubt \"is not a surmise, a guess or mere conjecture\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   that \"[i]t is such a doubt as in serious affairs that concern you, you would pay attention to; that is such a doubt as would cause reasonable men and women to hesitate to act upon it in matters of importance\"; and that it is \"a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt that has ... its foundation in the evidence [or] lack of evidence.\" The defendant also claims that the cumulative effect of these portions of the\n   instruction constitutes plain error. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error first must determine if the error is indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily [discernible] on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable. ... This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record. Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application. ... [T]he plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... [I]n addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate. A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice. ... [Previously], we described the two-pronged nature of the plain error doctrine: [An appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] ... unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that, [t]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes\n   in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment ... for reasons of policy. ... Put another way, plain error review is reserved for only the most egregious errors. When an error of such a magnitude exists, it necessitates reversal.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489138\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/221/#p812\">\n    324 Conn. at 812-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After reviewing the defendant's claim against this standard, we conclude that it is without merit because it is well settled that the trial court's instruction on reasonable doubt did not constitute plain error, let alone error.
