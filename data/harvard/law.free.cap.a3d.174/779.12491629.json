More specifically, we consider\n   whether an easement that affords ingress and egress to an abutting property can later be expanded, by necessity, for utilities. The plaintiff, William Francini, commenced the present action seeking, inter alia, a judgment declaring that he is entitled to an easement by necessity for underground utility lines across the property of the named defendant, Goodspeed Airport, LLC, and an injunction permitting use of the easement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which reversed trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Appellate Court's opinion and the record contain the following facts and procedural history. \"The following facts, as alleged by the plaintiff and admitted by the defendant, are not in dispute for the purpose of this motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff owns a parcel of land in East Haddam. The parcel's only access to a public highway is over an abutting property, owned by the defendant. [Both properties were originally part\n   of a single parcel of land, subsequently divided into many parcels for residential use and conveyed through a series of transfers over the years to various individuals or entities.] The defendant took title to its property by warranty deed in 1999, subject to a right-of-way easement now enjoyed by the plaintiff as well as several of the plaintiff's neighbors, landowners who also own land abutting the defendant's property. The 1999 warranty deed expressly described the right-of-way, in general terms and without limitations on its use, by providing for '[s]uch rights as others may have to a [right-of-way] over a passway or driveway as set forth in a deed from [the property's prior owner], dated August 16, 1963 and recorded in ... the East Haddam [l]and [r]ecords ....'\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"In 2001, the defendant entered into an agreement with several of the plaintiff's neighbors, who also share the plaintiff's right-of-way across the defendant's property, to allow the neighbors to improve the right-of-way by installing and maintaining a utility distribution system under the existing right-of-way easement. As a result, a commercial utility system was constructed under the existing right-of-way and now provides electricity to the plaintiff's neighbors. In exchange for this utility easement, each of the plaintiff's neighbors paid the defendant $7500. The plaintiff offered to pay the defendant the same $7500 that his neighbors had paid for use of the utility easement, but the defendant requested that the plaintiff not only pay the $7500, but also grant it the power to move the location of the easement at will. The plaintiff declined the additional terms and the two parties never reached an agreement. Without an agreement, the plaintiff does not enjoy an easement for commercial utilities and his property is\n   currently landlocked from access to commercial electricity. Currently, the plaintiff's house is powered by a generator, but the generator is alleged to be insufficient to run and maintain the basic\n   requirements of the plaintiff's house such as powering security devices, turning on automatically in the event of a flood, and running a refrigerator to preserve perishable food without constant operation of the generator.\" (Footnote added.)\n   <em>\n    Francini\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goodspeed Airport, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20Conn.%20App.%20279\">\n    164 Conn.

The trial court granted the defendant's motion, and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court determined that, although there was no precedent in this state favoring the grant of an easement by necessity for commercial utilities, the prior language of this court regarding easements by necessity, multiple treatises on the subject, and precedent from other jurisdictions throughout the country support expanding the scope of easements by necessity to include commercial utilities.

In reaching this conclusion, the Appellate Court did not specify the appropriate test to be used by the trial court to determine whether an easement by necessity existed. Instead, the Appellate Court concluded that easements by necessity for utilities are permissible, generally, and that \"the facts as alleged by the plaintiff, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and undeveloped by any evidence, prevent the defendant from prevailing on its motion [for summary judgment].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%201278\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. \"The standard of review of a trial court's decision granting summary judgment is well established.

The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... Our review of the trial court's\n   decision to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment is plenary....

Although this court has never directly addressed this question, it has recognized the broader principle that an easement by necessity may arise from a reasonable, but not strict, necessity. See\n   <em>\n    Hollywyle Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hollister\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1957194\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/164/389/#p398\">\n    164 Conn. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20A.2d%20247\">\n    324 A.2d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Consistent with this broad principle, scholarly treatises generally agree that the scope of an easement by necessity includes those uses that are for the beneficial enjoyment of the property. See J. Bruce &amp; J. Ely, Law\n   of Easements and Licenses in Land (2017) \u00a7 8:7, p. 8-32; R. Powell, Real Property (M. Wolf ed., 2017) \u00a7\u00a7 34.07 and 34.13, pp. 34-45 and 34-149; G. Thompson, Real Property (J. Grimes ed., 1980) \u00a7 336, pp. 419-23; 25 Am.

The commentary to this section discusses the policy rationales for easements by necessity, specifically, promoting the effective use of land and giving effect to the presumed intent of the parties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20A.2d%20247\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   comment (a), pp. 203-204. The commentary further observes that the rights necessary for the enjoyment of property are normally related to access to the property; however, it further provides: \"a servitude will be implied to do whatever is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of property, if the conveyance would otherwise\n   eliminate the property owner's right to do those things.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20A.2d%20247\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   comment (b), pp. 204-205. The commentary also specifically addresses the scope of an easement of necessity beyond just access to property, providing: \"[U]ntil recently, access for foot and vehicular traffic tended to be the only rights regarded as necessary for the enjoyment of surface possessory estates. However, the increasing dependence in recent years on electricity and telephone service, delivered through overland cables, justif [ies] the conclusion that implied servitudes by necessity will be recognized for those purposes. Whether access for other utilities and services has also become necessary to reasonable enjoyment of property depends on the nature and location of the property and normal land uses in the community.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20A.2d%20247\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   comment (d), p. 208.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Support for this view is also reflected in case law of other jurisdictions that have recognized easements by necessity for utilities, especially where a preexisting right-of-way existed. The earliest case involving a utility easement by necessity was\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jefferson County Telephone Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8634370\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/82/357/\">\n    82 W.

In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , several property owners utilized a shared right-of-way, and one of these owners wished to construct telephone lines along that easement for his own use. Id., at 358,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.%201042\">\n    95 S.E. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff in that case, the property owner of the servient estate, challenged the construction of the telephone lines, claiming that the initial grant of the right-of-way did not also give that owner the right to construct utility lines.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.%201042\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals examined the necessity of having electricity as follows: \"If then those living in a rural district with only such unlimited private ways as that involved here are to enjoy any of the modern conveniences, such as electric light, natural gas, telephones, and the like, they must of necessity rely upon such ways by which to obtain them. To deny them such right would be\n   to stop to some extent the wheels of progress, and invention, and finally make residence in the country more and more undesirable and less endurable.\" Id., at 360,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.%201042\">\n    95 S.E. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Insofar as the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   also challenged the additional burden on the original right-of-way due to digging and installing telephone poles, the court observed that there was no additional burden on the land so long as it was reasonable to do so and in accordance with private, rather than public, use. Id., at 360-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20S.E.%201042\">\n    95 S.E. 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland has also determined that an easement by necessity may permit modifications and repairs to property in order to conform to modern conditions. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Tong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2282024\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/152/398/\">\n    152 Md. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.%20822\">\n    136 A. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1927), the plaintiff had obtained a lease for a portion of a building in Baltimore that he attempted to adapt into a restaurant, but needed to modify gas lines that passed through another tenant's property. Although the court observed that easements by necessity \"are more familiarly met [within] rights of way ... they are not confined to such rights.\" Id., at 402,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.%20822\">\n    136 A. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court looked to the purpose for which the original right or easement was established and held: \"Whenever it has arisen from necessity it would seem to be [coextensive] with the reasonable needs,\n   present and future, of the dominant estate for such a right or easement, and to vary with the necessity, [insofar] as may be consistent with the full reasonable enjoyment of the servient tenement.\" Id., at 405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.%20822\">\n    136 A. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Electricity is largely used for power and light and for the operation of refrigerating and labor-saving machines on farms and in farm homes, and that its use contributes to the full and profitable enjoyment of a farm can hardly be doubted.\" Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Dowgiel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"473175\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/359/448/#p460\">\n    359 Pa. 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20115\">\n    59 A.2d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also permitted an easement by necessity for utilities along an express right-of-way.

Such a use is in this modern era one of the ordinary purposes of such a way ....

The rationale among these jurisdictions is to support the continued use of property, while also giving effect to the intent of the parties when granting the original conveyance for the beneficial enjoyment of the property owner. This rationale is consistent with our own precedent regarding the creation of easements by necessity, which likewise recognizes the importance of allowing the productive use of property and accomplishing its intended use. See\n   <em>\n    Deane\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kahn\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20157\">\n    317 Conn. at 176-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.3d%20259\">\n    116 A.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When an easement of physical access already exists, an expansion of that easement will be allowed so long as it is reasonably necessary\n   for the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant estate and does not unreasonably impair the servient estate owner's beneficial enjoyment of his or her property.\n   <em>\n    New York Central Railroad Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yarian\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1692168\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/219/477/#p485\">\n    219 Ind. at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20N.E.2d%20604\">\n    39 N.E.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Tong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2282024\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/152/398/\">\n    152 Md. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.%20822\">\n    136 A. 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jefferson County Telephone Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8634370\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/82/357/\">\n    82 W.

First, it fairly accounts for the expectations of both property owners as to the general use of the property.

Second, it furthers public policy insofar as it assumes that the parties reasonably would not have intended for the land to be left incapable of being put to beneficial use. See\n   <em>\n    Hollywyle Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hollister\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20A.2d%20247\">\n    324 A.2d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the presumption as to the intent of the parties is a fiction of law ... and merely disguises the public policy that no land should be left inaccessible or incapable of being put to profitable use\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although prior use of the property may evidence the parties' intentions, when the original conveyance was made long before the advent of modern utilities, such as electricity, a question arises as to whether the parties could have intended for the property's future use to include such developments.

The defendant substantially relies upon\n   <em>\n    Deane\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kahn\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20157\">\n    317 Conn. at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.3d%20259\">\n    116 A.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and its predecessors. Simply put, those cases relate to a different question, namely, the right to physical access for ingress and egress when no easement previously exists. Such physical access, by its very nature, involves a substantial infringement on the rights of the owner of the servient estate. An expansion of an existing easement to accommodate additional use for the beneficial enjoyment of property is of a different nature. It is true that our case law has restricted the granting of easements by necessity to property that is truly landlocked; however, as explained previously in this opinion, this court has never been presented with a situation involving an easement by necessity for commercial utilities over a preexisting right-of-way easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For similar reasons, we also disagree with the defendant that the court must necessarily engage in an analysis of whether other substitutes exist to provide utilities to the dominant estate. In\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533363\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/107/32/#p38\">\n    107 Conn. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=139%20A.%20348\">\n    139 A. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court stated that if the cost of finding another substitute to access the parcel would exceed the value of the property, then an easement by necessity could be granted. In\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , this court emphasized the proportionality of the cost when finding a suitable substitute, and that an easement will be granted only if a substitute could be obtained at a disproportionate cost. Id., at 38,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=139%20A.%20348\">\n    139 A. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When an easement by necessity for utilities is being considered, however, it would not be prudent to examine the cost of finding a substitute compared to the overall value of the property-the cost of obtaining access to utilities would rarely, if ever, exceed the value of the property. This is in accord with many other jurisdictions that have examined this same issue, and avoids the thorny evaluation of cost and how it relates to the value of the property.

Nonetheless, the availability of alternative reasonable methods of obtaining utilities for the dominant estate may be relevant, as such considerations could bear on the question of reasonable necessity in some cases-for example, examining the need for cable lines where satellite would provide the same services without intruding on the servient estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Applying the foregoing standards to the present case, we conclude that the motion for summary judgment should have been denied. Taking all evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, the plaintiff, we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether an easement by necessity over the defendant's property\n   should be granted for the installation of commercial utilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is without question that the plaintiff's property was, and is, intended to be used as a residential lot, simply from the surrounding lots and the residential character of the neighborhood. Even if the original conveyance did not anticipate the availability of modern conveniences, easements by necessity for utilities can accommodate those needs reasonably necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of property in the modern era. The defendant has proffered no evidence at this stage to demonstrate that it would be burdened by granting the easement, as it appears that the plaintiff need only connect to an existing electrical conduit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Indeed, although we conclude that the trial court should not have rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant because a genuine issue of material fact exists, we make no determination as to whether the plaintiff has satisfied his burden of establishing that he is entitled to an easement by necessity for utilities. The record at this stage in the proceedings is inadequate to make that determination. On remand, the trial court must make factual determinations about the intent of the parties regarding the use of the property at the time of severance, the relative enjoyment of the respective properties, and the burden that would be placed on those properties by the easement. The court should then balance those factors in order to determine the overall costs and benefits to the parties and arrive at an equitable solution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The complaint names seven additional defendants who reside on certain nearby properties.

Indeed, the first Restatement of Property did not distinguish the two types of easements, but instead provided a list of varying factors to consider with implied easements generally.

We disagree. Although these cases arose in the context of a preexisting right-of-way, they stand for the proposition that access to utilities is indeed necessary in modern times, and examine the scope of the original easement in relation the purpose for which the dominate estate was intended to be used.

Although we agree that the line between the two kinds of implied easements has been blurred, the intent of the parties and the beneficial use of property are still key components of both types of easements. The distinction between the two arises from the way the intent is determined: by examination of the express terms of the deed in cases of easements by implication, and by examination of the presumed intent of the parties by the circumstances of the conveyance in cases of easements by necessity.
