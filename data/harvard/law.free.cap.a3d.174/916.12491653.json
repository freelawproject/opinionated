Harrell, Jr. (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Harrell, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellant, Michael Foy, complains here that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City remanded erroneously his employment disciplinary case to Baltimore City Division of Pretrial Detention and Services (DPDS) Commissioner, John S. Wolfe, to conduct a second penalty increase meeting. Foy contends that remand to the Commissioner is inappropriate and that the Commissioner's prior decision to terminate him as a prison guard be reversed, without further administrative proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   He asserts Commissioner Wolfe abridged his rights under the Correctional Officers' Bill of Rights\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (COBR)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   when the Commissioner increased to termination the Baltimore City Department of Corrections' Hearing Board's (Hearing Board) recommended lesser punishment, without conducting a timely and proper on-the-record penalty increase meeting, and thus violated Md. Code (1999, 2017 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii) of the Correctional Services Article (Corr. Servs.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The circuit court (in its remand order) found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [Commissioner] Wolfe failed to satisfy the final portion of [Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii) ] when the audio equipment failed to capture [Appellant's penalty increase meeting] on the record[,] ... [and] a substantial right of [Appellant's] has been prejudiced when the penalty increase hearing, due to the failure of\n   the audio recording equipment, was not captured on the record ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this appeal, Appellant poses the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I. Did Appellee [Commissioner Wolfe] violate Appellant's Rights under the COBR when he increased the recommended penalty of the Hearing Board without recording the penalty increase [meeting]; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   II. Did the circuit court err in remanding the case to conduct another penalty increase [meeting]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Foy contends that Appellees violated the COBR when Commissioner Wolfe failed to follow the mandatory requirements of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the course of increasing Appellant's disciplinary punishment. Specifically, Commissioner Wolfe failed to \"allow[ ] [Appellant] to be heard on the record\" by neglecting to capture the contents of the only penalty increase meeting convened and, in place of such a record, tendering an uncompliant alternative \"record.\" The window of opportunity for enhancing the Hearing Board's recommended sanction closed once Commissioner Wolfe failed to comply with Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii) within the time frame allowed by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its initial response to this judicial review action on appeal, Appellees filed with this court a motion to dismiss asserting that the circuit court's order of remand was not an appealable final judgment because the remand contemplated further administrative proceedings. On the merits, Appellees argue that Commissioner Wolfe acted in good faith and complied substantially with the requirements of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   His good faith efforts at substantial compliance are represented by a memorandum memorializing what, according to his recollection, was said at the uncaptured penalty increase meeting and his attempts to reschedule the meeting within the allowed timeframe, presumably to rectify the recording equipment malfunction that occurred earlier. In addition, Appellees point also to a lack of any prejudice suffered by Appellant due to the absence of a formal recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We deny Appellees' motion to dismiss. We hold that Appellant's COBR rights were violated. Moreover, the circuit court remanded erroneously Appellant's case to Commissioner Wolfe to conduct a second, but untimely on-the-record meeting. The proper remedy is to reinstate the Hearing Board's penalty recommendation as the final administrative action (the computation of back-pay aside) under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statement of Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On 12 January 2014, Foy, a Lieutenant at the Baltimore City Detention Center (BCDC), was accused of using excessive force against a BCDC inmate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On 10 April 2014, the BCDC issued to Foy a notice of disciplinary charges recommending his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Foy appealed to the Hearing Board. The Hearing Board found Foy guilty of ten of twelve disciplinary charges brought against him. The Hearing Board\n   recommended that his penalty be reduced to a \"Transfer to Baltimore City Booking and Intake Center &amp; Demotion to Sergeant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Commissioner Wolfe received a copy of the Hearing Board's recommendation on 23 November 2015. He reviewed the administrative record made to that date, found the Hearing Board's penalty inadequate, and proposed to increase Foy's punishment under Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6). On 9 December 2015, the Commissioner conducted a penalty increase meeting with Foy and his counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the meeting, Commissioner Wolfe discovered that the audio recording equipment used to make a verbatim record of the meeting malfunctioned, failed to capture what was said at the meeting, as required by Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii). The Commissioner notified promptly Foy's counsel of the equipment failure. The Commissioner and Appellant's counsel agreed to reconvene, with Foy, on 17 December 2015 for another attempt at holding a recorded meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On 10 December 2015, Commissioner Wolfe memorialized his recollection of what transpired at the unrecorded penalty increase meeting in a written memorandum to Stephen T. Moyer, Secretary of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Foy's counsel confirmed with Commissioner Wolfe's office to hold a remedial penalty increase meeting on 16 December 2015. Later that day, however, Commissioner Wolfe canceled,\n   without explanation, the meeting. Commissioner Wolfe made no further effort to reschedule a meeting. Rather, on December 16, Commissioner Wolfe, with the permission of Secretary Moyer, increased the Hearing Board's recommended punishment of Foy from \"Transfer to Baltimore City Booking and Intake Center &amp; Demotion to Sergeant\" to termination of his employment. Foy filed an action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, arguing solely that the Commissioner violated his rights under the COBR when he increased the Hearing Board's recommended punishment without recording the penalty increase meeting. Foy requested the circuit court to rescind Commissioner Wolfe's increased penalty, re-impose the Hearing Board's recommended penalty, and reinstate\n   him accordingly, with commensurate back pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The circuit court found, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   That an error of law occurred at the penalty increase hearing when the audio recording equipment failed and there was no audio record of the meeting; and it is further found ... [that Commissioner] Wolfe failed to satisfy the final portion of [Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii) ] when the audio equipment failed to capture the hearing on the record ... and a substantial right of [Foy] has been prejudiced when the penalty increase hearing ... was not captured on the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a result, the circuit court ordered that \"this case be remanded for the purpose of conducting another penalty increase meeting so that a complete record of the administrative proceeding is available for the [c]ourt on [j]udicial [r]eview.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Appellees' Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellees move to dismiss this appeal on \"the grounds that [we] lack [ ] jurisdiction over this matter because the order appealed from is not a final judgment.\" They aver that Appellant has not been put out-of-court by the remand order from\n   which he sought judicial review. As such, Appellant cannot satisfy the critical requirement for an appealable final judgment. The circuit court ordered a remand for the appointing authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   to conduct another penalty increase meeting so that a complete record might be available for any further judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    b. Appellant's Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Appellant responds that the circuit court's remand order was authorized by Md. Code (1984, 2014 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 10-222(h)(1) of the State Government Article (State Gov't), and is an appealable final judgment under\n   <em>\n    Metro Maint. Sys. S., Inc. v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Milburn\n   </em>\n   , remands ordered pursuant to State Gov't \u00a7 10-222(h) are appealable immediately because the order terminates the judicial proceeding, and denies the parties any means of further prosecuting or defending the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    c.

As in\n   <em>\n    Milburn\n   </em>\n   , here the circuit court's findings are premised on a similar basis, in part. They lack any discernable conclusions of law or findings of fact. Rather, the circuit court appeared to profess an inability to assess the merits of Commissioner\n   Wolfe's conclusion to fire Foy, in light of the unrecorded penalty increase meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Appellees' life raft leaks, however. The sole dispute before the circuit court and here is not over whether the conclusion Commissioner Wolfe reached was supported by substantial evidence, but rather whether the process utilized to reach it violated Foy's COBR rights. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Milburn\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court here made clear findings on the merits of Appellant's sole appellate claim. Most notably, the circuit court found that \"\n   <em>\n    an error of law\n   </em>\n   occurred\n   at the penalty increase hearing\" and \"Commissioner Wolfe \"failed to satisfy the final portion of [Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii) ] when [he] ... failed to capture the hearing\n   <em>\n    on the record\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added).

The Commissioner Violated Appellant's COBR Rights When He Failed to Record a Penalty Increase Meeting Within the Time Allowed By Law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    a. Appellant's Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Foy avers that Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6) requires, on the part of Commissioner Wolfe, the satisfaction of four requirements within 30 days after the Commissioner received the\n   Hearing Board's decision before he may increase Appellant's penalty beyond that proposed by the Hearing Board. Commissioner Wolfe's failure to capture the penalty increase meeting on the audio record was in violation of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii). His unexplained failure to conduct and record a remedial meeting within the allowed statutory time period exacerbates the circumstances. Such failures preclude Commissioner Wolfe from increasing the Hearing Board's proposed penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Appellant maintains that Commissioner Wolfe's conduct evinces a disregard of the requirements of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6). In support of this contention, Appellant notes that the Commissioner canceled, unilaterally and without elaboration, the second penalty increase meeting set for December 17. Moreover, his attempt to comply with compiling a \"record\" of the unrecorded meeting through the December 10 memorandum to Secretary Moyer was not provided to Appellant until after the judicial review action was filed. Notably, Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-904(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   permits correctional officers to waive their COBR rights under certain circumstances. Appellant was not asked (nor did he agree) to waive the Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1) 30-day time limit, which might have mitigated Commissioner Wolfe's post-hoc \"scheduling conflict\" assertion and allowed a proper opportunity to conduct the remedial meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    b. Appellees' Arguments.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Appellees respond that Commissioner Wolfe complied with the spirit and intent of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6). He followed (or attempted to follow) each of the steps\n   in Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6), but it was only the unforeseeable recording\n   equipment malfunction that caused him to come up short. Commissioner Wolfe overcame the mechanical glitch by capturing the contents of the initial penalty increase meeting in the memorandum to Secretary Moyer. Appellees argue that Appellant had every opportunity to \"say whatever he desired to the appointing authority regarding the penalty.\" Moreover, Appellant failed to address how an absence of an audio record of the penalty increase meeting would change the outcome of the case. Thus, the inadvertent malfunction worked no violation of the rights of Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    c.

With these principles in mind, we perceive no need to consider the legislative history of Corr.

The proper application of this provision determines whether the 30-day clock for the Commissioner to act began to run after the Hearing Board rendered its decision (16 November 2015),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   or when Commissioner Wolfe acknowledged receipt of the Hearing Board's recommendation (23 November 2015).

Thus, it falls to the chief to \"review the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the hearing board\" and \"issue a final order\" within \"30 days after receipt of the recommendations of the hearing board.\" Corr. Servs. \u00a7\u00a7 10-910(b)(1)(i), (ii). The subject of the sentence, i.e., the appointing authority, in Corr.

Within 30 days of receipt of the hearing board's recommendations, the chief shall review the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the hearing board and then he shall issue his final order.\"). The statutory scheme offers the putative agency decision-maker final say as to an officer or correctional officer's punishment, if that authority acts timely and in accordance with the prescribed steps. These tasks must be satisfied within 30 days after acknowledgment of receipt of the Hearing Board's recommendation, unless the correctional officer agrees to an extension of time, i.e., a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To conclude that the plain meaning of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1) was that the 30-day period commenced when the\n   Hearing Board rendered its decision would insert, moreover, a phantom meaning to an otherwise evident and forthright statutory intent. It would result in a diminished 30-day window for the ultimate decision-maker to assess the merits of the recommended punishment and render its final judgment. The statute declines to concern itself with the modality of delivery of the\n   Hearing Board's decision to the appointing authority. We conclude that the plain meaning of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1) provides the appointing authority 30 days to render a final order, commencing when it acknowledges receipt of the Hearing Board's recommendation. Here, Commissioner Wolfe acknowledged receipt of the Hearing Board's proposed punishment on 23 November 2015. Thus, the 30-day window for satisfying the recorded increased penalty meeting requirement and rendering a final penalty decision expired on 23 December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Next, we consider the merits of the parties' contentions regarding whether the terms of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6) are mandatory in nature or may be satisfied by substantial compliance. Appellant contends that subsection (b)(6) compels the appointing authority to comply with each statutorily-mandated step. Appellees, on the other hand, aver that substantial compliance, or compliance with the \"letter and spirit of the statute,\" can be sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We are obliged to agree with Appellant. Courts should neither add words nor delete words from a clear and unambiguous statute in order to give it a meaning not reflected by the language the Legislature chose to use.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Thus, we must consider the written words in conjunction with the context in which they appear in the statute. Corr. Servs. \u00a7\u00a7 10-910(b)(1), (b)(4), and (b)(5) all contain \"shall,\" followed by specific statutory directions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The use of \"shall\" is key: \"[O]rdinarily, the word 'shall,' unless the context within which it is used indicates otherwise, is mandatory when used\n   in a statute, and thus denotes an imperative obligation inconsistent with the idea of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Bright v.

Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b) relating to the duties of the appointing authority employ \"shall.\" The use of this important word in the subsection (b)(1) list, coupled with a semicolon followed by \"and,\" indicates that the General Assembly meant that the subsection (b)(6) list set-out a mandatory regimen. Looking also to the prefatory language of the LEOBR, \"[t]he chief may increase the recommended penalty of the hearing board only if the chief personally ....\" Pub. Safety \u00a7 3-108 (d)(1)(i). The prefatory language of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6) states, by the same token, \"the appointing authority may increase the recommended penalty of the hearing board if the appointing authority ....\" Even in the absence of a corresponding use of \"only\" and \"personally\" in Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6), we find persuasive nonetheless the mandatory nature of Pub. Safety \u00a7 3-108(d)(1), similar to our reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Hird v.

The chief in\n   <em>\n    Hird\n   </em>\n   failed to satisfy what is now Pub. Safety \u00a7 3-108(d)(5)(ii), by failing to meet with the officer and allow her to be heard on the record. Commissioner Wolfe failed equally. Although the Commissioner met initially with Appellant in compliance with Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii), his efforts failed to comply with the requirement that the meeting be on the record. There was something additional, and indeed essential, for Commissioner Wolfe to do before finalizing a decision to increase Foy's penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Appellees argue that \"\n   <em>\n    Hird\n   </em>\n   did not address a situation where the appointing authority fully complied with the law and took the actions required by statute ... but the transcript of that meeting became unavailable due to a recording equipment malfunction.\" To the contrary, Commissioner Wolfe failed to comply with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Appellees argue also that Commissioner Wolfe's memorandum to Secretary Moyer setting forth his recollection of what transpired at the unrecorded penalty increase meeting and his efforts to reschedule another meeting to a date within the statutory period constitutes substantial compliance with Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6). If substantial compliance were an available defense, we would disagree with this contention. Moreover, we observe that Commissioner Wolfe's actions were not as forthright as Appellees claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In our view, Commissioner Wolfe's actions occupy the same church, if not the same pew, as the sheriff's conduct in\n   <em>\n    VanDevander\n   </em>\n   .

Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1) for Commissioner Wolfe to act began to run when he acknowledged receipt of the Hearing Board's recommendation on 23 November 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Appellant and Commissioner Wolfe agreed to have a remedial penalty increase meeting on 17 December 2015, well within the 30-day time limit. The Commissioner canceled unilaterally on 16 December 2015 the meeting, however. No reason was given for the cancellation nor any attempt made by Commissioner Wolfe to reschedule the penalty increase meeting before the expiration of the 30-day period on 23 December 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    VanDevander\n   </em>\n   , the appointing authority neglected to request the employee to waive his Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(1) 30-day right, and agree to have the requisite recorded penalty increase meeting take place beyond the 30-day window. Appellees argued before this Court at oral argument that, because of a scheduling conflict between Appellant's counsel and Commissioner Wolfe, they were unable to find a mutually available date on which to reschedule the penalty increase meeting. We are unmoved by this uncorroborated contention, especially in view of Appellee's incorrect view of when the 30-day window expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Commissioner Wolfe knew (or should have known) of the COBR's waiver provision, and could have requested Appellant to waive his right to a have the remedial meeting within the 30-day period. Instead, Commissioner Wolfe wrote a December 10 memorandum summary of his version of what transpired at the unrecorded 9 December 2015 penalty increase meeting, which memorandum (as the circuit court found) was neither objective nor complete on its face. Just as in\n   <em>\n    VanDevander\n   </em>\n   where the sheriff failed to notify the deputy regarding any objection he may have to the postponement, it appears that Commissioner Wolfe failed equally to notify timely Foy or his counsel of the existence of his written memorandum to Secretary Moyer. Commissioner Wolfe gave Foy no chance to\n   object timely to anything contained in (or omitted from) the memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Appellees assert that Appellant has not disputed on appeal the accuracy or scope of the statements in the memorandum. We do not expect Appellant to object to the contents of something he did not know existed until it was too late to remonstrate effectively. The unilateral, one-sided memorandum is inadequate to comply (strictly or substantially) with the \"on the record\" requirement of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Thus, Commissioner Wolfe's action was not taken validly when he increased the Hearing Board's proposed punishment. It cannot stand. Foy's rights were violated under the COBR. Failure to comply timely with the requirements of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-910(b)(6) closed the window of opportunity for the appointing authority to increase Foy's penalty beyond that proposed by the Hearing Board. Safeguards have been placed in the statute (such as the waiver provision of Corr. Servs. \u00a7 10-904(d)) to avoid cases like this from arising. The circuit court erred in remanding this case for another opportunity for a penalty increase meeting. We reverse the circuit court's judgment as to its remedy. The Hearing Board's proposed penalty becomes, by default, the sanction applicable to Foy in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Gov't \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(ii) (granting us the ability\n   to \"reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision ...

In my view, the unfortunate failure of the tape recorder during a meeting that everyone in attendance thought was being recorded can be cured by a remand for a new meeting with a working tape recorder. Foy should not escape termination as the penalty for disciplinary offenses including use of excessive force against an inmate because a tape recorder malfunctioned. For that reason, I would affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The numerous disciplinary charges against Foy arose out of an incident in which he stepped on an inmate's neck, pinning him to the ground, and then filed a false report about what had happened. The charges recommended termination. A Hearing Board was convened and issued its report on November 16, 2015, finding Foy guilty of ten of twelve charges and recommending as a penalty that he be transferred to Central Booking and demoted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Commissioner received the Hearing Board's report on November 23, 2015, and decided to pursue an increase in the penalty to termination. To that end, on December 9, 2015, he held a meeting with Foy and his lawyer. The meeting was tape recorded, or so everyone thought. Sometime after the meeting concluded, the Commissioner discovered that the tape recorder had malfunctioned. The next day, December 10, 2015, the Commissioner informed Foy's attorney of the malfunction and sought another date on which to hold a meeting with functional recording equipment. Between the two men, there was no available date before December 16. They scheduled a new meeting for December 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Also on December 10, 2015, the Commissioner wrote a memorandum to the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\"Secretary\"), detailing what\n   had happened at the December 9 meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The memorandum related the recording problem that later was discovered and the attempt to schedule a second meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   According to Foy's lawyer, the December 17, 2015 meeting was cancelled on December 16, with no explanation. It is\n   important to note, however, that the parties to this case (and later the circuit court) were operating under the assumption that the 30-day period for issuing a final decision, in Md. Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2015 Cumm. Supp.), section 10-910(b)(1) of the Correctional Services Article (\"Corr. Servs.\"), began to run on November 16, 2015, when the Hearing Board issued its report, not on November 23, 2015, when the Commissioner received it. Indeed, that is the position the parties take to this day, as their briefs make clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the parties thought the 30-day period would expire on December 16, 2015 (or, as Foy's lawyer states in his brief, that December 17, 2015, was \"the 31\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   day\"). Foy's lawyer acknowledges (as it turns out incorrectly) that a meeting on December 17 would have been beyond the 30-day time period. In all likelihood, the Commissioner cancelled the December 17, 2015 meeting because, like everyone else, he thought it would be beyond the 30-day deadline for issuing a final decision.\n   On December 16, 2015, the Commissioner issued his final order, by means of a letter addressed to Foy, explaining that he was increasing the penalty to termination and the basis for that decision. The final order thus was issued within 30 days of November 16, 2015 (the day everyone thought was the 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day) and, more importantly, within 30 days of November 23, 2016 (the day that, as the Majority explains, and as I agree, in fact was the 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The only provision of the Correctional Officers' Bill of Rights (\"COBR\") governing review by the appointing authority of a hearing board's recommendations is Corr. Servs. section 10-910(b). The 30-day time period at the crux of this case is set forth at subsection (b)(1):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Within 30 days after receipt of the recommendations of the hearing board, the appointing authority shall: (i) review the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the hearing board; and (ii) issue a final order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Subsection (b)(5) requires the appointing authority to obtain the approval of the Secretary before terminating a correctional officer under this subsection. And subsection (b)(6) sets out the steps that must be taken for an increase in the recommended penalty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   With the approval of the Secretary, the appointing authority may increase the recommended penalty of the hearing board if the appointing authority:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (i) reviews the entire record of the proceedings of the hearing board;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (ii) meets with the correctional officer and allows the correctional officer to be heard\n   <em>\n    on the record\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (iii) at least 10 days before the meeting, discloses and provides in writing to the correctional officer any oral or written communication not included in the record of the hearing board on which the decision to consider increasing the penalty is wholly or partly based; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (iv) states on the record the substantial evidence on which the appointing authority relied to support the increase of the recommended penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Subsection (b)(6) does not expressly state that those steps all\n   must be taken within 30 days of the appointing authority's receipt of the Hearing Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The issue in this case only concerns the meeting required by subsection (b)(6)(ii), specifically that it was held but not recorded. I agree with the Majority that the Commissioner's written summary of the meeting did not comply with, or substantially comply with, the requirement that the meeting be \"on the record.\" I depart from the Majority with respect to the consequence of the Commissioner's having held a meeting, but not a meeting \"on the record,\" before issuing his timely final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As the Majority acknowledges,\n   <em>\n    Hird v.

The issue there was whether an officer whose penalty for a disciplinary finding under the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (\"LEOBR\") had been increased timely filed her petition for judicial review in the circuit court, under Rule 7-203. As pertinent, that rule required (and still does) the petition for judicial review to be filed \"within 30 days after ... the date of the order or action of which review is sought [.]\" The police chief wrote a letter to the officer stating that he was increasing her penalty, but did not give it to her. Three days later he met with her, read the letter out loud, and handed it to her. She filed her petition for judicial review 30 days after the latter of those two days. The question was whether the 30-day deadline in Rule 7-203 began to run on the day the chief wrote the letter, or the day he met with the officer and presented the letter to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   At that time, the LEOBR stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    Before the chief may increase the recommended penalty of the hearing board, the chief personally shall\n   </em>\n   (1) Review the entire record of the hearing board proceeding; (2) Meet with the law enforcement officer and permit [her] to be heard on the record; (3) Disclose and provide the officer in writing at least 10 days prior to the meeting any oral or written communication not included in the hearing board\n   record on which the decision to consider increasing the penalty is based; and (4) State on the record the substantial evidence relied on to support the increase of the recommended penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Art. 27, \u00a7 731(c) (emphasis added). We held that the action the officer was challenging was completed on the day the chief met with the officer, which was one of the steps he was required to take \"before\" he could increase her penalty, not three days earlier when he prepared his letter but had not yet met with the officer. Therefore the petition was timely filed. There was no contention in\n   <em>\n    Hird\n   </em>\n   that the police chief had not acted timely, and therefore no issue about the consequence of an appointing authority not acting timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    VanDevander v.

Subsection (b)(1) of Corr. Servs. section 10-910 sets a clear 30-day deadline for issuing a final decision, but subsection (b)(6) does not include temporal language so as to make clear that compliance with a requirement for increasing the penalty can never take place by cure, after the final decision has been issued. Indeed, in the face of stricter language in the LEOBR (\"Before the chief may increase the recommended penalty of the hearing board, the chief personally shall ....\"), we made plain in\n   <em>\n    VanDevander\n   </em>\n   that some failures to comply can be cured after the final order has been issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   To be sure, the recording failure in this case could have been cured before the Commissioner issued his final order. That was not an impossibility. Unfortunately, the parties misunderstood (and still misunderstand) that December 16,\n   2015, was not the last day for the Commissioner to issue that order. Nevertheless, the COBR does not prohibit the Commissioner from taking action to cure the recording failure post-final decision, even if it could have been cured before. Especially given the technical nature of the failure here and the lack of any prejudice to Foy beyond the absence of a recording, this case should be remanded for a new meeting that is properly recorded.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Md.

Commissioner Wolfe canceled, on 16 December 2015, the 17 December 2015 remedial meeting, without explanation.

(\"The hearing board's report came forth on November 12, 1998.
