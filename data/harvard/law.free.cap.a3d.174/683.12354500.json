In the latter order, the BHA adopted the recommendation of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to deny Petitioner\u2019s appeal contesting, and seeking to expunge, a founded report of child abuse from the ChildLine <em>&amp; </em>Abuse Registry (ChildLine).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">In this case, to support the change from an indicated report to a founded report, the Chester County Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) relied solely on the admission that Petitioner made in a juvenile court proceeding and the juvenile court\u2019s order -adjudicating Petitioner delinquent based upon that admission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>(Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 60a.) All parties agree that in order for the founded report to be legally valid, Petitioner must be a \u201cperpetrator\u201d as that term is defined in Section 6303 of the Child Protective Services Law (Law)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to mean \u201c[a]n individual who is 14 years of age or older\u201d at the time of the abuse and/or delinquent act. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303. On review, the primary issue for us to decide is whether the record of the juvenile court proceedings sufficiently verifies that Petitioner was adjudicated delinquent for conduct that he committed when he was 14 or older.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">Petitioner was born on January 10,2000. On October 7, 2014, DCYF received a report from Petitioner\u2019s mother who stated that she observed Petitioner\u2019s then 11-year-old sister (Sister) performing oral sex on him the day before. (Finding of Fact (F.F.) at No. 3.) At the time this incident occurred, Petitioner was 14 years old. \u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">On October 8, 2014, the local police conducted an investigation and interviewed Sister. In a juvenile affidavit of probable cause (Affidavit), the police stated that Sister told them that she and Petitioner started, to. engage in physical conduct of a sexual nature a little over two years ago, when Sister \u201cwas at the end of 4th grade.\u201d (R.R. at 137a.) Sister further stated that \u201cduring the past [2] years the incidents escalated to oral sex between the two.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without providing any specific dates or time frame within this two-year period, Sister said that, in total, Petitioner \"performed oral sex on her approximately four times, and she performed oral sex on him approximately eight times. According to Sister, the last incident occurred a few days before the interview, on or about October 6, 2014, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>this was the only incident of which Sister stated happened \u2022 on a certain date. <em>Id. </em>Notably, Petitioner would have been under the age of 14 during any incident that occurred prior to January 10, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">On November 18, 2014, the Commonwealth filed a juvenile petition (Petition), alleging that Petitioner committed nine delinquent acts between \u201cJune 2012-October 6, 2014.\u201d (R.R. at 134a.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More precisely, the Commonwealth asserted that Petitioner committed four counts of involuntary deviate , sexual intercourse\u2014graded as a.first-degree felony;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> four counts of indecent assault (complainant less than 13 years, of .age)\u2014'graded as a first-degree misdemeanor;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and one count of indecent assault (complainant less than 13 years of age)\u2014graded as a third-degree felony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the face of the Petition, there were no allegations directly accompanying, or corresponding to, each charge in the Petition on an individual or sep\u00e1rate basis. Instead, the conduct that formed the basis of the charges was apparently contained in the lump-sum format of the Affidavit attached to the Petition. However, the Petition and the attached Affidavit neither cross-referenced each other, nor otherwise connected each count to particular instances of misconduct. Consequently, the Petition and the Affidavit did not .correlate any specific acts, or the dates or time frame in which they occurred, to any of the nine counts asserted against Petitioner in the Petition. (R.R. at 134a~36a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Following the filing of the Petition, ChildLine filed an indicated report of child abuse against Petitioner on December 12, 2014, and issued a notice informing his parents of its determination. (R.R. at la-3a; F.F. at No. 1.) In response, Petitioner filed an administrative appeal, By order dated June 15, 2015, the Department of Human Services (Department) automatically stayed the appeal pending the outcome of the juvenile proceedings. (R.R. at 16a; <em>see </em>.section 6341(d) of the Law, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(d).) .</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">In due course, Petitioner and DCYF filed status updates, with respect to the juvenile proceedings, and the records in the juvenile proceedings were released to DCYF. Gn January 13, 2016, DCYF issued a supplemental report amending Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>er\u2019s report from \u201cindicated\u201d, to. \u201cfounded,\u201d based upon his June 1, 2015 admission and adjudication of delinquency in juvenile court. An ALJ then entered an order scheduling a hearing for March 8, 2016; however, the order limited the scope of the hearing to the issues of whether DCYF properly amended the report to founded, and whether the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication established that Petitioner was a \u201cperpetrator\u201d for purposes of the Law. The ALJ\u2019s order expressly stated that he would not consider the underlying merits at the hearing, <em>ie,, </em>receive evidence from both parties and make factual determinations regarding the abuse and/or when it had occurred. (R.R. at 23a-28a, 60a-63a, 152a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">On March 8, 2016, the ALJ convened a telephonic hearing. Petitioner and DCYF. each presented argument as to whether the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of delinquency proved that he was 14 at the time of the delinquent act, therefore making him a \u201cperpetrator\u201d under the Law, and whether the record of the juvenile proceedings was sufficient to support the founded report. (R.R. at 158a-97a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In an adjudication and recommendation dated June 15, 2016, the ALJ concluded that DCYF correctly, changed the status of the report from indicated to founded. In doing so, the ALJ found that the juvenile court adjudicated Petitioner delinquent for committing involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault. The ALJ further found that the delinquency proceedings involved the same factual circumstances as the founded report. (F.F. at Nos. 10-11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In rejecting Petitioner\u2019s assertion that the record failed to demonstrate that he was a 14-year-old \u201cperpetrator\u201d for purposes of the Law, the ALJ reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a6bj-dedup-0\">Counsel argues that [Petitioner] should not be considered a \u201cperpetrator\u201d because the related delinquency allegations date back to when [Petitioner] was 12 years old and the majority of the allegations occurred prior to [Petitioner] turning 14 years of age, and therefore, [Petitioner] does not meet the definition of \u201cperpetrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"affz-dedup-0\">The definition of \u201cperpetrator\u201d includes an individual who is 14 years of age or older and resides in the' same home as the child. However, it is irrelevant as 'to ' when the majority of the allegations took place. The only question is whether an incident of abuse occurred after [Petitioner] reached 14 years of age. In this case, the [indicated]- report shows that [Petitioner] resided with the subject child and reached 14 years of age on January 10, 2014. The date of the oral report listed on the [indicated report] is October 7, 2014. Additionally, the narrative of the [indicated,report] refers to an incident the day. prior to the [\u25a0] report date, and the date of incident listed, on the [report] is October 6,2014. Similarly, the affidavit of probable cause refers to an incident in October 2014. Since the [indicated report] and affidavit of probable cause refer to an incident in October 2014, [Petitioner] meets the definition of perpetrator in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">(ALJ\u2019s. Adj udication at 2-3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">On June 21, 2016, the BHA upheld the ALJ\u2019s decision, adopting that decision in its entirety. Thereafter, Petitioner filed a motion, for reconsideration, which the Secretary denied by. order dated July 15, 2016. Petitioner then filed a timely petition for review from both orders, which is now before this Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>In his appellate brief, Petitioner contends that the record of the juvenile proceedings was inadequate to establish that he was adjudicated delinquent for an act that occurred when he was at least 14 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Under the Law, an \u201cindicated\u201d report is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201ca report of child abuse made pursuant to this chapter if an investigation by the [Department or [DCYF] determines that substantial evidence of the alleged abuse by a perpetrator exists based on ... [t]he child protective service investigation.\u201d Section 6303 of the Law, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303. However, for an \u201cindicated\u201d report to attain the status of a \u201cfounded report,\u201d there must be a judicial adjudication. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303; <em>D.M. v. Department of Public Welfare, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854107\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/122/1151/#p1155\">122 A.3d 1151</extracted-citation>, 1155 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015). More specifically, a \u201cfounded\u201d report can be sustained with evidence of \u201ca judicial adjudication\u201d in which there is \u201ca finding that [the] child who is a subject of the report has been abused and <em>the adjudication involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.\u201d </em>23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303 (emphasis supplied). According to the Law, a-\u201cjudicial adjudication ... may include ... [a] finding of delinquency under [Section 6341 of the Juvenile Act].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">This Court has held that, pursuant- to this statutory paradigm, DCYF must demonstrate that the factual circumstances of the judicial adjudication and the indicated report are identical, and, if it does, the report is properly designated as a founded report. <em>D.M., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854107\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/122/1151/#p1155\">122 A.3d at 1155</extracted-citation>. This is so because the adjudication, in and of itself, normally encompasses \u201cnot only a judicial finding that the child has been abused, but that the perpetrator has been found guilty of abuse ....\u201d <em>J.G. v. Department of Public Welfare, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1093\">795 A.2d 1089</extracted-citation>, 1093 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002). Consequently, \u201c[w]here a founded report is based upon such an adjudication, an appeal would, in most instances, constitute a collateral attack of the adjudication itself, which is not allowed.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1093\">Id.</extracted-citation></em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Nonetheless, under the Administrative Agency Law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a perpetrator may appeal a founded report for the limited purpose of determining whether or not the underlying adjudication supports the founded report. <em>J.G., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1093\">795 A.2d at 1093</extracted-citation>. Even if a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent for acts of abuse against a child, that juvenile must have been adjudicated delinquent for the same incident described in the indicated report and for an act that rendered him a \u201cperpetrator\u201d under the Law. <em>See G.M. v. Department of Public Welfare, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"8206802\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/377/#p380\">957 A.2d 377</extracted-citation>, 380-81 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008); <em>R.F. v. Department of Public Welfare, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267648\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/845/214/#p218\">845 A.2d 214</extracted-citation>, 218 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004). By way of definition, a \u201cperpetrator\u201d is strictly limited to certain classes of persons, including, as relevant here, \u201c[a]n individual who is 14 years of age or older\u201d when he or she committed the act of abuse. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Here, in the indicated report, DCYF represented that it received a report from Petitioner\u2019s mother who stated that on October 6, 2014, she observed Petitioner, then 14, performing oral sex on his Sister, then 11. (R.R. at 2a.) This was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>only incident or factual circumstance listed in the report. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267648\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/845/214/#p218\">Id.</extracted-citation></em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">However, the record of the juvenile court proceedings was markedly insufficient to prove that Petitioner was adjudicated delinquent for \u201cthe same factual circumstance\u201d of this incident. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303. In the Petition, under the heading \u201cDate/Time of Offense,\u201d the affiant recorded: \u201cJune 2012-October 6, 2014.\u201d (R.R. at 134a.) Significantly, and perhaps evidencing inartful pleading under the Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure, the Petition did not contain any specific allegations that explained the factual basis for each\u2014or. any\u2014of the nine counts that Petitioner was alleged to have committed. (R.R. at 134a.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the Affidavit was attached to the Petition to describe the factual bases for all the charges, the Affidavit detailed a variety of instances where conduct of a sexual nature had occurred between Petitioner and,Sister \u201cduring the past two years\u201d and some months prior to that. (R.R. at 137a.) Critically, the Affidavit did not provide a more definite time frame for the individual incidents, except for the one that occurred in October 2014. However, the Petition, in a seemingly impolitic approach to pleading under the Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure, did not link the incident in October 2014 to any particular count(s) in the Petition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Because the numerous sexual incidents outlined in the Affidavit are not coupled or conjoined in any manner with the counts in the -Petition, it is unclear what conduct formed the basis for the individual counts. Assuming that the October incident was included in a count in the juvenile petition, it is just as likely to be count 1 as it is any other count, or it could possibly be a combination of multiple counts. The lack of specificity is also evident as to-when the conduct occurred with respect to each count, and what Petitioner\u2019s age was in relation to each count. Notably, in the time period of which the incidents of abuse-allegedly took place, from June 2012 to October ' 2014, Petitioner would have been under the age of 14 for 19 months, and' over the age of 14 for nine months. The point is that, given the current state of the record, we .simply do not know how the counts in the Petition match up with the particular allegations of \u25a0 misconduct, as well as Petitioner\u2019s age at the time of each incident of misconduct when viewed in connection with the counts in the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The remaining documents of the juvenile proceedings do not clarify the discrepancy and, in fact, only exacerbate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">After conducting a- hearing on: May 29, 2015, the juvenile court issued an adjudicatory/dispositional hearing order dated June 1, 2015. In this order, the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>court found that Petitioner \u201ctendered an admission to some or all of the delinquent acts'alleged in the Petition as indicated in Exhibit A,\u201d and accepted Petitioner\u2019s admission as being made knowingly,.\u2018intelligently, and voluntarily. (R.R. at 129a.) Yet, Exhibit A does not contain any delinquent acts and simply charts the nine counts in sequential order, with horizontal headings that list the criminal statutes, grades of the .offenses, and disposition of the charges. (R.R. at 131a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">In ruling on \u201cthe offenses set forth in Exhibit A,\u201d the juvenile court: (1) adjudicated Petitioner delinquent for indecent assault (complainant less than 13 years of age)\u2014graded as a first-degree misdemean- or (hereinafter \u201cIndecent Assault\u201d), and (2) entered a \u201cfinding of fact\u201d for one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse\u2014 graded as a first-degree felony (hereinafter \u201cIDSI\u201d). <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267648\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/845/214/#p218\">Id.</extracted-citation> </em>According to-Exhibit A, seven of the nine counts in the Petition were withdrawn.. Petitioner admitted to count. 1, IDSI, with the juvenile, court entering a finding of \u201csubstantiated,\u201d on this count, and count 3, Indecent Assault, with the juvenile court entering a finding of \u201cadjudicated delinquent\u201d on this count. (R.R. at 131a.) Ultimately, the juvenile court placed Petitioner on two years of probation, ordered that he undergo psy-chosexual assessment, and. deferred final disposition. (R.R, at 129a-30a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In the May 29, 2015 juvenile admission form\u2014which is akin to a written guilty plea colloquy in a criminal case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\u2014Petitioner, with the assistance of counsel, admitted-.to an adjudication of delinquency for Indecent Assault and a finding of fact without an adjudication for IDSI,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In an addendum to the admission form (Addendum), Indecent Assault was recorded as the only \u201cdelinquent act.\u201d In Part A of the Addendum, entitled \u201cSexual Offender Registration\u201414 years or older,\u201d Petitioner was asked whether he committed' one of the delinquent acts enumerated on the form, including IDSI, on or after his 14th birthday, and this section was crossed out. (R.R. at 144a-147a.) In Part B of the Addendum, pertaining to \u201cCivil Commitment for Involuntary Treatment,\u201d Petitioner stated that he committed the delinquent act of Indecent Assault. (R.R. at 147a-51a.) Contrary to the finding of the ALJ, the juvenile court adjudicated Petitioner delinquent for Indecent Assault only, and not for IDSI. <em>See In the Interest of M.W., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206462\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/614/633/\">614 Pa. 633</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206852,7315465,7315502,4207091,7315478,4206462\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/39/958/\">39 A.3d 958</extracted-citation>, 966 (2012). Importantly, although the form had a space to \u201clist the delinquent acts\u201d that Petitioner committed, no details were provided to shed light on the factual basis that'comprised his adjudication of delinquency for count 3, Indecent Assault. (R.R. at 138a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">On August 4, 2015, the juvenile court entered a dispositional hearing order,, placing Petitioner on probation indefinitely, with additional conditions, and directing him to continue psychotherapy. (R.R. at 132a-33a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">Based on the record of the juvenile court proceedings as a whole, including the Petition, Affidavit, Petitioner\u2019s admission form, and the juvenile court\u2019s orders, we can confirm very little: as a result of his admission, Petitioner was adjudicated delinquent of count 3, Indecent Assault. But this is as far as this Court can go. As we have already explained, there is nothing in the r\u00e9cord to demonstrate, with even an iota of certainty, that this count* as op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>posed to the other eight counts, was lodged against Petitioner for conduct occurring in October 2014 or at a point when he was 14. Indeed, the Affidavit catalogued 12 discrete instances where Petitioner and Sister engaged in oral sex, as well as many other allegations of sexual conduct, including times where Petitioner would \u201cgrind\u201d with Sister, grab her \u201cbuttocks,\u201d and \u201ctouch her breasts,\u201d (R.R. at 137a.) We only know with certainty that one incident happened when Petitioner was 14, the one in October 2014; the dates of the allegations stem from June 2012 to October 2014; and Petitioner would have been under the age of 14 during any incident that occurred prior to January 2014.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because count 3 in the Petition is not bonded with any particular factual allegation in the Affidavit, count 3 could be based on any one of the allegations of sexual abuse in the Affidavit. Given all this uncertainty, and the multiple variables at play, Petitioner\u2019s adjudication of delinquency for count 3 merely proves that, at some unknowable point of time in a span of two years and four months, Petitioner committed the act of Indecent Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Quite possibly, one could hypothesize, as the Department and DCYF do in their briefs,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that it would make sense, or be somewhat logical, for Petitioner to admit guilt to the October. 2014 incident because it was the most recent event discussed in the Affidavit. This Court, however, declines to draw such an inference in a cloud of fortuity and happenstance, where nothing more than a gut feeling as to what is theoretically plausible\u2014but not actually proven\u2014serves as our guide and foundation for a decision. <em>Cf. R.F., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267648\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/845/214/#p218\">845 \u00c1.2d at 218</extracted-citation> (\u201c[Sjimply because R.F. entered a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to Endangering the Welfare of a Child, [the Department] may not' infer that the plea was to an act of sexual abuse, especially in light of the colloquy surrounding the entering of that plea.\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As our Supreme Court said: \u201cTo be of independent probative value, [an] admission of guilt-should be complete in itself if it is to establish the facts for which it is offered. It is not to be implemented by suspicion or conjecture pr by piling inference upon, inference.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v.

After all, the reason that an adjudication allows an indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>cated report to become a founded report is because the adjudication is supposed to constitute a court\u2019s legal determination of the \u201csame factual circumstances,\u201d 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303, depicted in the indicated report. In this scenario, the adjudication verifies the indicated report via the factual findings/admissions that a court makes/accepts in connection with a conviction, a verdict of guilt, an adjudication, etc., and rightfully confers upon the report the status of being \u201cfounded.\u201d <em>See J.G., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1093\">795 A.2d at 1093-94</extracted-citation>. Stated differently, for an indicated report to be independently \u201cfounded,\u201d the adjudication must resolve all of the issues in the indicated report definitively and coriclusively. It is for this reason that this Court, while highlighting that an adjudication cannot usually be collaterally attacked in an administrative proceeding, has stated that the only way to properly challenge an adjudication upon which a founded report is based is to appeal and contest the adjudication. <em>See <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1093\">id.</extracted-citation> </em>at 1093 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Here, however, the record of the juvenile court proceedings is too vague and ambiguous for us to confirm that Petitioner was adjudicated delinquent for the same incident that occurred on October 6, 2014. Unable to find that the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of delinquency verifies\u2014or even pertains to\u2014the misconduct in the indicated report, we cannot conclude that the adjudication supports the founded report.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that DCYF erred in relying solely on the adjudication to effectuate a change in the report to founded and that the Secretary committed an error of law in sanctioning the modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In reaching his decision, the ALJ failed to analyze the Petition, Petitioner\u2019s admission, and the juvenile court\u2019s adjudicatory documents. Rather than focus on these extremely important pieces of information, the ALJ placed heavy emphasis on the fact that the incident date listed on the indicated report was October 6, 2014, and the Affidavit refers to the same incident and date, (ALJ\u2019s Adjudication at 2-3.) However, the Affidavit is by no means an adjudication, and the information in the indicated report, even if corroborated by the Affidavit and supported by substantial evidence, cannot convert an indicated report into a founded report.. If we allowed such, then this Court would effectively permit avoidance of section 6303 of the Law and its requirement that the adjudication independently sustain the incident in the indicated report both factually and legally. Although in some rare instances an ALJ may use an indicated report to fill in gaps that .result from the absence of express elements in an adjudicated crime, the ALJ may do so only when the \u201cjudicial adjudication and the factual basis' for that adjudication is identical to the factual basis of the [indicated] report.\u201d <em>DM., </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854107\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/122/1151/#p1155\">122 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>1155</extracted-citation>. However, that is not the case here, and the gap that exists between the event that constituted the adjudication and the occurrence listed in the indicated report is of such monumental proportions that it makes it impossible for us to identify any overlap between the two.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AAP0\">Therefore, for the above-stated reasons, we reverse the Secretary\u2019s order upholding the ALJ\u2019s determination that DCYF correctly changed the report from indicated to founded.

In its brief, the Department contends that Petitioner admitted at the telephonic hearing that the delinquency proceedings resulted in an adjudication involving the same factual circumstances as the indicated report. (Department\u2019s brief at 11-12.) This assertion is refuted by the record. At the outset, Petitioner contended that his adjudication of delinquency for indecent assault failed to establish that he admitted that he was 14 years of age or older when he committed that offense. (R.R. at 178a.) Although Petitioner later stated the adjudication of delinquency involved the \"same subject child\u201d that was listed in the indicated report, (R.R. at 178a), Petitioner continued to maintain that he was not \"a perpetrator, \u201d (R.R. at 179a), \"because he would have had to have been 14.\u201d (R.R. at 184a.) In response, the Department argued that the adjudication of delinquency included \u201cthe time period in which Petitioner was 14.\u201d (R.R. at 190a.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"AIj0\">. In <em>D.M., </em>the petitioner pled no contest to the crime of harassment for making statements and gestures to a minor at an adolescent facility that were \"identical to the factual basis of the [indicated] report.\u201d <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854107\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/122/1151/#p1155\">122 A.3d at 1155</extracted-citation>. In designating the petitioner a perpetrator under the Law, the agency determined in the indicated report that the petitioner was employed at the adolescent facility as a supervisor who was responsible for the child\u2019s welfare. However, the place of the petitioner's employment was immaterial to the criminal charge of harassment. Nonetheless, the petitioner admitted in his plea that \"the address where the incidents occurred [was] the adolescent facility.\u201d <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6854107\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/122/1151/#p1155\">Id.</extracted-citation></em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AQV7\">In this limited situation, we permitted the ALJ to look beyond the adjudication, and rely upon the indicated report, to fill in the \"gap\u201d and find that the petitioner was an employee of the facility and was responsible for the child.
