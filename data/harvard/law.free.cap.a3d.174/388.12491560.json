Instead, the General Assembly\n   repealed the death penalty in 2013. 2013 Md. Laws, ch. 156, \u00a7 3. Meanwhile, on June 6, 2013, Grandison filed, in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, the first of two motions to correct an illegal sentence (which he supplemented several times) that are the subject of the present appeals. Following two hearings, the circuit court, on November 13, 2014, issued a memorandum opinion and order granting relief, at the State's own concession, on a single claim-that the twenty-year sentence imposed for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence was illegal, because, at the time Grandison committed that offense, its maximum penalty was fifteen years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the circuit court vacated Grandison's twenty-year sentence for that crime and imposed a fifteen-year term of imprisonment, consecutive to his life sentence for conspiracy as well as to Grandison's\n   federal sentences. But it denied all of his other claims. Grandison\n   noted a timely appeal from that order, raising the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in ruling appellant's convictions for first degree murder did not merge with his conviction for use of a handgun in the commission of [ ] a felony or crime of violence under the required evidence test?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in holding a motion to correct illegal sentence is not the appropriate forum to consider appellant's allegations his sentences are illegal under the\n   <em>\n    Bartkus\n   </em>\n   exception to dual sovereignty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   III. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in holding the jury was properly hearkened since a mere hearkening of counts of an indictment without specifying the offense does not constitute a hearkening of the verdict as to first degree murder or any other offense?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   IV. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in ruling after vacating sentence under\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   the court had the authority to resentence and there was no legal requirement the resentencing jury announce their findings in open court or requirement to poll or hearken their findings?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   V. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in imposing the fifteen year sentence for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or\n   crime of violence consecutive to Grandison's federal sentences of life plus ten years after the federal authorities made those sentences run concurrent with the State sentences?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Then, in 2015, Governor Martin O'Malley, exercising his pardon power, commuted Grandison's death sentences to sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Executive Order 01.01.2015.05 (Jan. 20, 2015). Thereafter, Grandison filed, in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, a second motion to correct an illegal sentence. The circuit court subsequently issued a written memorandum opinion and order denying that motion. Grandison noted a timely appeal from\n   that order, raising two question for review, which we have slightly rephrased as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to correct illegal sentence in holding that the former Governor had authority under Maryland Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 20 to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   exercise executive powers to commute Grandison's death sentences to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole without an application having been made seeking commutation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in holding that the former Governor's commutation of his sentences of death to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole did not violate Art. 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which prohibits\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   laws in criminal cases?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On this Court's own motion, we consolidated these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Appeal No. 2039\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Grandison claims that the circuit abused its discretion in ruling that his convictions for first-degree murder did not merge with his conviction for use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence under the required evidence test.

The only substantive limitations on that power are that it may not be exercised \"in cases of impeachment, and in cases, in which [the Governor] is prohibited by other Articles of this Constitution.\" Md. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 20. We interpret the procedural limitation, on which Grandison relies, that \"before granting a\n   <em>\n    nolle prosequi\n   </em>\n   , or pardon, [the Governor] shall give notice, in one or more newspapers, of the application made for it, and of the day on, or after which, his decision will be given[,]\" as merely a notice requirement and not a condition precedent. Md. Const., Art. II, \u00a7 20. As the State aptly puts it in its brief, \"the most\n   logical interpretation of the 'application' language is that the Governor will be required to give notice of any application received, but only in the event that one was actually received.\" In any event, Grandison acknowledges that former Governor O'Malley gave the required notice of \"the day on, or after which, his decision [would] be given.\" Accordingly, we conclude that the fact that Grandison did not apply for a commutation of sentence does not render the actions of the former Governor illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, we turn to Grandison's assertion that the former Governor, in commuting his death sentences to sentences of life without the possibility of parole, imposed illegal sentences, in violation of the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.

That contention, like all of the others in these appeals, is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Notwithstanding the independent constitutional basis for the gubernatorial pardon power, Md. Const., Art II, \u00a7 20, that power is also set forth in statutes. The pertinent statutes, for our purposes, are Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Article 41, \u00a7\u00a7 118 and 119, and their modern-day counterparts, CS \u00a7\u00a7 7-601 and 7-602. Article 41, \u00a7 118, the statute in effect at the time Grandison committed the murders at issue, provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The Governor upon giving the notice required by the Constitution may commute or change any sentence of death into penal confinement for such period as he shall think expedient. And, on giving such a notice, he may pardon any person, convicted of crime, on such conditions as he may prescribe, or he may upon like notice remit any part of the time for which any person may be sentenced to imprisonment on such like conditions without such remission operating as a full pardon to any such person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Article 41, \u00a7 119, also in effect at the time Grandison committed the murders at issue, further emphasized the plenary nature of the gubernatorial pardon power. It provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   In any case in which the Governor may issue a conditional pardon to any person, the Governor, in the absence of any provision to the contrary expressed therein, shall be the sole judge of whether or not the conditions of said pardon have been breached, and the determination by the Governor, that the conditions of such pardon have been violated by the person receiving the same, shall be final and not subject to review by any court of this State.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plainly, under Section 118, the Governor was authorized to \"commute or change any sentence of death into penal confinement for such period\n   <strong>\n    as he shall think expedient\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis\n   added.) Such a period would obviously include life without the possibility of parole. That point is further confirmed by the provision that the Governor could \"remit any part of the time for which any person may be sentenced to imprisonment on such like conditions,\" that is, \"\n   <strong>\n    such conditions as he may prescribe\n   </strong>\n   ,\" \"without such remission operating as a full pardon to any such person.\" Art. 41, \u00a7 118 (emphasis added). Clearly, among \"such conditions\" as the Governor \"may prescribe\" would have included the condition that a prisoner, like Grandison, being granted commutation of his death sentences, would not be eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Further underscoring the Governor's plenary authority to impose conditions on any pardon he may grant was Section 119. That section, consistent with the Governor's plenary pardon power under Article II, \u00a7 20, made clear that the Governor\n   alone is the judge of whether a condition of a pardon has been breached and that such a determination, by the Governor, \"shall be final and not subject to review by any court of this State.\" Art. 41, \u00a7 119. In this respect, the instant case is indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Schick,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174345\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/256/#p266\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which is highly persuasive authority in interpreting the scope of the Maryland counterpart to the federal constitutional provision interpreted in that case.
