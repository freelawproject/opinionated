Disciplinary Counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charged Ms, Luxenberg with several violations of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct after Mr. Dickens allegedly stole at least $1,434,298.50 from three estates, including that of Ms, Luxenberg\u2019s client, Michelle Seltzer. Following his theft, Mr. Dickens fled to an island outside of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\">The Board on Professional Responsibility (\u201cthe Board\u201d) has recommended that Mr. Dickens be disbarred from the practice of law due to his violation of multiple rules of professional conduct,' including Rule 1.15 (a) and (c), commingling and misappropriation, and Rule 8.4 (c), conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board also has recommended that Ms. Luxenberg be suspended from the practice of law for six months due to her violation of Rules 1.3 (a), 5.1 (a), and 5.1 (c)(2), relating-to the responsibility of - partners in law firms to ensure competency and ethical- behavior by attorneys in the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Ms. Luxenberg argues on appeal that the Board erred by (1) considering evidence from disciplinary matters to which she was not a party; (2) finding that she violated Rules 1.3 (a), 5.1 (a), and 5.1\u2019 (c); and (3) recommending a \u201charsh\u201d sanction that is inconsistent with this court\u2019s case law and that is greater than the 45-day sanction -recommended by the Board\u2019s Hearing .Committee. Disciplinary Counsel argues that the Board erred by failing to find that Ms. Luxenberg also violated Rules 1.3 (b)(1) and- (2) pertaining to (a) a -lawyer\u2019s intentional failure to seek the lawful objectives of a client and (b) prejudice or damage to the client; Rule 1.7 (b)(4) concerning a lawyer\u2019s representation of a client where the lawyer\u2019s professional judgment may be affected by her own interest; and Rule 8.4 (a) regarding a lawyer\u2019s professional misconduct by knowingly assisting or inducing another to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. Disciplinary Counsel also asserts that given the record in this case, the proper sanction for Ms. Luxenberg is a one-year suspension, with a fitness requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">For the reasons stated below, we accept the recommendation of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The findings of fact contained in the voluminous Report and Recommendation of the Board\u2019s Hearing Committee -Number 12, and supporting record evidentiary documents, reveal the following factual context. - Ms. Luxenberg commenced her practice of law as a member of the District of Columbia Bar in 1975. Eventually she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>was joined in practice by her husband, Stephen Johnson, While Mr. Dickens was completing his legal studies, he became a law clerk at the firm; he was hired in October 1995 because of his computer skills. His status changed to that of an associate in the firm in October 1996 when he .became a member of the District of Columbia Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">. In 1998, the firm incorporated in Maryland as Luxenberg and Johnson, and in 2003, when Mr. Dickens became a partner, the firm changed its name to Luxenberg, Johnson and Dickens. The firm had no partnership agreement but Ms. Luxenberg always retained a 52% interest in the firm, Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s practice has . been devoted to family matters such as divorce and custody. Although she has never been the managing partner of the firm, she decided which clients the firm would represent and who would handle the client matters. Mr. Johnson also had a family law practice, and he took on cases in other areas of the law..</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Mr. Dickens handled some cases-with Ms. Luxenberg and some with Mr. Johnson, but also took on cases on his own, such as the representation, beginning in 2000, of Vernon Harris.in the probate of Mr. Harris\u2019s sister\u2019s estate, and the. representation of the personal representative, of the. estate of Dr/ JoAnne S, O\u2019Brien in April 2008. (the \u201cGarrity/O\u2019Brien\u201d matter). There was a different arrangement in the case of Ms. Seltzer whose separation and divorce Ms. Luxenberg had handled in 1994. -When Ms. Seltzer sought Ms* Luxen-berg\u2019s representation in 2004 to update her estate plan, which included a revocable trust created in 1990 (the \u201c1990 trust\u201d), Ms. Luxenberg explained to Ms. Seltzer that she did not do that type of legal work; however, during a meeting at the law ft\u2122, Ms. Luxenberg introduced Ms. Seltzer to Mr. Dickens as the person who could do the required work. Mr. Dickens made, a few amendments in 2004 to the 1990 trust, and he prepared a general power of attorney as well as a healthcare power of attorney for Ms. Seltzer. In response to Ms. Seltzer\u2019s request, Ms. Luxenberg became a co-trustee of the trust; Ms. Seltzer remained as the other co-trustee. In mid-November 2004, Ms. Seltzer executed the amended trust as grantor and trustee, and Ms. Luxenberg signed the document as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In early 2007, Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Johnson decided to move the main office .of the firm, from the District of Columbia to Maryland, and .to maintain satellite offices in the District and Virginia. By this time Mr. Johnson\u2019s, law practice was limited and his time centered on administration of the firm. Even though he was not a member of the Virginia Bar and Ms. Luxenberg had knowledge of that.. fact, Mr. Dickens worked out of the Virginia office that the firm leased in February 2007; the lease was. signed by Mr. Dickens but the firm paid the rent for several months before delegating that responsibility to Mr. Dickens.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The management of the small firm was not rigorous after the 2007 move of the main office to Maryland and Mr. Dickens\u2019 relocation to the Virginia office. Although the firm appears to have some policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical obligations, these were either .loosely followed or not enforced with respect to matters handled by. Mr.' Dickens. Generally,. the firm held biweekly staff meetings during which open cases were reviewed; however, Mr. Dickens\u2019 attendance at these meetings decreased significantly, his participation by phone was sporadic, and there were occasions on which he .simply could not be reached. Moreover, despite the .firm\u2019s record-keeping policies, Mr. Dickens failed to execute, retainer agree-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>merits with clients that he represented, maintain proper billing records, and save electronic client documents to the firm\u2019s computer server. Even when the firm discovered that Mr. Dickens had clients for whom the main office had no records,\u2019 or when the firm received checks, sometimes for substantial amounts of money, without documentation\u2014as in the Garrity/O\u2019Brien matter\u2014the firm made little or no effort to ensure that Mr. Dickens followed its policies and procedures, as well as the ethical rules of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">There was limited contact between Ms. Seltzer and the Luxenberg firm in 2006 and 2007 regarding her trust. In late 2007, Ms. Seltzer was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer. She underwent surgery, followed by chemotherapy treatment which she received through 2009. During that period of time, in addition to Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s role as co-trustee of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trust, Ms. Seltzer and Ms. Luxenberg became friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Sometime in early 2009, Mr. Dickens advised.Ms. Luxenberg that he planned to leave the firm to spend time on other interests, but that he could still handle some legal matters; he traveled quite a bit, apparently in connection with a Middle East telecommunications venture and also business at the Vatican. Around April 2009, Ms. Seltzer contacted Ms. Luxen-berg because she desired some changes in her estate plan, to ensure that she properly provided for her adult children, Eric Seltzer and Jerri Seltzer Falk. She stated in an email on May 11 that if Ms. Luxenberg was too busy to handle her request and would like for Mr. Dickens to do so, that would be \u201cokay.\u201d On the same day, Ms. Luxenberg responded that Mr. Dickens \u201cwould have to deal with any trust questions.\u201d Thereafter, Ms. Luxenberg sent Mr. Dickens an email detailing information about Ms. Seltzer\u2019s children and the family trusts; she ended the email by saying, in part, \u201cI have told Michelle [Ms. Seltzer] I will still be involved and will talk to her and if necessary do conference calls with her and you.\u201d In addition, Ms. Luxenberg informed Ms. Seltzer that the firm would charge a discounted hourly rate of $375 \u201cbecause of our long relationship with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">When she had not heard from Mr. Dickens, Ms. Seltzer sent emails to Ms. Luxenberg on July 6, and again on August 10, about the lack of communication from Mr. Dickens. On August 12, 2009, Ms. Luxenberg sent an email to Mr. Dickens, saying \u201cI need to know if you can do this realistically. Otherwise we need to get someone else to do it.\u201d Mr. Dickens sent Ms. Seltzer a responsive communication and Ms. Lux-enberg arranged for Ms. Seltzer and Mr. Dickens to speak by phone on a certain date. After speaking with Ms. Seltzer on August 18, 2009, Mr. Dickens sent an email to Ms. Luxenberg outlining the work to be performed on the trust and other documents, and he included mention of \u201c[a] new trust\u201d for Ms. Seltzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Because Ms. Seltzer had not received any draft documents from Mr. Dickens and had learned that her cancer had \u201cmetastasized arid spread,\u201d she again reached out to Ms. Luxenberg on September 14, 2009, saying in part: \u201cIf this is an undertaking that [Mr. Dickens] is not interested in doing, I understand and perhaps I should find someone else. I do put my trust in both of you and that is why I felt you and [Mr. Dickens] could help me.\u201d Mr. Dickens claimed he had sent the documents by regular mail, then said he spelled the name of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s street incorrectly, and subsequently, he sent a package to Ms. Seltzer by FedEx on September 16, which she received. Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Dickens apparently had a-tense telephone conversation during which Ms. Lux-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>enberg requested copies of the Seltzer documents for the firm\u2019s central files; Mr. Dickens apparently took' offense at the tone and content of the conversation. By September 21, 2009, it became clear that the only document Mr. Dickens had sent to Ms. Seltzer at that point was the new trust, which -he discussed directly with Ms. Seltzer on September 21. Both Ms. Seltzer and Mr. Dickens informed Ms. Luxenberg on September 22 and 23, that they were making progress on the trust. Later, Ms. Seltzer\u2019s son (undoubtedly at the request of his mother) sent Mr. Dickens a list of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets, including account numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Sometime thereafter, Mr. Dickens traveled to Rome. Upon his return, he sent Ms. Seltzer an email on October 20, 2009, acknowledging her calls and questions while he was away, the potential need for some changes in the trust, and the need to schedule a date for signing the trust. Between October 20 and October 26, Mr. Dickens and Ms. Seltzer exchanged emails regarding a date for the signing of the new trust. Although Eric and Jerri were included in the email exchange, Ms. Luxenberg was not, except for an October \u201cFYI\u201d email to her from- Mr. Dickens on October 26, which included the chain of emails beginning on October 20. On the day of the signing of the new trust, November 2, 2009, Mr. Dickens met with Ms. Seltzer, Eric, and Jerri in the Luxenberg firm\u2019s Maryland office. Mr. Dickens did not provide a copy of the new trust, labeled the \u201cMichelle S. Seltzer Family Trust,\u201d to Ms. Seltzer\u2019s children before the meeting, and the schedule of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets was neither attached to the document she signed nor discussed during the meeting. Ms. Luxenberg did not see Ms. Seltzer or her children until the meeting had concluded; she claimed she did not know about the meeting or the signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">One month after the execution of the new trust, Ms. Seltzer-sent Mr. Dickens an email inquiring about her will,, and advising that she wanted to complete everything before going to Johns Hopkins for further treatment. She followed that, email with another on December 4 stating, \u201cif you still have any documents to complete could we take care of that now?\u201d Subsequently, on December 11, 2009, *Ms. Seltzer signed her new will, which essentially mirrored her old will, except that Mr; Dickens was appointed as personal representative of her will; the will named Stephen Johnson as Mr.' Dickens\u2019 successor. The will was witnessed by a non-lawyer employee of the firm, Stephen Gleichman, and by Billy Tollar, Mr. Dickens\u2019 friend who later became his spouse. Apparently Ms. Luxenberg did not see the new will before it was presented to Ms. Seltzer, but Ms. Luxenberg was copied on a December 8, 2009, email that scheduled the will signing for December 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">On December 23, 2009, Mr. Dickens was supposed to meet Ms. Seltzer at her bank, but did not appear. Ms. Luxenberg sent an apologetic email to Ms. Seltzer the following day stating that Mr. Dickens \u201cwent away for Christmas.\u201d But Mr. Gleichman had earlier informed Ms. Seltzer that Mr. Dickens was \u201cunfortunately stuck in court for a vicious case,\u201d as the reason.for his failure to keep the bank appointment with Ms. Seltzer;. Ms. Luxenberg reiterated that reason in a later communication to Ms. Seltzer. In response to Ms. Luxen-berg\u2019s email, Ms. Seltzer discussed her cancer treatments, and stated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry [Mr. Dickens] didn\u2019t relay where and why we were meeting since it wasn\u2019t extremely urgent. If he still wants to introduce himself to the officers of my bank, we\u2019ll have to do it after the. first [of the year].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In late January and early February 2010, Mr. Dickens filed an application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>an IRS EIN number for the new Michelle Seltzer trust; the information he sent to the IRS identified himself as \u201cGrantor\u201d and \u201cTrustee\u201d of the trust. He also notified Ms. Luxenberg about a change in his cellular service -\u201c[i]n preparation for ray move to Italy,\u201d and he received confirmation from the State Corporation Commission for the Commonwealth of Virginia that articles,,of incorporation for the limited liability corporation, JECRAL, LLC had been filed successfully. Earlier on December 11, 2009, (according to Mr, Dickens\u2019 First .Account for tlie Seltzer Family Trust, filed on March 25, 2011), Ms. Seltzer had purchased, an Assignment of a 1% interest in JECRAL and FRW Telecom with a demand note payable to Mi\u2019. Dickens in his individual capacity in. the amount of $685,000,</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">, Ms. Seltzer\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate, and her daughter notified Mr, Dickens on February 14, 2010, that Ms. Seltzer had been placed in hospice, care-at Casey House in Maryland. Ms. Luxenberg bought several plants and went to see Ms. Seltzer on February 23. Until Ms, Luxen-berg encountered Mr. Dickens in the parking lot of Casey House, she was unaware that Mr, Dickens planned to visit Ms. Seltzer oh the same day to obtain her signature on a legal document. When Ms. Luxenberg arrived in Ms. Seltzer\u2019s room, Ms. Seltzer asked her to witness papers that Mr. Dickens had brought for Ms. Seltzer\u2019s signature, Ms. Luxenberg did not read the docum\u00e9nt she was asked to witness but she understood that it pertained to \u201cmarshallfing] assets for the trust for Michelle Seltzer .., that were left in the PNC Bank.\u201d Ms. Luxenberg did not recall Mr. Dickens reading or explaining the document to Ms.' Seltzer; nor did Ms. Luxenberg question Mr, D'ickens about the document which stated; \u201cTo Any and All Officers of PNC Bank[,] Please cash-in or liquidate all of the Certificates of Deposit that I have in your bank, -including, but not limited to all those listed on the attached two sheets and give the proceeds to Dorrance D. Dickens, who is my attorney.\u201d Ms. Luxenberg did not see \u201cthe two attached sheets\u201d because they were not affixed to the document that Ms. Seltzer signed. The other person who witnessed the document was Carolyn Hohlfeld, then a human resources employee with Montgomery County government who had assisted Ms. Seltzer while she was still working and receiving cancer treatments. She happened to be visiting with Ms. Seltzer on February 23 and Mr. Dickens asked her to witness a document.. Like Ms, Luxenberg, Ms, Hohlfeld did not read the document and did not recall seeing any attachments, but Ms. Hohlfeld questioned Ms, Seltzer to be sure. Ms. Seltzer was aware of the nature of the document she was about to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Armed with the February 23 document, Mr. Dickens proceeded to the PNC,Bank on February 26, 2010, and transferred Ms. Seltzer\u2019s PNC assets to another PNC account for which he was the sole signatory, the \u201cMichelle Seltzer Family TRT, Dorrance D. Dickens Trustee\u201d account. He deposited $20,000 of the funds into his personal account at another bank, the United Bank, on February 26, 2010. A few days later, on March 5, Ms; Seltzer, succumbed to her illness. Mr, Dickens removed a total of $60,000 from Ms, Seltzer\u2019s trust funds from two checks, written on March 8 and 11; he again deposited the funds in his personal account at United Bank. He also wrote a check to the Luxen-berg firm on the Seltzer trust' account on March 11, in the amount of $4,478 indicating on the memo line of the check \u201cLegal Fees.\u201d The firm\u2019s bookkeeper posed an email question to Mr. Dickens about the missing bill that would explain the check; Mr. Dickens\u2019 return explanation was limit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ed to, \u201c[A]s soon as I decompress I will log on and handle it.\u201d Nevertheless, the firm cashed the check without any record confirming that it was entitled to funds from Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trust, a fact that Ms. Luxen-berg acknowledged during her testimony before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Not long after Ms. Seltzer\u2019s memorial service on March 11, her children, Eric Seltzer and Jerri Seltzer Falk, communicated with Mr. Dickens by phone and email to inquire whether he was ready to meet with them about their mother\u2019s estate, but he \u201ckept putting [them] off.\u201d Eventually, on March 23, 2010, he notified the Seltzer children that he had been \u201ctraveling outside the country\u201d but had returned; however, he did not indicate when he would meet with Mr. Seltzer and Ms. Falk. When Ms. Falk\u2019s April 1 email to Mr. Dickens, inquiring as to when they might meet \u201cto discuss [the] will and other details,\u201d received no response, Stuart Plot-nick, the trustee of the trust created for Eric Seltzer by his father, called and requested Ms. Seltzer\u2019s will and trust; A paralegal at the Luxenberg firm reported the call by email to both Mr. Dickens and Ms. Luxenberg on April 15, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Seltzer informed Mr. Dickens on April 19 that he still had not received the requested documents. Finally, on April 20, the firm\u2019s paralegal sent the trust without the statement of assets, but not the will, to Mr. Plotnick. Mr. Plotnick immediately asked about the schedule of assets and Mr. Dickens responded via email, with a copy to Ms. Luxenberg, that he did not yet have a schedule of assets since \u201c[m]ost of the assets will be coming from the estate per the will.\u201d Mr.\u2019 Dickens sent another email to Mr, Plotnick on April 21, with a copy to Ms. Luxenberg saying, in party that he was \u201cin the process of going through the papers to locate the assets\u201d and mentioning the assets of \u201ca revocable trust\u201d as well as the irrevocable family trust that he had created for Ms. Seltzer. After Ms. Falk pressed the issue of Mr. Dickens\u2019 non-response in an email dated April 23, Mr. Dickens sent her a check and cash around April 26 to cover Ms. Seltzer\u2019s funeral expenses and honorarium for the rabbi who officiated at Ms. Seltzer\u2019s memorial service. It was in April and again in July 2010 that Ms. Luxenberg went to the PNG Bank with Mr. Dickens to transfer assets belonging to the 1990 trust to the 2009 trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms; Luxenberg billed Ms. Seltzer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>account for the second trip to PNC Bank with Mr. Dickens on July 13, 2010. As Trustee of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s amended 1990 trust and in accordance with Mr. Dickens\u2019 direction, she transferred $27,742.12 from the Michelle S. Seltzer Trust funds at the bank to the Michelle .Seltzer Family Trust, although she thought the funds were being transferred to \u201cthe irrevocable trust.\u201d On the same day she transferred a smaller sum for a total of more than $33,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">By early August 2010, Mr. Seltzer and Ms. Falk had not received the information they had requested from Mr. Dickens about the assets of the trust. Mr. Seltzer reported to his sister on August 2 that hq had spoken with .Mr. Dickens who said \u201che ha[d] run into complications with [Ms. Seltzer\u2019s] assets because [she] has two trusts.\u201d Mr. Seltzer added that Mr. Dickens \u201c[s]ays he will know soon how much is in the estate and then I imagine [he] will also work on getting checks out to us that were promised at the end of last month.\u201d On August 9 Mr. Seltzer again pressed Mr. Dickens by asking for an accounting of the assets in the Seltzer trust set up by Mr. Dickens, requesting \u201ccopies of the first trust\u201d as well as an accounting, and inquiring \u201cwhere the assets are being kept (for example, where [his] half of [his mother\u2019s] life insurance proceeds are.\u201d Mr. Dickens sent an extensive response on August 10, outlining what purportedly were the steps he still had to take, promising to send Mri Seltzer and Ms. Falk $5,000 each that day, and indicating that Ms. Luxenberg \u201cis cooperating to get this done as efficiently as possible.\u201d Ms. Falk sent a rapid response to Mr. Dickens, with a copy to Ms. Luxen-berg, asserting in part that more important than a distribution was \u201ca full and accurate accounting of the assets that are supposed to be in the trust.\u201d Shortly after receiving her copy of Ms. Falk\u2019s email, Ms. Luxenberg asked Mr. Dickens for \u201call of the documents in the Seltzer file,\u201d informed him that she had neither the trust documents nor the will, and reminded him that he had promised to submit the Seltzer file \u201ca while ago when [he was] traveling the globe.\u201d Although Mr. Dickens sent Ms. Luxenberg some files, he did not transmit the schedule of assets or information about any of the trust bank accounts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>As the December 6, 2010, deadline approached for the filing of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s Maryland Estate Tax return, Ms. Gelfeld sent a formal letter to Mr. Dickens and Mr. Johnson expressing (1) concern that the estate might owe Maryland estate tax, and (2) concern not only about the absence of an accounting of estate and trust assets but also about the \u201c[inability of Trustee to administer the Trust on a reasonable and timely basis.\u201d Ms. Luxenberg was aware of Ms. Gelfeld\u2019s letter through Mr. Johnson. Mr. Dickens sent an immediate defensive and partly dishonest response to Ms. Gel-feld claiming that he saw \u201cno reason not to file the return by the deadline,\u201d denying that the Luxenberg firm had any \u201cresponsibility for anything under either the trust or estate,\u201d asserting that he had the responsibility and that Mr. Seltzer and Ms. Falk had \u201creceived a copy of the trust and Schedule A [listing Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets] ... on the morning Ms. Seltzer signed the trust agreement,\u201d declaring that Ms. Seltzer personally transferred her PNC bank assets to her new trust, insisting that he was \u201cadministering the Estate and Trust in a reasonable and timely manner,\u201d and failing to mention that he had already pilfered a large chunk of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets. Mr. Dickens offered to meet with Ms. Gelfeld on the morning of December 15. On December 8, an associate in the office of Gary Altman, Mr. Seltzer\u2019s attorney, sent a letter to Mr. Dickens indicating that Mr. Altman could participate in the December 15 meeting by phone.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">As the new year dawned, Ms. Luxen-berg became aware that Mr. Dickens had billed over $25,000 in personal expenses to a firm credit card that she thought had been, closed out by Mr. Dickens after the firm had paid off $27,000 on the card in July 2007. Although Ms. Luxenberg had received calls from creditors about the credit card bill, \u2019She had hung up on the callers because she thought the card had been cancelled. Nevertheless, she began to communicate with Ms. DeLuca oh January 5, 2011, asking her to get Mr.' Dickens; who was facing heart surgery, to take card of the matter. Ms. Luxenberg explained during her hearing testimony that she was communicating with Ms. DeLuca instead of Mr. Dickens because \u201che wasn\u2019t returning her calls.\u201d However, Mr. Dickens sent a letter to Ms. Gelfeld and Mr. Altman on January 6, 2011, disclaiming that he had ever been asked to do an estate plan for Ms. Seltzer and asserting that had he done a plan for her he \u201cwould certainly [have] had a greater knowledge .of her assets and their whereabouts and. disposition than [he] actually did.\u201d He insisted that neither he nor Mr.-Johnson.had ever wanted to be a trustee of the trust or a personal representative of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s estate, and that after closing out the estate and the tax year, he would hand over the trusteeship. As the month of January drew to .a close, Ms. Luxenberg was trying to locate Mr. Dickens through Ms. DeLuca on January 21 to wish him' \u00e1 happy birthday, while Ms. Gelfeld and Mr,. Altman were writing to Mr. Dickens about serious problems they were discovering with his handling of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Dickens was trying to explain away their discoveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">By February 1, 2011, Mr. Dickens agreed to accept the recommendation of Ms. Gelfeld and Mr. Altman that Peg Shaw, an attorney licensed in .the District of Columbia, prepare a Seltzer trusts/estate accounting. As Ms. Shaw worked on the estate accounting, she raised questions with Mr. Dickens about missing items such as Ms. Seltzer\u2019s pension funds, and Mr. Dickens sought to deflect the questions. Before Ms. Shaw completed the draft estate accounting on February 21, based on the information provided by Mr. Dickens, he had taken more money from Ms. .Seltzer\u2019s assets\u2014$3,184.40 on February 10, and $6,000 and $12,000 on February 14. As Ms. Shaw began working with Mr. Dickens, but not Ms. Luxenberg, on the trust accounting in early March, she sent Mr. Dickens an email on March 2, 2011, informing him- that a page from, the estate tax return\u2014listing the assets relating to \u201cMortgages, Notes, and Cash\u201d\u2014was missing. On that same day Mr. Dickens took $25,000 from Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets. The following day Ms. Shaw sent Mr. Dickens an email attaching the draft trust accounting and stating in part, \u201cPlease review the doeument called Missing Assets. This shows what I can account for and what I can\u2019t account for. We need to And the missipg stuff.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ms. Shaw sent a Anal draft accounting to Mr. Dickens on March 14 with an extensive email identifying problems, including \u201cwhat happened to the approximately $300,000' in CD\u2019s owned by [Ms. Seltzer] until she liquidated them .., a few days before- her death.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On March 18, 2011, Ms. Shaw sent Mr. Dickens yet another email identifying missing items from the estate and trust accountings. That same day Mr. Dickens lifted $15,000 from Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets, and on March 29, he took $29,985.86 in proceeds from the Vanguard Mutual investment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Also on March 29, 2011, Mr, Dickens made a handwritten note on the $685,000 demand note that Ms. Seltzer had signed on December 11, 2009, stating \u201cTJiis note is. hereby satisfied, cancelled, and released this 29th day of March, 2011.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Mr. Altman sounded the alarm on March 29, 2011, when he attempted to reach Ms. Luxenberg, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Dickens by phone. He left a message saying, it was \u201can absolute emergency.\u201d Ms. Luxenberg tried to reach Mr. Dickens through Ms. DeLuca.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mr. -Altman fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>lowed his call with a letter dated March 30, 2011, indicating that there should be approximately $1,485,842 in Ms. Seltzer\u2019s estate and demanding, a distribution of $750,000 each to Ms. Seltzer\u2019s children, as well as Mr. Dickens\u2019 resignation, and that of Ms. Luxenberg, from their respective roles in Ms. Seltzer\u2019s estate and trust. Mr. Dickens sent letters to Ms. Gelfeld and Mr. Altman on April 7, April 19, 2011, and May 2, 2011, in an attempt to resolve the matter. He met with Mr. Altman and Ms. Gelfeld on April 27, admitted that his \u201ctel-com deal\u201d had been worthless since around August 2010, defended the Demand Note that Ms. Seltzer had signed, and promised to close out the Seltzer estate before departing on May 6, 2011. On April 29, Mr. Dickens removed another $11,000 from Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trust, allegedly for \u201cfees.\u201d Ms. Falk and Mr.' Seltzer filed a multi-count' lawsuit against Mr. Dickens, Ms. Luxenberg, and the Luxenberg firm on May 5, 2011. The parties settled and Ms. Falk and Mr. Seltzer dismissed the lawsuit against Ms. Luxenberg and thfe Luxenberg firm with prejudice, and dismissed the action against Mr. Dickens without prejudice on August 16, 2012.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Disciplinary Counsel began its investigation- of Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Dickens in July 201.1.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Both Ms. Luxenberg and Disciplinary Counsel filed Briefs before the Hearing Committee supporting their respective exceptions to the Committee\u2019s Report \u2018and Recommendation, as well as oppositions to the other\u2019s Brief.

Rule 1.3 (a) which mandates that \u201c[a] lawyer shall represent a client zealously and diligently, within the bounds of law[,]\u201d clearly requires the existence of an attorney/client relationship.

Committee nor the Board explicitly addressed whether an. attorney-client relationship generally existed between Ms. Luxenberg and Ms. Seltzer regarding the trusts and estates matter, although both briefly addressed whether Ms. Luxenberg acted in a legal capacity when she witnessed Ms. Seltzer\u2019s signing of the letter of instruction in February 2010. Nevertheless, the Committee and Board disagreed as to whether Ms. Luxenberg violated Rule 1.3 (a)\u2014the Committee determined that she did not, and the Board that she did violate Rule 1.3. On this record we first conclude that there was an attorney-client/fiduciary relationship between Ms. Luxenberg and Ms. Seltzer with respect to the trusts and estates matter. Second, we conclude that the record contains substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Luxenberg violated Rule 1.3 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">First, there is no doubt that Ms. Seltzer and Ms. Luxenberg had an attorney-client relationship, beginning in 1994 when Ms. Seltzer engaged Ms. Luxenberg to handle her divorce action. Later, Ms. Seltzer approached the Luxenberg firm in 2004 to update her estate plan, and although Ms. Luxenberg clearly informed Ms. Seltzer that she did not handle cases involving trusts and estates, she introduced Mr. Dickens, a partner in the firm, as a person who could do that type of work. Moreover, Ms. Luxenberg agreed to become a co-trustee of the 1990 Seltzer trust, replacing Ms. Seltzer\u2019s brother in that role. Again, in 2009 Ms. Seltzer, requested Ms. Luxen-berg\u2019s assistance to make additional changes to her estate plan. Although Ms. Luxenberg clearly stated that Mr. Dickens \u201cwould have to deal with any trust questions,\u201d Ms. Luxenberg informed Mr. Dickens that she would \u201cstill be involved and [would] talk to [Ms. Seltzer] and if necessary do conference calls with her and you,\u201d manifesting an intention that both she and Mr. Dickens would have an attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>relationship with Ms. Seltzer. <em>See In re Ryan, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7861283\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/670/375/#p379\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7861283\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/670/375/#p379\">670 A.2d at 379</extracted-citation>. Because Mr. Dickens, had not performed any work during an approximate . three-month period, Ms. Seltzer suggested to Ms. Luxenberg that perhaps she should find someone else to do the necessary work. Significantly, Ms. Seltzer also stated in the same communication that she \u201cput [her] trust in both [Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Dickens] and that is why [she] felt that [Ms. Luxen-berg and Mr. Dickens] could help.[her],\u201d clearly indicating Ms. Seltzer\u2019s perception that both Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Dickens were her attorneys. <em>See In re Lieber, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7944708\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/442/153/#p156\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7944708\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/442/153/#p156\">442 A.2d at 156</extracted-citation>. Consequently, the record supports the existence of an attorney-client relationship between Ms. Luxenberg/Mr. Dickens and Ms. Sqltzer regarding the trusts and estates matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Second, even though the Board and the Hearing Committee disagreed as to whether Ms. Luxenberg violated Rule 1:3 (a), our review of the record convinces us that Ms. Luxenberg violated the duty of diligence that the Rule mandates.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, Comment 8 to the Rule emphasizes that \u201cunreasonable delay can cause a client needless anxiety andundermine confidence in the lawyer\u2019s trustworthiness,\u201d and the Rule also underscores the fact that \u201c[n]e-glect of client matters is \u00e1 serious violation of the obligation of diligence.\u201d District of Columbia Rules of 'Professional' Conduct, Rule 1.3, Comment 8; <em>see also In re Reback, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7912767\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/487/235/#p238\">487 A.2d 235</extracted-citation>, 238 (D.C. 1985) (neglect means \u201cindifference and a consistent failure to carry out the obligations which the lawyer has assumed to [her] client or a conscious disregard for the responsibility owed to the client\u201d). The duty or obligation of diligence was particularly compelling in this case because Ms. Seltzer had been battling a terminal illness since 2007 and both Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Dickens were aware of the illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The record reveals Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s failure to recognize, \u2019at least by July 2009 that her longstanding trust in Mr. Dickens whs not warranted, especially in the face of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s declining health and anxiousness to complete work on the documents reflecting her wishes to protect\" and provide for her adult children. Although Ms. Lux-enberg had b\u00e9come a seasoned lawyer with an admirable track record of service to her clients and the legal profession, her actions and omissions manifested a consistent failure to carry out her obligation of diligence to Ms. Seltzer, Ms. .Luxenberg ignored clear warning signs that, the trust and confidence Ms. Seltzer had placed in her and Mr. Dickens was no longer justified. The warning signs included (a) Mr. Dickens\u2019 long delay in addressing Ms. Seltzer\u2019s 2009 request for additional modifications of her trust and estate documents; (b) Mr. Dickens\u2019 frequent travels abroad while work on Ms. Seltzer\u2019s matter was pending, and his notice to the Luxenberg firm that he would be moving to Italy; (c) Mr. Dickens\u2019 failure to honor Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s September 2009 request that he submit copies of the Seltzer trusts and estate documents to the firm\u2019s central files; (d) Mr. Dickens\u2019 failure to notify Ms. Luxenberg about Ms. Seltzer\u2019s November 2009 visit to the Lux-enberg firm\u2019s Maryland office .to sign the Seltzer Family Trust agreement; (e) the delay in Mr. Dickens\u2019 transmittal of the redraft of the Seltzer will to the client; (f) Mr. Dickens\u2019 failure to meet Ms. Seltzer at the bank on December 23, 2009, as planned and Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s confusion as to the reason for his failure;, and (g) Mir. Dickens\u2019 lack of notice to Ms. Luxenberg, a co-trustee of the 1990 amended trust, that he would seek Ms. Seltzer\u2019s signature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>on February 23, 2010, on a letter of instruction regarding the transfer of assets from the 1990 amended trust to the Seltzer Family Trust created by Mr. Dickens.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The events surrounding the letter\u2019of instruction substantiated Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s consistent failure to' carry out her obligation of diligence to her client, Ms. Seltzer. Notwithstanding Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s friendship with Ms, Seltzer, Ms. Luxen-berg had an attorney-client, and hence, a fiduciary relationship with Ms. Seltzer. That relationship not only covered' the legal work that Ms.\" Seltzer had requested in 2009 which had been unduly delayed, but also Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s fiduciary role as co-trustee of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s 1990 trust. Yet, Ms. Luxenberg had little idea about the content of the document\u2014the letter of instruction\u2014that Ms. Seltzer asked her to witness on February 23. Nevertheless, Ms. Luxenberg understood that the document concerned \u201cmarshalling] assets for the trust for [Ms.] Seltzer that were left in the PNC Bank.\u201d Even with this limited understanding, Ms. Luxenberg as co-trustee of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s 1990 trust did not bother to read the one sentence instruction to the officers of the PNC Bank, \u201c[p]lease cash-in or liquidate all of the Certificates of Deposit that I have in your bank, including, but not .limited to all those listed on the attached two sheets and give the proceeds to Dorrance D. Dickens, who is my attorney.\u201d Because she did not read the one-sentence instruction, she of course did not realize that nothing was attached to the letter of instruction, and did not comprehend the significance of the missing schedule of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s assets. Ms. Luxen-berg\u2019s failure to carry out her obligation of diligence to Ms. Seltzer under Rule 1.3 (a) left a clear path not only'for Mr. Dickens to go to the PNC Bank on February 26 to transfer some of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s PNC assets to an account over which he had control, but also paved the way for Mr. Dickens to return to the bank in April and July 2010, with Ms. Luxenberg, to transfer assets from the amended 1990 trust to the 2009 trust, assets that Mr. Dickens began-to transfer into his personal account.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s obligation of diligence and her fiduciary duty to Ms. .Seltzer included not only reading the letter of instruction, but also obtaining and reading copies of the 1990 trust, the 2004 amendments, and the .2009 trust.,As'a result of reading these documents, Ms. Luxenberg would have been aware of important-provisions of the documents and wo.uld have had a proper context for understanding the significance of the letter of instruction. She would have known at least the following. The beneficiaries of the 1990 trust were Ms; Seltzer\u2019s-children, Mr. Seltzer and Ms. Falk, and the co-trustees were Ms. Seltzer and her brother, Charles Schaffer; Article 8 (A) of the 1990 trust specified that when one of the co-trustees ceased to serve, the sole successor trustee could appoint a co-successor. Article 10 outlined the extensive fiduciary powers of the trustees. Under the 2004 Amended Michelle S. Seltzer Revocable Trust, Ms. Seltzer designated herself and Ms. Luxenberg as the co-trustees; Article 8 (B) provided that upon the death of either Ms. Seltzer or Ms. Luxenberg, \u201cthe other shall be the sole successor co-trustee\u201d and could \u201cappoint a corporate trustee or a child of th\u00e9 grantor, if over the age of 21, as a co-successor or successor trustee.\u201d The 2004 amehdment did not alter Article 10 regarding fiduciary powers, including Article 10 (1) concerning the power to transfer investments and property of the trust. A reading of these documents also would have na\u00e1de Ms. Luxen-berg cognizant of the fact that instead of again amending the 1990 trust in 2009, Mr, Dickens created a new trust, the Michelle S, Seltzer Family Trust, The trust document specified that trust was between Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Seltzer as Grantor or Settlor and \u201cDor-rance D.

Specifically, Disciplinary Counsel maintains that Ms. Luxenberg had managerial authority within the firm because \u201cthe Board noted [her] roles as founder, decision-maker, and business-generator, her controlling interest and her husband\u2019s low practice profile,\u201d all of which \u201cestablished her as a partner and lawyer with managerial authority in the firm, even if she called her husband \u2018managing partner.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">The plain words of Rule 5.1 (a) assign \u201cpartners,\u201d and lawyers who have \u201cmanagerial authority in a law firm\u201d the responsibility of making \u201creasonable efforts to ensure\u201d that the firm\u2019s lawyers \u201cconform to the Rules of Professional Conduct;\u201d District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 5.1 (a), and Comment 1. Rule .5.1 (a) of the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct is virtually the same as the District\u2019s Rule 5.1 (a), and Comment 1 to the rule states that \u201cParagraph (a) applies to lawyers who have managerial authority over the\u2019 professional work of a firm.\u201d However, the comment further specifies that \u201c[t]his includes members of a partnership.\u201d ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 5.1 (a), and Comment 1; <em>see also </em>Center for Professional Responsibility, ABA, <em>Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct, </em>443 (5th ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Ms. .

The Hearing Committee found that she was the majority owner (52%) of Luxenberg, Johnson &amp; Dickens, and she generally made the decisions as to what clients the firm would represent and who would handle the client matters. Indeed, she identified and introduced Mr. Dickens to'Ms. Seltzer as the firm lawyer who would handle Ms. Seltzer\u2019s 2004 request, and later her 2009 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Despite Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s effort to distance herself from Mr, Dickens with respect to Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trusts and estates matter, it is dear that Mr. Dickens considered himself a member of the Luxenberg firm; indeed, he clearly identified himself in the 2009 trust document as \u201cDorrance D. Dickens, trustee, of Luxenberg, Johnson and Dickens, P.C.\u201d Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s actions also reflected her belief that Mr. Dickens was still a member of the Luxen-berg firm; she sent communications to him at the firm\u2019s Virginia satellite office, and continued efforts to reach Mr.- Dickens through the administrator of the firm\u2019s Virginia office. Moreover, Ms. Luxenberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>had made clear to Mr. Dickens in 2009, in writing, that she would continue to be \u201cinvolved\u201d in the Seltzer matter. In short, the record contains substantial evidence that even though Ms. Luxenberg did not have the title of managing partner, she was a \u201cpartner\u201d with \u201cmanagerial authority\u201d during the time the firm handled Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trusts and estates matter; therefore, she fell under the coverage of Rule 5.1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">While the firm had some policies and practices that would assure its lawyers conformed to the Rules of Professional Conduct, Ms. Luxenberg did not make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to make certain these policies and procedures actually were in effect and followed. Notably, she took no action when Mr. Dickens began to and continued to miss firm meetings during which firm client matters were reviewed, and despite the firm\u2019s policy that all client records should be sent to the firm\u2019s main files, she did not make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ensure Mr. Dickens\u2019 compliance with the policy after he did not. respond to repeated requests for the Seltzer documents, or to Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s admonition about the missing documents in a tense phone call around September 2009, prior to the execution of the 2009 trust document.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">As we indicated in discussing Rule 1.3 (a), Ms. Luxenberg \u201cwas on notice that matters relating to [Ms. Seltzer\u2019s] trust ... were awry.\u201d <em>In re Robinson, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306546\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/74/688/\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306546\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/74/688/\">74 A.3d at 696</extracted-citation>. Ms. Luxenberg may have \u201cassumefd]\u201d that Mr. Dickens would follow the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 5.1 (a), Comment 3, but she did not make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ensure that Mr. Dickens\u2019 behavior conformed to the Rules of Professional Conduct. Since, the firm was very small initially, informal enforcement of policies and procedures and \u201coccasional admonition ordinarily might be sufficient,\u201d Rule 5.1 (a), Comment 3. However, as we asserted in <em>In re Robinson, </em>once warning signs appeared, suggesting clear problems regarding ethical behavior, informal enforcement and occasional admonition no longer sufficed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Similar conclusions were reached in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v.

He was no longer in the same office with his mentors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>partners'. Particularly when warning signs appeared that things definitely were not in order with respect to Mr. Dickens\u2019 work on the Seltzer trusts and estates matter, as a partner with managerial authority over the Seltzer matter, Ms. Luxenberg should have instituted periodic reviews and intervened.to make certain that Mr. Dickens was doing the Seltzer work in a timely manner and was conforming to the Rules of Professional Conduct in his handling of the Seltzer trust assets. As the court said in <em>In re Fonte, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3978164\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/75/199/\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em>\u201c[i]n the face of ... warning [signs], [especially of improper handling of trust assets], greater oversight and immediate intervention was warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. In sum, the record contains substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding and conclusion that Ms. Luxenberg violated Rule 5.1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Second, Ms. Luxenberg contends that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s conclusion [that she violated Rule 5.1 (c)(2) ] is incorrect inasmuch as Disciplinary Counsel failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that [she] had \u2018comparable managerial authority over [Mr.] Dickens or that [she] was his direct supervisor in connection with Ms. Seltzer\u2019s estate and trusts matter.\u201d Disciplinary Counsel argues that \u201c[t]he Board and Committee found that [Ms.] Luxenberg had enough \u00f3f a supervising role for Rule 5.1 (c)(2) to apply, including \u2018direct supervisory authority over [Mr.] Dickens in the Seltzer matter.\u201d Disciplinary Counsel maintains that Ms. Lux-enberg knew or should have known of Mr. Dickens\u2019 misconduct because she \u201cwas very much involved in Ms. Seltzer\u2019s case, not only as her lawyer, but as a trustee of one of her trusts\u2014a position derived from being Ms. Seltzer\u2019s lawyer.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The District\u2019s Rule 5.1 (c)(2) differs from that of the ABA Model Rule 5.1 (c)(2) in one noticeable way. The District\u2019s rule contains \u201cknow or reasonably shpuld know\u201d language while the ABA Model Rule contains only the word \u201cknow.\u201d Under the District\u2019s Rule, there is substantial 'evidence supporting the Board\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Luxenberg \u201creasonably should [have] know[n] of [Mr. Dickens\u2019] conduct at a time when its consequences [could have] be[en] avoided but fail[ed] to take reasonable remedial action.\u201d Rule 5.1 (c)(2). This court previously rejected a contention that the District\u2019s Rule is \u201cunfair\u201d because it \u201csubjects [a lawyer] to discipline for the dishonesty or misrepresentations of another attorney of which the [lawyer] had no knowledge.\u201d <em>In re Cohen, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9265932\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/847/1162/\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9265932\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/847/1162/\">847 A.2d at 1166</extracted-citation>. We said that, \u201cas the Board recognized, in going beyond the model rule, Rule 5.1 (c)(2) reflects what this jurisdiction has determined to be a fair and necessary balance.

However, Ms. Luxenberg was the main, majority partner in a very small firm with, as of 2007, a central office in Maryland and satellite offices in Virginia and the District of Columbia. The Hearing Committee found that Ms. Luxenberg brought most of the business to the firm, and Ms. Seltzer not only was Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s client but Ms. Luxenberg also was the co-trustee of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s 1990 trust, as amended in 2004, While Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s contacts with Mr. Dickens were frequent when the firm\u2019s main office was in the District of Columbia and Mr. Dickens worked out of that office, the contacts were increasingly less frequent after Ms. Luxenberg and Mr. Johnson moved their offices to Maryland and Mr. Dickens chose to work out of .the Virginia office. Under these circumstances\u2014and at the first signs, that Mr. Dickens was not adhering to firm policies (including attendance at firm meetings), failed to complete the work on the Seltzer matter in a reasonable time period, failed to send the Seltzer documents to the firm\u2019s central files, missed a meeting with Ms, Seltzer, failed to inform Ms. Luxenberg of the new 2009 trust document which implicated the 1990 amended trust of which Ms. Luxenberg was a co-trustee, and failed to inform Ms. Luxenberg of the date of the execution of the 2009 trust or the nature of the letter of instruction that Ms. Luxen-berg was asked to witness\u2014Ms. Luxen-berg should have become more vigilant in monitoring Mr. Dickens\u2019 adherence to the Rules of Professional Conduct. At these warning signs, and others discussed above in our consideration of Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s violation of Rule 1.3 (a), \u201c[w]e believe a lawyer of reasonable prudence and -competence would have made the inquiry necessary to determine\u201d whether Mr. Dickens was properly handling Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trusts and estates matter in a timely fashion. <em>In re Cohen, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9265932\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/847/1162/\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9265932\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/847/1162/\">847 A.2d at 1167</extracted-citation>.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">With respect to Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s alleged violation of Rules 1.7 (b)(4) and 8.4 (a), Disciplinary Counsel essentially argues that Ms. Luxenberg placed' her own interests and those of Mr. Dickens above Ms. Seltzer\u2019s interests, repeatedly displayed her unwillingness to challenge Mr. Dickens, and knowingly assisted or aided and abetted Mr. Dickens in his violation of (a) Rule 1.3 (discussed above), (b) Rule 1.15 (a) and (c) (misappropriation of entrusted funds), and (c) Rule 5.5 (a) (delegated the Seltzer matter to Mr. Dickens while knowing he was not licensed to practice in Maryland).

The record is devoid of substantial evidence showing that Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s representation of Ms. Seltzer was adversely affected by her representation of another client, or that her responsibilities to or interests in Mr. Dickens adversely affected her repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>sentation of Ms. Seltzer, or that her own interests adversely affected those of Ms. Seltzer. In fact, the Hearing Committee found no conflict of interest. The gravamen of Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s Rule 8.4 (a) argument against Ms. Luxenberg is that she knowingly assisted or aided and abetted Mr. Dickens in his illegal actions, but just as the record contained no substantial evidence of Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s intentional action with respect to Rules 1.3 (b)(1) and (2), the record lacks substantial evidence establishing that Ms. Luxenberg knowingly assisted, aided, or abetted Mr. Dickens\u2019 illegal actions. Most significantly, as the Board pointed out, Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s credited testimony reveals her steadfast belief that as soon as the 2009 trust became effective, the assets of the 1990 trust were transferred to the 2009 trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">What is the Appropriate Sanction for Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s Violation of Rules 1.3, 5.1 (a), and 5.1 (c)(2)?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We are mindful that the Board\u2019s recommended six-month sanction comes to us \u201cwith a strong presumption in its favor.\u201d <em>In re Silva, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279626\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/29/924/#p926\">29 A.3d 924</extracted-citation>, 926 (D.C. 2011). If the recommended sanction \u201cfalls within a wide range of acceptable outcomes, it will be adopted and imposed.\u201d <em>In re Goffe, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11292475\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/641/458/#p463\">641 A.2d 458</extracted-citation>, 463-64 (D.C. 1994). In reviewing' the recommended sanction, we consider various non-exclusive factors including \u201c(1) the seriousness of the conduct at issue; (2) the prejudice, if any, to the client which resulted from the conduct; (3) whether the conduct involved dishonesty and/or misrepresentation; (4) the presence or . absence of violations of other provisions of the disciplinary rules[;] (5) whether the attorney had a previous disciplinary history; (6) whether or not the attorney acknowledged his or her wrongful conduct; and (7) circumstances in mitigation of the conduct.\u201d <em>In re Pelkey, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"8185676\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/962/268/#p281\">962 A.2d 268</extracted-citation>, 281 (D.C. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Here, there can be no doubt of the seriousness of Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s conduct because her lack of diligence and failure to ensure that Mr, Dickens\u2019t behavior conformed to the Rules of Professional Conduct enabled him to siphon away substantial assets of the Seltzer trust belonging to Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s longstanding client, Michelle Seltzer. We recognize that Ms. Lux-enberg made it quite clear that she did not specialize in trusts and estates but that does not serve as an excuse-for failing to carry out her fiduciary duty to Ms. Seltzer as both her lawyer and the co-trustee of the amended 1990 trust. Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s violation of. Rules 1.3 (a), 5.1 (a), and 5.1 (c)(2) undoubtedly played a role in Mr. Dickens\u2019 misappropriation of the Seltzer trust assets that clearly prejudiced Ms. Seltzer who was dedicated to ensuring her children were provided for and protected after her death. However, Ms. Luxenberg was not charged with dishonesty, misrepresentation, or misappropriation. Moreover, Ms, Luxenberg cooperated'with Disciplinary Counsel, has no prior disciplinary history, and was found not to have violated other professional- conduct rules. Notably, as the proceedings before the Hearing Committee revealed, and as the Board recognized, Ms. 'Luxenberg has a \u201cvery high reputation in the legal community,\u201d and has shown her commitment to public service and to the Bar of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u2022Although there is no clear precedent in this jurisdiction for the type of sanction that is appropriate in Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s case, under the circumstances discussed in this opinion we do not believe Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s advocacy of a one-year suspension with a fitness requirement is, appropriate, given the absence of intentional conduct and-the lack of substantial -evidence that Ms. Luxenberg knowingly assisted or aided and abetted Mr, Dickens\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>misappropriation. Nor do we think that a simple reprimand as advocated by Ms. Luxenberg, or a 45-day suspension as recommended by the Hearing Committee would reflect the seriousness of Ms. Lux-enberg\u2019s violations. Rather, in reviewing the sanctions imposed in some of our cases, we believe Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s case falls within the range of sanctions imposed in <em>In re Robinson, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306546\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/74/688/\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em>which included a violation of Rule 5.1 (a) (as well, as Rules 1.15 (a) and (b)), and in <em>In re Cater, </em>which included a violation of Rule 5.3 (b) (comparable to Rules 5.1 (a) and (b) but relating to -supervision of a .nonlawyer) (as well as Rules 1.1 (a), 8.1 (b), and 8.4 (d)). In <em>Robinson, </em>which included a Rule 1.15 (a) violation (negligent misappropriation) we imposed a seven-month suspension, and in <em>Cater, </em>which included a Rule 8.4 (d) violation (seriously interfering with the administration of justice), we imposed a 180-day suspension plus a - fitness requirement. Consequently, consistent \u215e with the presumption in favor of the Board\u2019s recommended sanction, we accept the recommendation of the Bo\u00e1rd that a six-month suspension be imposed, without a fitness requirement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, respondent Deborah Luxenberg is hereby suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for a period of six months, effective' 30 days from the date of this opinion.

Mr. Dickens did not respond to Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s charges, take exception to the Board's Report and Recommendation, or file an appellate brief. The factual sunjmary section of this opinion includes facts pertinent to the cases of both Mr. Dickens and Ms. Luxen-berg. However, since Mr. Dickens did not participate in the, disciplinary proceedings, and, did not contest the Hearing Committee\u2019s and the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions, the analysis section of this opinion focuses only on arguments presented by Ms. Luxenberg. Furthermore, since Mr. Dickens has not contested the case against him, we conclude that Disciplinary Counsel has proven by clear and convincing evidence that he violated Rules 1.1 (a), 1.1,(b), 1.3 (b)(1) and (b)(2), 1.4 (a) and (b), 1.7 (b)(4), 1.15 (a) and (c), 8.1 (b), and 8.4 (b), (c), and (d) in the Harris, O\u2019Brien, and Seltzer matters, and he is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia, and as a condition of reinstatement ..he is required to malee restitution in the amount of $1,434,298.50, with interest at the legal rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\">.

While he was avoiding sending documents to or meeting with Mr. Seltzer, Ms. Falk, and Mr. Plotnick, Mr. Dickens continued to siphon funds from Ms. Seltzer's family trust to benefit his personal account at United Bank, including $30,000 on March 12, $70,000 on March 23, and $35,000 on April <em>2, </em>2010. Mr. Seltzer and Ms. Falk continued to seek a meeting with Mr. Di.ckens, as well as a list of assets, and proceeds from the trust in May and June 2010. In addition, Ms. Luxenberg attempted to reach Mr. Dickens by phone in late June after Mr. Johnson indicated that there was \"an immediate deadline\u201d regarding the Seltzer matter. Ms. Luxenberg sent Mr. Dickens a follow-up email on'June 23, 2010, asking \"when the deadline is or what [she] h[ad] to do,\u201d and closing the email with \"we need to get Seltzer done and I need to know what you want me to do.\u201d In the face of these requests for information Mr. Dickens removed more funds from the trust \u00e1nd placed them into his personal account -including, $12,300 on May 10, 2010, $7,500 on May 26, $15,000 on June 10, and $10,000 on June 24. He transferred another $50,000 to James Frelk on June 7; Mr, Frelk was not a beneficiary of Ms. Seltzer\u2019s trust or will and was not connected to Ms. Seltzer. He dipped into the Seltzer trust again in July 2010, taking $3,500 on July 8, and paying $43,719.05 to Tysons Audi on July -14 for a car that he and Mr. Tollar co-purchased, By that time, he had lifted approximately $360,000 from the trust, leaving only about $200 as the balance at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>end of July. He failed to properly deposit a $25,035.59 benefits payment from Montgomery County to the Seltzer trust, instead depositing it in his personal account on July 20, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">. Between August and November 2010, when Mr. Seltzer, Ms. Falk, and Ms. Luxenberg were seeking information from him, Mr. Dickens began to collect and take for himself funds from Ms. Seltzer\u2019s estate that were earmarked for her 1990 trust. These included funds from T. Rowe Price investments\u2014 $10,000 taken on August 9, $42,000 on August 25, $15,000 on September 3, $10,000 on September 20, and $17,000 on September 28 for a total of $94,000; funds from Vanguard Mutual investments\u2014$27,886 on October 8, $29,000 on October 15, $20,000 on November 10, $15,000 on November 18, (and later $29,985.86 on March 19, 2011), for a total of $121,871.86. In late November an attorney for Ms. Falk, Carole Gelfeld, tried to reach Mr. Dickens; after learning that he was reportedly ill, Ms. Gelfeld tried to reach Mr. Johnson, the successor trustee to the Seltzer family trust and successor personal representative for Ms. Seltzer's will. Mr. Johnson informed Ms. Luxenberg about the communication from Ms. Gelfeld, Ms. Luxenberg sent Mr. Johnson an email on November 30 stating \"I can talk to [Mr. Dickens] about this. If you don\u2019t want to. Someone has to.\u201d Mr. Johnson-in turn sent an email the same day to Mr. Dickens, with a copy to Ms. Luxenberg, stating in part \"DDD: HELP!!!!!!!!!!!

Instead of a face-to-face meeting with Ms. Gelfeld, Mr, Dickens spoke with her and Mr. Altman by phone on December 15, Mr. Dickens claimed that he had filed the Maryland tax return on December 6 but acknowledged that he had not paid the tax that was due. Nor had he sent copies of the return to Ms. Gelfeld or Mr, Altman. Mr. Dickens agreed that modifications to the Seltzer family trust were required, and that he would step down as trustee in favor of an individual acceptable to the beneficiaries of the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\">.

Ms. Gelfeld testified before the Board that Ms, Seltzer\u2019s estate originally had approxi.mately $1.6 million, a.nd was \"left with well under $700,000\" after Mr. Dickens\u2019 theift of Seltzer assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">. After Disciplinary Counsel filed specification of charges against Mr, Dickens and Ms, Luxenberg, the Board\u2019s Hearing Committee Number Twelve conducted the proceedings against both attorneys. In response to Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s motion, to which neither Mr. Dickens nor Ms. Luxenberg filed a response, on November 27, 2013, the Board issued an order assigning Mr. Dickens\u2019 and Ms. Luxenberg's cases to the same hearing committee and <em>sua sponte </em>consolidated the specifications of charges in both cases. Subsequently, on Februaiy 14, 2014, the Hearing Committee issued an Order in which it stated, in part, that \"[Ms.] Luxenberg is on notice that when considering the charges against her, the Hearing Committee may consider evidence presented in connection with [the Dickens\u2019 matters], as well as [the Luxenberg matters].\u201d Nevertheless, the Hearing Committee stated in its conclusions of law relating to the Seltzer matter that \"the Committee has considered against [Ms.] Luxenberg only the charges against her that are set forth in the Specification of Charges in which she is named.\u201d The Hearing Committee added, \"to the extent that certain of those' charges address [Ms.] Luxenberg's responsibility for [Mr.] Dickens\u2019 misconduct, the Committee has considered only whether she is responsible for [Mr.] Dickens\u2019 violations in the Seltzer matter, not whether she is responsible for [Mr.] Dickens\u2019 violations in the Harris or O'Brien matters.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">. We do not agree -with Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s argument that the 'Board \"in \u2019essence\u201d decided that Ms. Luxenberg violated Rule 1.3 (b)(1) and Rule 1.3 (b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">. In light of our conclusion, we see no need to fully address the Board\u2019s acceptance of two other arguments initially presented by Disciplinary Counsel before the Hearing Committee and later restated by the Board\u2014that Ms. Luxenberg violated Rule 1.3 (a), first by \"delegat[ing]. [Ms.] Seltzer\u2019s 2009 matter to [Mr.] Dickens while knowing that he was not licensed in Maryland, was rarely around, and already had made plans to leave the firm and practice of law,\u201d and second \u2018\u2018[Ms.] Luxen-berg neglected [Ms.] Seltzer\u2019s matter because she knew [Mr.] Dickens was not working on the Seltzer matter for four months, but took no actions to ensure that [Ms.] Seltzer was receiving proper representation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">. As a threshold matter, Ms. Luxenberg insists that the Board violated her due process rights under D.C. Bar Rule XI, \u00a7 8 (c) by considering evidence introduced in the Harris and O\u2019Brien matters, even though she was not charged in those matters, The Board acknowledged that the Hearing Committee considered evidence presented in the Harris, O\u2019Brien, and Seltzer matters in examining whether Ms. Luxenberg violated Rules 5.1 (a) and 5.1 (c)(2) because the evidence involved the administration of the Luxenberg firm. Section 8 (c) states in part, that the petition initiating disciplinary proceedings \u201cshall be sufficiently clear and specific to inform the attorney of the alleged misconduct.\u201d In its order of February 14, 2014, the Hearing Committee stated that \"Respondent Luxenberg is on notice that when considering the charges against her, the Hearing Committee may consider evidence presented in connection with the [Harris and O\u2019Brien matters].\u201d Since Ms. Luxenberg\u2019s hearing did not begin until March 31, 2014, she had ample and reasonable notice that evidence regarding the administration of her firm that might be presented in the Harris and O\u2019Brien matters might be used in determining violations in the Seltzer matter, and as the Board found, the pertinent evidence introduced \u201cdirectly related to the charges in the Seltzer matter.\u201d Furthermore, in prior cases, we have indicated that the Hearing Committee and the Board should consider such evidence. For example, in <em>In re Ukwu, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8376380\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/926/1106/#p1116\">supra,</extracted-citation> </em>we decl\u00e1red that \u201cthe Hearing Committee and the Board were inquired to consider- ... all five representations [of the lawyer] in determining whether [a specified rule] was violated.\u201d <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8376380\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/926/1106/#p1116\">926 A.2d at 1117</extracted-citation>. <em>See also In re Godette, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329887\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/1157/#p1165\">919 A.2d 1157</extracted-citation>, 1165-66 (D.C. 2007); <em>In re Shillaire, </em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7873824\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/549/336/#p343\">549 A.2d 336</extracted-citation>, 343 (D.C. 1988), both stating, respectively, that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>should have considered specified uncharged conduct or statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b353-5\">.
