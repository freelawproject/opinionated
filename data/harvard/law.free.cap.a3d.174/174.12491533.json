The plaintiffs contend that the arrest section of the department's policy (arrest policy) imposes\n   a ministerial, nondiscretionary duty on the police to search anyone taken into custody, including those taken into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a). See Newtown Board of Police Commissioners, Newtown Police Policy and Procedure 3.00 (revised February 1, 2005) (Police Policy). Alternatively, the plaintiffs argue that Lupienski was a prisoner and, therefore, subject to mandatory search under the department's prisoner transportation section of the policy (transportation policy). See id., 3.07 (revised May 5, 2009). The defendant counters that the arrest policy applies only in the context of criminal arrest and does not apply in the context of civil mental health custody, which is governed by \u00a7 17a-503 (a). The defendant also argues that the transportation policy does not apply to those under custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a). We agree with the defendant and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following undisputed facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiffs' claims arise from an incident at Danbury Hospital on March 2, 2010. While a patient at the hospital, Lupienski shot Andrew Hull, an assistant nurse manager. Lupienski had been transported to the hospital approximately thirty-eight hours earlier, after he went to the department complaining of auditory hallucinations and shortness of breath. Without searching Lupienski, Officer Steven Borges took him into involuntary custody and arranged for him to be transported\n   to the hospital by Newtown Emergency Management Services, as provided by \u00a7 17a-503 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs subsequently brought this action, seeking damages for, inter alia, the injuries sustained by Andrew Hull, and alleging that the police had a ministerial, nondiscretionary duty to search Lupienski pursuant to the arrest policy. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) it was immune from liability because any duty to search was discretionary rather than ministerial, (2) any requirement to search would have been a public duty resulting in a public injury rather than an individual injury, (3) there was no custody pursuant to the arrest policy and therefore no duty to search Lupienski, and (4) the plaintiffs had submitted no proof that a search would have revealed a weapon. The trial court denied the motion. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion seeking a legal ruling from the trial court as to whether \"custody\" under \u00a7 17a-503 (a) equates to \"arrest\" under the arrest policy. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that \"as a matter of law ... taking a person into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a) is not an 'arrest' and that Lupienski was not 'arrested' under the [Police Policy].\" As a result of the trial court's decision, the defendant filed a second motion for summary judgment, contending that the police had no duty to search Lupienski because he was not arrested under the arrest policy or under \u00a7 17a-503 (a). Several weeks later, the plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to include their alternative theory that alleged that the police had a duty to search Lupienski pursuant to the transportation policy. The trial court denied the plaintiffs' motion to amend and granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court also denied the plaintiffs' subsequent motion for reconsideration, which argued that the trial court improperly declined to consider the transportation\n   policy as an alternative legal basis for the duty to search. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs' primary argument implicates governmental immunity. Their theory of liability is that the police had a ministerial or mandatory, nondiscretionary duty to search Lupienski. The plaintiffs rest this conclusion on two premises. First,\n   the plaintiffs contend that the arrest policy requires officers to search arrestees, and that individuals, like Lupienski, who are taken into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a), have been \"arrested\" for the purposes of the arrest policy. Second, the plaintiffs offer as an alternative argument that the transportation policy imposed a ministerial, nondiscretionary duty to search Lupienski. The defendant counters that neither \u00a7 17a-503 (a) nor the arrest or transportation policies imposed such a duty and that, as a result, the defendant is shielded from liability due to governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \"Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Coley\n   </em>\n   claimed that the General Statutes and a Hartford police departmental policy that set forth procedures for police response to domestic violence imposed a nondiscretionary duty to \"remain at the scene for a reasonable amount of time until the likelihood of imminent violence had been eliminated ....\" Id., at 152,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20A.3d%20480\">\n    95 A.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We address each possibility in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiffs' first argument in support of their claim that the police had a ministerial duty operates in three parts: (1) the arrest policy expressly requires officers to search arrestees; (2) the arrest policy defines arrest as taking a person into custody; and (3) custody under the arrest policy encompasses custody as it is used in \u00a7 17a-503 (a). As a result, we must examine the meaning of custody in each context, interpreting the arrest policy first and then \u00a7 17a-503 (a). Although we agree that the policy requires that arrestees be searched, we conclude that the arrest policy applies solely to the criminal context\n   and therefore does not apply when the police take a person into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The department's arrest policy mandates that \"[o]fficers shall conduct a thorough search of the person arrested\"; Police Policy, supra, 3.00, pt. IV H, p. 4; and defines arrest as \"[t]aking a person into custody.\" Id., pt. III, p. 1. Assuming, without deciding, that the arrest policy imposes a ministerial duty to search those arrested, the question is what the policy means by \"custody.\" Looking to the text of the arrest policy, custody applies in the criminal context alone. Despite the lack of a definition of custody\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the arrest policy, our conclusion finds support in that policy's provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, under the arrest policy, arrest requires either an arrest warrant or probable cause. Id., pt. IV, p. 4. The arrest policy defines probable cause for an arrest as \"[t]he existence of facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonably prudent officer to believe that a person had committed a\n   <em>\n    criminal offense\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Id., pt. III, p. 1. This requirement of probable cause of a criminal offense corresponds closely with the state and federal understanding of probable cause. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960688\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/427/#p435\">\n    286 Conn. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435-36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=944%20A.2d%20297\">\n    944 A.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In order for a warrantless felony arrest to be valid, it must be supported by probable cause....

Thus, in the absence of an arrest warrant, the arrest policy allows arrests only where there is probable cause to believe that the arrestee committed a criminal offense. The reverse is also informative; under the arrest policy, any arrest not grounded in probable cause requires an arrest warrant. That option requires an officer to obtain an arrest warrant from a \"judge, magistrate, or other legal authority empowered to issue such warrants ....\" Police Policy, supra, 3.00, pt. IV C, p. 2. Thus, under the arrest policy, there is no arrest unless there is such a warrant, or there is probable cause for a criminal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, the arrest policy imposes procedural requirements that further clarify that the policy applies solely to the criminal context. For example, \"arresting officers shall identify themselves, inform the suspect of his or her arrest, and\n   <em>\n    specify the charges for which the arrest is being made.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Id., pt. IV D, p. 3. This requirement would be irrational and impossible beyond the criminal context. The same is true of the arrest policy mandate that \"[a]ll arrested persons shall be handcuffed after being taken into custody, except as otherwise provided by departmental policy ....\" Id., pt. IV F, p. 3. Relatedly, the arrest policy also directs that \"[a]rrestees shall be advised of their\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights before any questioning,\" inherently indicating criminal arrest. (Footnote added.) Id., pt. IV\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   , p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   These procedures underpin a scheme that would be absurd and troubling outside of the criminal context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having established that custody under the arrest policy applies in the criminal context, it is useful to summarize what the resulting meaning of custody is, as doing so further illustrates the criminal purview of the arrest policy. Custody in this court's criminal law jurisprudence is closely linked to the parameters of custodial interrogation set forth by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/#p444\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), and its progeny.

Indeed, many of the factors that suggest custody-such as handcuffing-would also suggest a formal arrest.

Determining whether custody has the same meaning pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a) and pursuant to the arrest policy presents a question of statutory interpretation, over which we\n   exercise plenary review, guided by well established principles regarding legislative intent.

If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered....

Section 17a-503 (a) provides that \"[a]ny police officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a person has psychiatric\n   disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, and in need of immediate care and treatment, may take such person into custody and take or cause such person to be taken to a general hospital for emergency examination under this section. The officer shall execute a written request for emergency examination detailing the circumstances under which the person was taken into custody, and such request shall be left with the facility. The person shall be examined within twenty-four hours and shall not be held for more than seventy-two hours unless committed under section 17a-502.\"\n   The text of section \u00a7 17a-503 (a) uses the term custody in a manner inconsistent with criminal custody or arrest. In \u00a7 17a-503 (a), custody is justified by a reasonable cause belief that a person is suffering from a psychiatric disability and may pose a danger to himself or others, or that a person is \"[g]ravely disabled, and in need of immediate care and treatment ....\" This stands in contrast to the criminal arrest requirement that there be either a warrant or a probable cause belief of a criminal offense. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Devenpeck\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916678\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/146/#p152\">\n    543 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916678\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/146/#p152\">\n    125 S.Ct. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a warrantless arrest by a law officer is reasonable under the [f]ourth [a]mendment where there is probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed\"). Thus, it does not matter whether reasonable cause for custody under \u00a7 17a-503 (a) is the same standard as probable cause for arrest, because they are clearly standards for two distinct purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Other language in \u00a7 17a-503 (a) illustrates that custody is not used in the criminal context. Specifically, \u00a7 17a-503 (a) allows the police to take a psychiatrically or gravely disabled \"person into custody and take or cause such person to be taken to a general hospital for\n   <em>\n    emergency examination\n   </em>\n   under this section.\" (Emphasis added.) As a result, the scope of custody is narrow under the statute-its purpose is to facilitate emergency evaluation, not to serve as the initial volley in an interrogation or a criminal investigation. This conclusion comports with this court's previous interpretation of \u00a7 17a-503. See\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952046\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/821/#p824\">\n    282 Conn. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 824, 848 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20A.2d%201030\">\n    925 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (explaining that officer who took individual into \"involuntary custody and caused him to be transported\" to hospital for psychiatric evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 [a] was \"serving less in a law enforcement capacity than in a health and safety capacity\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The other subsections of \u00a7 17a-503 further confirm the scope of subsection (a). They outline alternative\n   procedures for obtaining emergency treatment for individuals dangerous to themselves or others due to psychiatric disability, or with a grave disability. For example, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (b),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   probate courts may issue warrants \"for the apprehension [of] and bringing before it\" a person in need, and may order that such person \"be taken to a\n   general hospital for examination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, licensed psychologists or licensed clinical social workers can obtain immediate care or treatment for a person in need under \u00a7 17a-503 (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   respectively. Thus, the focus of \u00a7 17a-503 is on\n   providing emergency medical care to the psychiatrically or gravely disabled. Police custody under \u00a7 17a-503 (a) is just one route by which medical attention may be obtained, and the role of the police under the statute is roughly equivalent to probate courts in \u00a7 17a-503 (b), psychologists in \u00a7 17a-503 (c), or social workers pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (d). Thus, custody, as it is employed in \u00a7 17a-503 (a), is merely a tool in affording the medical relief embodied in the other provisions of \u00a7 17a-503-not a Trojan horse to import criminal procedure jurisprudence into an unrelated statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The relationship between \u00a7 17a-503 (a) and other statutes further illustrates that its use of the term custody does not denote criminal custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 17a-503 (a) is located in chapter 319i of the General Statutes, which governs \"Persons with Psychiatric Disabilities.\" Specifically, \u00a7 17a-503 (a) is in part II of that chapter, which sets forth general provisions for civil commitment. Other statutes in part II cover subjects such as the procedures for commitment hearings, confidentiality in cases involving persons with psychiatric disabilities, and commitment under an emergency certificate. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-498, 17a-500 and 17a-502.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 17a-503, then, is part of a broader legislative scheme focused on psychiatric\n   disability, mental health, and commitment, not criminal procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although we recognize that there is an aspect of involuntariness to custody under \u00a7 17a-503 (a), it is not enough to transform the act of taking into custody into criminal arrest. Section 17a-503 (a) is distinguishable: its aim is psychiatric treatment, rather than criminal justice; it requires reasonable cause to believe a person has a psychiatric or grave disability rather than probable cause for a criminal offense; and it prescribes an entirely different procedure grounded in its mental health purpose. As a result, under \u00a7 17a-503 (a), the police are not required to follow the same procedures that they would have been bound by in a criminal arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, the term custody is used differently in \u00a7 17a-503 (a) and in the arrest policy. The arrest policy plainly and unambiguously uses the term custody in the context of criminal arrest. In contrast, \u00a7 17a-503 (a) uses the term in the context of providing emergency medical treatment. In the present case, the police did not have a ministerial duty to search Lupienski under the arrest policy. Lupienski was taken into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a), but not into \"custody\" as understood in the arrest policy. Therefore, any duty to search arrestees under the arrest policy was not triggered, and no search of Lupienski was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The plaintiffs' other arguments in favor of this theory of liability are not persuasive. The plaintiffs caution that relegating the arrest policy to the criminal context would result in unfettered police discretion and deprive those taken into custody under \u00a7 17a-503 (a) of the procedural protections for arrestees under the policy. In the context of \u00a7 17a-503 (a), however, the only statute at issue in the present case, police discretion is limited by the narrowly cabined justification and procedures\n   outlined in its text. See\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952046\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/821/#p824\">\n    282 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   848 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20A.2d%201030\">\n    925 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that \u00a7 17a-503 [a] contains \"other safeguards against any abuse of power by the officer, which are provided by the unique statutory scheme at play in this case-such as immediate psychiatric evaluation\"). For example, in addition to the reasonable cause requirement, custody is qualified in \u00a7 17a-503 (a) by a requirement that a person be \"examined within twenty-four hours and ... not be held for more than seventy-two hours unless committed under section 17a-502.\" Should custody evolve beyond these narrow limitations, it very well may give rise to other legal and constitutional protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, it is well established that this court has a duty \"to construe statutes, whenever possible, to avoid constitutional infirmities ....\"\n   <em>\n    Denardo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bergamo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593117\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/272/500/\">\n    272 Conn. 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=863%20A.2d%20686\">\n    863 A.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The plaintiffs' interpretation of \u00a7 17a-503 (a) appears to raise constitutional infirmities because it would allow the police to conduct arrests without probable cause or a warrant. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Devenpeck\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916678\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/146/#p152\">\n    543 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5916678\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/146/#p152\">\n    125 S.Ct. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiffs also argue that there are similarities between criminal arrest and custody of the sort envisioned by \u00a7 17a-503 (a), because mental health related seizures under New York's civil commitment statute;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Mental%20Hyg.%20Law%20%C2%A7%209.41\">\n    N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law \u00a7 9.41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (McKinney 2011) ; have been described as arrests by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. See\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805199\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/85/#p88\">\n    711 F.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 (2d Cir. 2013) (characterizing that statute as \"authoriz[ing] the arrest of a person who appears to be mentally ill and acts in a manner likely to result in serious harm to himself or others\"). None of the authorities cited by the plaintiffs provides support for the argument\n   that taking a person into custody pursuant to a civil statute can constitute a criminal arrest.\n   In support of this claim, the plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Disability Advocates, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McMahon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9084602\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/279/158/#p164\">\n    279 F.Supp.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (N.D.N.Y. 2003), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Fed.%20Appx.%20674\">\n    124 Fed.Appx. 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2005), which held that \"while [ N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law \u00a7] 9.41 may not use the term 'arrest,' the authority it grants to the police is, in fact, the legal authority to arrest.\" The court made clear however, that arrests under that statute are not\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   arrests. See id., at 165 (noting that, \"by its plain terms, New York's Criminal Procedure Law is inapplicable to custodial detentions under the Mental Hygiene Law ... [and] courts have noted that conduct equivalent to mental illness which can result in custody under the Mental Hygiene Law cannot be considered an offense\" [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). Further evidence that arrest under \u00a7 9.41 is not a criminal arrest is apparent in the fact that \"the procedures employed by the police for [m]ental [h]ygiene pickups [under that statute] are significantly different [from] those employed in criminal matters.\" Id. The same is true with \u00a7 17a-503 (a) ; taking someone into custody under the statute does not trigger the same procedures that the police would be bound by during a criminal arrest. Therefore, even though mental health seizures have been described as \"arrests,\" they are not criminal arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, we reject the plaintiffs' argument that those in custody under \u00a7 17a-503 (a) are subject to search incident to arrest because civil arrestees are subject to search incident to arrest in other contexts, such as civil immigration arrests or under the New York civil commitment statute. Those issues are not before the court. Even if a search may be possible in such contexts, it does not mean that it is mandatory. That is the relevant question in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus, we hold that the arrest policy does not impose a ministerial duty on officers to search those taken into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a). Lupienski was not\n   taken into custody under the policy, and, therefore, he was not arrested and he was not subject to the search requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The plaintiffs' second claim is that the police had a ministerial, nondiscretionary duty to search Lupienski under the transportation policy. See Police Policy, supra, 3.07. We disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The transportation policy states that, \"[p]rior to transport, all prisoners shall be thoroughly searched for any weapons or contraband.\" Id., pt. IV, p. 1. According to the transportation policy statement of purpose, the policy is in place to \"provide guidelines for transporting persons in the custody [of the] ... officers.\" Id., pt. I, p. 1. The text of the prisoner transportation policy indicates that its purview is criminal and does not implicate mental health custody. For example, the policy requires officers to \"handcuff (double-locked) all prisoners with their hands behind their back with palms facing outward.\" Id., pt. IV B, p. 1. There is an exception to this requirement for the \"medically ill,\" but not for the psychiatrically disabled. Id., p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the present case, Lupienski was not in custody or arrested within the meaning of the policy for the reasons discussed in the preceding section, and, therefore, the transportation policy is inapposite. There was no prisoner to search. Furthermore, the focus of the transportation policy on criminal arrest procedures, like handcuffing, illustrates that the policy is not intended to govern transport to the hospital pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, the transportation policy has a broad definition of prisoner because it applies not only to those prisoners in custody, but also to those \"awaiting interrogation, arrest processing, transfer to court, or other administrative procedures ....\" Police Policy, supra, 2.01, pt. II, p. 1 (revised July 1, 2008). The plaintiffs' reliance on this language is misplaced because it comes not from the transportation policy, but rather from a separate chapter of the policy focused on prisoner holding facilities. Id. The full sentence states that \"[i]t is the policy of this agency to provide secure temporary holding cells for prisoners awaiting interrogation, arrest processing, transfer to court, or other administrative procedures, and to maintain these facilities in a sanitary and safe manner.\" Id. This statement does not expand the definition of prisoner, or list reasons someone may be in custody, but merely details situations in which holding cells should be available to someone who is already a prisoner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We therefore reject the plaintiffs' argument that Lupienski was a prisoner under the transportation policy and that, as a result, the officers were required to search him before sending him to the hospital. Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that the defendant did not have a ministerial duty to search Lupienski under the policy when he was taken into custody pursuant to \u00a7 17a-503 (a) and properly granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.

Instead, I would conclude that the plain meaning of the word \"[a]rrest,\" which is defined in the policy as \"[t]aking a person into custody,\" creates a ministerial duty requiring the police to search anyone who has been taken into custody for whatever reason.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20A.3d%20166\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   pt.

I will add facts and law only when necessary to advance the discussion set forth in this dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It should be noted that, after his interaction with Stanley Lupienski, Officer Steven Borges proceeded to fill out a \"police emergency examination request\" form to be provided to both the ambulance driver and the hospital. The form, which is issued by the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, contains the following language: \"Any police officer who has reasonable cause to believe that a\n   person has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, and in need of immediate care and treatment, may take such person into custody and take or cause such person to be taken to a general hospital for emergency examination under this section. The officer shall execute a written request for emergency examination detailing the circumstances under which the person was taken into custody and such request shall be left with the facility. The person shall be examined within twenty-four hours and shall not be held for more than seventy-two hours unless committed under section 17a-502.\" This language\n   comes, almost verbatim, from \u00a7 17a-503 (a). Borges signed the form in a box beneath a sentence stating: \"It is my belief that the above named person is mentally ill and dangerous to himself, herself or others or gravely disabled and is need of immediate care and treatment.\" At no point did any member of the department make any effort to search or frisk Lupienski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The department's manual contains a policy governing the subject of arrests. Policy Manual, supra, 3.00. This policy begins with a section entitled \"definitions,\" and the first term listed therein is \"[a]rrest,\" which is defined as \"[t]aking a person into custody.\" Id., pt. III, p. 1. A later section of the policy, entitled \"[s]earch [i]ncident to [a]rrest\" provides that \"[o]fficers shall conduct a thorough search of the person arrested.\" Id., pt. IV H, p. 4. The defendant, the town of Newtown, admitted in the underlying pleadings that the policy governing arrests would have applied any time one of its police officers \"took a person into custody\" and that \"it was mandatory for officers to conduct a thorough search of any person taken into custody.\" The defendant further admitted that \"[u]nder the policy governing arrests, officers did not have discretion to decline to search a person taken into custody,\" and that \"[u]nder the policy ... the duty of an officer to search a person who had been taken into custody was not left to the judgment or discretion of the officer.\" The defendant admitted these statements and then added that the policy applied when someone was arrested. In my view, it is clear that the policy applied when someone is arrested. It is also clear that the policy defines an arrest to be whenever someone is taken into custody. The policy does not define arrest to mean someone is taken into custody \"for a criminal offense.\" The majority has now added words to the definition which do not appear in the policy. In my view, respectfully, since both the policy\n   and definition are plain and unambiguous we should not be placing our own judicial gloss on that definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The policy explicitly requires that, in the case of an arrest, \"[o]fficers shall conduct a thorough search of the person arrested.\" Policy Manual, supra, 3.00, pt. IV H 1, p. 4.

See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 52-143 (e) (if witness fails to respond to subpoena to testify in court, the court \"may issue a capias directed to some proper officer to arrest the witness and bring him before the court to testify,\" though no criminal offense has been committed); see also\n   General Statutes \u00a7 17b-745 (a) (8) (authorizes judges and family magistrates to enforce family support orders through noncriminal contempt, and if defendant fails to appear for contempt hearing judge or magistrate may order official \"to arrest such defendant and bring such defendant before the Superior Court for a contempt hearing\"); General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a) (\"[a]ny probation officer may arrest any defendant on probation without a warrant\n   or may deputize any other officer with power to arrest to do so by giving such other officer a written statement setting forth that the defendant has, in the judgment of the probation officer, violated the conditions of the defendant's probation\"). Similar authority exists for the arrest of parolees who have committed technical, i.e., noncriminal-parole violations. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-127 (police officers \"shall arrest and hold any parolee or inmate when so requested, without any written warrant\"); see also General Statutes \u00a7 17a-503 (a) (authorizes police officer to take person into custody when officer has reasonable cause to believe \"has psychiatric disabilities and is dangerous to himself or herself or others or gravely disabled, and in need of immediate care and treatment\"); General Statutes \u00a7 17a-503 (b) (court of probate may, on application, \"issue a warrant for the apprehension\" of person alleged to suffer from psychiatric disability); General Statutes \u00a7 52-489 (courts may, through writ of ne exeat, order person taken into custody to compel bond ensuring continued presence within state). Therefore, in my view, it is clear that the meaning of the term \"arrest\" in the law quite commonly extends to civil as well as criminal confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Application of the policy requiring police to conduct mandatory searches to civil arrests, such as those under \u00a7 17a-503 (a), is required by that policy's plain text. Persons taken into custody under \u00a7 17a-503 are subject to search incident to that arrest. As the United States\n   Supreme Court has held, in upholding a search incident to a civil immigration arrest: \"There can be no doubt that a search for weapons has as much justification here as it has in the case of an arrest for crime, where it has been recognized as proper.... It is no less important for government officers, acting under established procedure to effect a deportation arrest rather than one for crime, to protect themselves and to insure that their prisoner retains no means by which to accomplish an escape.\"\n   <em>\n    Abel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163406\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/217/#p236\">\n    362 U.S. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163406\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/217/#p236\">\n    80 S.Ct. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163406\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/362/217/#p236\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960).

Thus, the definition of \"arrest\" set forth in the definitions section of the policy, which refers explicitly to people who have been taken into custody, makes even more sense when considered in this context. Policy Manual, supra, 3.00, pt. III, p. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The majority cites to the policy's definition of \"probable cause for arrest\" in support of its conclusion. See id. That phrase is defined as, \"[t]he existence of facts and circumstances that would lead a reasonably prudent officer to believe that a person had committed a criminal offense.\" Id. This phrase is the one point in which the policy uses the term \"criminal offense.\" The phrase is neither located in the definition of \"arrest,\" nor the identification of the lawful bases for an arrest. In my view, it is clear that the department knew how to insert the phrase \"a criminal offense\" when it wanted to. The fact that the department chose not to insert the phrase when defining the term \"arrest,\" and further chose not to use the term to further clarify the phrase \"taken into custody,\" evinces a clear intent that the term\n   should apply to any custodial situation. The majority further recites the procedural requirements which it maintains make it clear that the arrest policy only applies in the criminal context. For example, it recites language in the policy requiring that\n   \"arresting officers shall identify themselves, inform the suspect of his or her arrest, and specify the charges for which the arrest is being made.\" Policy Manual, supra, 3.00, pt. IV D 3, p. 3. Again, these procedures apply equally to any civil arrest. The officer need only recite the statute pursuant to which he is exercising authority over the person detained and seized. The term arrest is equated with seizure. The fact that Lupienski was taken into custody is not disputed. Pursuant to the Policy Manual, the officer was required to perform a search of Lupienski at that time. The fact that a search was not performed exposes the defendant, in my view, to potential liability. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case with instructions to deny the defendant's motion for summary judgment and for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    I note that, \"[i]n construing [municipal] regulations, the general rules of statutory construction apply.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Zoning Board of Appeals\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710391\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/227/71/#p89\">\n     227 Conn 71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 89,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20A.2d%201089\">\n     629 A.2d 1089\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993), cert. denied,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"234465,233123,231592,235434,233164,231405,234429,233201,235698,231601,233205,233846,233949\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/1164/\">\n     510 U.S. 1164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20S.%20Ct.%201190\">\n     114 S.Ct. 1190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20540\">\n     127 L.Ed.2d 540\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1994) ; see also\n    <em>\n     Schwartz\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Planning &amp; Zoning Commission\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519028\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/208/146/#p153\">\n     208 Conn. 146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 153,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=543%20A.2d%201339\">\n     543 A.2d 1339\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1988).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    See Black's Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) (\"[a] seizure or forcible restraint\"); Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (\"[to] deprive a person of his liberty by legal authority\"); see also\n    <em>\n     People\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Gilmore\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3987348,3201959\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/76/548/\">\n     76 App.Div.2d 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 552-53,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=430%20N.Y.S.2d%20854\">\n     430 N.Y.S.2d 854\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1980) (\" '[a]rrest' has been defined as 'the taking, seizing, or detaining of the person of another, (1) by touching or putting hands on him; (2) or by any act that indicates an intention to take him into custody and that subjects him to the actual control and will of the person making the arrest; or (3) by the consent of the person to be arrested' \"), quoting 5 Am.
