Before Judge Russell.

The petition contained two counts. The first count was, in substance, as follows: During the year 1892, the town caused the water th'at theretofore accumulated on the main street of the town in a basin south and across the Southern Railway Company\u2019s line through the town from plaintiff\u2019s property, which had naturally theretofore run off in a southerly direction in drainage channels and ditches, to be negligently diverted from .its natural and usual- course, and \u25a0 forced in and upon the property of plaintiffs, their stable and garden lot, which since the year 1892 and up to the time of bringing the action has greatly injured and damaged plaintiffs, by causing the stable and garden lot to be badly washed and flooded in times of rains; the garden thus being made wet, washed, and unfit for cultivation and unproductive, and rendered unhealthy, whereby the enjoyment of the property was greatly diminished and its' value greatly lessened, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>plaintiffs damage in the sum of $500. The second count alleged: During the year 1902 the Town of Norcross cut a ditch alongside plaintiffs\u2019 hotel, and so elevated the outside of the sidewalk as to-throw a large portion of the water from the east side of the town into the ditch and away from formerly-used ditches along the street and sidewalk under the hotel and into a basement, flooding it in time of rains, by which the walls of the hotel and basement became saturated with water and cracked, causing the mortar and bricks to fall out, and the foundations, plastering, sides, and partitions to be undermined and rendered weak and dangerous. Plaintiffs have been thereby damaged in the sum of $500. One of the plaintiffs undertook to relieve the property from the effects of defendant\u2019s acts, and he was arrested by the town authorities and punished upon a charge of obstructing the sidewalks. Before the acts herein complained of, the water from the roof of the hotel ran along where the defendant dug the ditch, at no time running into or damaging the basement or hotel, or causing the same to-be wet, damp, and unhealthy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">The defendant pleaded a general denial as to both counts, and the statute of limitations as to the first. The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs complain that, the court erred in refusing to grant them a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\"><em>N. L. Hutchins </em>and <em>N. L.

The concluding words of the count, which lay the damages, and allege that the value of the property has been greatly lessened in a stated sum, would indicate that the purpose of the pleader was to sue for a permanent injury to the property as the result of the original wrongful acts committed at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>stated in the count. The plaintiffs can not complain if that construction most favorable to the rights of the defendant is placed upon the count. When so construed, the count will be held to be one for a permanent injury resulting from the original wrongful acts; and hence it was not erroneous to charge that the cause of action set forth in the first count of the petition was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> In charging the law in reference to the second count, the judge told the jury, in substance, that it was the duty of the plaintiffs to have controlled the water falling on their premises, and that if damage to the hotel building was caused by water falling from the plaintiffs\u2019 roof, they could not recover. This charge is assigned as erroneous, for the reason that it is not applicable to the facts. There was evidence from which the jury could find that the water from the roof of the hotel had been accustomed to fall upon the sidewalk and run into the street and be carried off in that manner; that the town authorities had caused the sidewalk around the hotel to be raised; and that the effect of this was to throw the water falling from the roof back upon the building, thereby damaging the property. The general rule is that when one is injured by the negligence of another, the injured party is bound' to lessen the damages as far as practicable by the use of ordinary care and diligence; but this rule does not apply in case of a positive tort. Civil Code, \u00a7 3802. In <em>Athens Manufacturing Company </em>v. <em>Rucher, </em>80 <em>Ga. </em>291 (4), it was distinctly held that whenever the right to enjoy one\u2019s property to its fullest extent is invaded, and injury results therefrom, he may recover any damages sustained by reason of such invasion, and he is not bound to do anything to avoid the consequences thereof. See also <em>Satterfield </em>v. <em>Rowan, </em>83 <em>Ga. </em>187. The act of the Town of Norcross, in causing the water falling from the plaintiffs\u2019 roof to run back upon their property, instead of passing off in the manner in which it had been accustomed to flow, was a direct invasion of the plaintiffs\u2019 property rights, and similar to the acts which were complained Of in the two cases cited. . The charge was erroneous, and the error was of such a character as. to require the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A0P\">\n<em>All the Justices concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
