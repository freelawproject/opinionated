Taylor challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction in his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. He argues that the district court should not have withheld the two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility on the grounds that he waited until the morning of trial to enter his guilty plea. Further, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that he truthfully admitted the conduct comprising the offense early in the proceedings and that he did not enter a. guilty plea earlier because he lacked an \u201cunderstanding of the process,\u201d lacked \u201ccommunication with counsel representing him through the time of his plea,\u201d and lacked a \u201cclear understanding of the \u2018armed career\u2019 provisions and how they created a minimum fifteen (15) year sentence for his offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">An appellate court\u2019s review of a sentence must start with the issue whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 404 (5th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 16, 2009) (No. 08-9339).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Whether a defendant clearly demonstrates an acceptance of responsibility is a question of fact. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>915 F.2d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1990). A finding that a defendant has not accepted responsibility is examined under a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 753 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.5). This court \u201cwill affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under [\u00a7 3E1.1] unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">This court has routinely upheld the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility when a defendant waits until the eve of trial to enter a guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>39 F.3d 568, 570 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1299 (5th Cir.1994). The record indicates that Taylor rejected two plea offers by the Government during the course of the proceedings and instead waited until the morning of trial to enter a guilty plea. Further, the district court determined that Taylor\u2019s attitude at the sentencing hearing did not reflect responsibility or contrition for his actions. The district court\u2019s denial of the downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not without foundation. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 458. Taylor has not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
