Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001), which rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to the felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). In addition, Diaz raises arguments that he concedes are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Avants, </em>278 F.3d 510, 522 (5th Cir.2002), which held that, although the appellant was in state custody and was represented by counsel, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel did not attach with respect to a federal charge for which the appellant had not yet been indicted. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
