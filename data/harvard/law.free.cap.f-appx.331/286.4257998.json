The complaint, which alleged that corrections officers, prison officials, and the Corrections Corporation of America were liable to Clay because another inmate at the Winn Correctional Center attacked him, was dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jui'isdictional in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2363-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The notice of appeal in a civil action must be filed within 30 days of entry of the judgment from which the appeal is taken. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The final judgment dismissing Clay\u2019s complaint was entered on April 29, 2008, but Clay\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed until November 2008, more than six months after that date. Because Clay filed did not file a timely notice of appeal, we are without jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See Bowles, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2363-66. Accordingly, we dismiss Clay\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and deny his IFP motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
