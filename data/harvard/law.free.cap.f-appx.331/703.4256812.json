In August 2003, Monroe pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii). At the original sentencing hearing, the district court found that Monroe was a career offender, but noted that his total offense level \u2014 31\u2014 would be the same under either the drug quantity guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), or the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). The court sentenced Monroe to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">In 2008, Monroe filed the present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, requesting a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court noted that, although Amendment 706 reduced Monroe\u2019s total offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) from 31 to 29, it did not have any effect on Monroe\u2019s \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) offense level, which remained at 31. Therefore, the district court concluded that Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Monroe\u2019s guideline range, and denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Monroe now appeals, arguing that he was originally sentenced under the drug quantity guideline, and, therefore, is eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">Section 3582(c)(2) gives federal courts the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by \u201csubstituting: the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base offense level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time that the defendant was sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>tenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Under the second step, the court must decide whether to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">A career offender\u2019s base offense level is determined by using either the offense level which would ordinarily apply under Chapters 2 and 3, or, if it results in a <em>higher </em>offense level, the table in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (emphasis added). Thus, where, as here, a defendant\u2019s offense level would be the same, sentencing under Chapters 2 and 3 is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), we held that defendants who were originally sentenced under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)\u2019s career offender table were not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because then-guideline ranges were not based on the drug quantity offense levels which had been lowered by Amendment 706. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-29. The <em>Moore </em>decision, however, did not address the applicability of Amendment 706 to a career offender who was originally sentenced based on the drug quantity guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In this case, Monroe was originally sentenced as a career offender, but his base offense level was determined under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) because application of \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) did not result in a higher offense level. Because of Monroe\u2019s status as a career offender, the district court, in determining whether Amendment 706 reduced Monroe\u2019s guideline range, was required to consider not only whether the amendment reduced his drug quantity base offense level, but also whether \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) produced a higher offense level than his amended drug quantity offense level. Amendment 706 reduced Monroe\u2019s drug quantity base offense level from 34 to 32, but did not affect his career offender offense level, which remained at 34. Therefore, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of reducing Monroe\u2019s guideline range. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Monroe\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
