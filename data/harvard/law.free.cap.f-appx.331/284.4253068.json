The district court found that Brown\u2019s suit was time-barred because he failed to file suit within the required 90 days of receiving his \u201cright to sue\u201d letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>This Court reviews a summary judgment dismissal <em>de novo. </em>In a <em>de novo </em>review, an appeals court applies the same standards as the district court. <em>See Williams v. Wynne, </em>533 F.3d 360, 365 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Title VII provides that claimants have ninety days to file a civil action after receipt of a notice of a right to sue from the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(1); Taylor <em>v. Books A Million, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 376, 379 (5th Cir.2002). Brown stated in his deposition that he received his notice from the EEOC in the first week of September, which would have been no later than September 8, 2007. He filed his lawsuit on January 4, 2008, outside the 90-day window required by Title VII to bring a claim. The requirement to file a suit within 90 days of receiving the \u201cright to sue\u201d letter is strictly construed. <em>Taylor, </em>296 F.3d at 379. Brown presented no evidence to refute his statement in his deposition. While Brown attempted to explain away the time conflict in his amended answer, \u201cconcluso-ry allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378. With no evidence to contradict Brown\u2019s own assertions of the date of receipt of the letter, summary judgment in favor of the defendants is warranted. Because the suit is time-barred, we need not address the other issues raised by Brown on appeal. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
