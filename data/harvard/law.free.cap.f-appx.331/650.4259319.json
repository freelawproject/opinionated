Because we agree that Sprauer\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b682-24\">On December 20, 2006, Sprauer, an off-duty police officer employed by the Town of Jupiter, was pulled over in the City of Stuart by Stuart Police Officer George McLane. McLane, concerned that Sprauer might be intoxicated, summoned Stuart Police Officer Matthew Cernuto to the scene because Cernuto\u2019s vehicle contained a video camera. The officers gave Sprauer roadside sobriety tests which were videotaped, and administered traffic citations, but did not arrest Sprauer for driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">Thereafter, the Jupiter Police Department obtained a copy of the videotape of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the field sobriety tests from the Stuart Police Department. An internal affairs investigation was commenced by Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzeimw to determine if Sprauer had violated the police department\u2019s rules and if discipline was warranted. Kitzerow assigned Captain Scott De Atley and Lieutenant David England to conduct the investigation. The investigators found, <em>inter alia, </em>that Sprauer drove under the influence of alcohol on December 20, 2006 and improperly attempted to use his position as a police officer to avoid arrest. A pre-termination hearing was held before Kitzerow, after which he concluded that Sprauer was impaired when stopped by the Stuart police. Kitzerow recommended to Jupiter Town Manager Andrew Lukasik that Sprauer be disciplined for policy violations, and possibly terminated. Lukasik issued a letter, rejecting Sprauer\u2019s contention that the videotape had been \u201ctampered with in an effort to develop a case\u201d against him, and terminating Sprauer\u2019s employment. Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, Sprauer was afforded a post-termination hearing before an independent arbitrator. Following the hearing, the arbitrator ordered that Sprauer\u2019s employment be reinstated, but did not award recovery for lost pay or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Sprauer thereafter brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violations of procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection rights. Following the defendants\u2019 motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cRule\u201d) 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court dismissed Sprauer\u2019s eom-plaint, but permitted Sprauer leave to amend. Sprauer filed an amended complaint and the defendants filed another Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation advising that the district court grant the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. The report and recommendation was adopted by the district court in its entirety and Sprauer\u2019s complaint was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Sprauer appeals, arguing that: (1) his complaint properly alleges violations of his substantive due process rights;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the defendants are not entitled to sovereign or official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Leib v. Hillsborough County Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, dismissed Sprauer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 substantive due process claim on the grounds that his amended complaint only alleges a protected interest in continued employment, which is not a \u201cfundamental right\u201d as required for a substantive due process claim. On appeal, Sprauer argues that the district court improperly construed his amended complaint because the complaint \u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>claim any rights to continued employment, but complains of the Defendants\u2019 conduct in tampering and altering the tape to change its tenor and meaning which deprived Plaintiff of his federally-protected rights. This violation and abridgement is a violation of the substantive due process guaranteed by the United States Constitution .... \u201d Sprauer argues that he was denied the \u201cright to be confronted by the truth\u201d and argues that the alleged tampering was \u201cintentional and malicious in an effort to suppress the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Section 1983 does not in itself create federal rights, but rather provides a vehicle for asserting those rights in situations where a plaintiff \u201cwas deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). Substantive due process \u201cprotects those rights that are \u2018fundamental,\u2019 that is, rights that are \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937)). \u201cThe Supreme Court has deemed that most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are fundamental; certain unenumerated rights (for instance, the penumbral right of privacy), also merit protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The fundamental rights protected under the due process clause are rooted in the United States Constitution, and thus substantive due process cannot be used to vindicate rights that are creatures of state law. <em>Greenbriar Vill., L.L.C. v. Mountain Brook, City, </em>345 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir.2003). This court has held that employment rights are state-created and thus not \u201cfundamental,\u201d so they do not enjoy substantive due process protection. <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1560.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">After construing the amended complaint in the manner most favorable to Sprauer, we conclude that it fails to allege a substantive due process violation. In dismissing Sprauer\u2019s initial complaint with leave to amend, the district court gave detailed instructions to Sprauer, including that \u201ceach count shall state with specificity both the factual and legal basis for the claim it sets forth.\u201d The court defined \u201clegal basis\u201d as \u201cwhat law gives the plaintiff a right to recover based on the factual scenario alleged.\u201d Despite these clear instructions, Sprauer\u2019s complaint does not specifically identify any fundamental right that was allegedly violated by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The district court construed the amend\u2022ed complaint as alleging that Sprauer was deprived of his right to continued employment, whereas Sprauer now frames his complaint as alleging a deprivation of the \u201cright to be confronted by the truth.\u201d In either case, Sprauer has failed to allege a fundamental right that could form the basis of a substantive due process claim. As noted above, employment rights are not entitled to substantive due process protection. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Sprauer does not cite any authority in favor of his \u201cright to be confronted by the truth,\u201d nor has this court ever used such language. The substance of Sprauer\u2019s argument appeal's to be that videotapes were tampered with by the Stuart Defendants and, despite knowledge of this tampering, the Jupiter Defendants released these tapes to the media and used them against Sprauer during his pre-termination proceeding, thereby adversely impacting his reputation and employment. Although these allegations, if true, might form the basis of a state-law tort claim, they do not establish a substan- \u25a0 tive due process violation. Therefore, Sprauer does not have a valid \u00a7 1983 claim based on alleged violations of his substantive due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Because Sprauer\u2019s amended complaint fails to establish a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Accordingly, we need not address the sovereign or official immunity arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\">.
