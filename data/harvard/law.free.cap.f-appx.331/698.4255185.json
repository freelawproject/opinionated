After review, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">In his complaint, Sairras, a Suriname national, alleged that he was arrested by Defendants Perry, Evans, and Bartelt and transported to an interrogation room. Sa-irras alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Defendants never advised him of his right to contact the Suriname Consulate and that Defendant Bartelt beat him with a closed fist and uttered racial epithets and profanity to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sairras sought compensatory and punitive damages to remedy the \u201ctorture\u201d and deprivation of his rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (\u201cVienna Convention\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to access the Suriname Consulate. Sairras repeatedly cited both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Alien Tort Claims Act (\u201cATCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350, as his basis for relief and stated that Bartelt\u2019s \u201cdeliberate torture\u201d violated \u201cuniversally accepted norms of international law of human rights.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">The district court dismissed Sairras\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). First, the district court rejected Sairras\u2019s argument that there is a judicially enforceable right for individuals under the Vienna Convention. Although Sairras relied on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Jogi v. Voges, </em>480 F.3d 822 (7th Cir.2007), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>district court noted that this Court expressly rejected the reasoning of <em>Jogi </em>in <em>Gandara v. Bennett, </em>528 F.3d 823. (11th Cir.2008), and found that no such right exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The district court also found that Sair-ras\u2019s complaint was barred by the four-year statute of limitations. The district court determined that the statute of limitations began to run on May 20, 2003,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when Sairras was aware of his injury and knew the identity of the culprits, and expired before his complaint was filed in December 2007.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court rejected Sairras\u2019s assertion that he was entitled to equitable tolling until <em>Jogi </em>was decided in 2007 because (1) the <em>Jogi </em>decision has not been adopted in this Court, (2) a change in the law is not an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d warranting equitable tolling, (3) Sairras failed to seek a remedy for these injuries prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, and (4) Florida law does not provide for equitable tolling based on newly recognized rights. The district court did not separately address Sairras\u2019s claims under the ATCA and appeared to treat all of his claims as if they were brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal of Sairras\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sairras did not file his \u00a7 1983 claim within Florida\u2019s four-year statute of limitations for filing personal injury actions. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3); <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 270-75, 280, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1943-47, 1949, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985) (concluding that \u00a7 1983 actions are best characterized as personal injury actions and that the forum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury actions applies). Also, Sairras was not entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations until <em>Jogi </em>was decided because, inter alia, this Court has not adopted the holding in <em>Jogi </em>that the Vienna Convention contains a private action and remedy enforceable through \u00a7 1983. <em>See Gandara, </em>528 F.3d at 827-29. For this same reason, Sairras could not state a \u00a7 1983 claim even if his complaint was timely filed. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Sairras\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Sairras, however, also alleged a separate claim under the ATCA. The ATCA provides that district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions brought by aliens for torts committed in violation of the law of nations or treaties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350. To obtain relief under \u00a7 1350, a plaintiff must prove a <em>prima facie </em>case that he is (1) an alien, (2) suing for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tort, which was (3) committed in violation of the law of nations. <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, </em>416 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). The ATCA is \u201cjurisdictional in nature\u201d but also \u201cprovides a cause of action \u2018for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time [of its enactment].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 724, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 2761, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004)) (alteration in original). This Court has recognized that \u201c[s]tate-spon-sored torture, unlike torture by private actors, likely violates international law and is therefore actionable under the [ATCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In addition to his \u00a7 1983 claim, Sairras alleged a separate ATCA claim that the Defendants beat and tortured him during their interrogation in violation of international law. Sairras referenced the ATCA throughout his complaint and his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and noted the ATCA\u2019s longer statute of limitations of ten years. <em>See Cabello v. Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.2005). The district court either treated Sairras\u2019s ATCA claim as subsumed within his \u00a7 1983 claim or failed to address the ATCA claim at all. Because the ATCA claim has a longer statute of limitations and encompasses allegations regarding the alleged beating that go beyond Sairras\u2019s argument regarding the Vienna Convention, the ATCA claim presents different considerations than his \u00a7 1983 claim. And the district court should address them in the first instance. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for the district court to address in the first instance whether Sairras\u2019s ATCA claim survives review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>See Bartholomew v. AGL Resources, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 1333, 1342 n. 6 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-12\">. The complaint named as Defendants: (1) DEA supervisor Jonathan Schleffer; (2) DEA agent Shawn Perry; (3) DEA agent Karry Evans; (4) Miami Metro Dade police officer Douglas Bartelt; (5) Assistant State Attorney Michael Greco; and (6) Assistant State Attorney Andrea Ricker Wolfson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\">. Sairras later was convicted of drug trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\">. \u201cArticle 36 of the Vienna Convention provides that upon arrest, a foreign national has the right to contact the consular post of his home country, and that the arresting authorities must inform the detainee of that right. Once a detainee is informed of his right to contact the local consulate\u2019s office, the arresting authorities must forward any desired communications to that foreign office.\u201d <em>Ma-haraj v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>432 F.3d 1292, 1304 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b731-19\">.Sairras referred to the relief he sought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 by various names in his pleadings, including the \"Alien Tort Statute,\" \"Federal Torture Victims Act,\u201d and \"Alien Tort Claims Act.\" To avoid confusion, we will refer to the statute as the ATCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">.While the district court stated that Sairras\u2019s date of injury was March 20, 2003, it appears that it meant to say May 20, 2003, which was the date Sairras was charged. Both the district court and the magistrate judge used the May 20, 2003 date Sairras was charged as the date that the statute of limitations began because it was the only date Sairras provided in his complaint. He did not state the date of his arrest in his complaint or in any subsequent pleadings. In any event, Sairras's arrest necessarily came before the date he was charged so he was not prejudiced by the use of May 20, 2003 as the date that the statute of limitations started to run.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\">. The district court also adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that Sairras's complaint be dismissed because Sairras failed to state a claim against Defendant Schleffer and could not prove a <em>prima facie </em>case of malicious prosecution against Defendants Greco and Wolfson. Sairras does not challenge these rulings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\">.
