(CNA) and Baker Hughes, Inc. (Baker Hughes) on his claim for long-term disability benefits under ERISA and other state-law causes of action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Menchaca worked for Baker Hughes as a machinist for over twenty years until he developed pain in his hands and wrists. Menchaca filed for benefits under Baker Hughes\u2019s Long Term Disability Plan (the Plan), which at the time was administered by ING Employee Benefits Disability Management Services (ING). The Plan contained two provisions for long-term disability benefits. The first, referred to as the \u201cown occupation\u201d provision, provides benefits for the first twelve months of disability for participants who are unable to engage in their regular occupation. After that initial twelve-month period, the Plan then provides coverage under the \u201cany occupation\u201d provision, which requires that the participant be unable to engage in \u201cany occupation or employment for which he is qualified, or may reasonably become qualified, based on his training, education or experience.\u201d As a condition of payment of benefits, the Plan requires that \u201ceach Participant ... provide proof of continued Total Disability....\u201d The Plan further grants the plan administrator \u201cabsolute discretion to construe and interpret any and all provisions of the Plan,\u201d as well as the authority to \u201c[i]n its discretion, ... determine eligibility under the terms of the Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">ING initially approved Menchaca\u2019s claim for benefits under the \u201cown occupation\u201d provision and, after the first twelve months elapsed, continued to pay benefits under the \u201cany occupation\u201d provision until October 2001. At that point, benefits were terminated because Menchaca failed to provide earnings-related documentation and periodic medical updates to substantiate his continued entitlement to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In July 2002, CNA replaced ING as the administrator of the Plan, but Menchaca\u2019s claim was not transferred to CNA. Instead, Baker Hughes kept the claim in-house. In response to letters from Men-chaca regarding his benefits, Baker Hughes decided to ask CNA to reopen and evaluate Menchaca\u2019s claim. Baker Hughes also directed CNA to issue a \u201cgood faith\u201d lump-sum payment for benefits spanning from November 2001 to December 2002, but warned Menchaca that such a payment did \u201cnot constitute a determination that you, in fact, had a qualifying disabling condition during the period from November 1, 2001 through December 1, 2002 that entitled you to payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">CNA reviewed Menchaca\u2019s file and conducted an investigation that included review of Menchaca\u2019s medical records; an interview of Menchaca in which he admitted that he was working part-time running errands and translating for an attorney; video surveillance that showed Menchaca walking, entering and exiting vehicles, and driving; an independent medical evaluation in which the doctor concluded that Menchaca had no limitations as to sitting, standing, or walking; a functional capacity evaluation that demonstrated good tolerance for sitting, walking, standing, and lifting lightweight objects; and a vocational assessment indicating that Menchaca was capable of performing alternative gainful employment. During this investigation, CNA also requested updated medical information from Menchaca showing that he was under the care of a physician and was still disabled, as required by the Plan. Menchaca refused to comply. As a result of this investigation and Menchaca\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>failure to provide updated medical information substantiating his continued disability, CNA found Menchaca ineligible for benefits and denied payment beyond December 2002. Menchaca requested reconsideration of the denial pursuant to his appeal rights under ERISA and CNA affirmed its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Menchaca filed a claim in the district court for long-term disability benefits under ERISA, as well as state-law causes of action for breach of contract, statutory and common law breach of the duty of good faith and fan\u2019 dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and violations of Texas Insurance Code \u00a7\u00a7 21.21 and 21.55. CNA filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the state-law causes of action, which the district court granted. Menchaca amended his complaint but continued to assert the state-law causes of action. The district court again granted a motion to dismiss the state-law claims, causing Menchaca to file a second amended complaint that again attempted to assert state-law claims. CNA then moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in ERISA cases de novo, applying the same legal standard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the district court reviewed CNA\u2019s denial of benefits for abuse of discretion. Menchaca argues that the district court should have applied a de novo standard of review because of a potential conflict of interest in the plan administrator\u2019s decisionmaking. Whether the district court applied the correct standard of review is a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">A plan administrator\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also review an administrator\u2019s denial of ERISA benefits for abuse of discretion where the plan grants the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Evidence of a conflict of interest does not alter the abuse-of-discretion standard, but rather is \u201cweighed as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff has the burden to produce evidence that a conflict exists.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">Here, Menchaca does not dispute that the Plan grants discretionary authority to CNA to determine eligibility for benefits and construe the terms of the Plan. Though Menchaca asserts that a conflict of interest exists in CNA\u2019s administration of the Plan, he has failed to produce any evidence that such a conflict exists or to what extent it might affect CNA\u2019s deci-sionmaking. Thus, the district court correctly applied an abuse of discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">\u201cUnder the abuse of discretion standard, if the plan fiduciary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>not arbitrary and capricious, it must prevail.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A decision is arbitrary if it is \u201cmade without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Menchaca argues that CNA abused its discretion by \u201cre-open[ing][his] individual case and reversing] the prior decisions granting long-term disability benefits\u201d to Menchaca. However, the evidence in the administrative record does not indicate that CNA\u2019s decision reversed the decision of the prior plan administrator. ING stopped providing benefits to Menchaca under the \u201cany occupation\u201d provision as of October 2001 due to Menchaca\u2019s failure to provide earnings-related documentation and medical updates. Though Baker Hughes directed CNA to issue a \u201cgood-faith\u201d lump sum payment to Menchaca when CNA reopened Menchaca\u2019s claim, Baker Hughes specifically noted that the payment did not constitute a determination that Menchaca was eligible for benefits during this time. CNA\u2019s later denial based, in part, on Menchaca\u2019s failure to provide earnings information and medical updates is consistent with ING\u2019s prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Menchaca also argues that the district court erred in considering an opinion in the administrative record rendered by Julie Byrd, CNA\u2019s vocational case manager, whose qualifications as an expert Menchaca asserts were not established by the administrative record. Byrd stated that Menchaca had the ability to perform work as an information receptionist, surveillance camera monitor, control. access guard and gate guard. We need not address this argument, however, because even without Byrd\u2019s opinion, there was sufficient evidence to support CNA\u2019s decision. Vocational testimony is not required for a plan administrator to determine disability.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that Menchaca was actually performing part-time work for a law firm is strong evidence that Menchaca was not disabled from performing \u201cany occupation.\u201d Moreover, video surveillance and medical testimony established that Men-chaca was capable of performing sedentary or light-capacity work. Additionally, Men-chaca\u2019s refusal to provide earnings information and medical updates as required by the plan provided a sufficient reason to deny benefits. Given these facts, we cannot say that CNA abused its discretion in denying Menchaca\u2019s long-term benefits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">Finally, Menchaca argues that the Plan\u2019s \u201cany occupation\u201d language must be read to include an implicit requirement that Menchaca be able to work at the occupation on a full-time basis, and that none of the evidence establishes that he was able to work full time. This argument is not supported by the Plan\u2019s definition of Total Disability which requires that Men-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>chaca \u201cnot engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit other than Rehabilitative Employment.\u201d This definition does not require that work performed for compensation (such as the part-time work he was doing) be full time. Therefore, CNA did not abuse its discretion by failing to read a full-time requirement into the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Menchaca also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his state-law causes of action for breach of contract, statutory and common law breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and violations of Texas Insurance Code \u00a7\u00a7 21.21 and 21.55.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> CNA filed two separate motions to dismiss the state-law causes of actions on the grounds that they were preempted by ERISA, and the district court granted both motions. Menchaca\u2019s Second Amended Complaint again alleged facts that, according to the district court, \u201cmay represent an attempt to assert claims based on state law.\u201d Thus, in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, it again stated that any state-law claims were preempted by ERISA. Menchaca argues that he had the right to plead the state-law causes of action in the alternative to his ERISA claims and that preemption of those claims violated his constitutional rights. We review ERISA preemption of state law de novo.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">ERISA preempts all state laws that \u201crelate\u201d to employee benefit plans.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201cany state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ERISA civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore pre-empted.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Though ERISA also has a savings clause excepting from preemption any state laws \u201cwhich regulate insurance, banking, or securities,\u201d we have previously held that claims under Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 21.21 and 21.25, as well as the Texas common law duties of good faith and fair dealing, do not fall within that exception and are preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Indeed, Menchaca acknowledges that ERISA preempts \u201ca party\u2019s ability to obtain multiple relief via concurrent state-law causes of action.\u201d Instead, Menchaca argues that his state-law claims are pled in the alternative pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 and thus not subject to preemption. This argument has no merit. Whether Menchaca refers to his claims as an \u201calternate theory of recovery\u201d or a \u201cconcurrent state-law cause of action\u201d has no effect on ERISA\u2019s preemption of those claims. Thus, the district court properly dismissed Menchaca\u2019s state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
