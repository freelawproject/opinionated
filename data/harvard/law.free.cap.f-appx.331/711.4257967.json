Bodiford, appointed counsel for Antoine Wilbert Jean-Louis in this direct criminal appeal, has filed a motion to withdraw on appeal, supported by a brief prepared pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Jean-Louis\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Nevertheless, we VACATE the judgment and commitment order due to a clerical error and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions for it to correct this order to reflect the correct period of supervised release announced at sentencing \u2014 namely, eight years on Count 1 and three years on Count 2, to run concurrently.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
