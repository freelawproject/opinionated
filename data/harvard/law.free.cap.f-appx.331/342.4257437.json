Tijerina\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-22\">Tijerina argues that the defendants violated his rights during the course of his prosecution, direct appeal, and state post-conviction proceedings. He also argues that Judge Darnell and the prosecutor defendants are not entitled to immunity. Ti-jerina moves this court to take judicial notice of his pending 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 proceedings. Tijerina does not address the propriety of the district court\u2019s determination that his suit was untimely, nor does he address the district court\u2019s determinations that his claims against one defendant were malicious and that his claims against the defense attorney defendants are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Tijerina has thus abandoned any challenges he may have had to these determinations. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Tijerina has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Tijerina\u2019s motion for judicial notice is likewise DENIED. His appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Tijeri-na\u2019s suit as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Tijerina is WARNED that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
