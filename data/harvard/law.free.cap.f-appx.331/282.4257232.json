Robinson sought $5,000,000 in damages from each defendant. Robinson also sought injunctive relief requiring corrections employees to adhere to federal law, state law, and prison regulation in addressing a prisoner request to use the restroom. The district court found that notwithstanding his claims of discomfort, shame, and embarrassment, Robinson did not allege \u201cthat he sustained any injury or actual harm as a result\u201d of the incident. The district court dismissed Robinson\u2019s lawsuit as legally frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">On appeal Robinson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim as legally frivolous. This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) as frivolous for abuse of discretion. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim under the same de novo standard of review applicable to dismissals made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). Given the general reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) and to guarantee that Robinson\u2019s claims are reviewed under the strictest level of scrutiny available, the dismissal is construed to have referred to both sections of the statute, and review is de novo. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">\u201cNo Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). This limitation applies regardless of the nature of constitutional rights claimed to have been violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ed. <em>Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 374-75. This court has held that the physical injury required by \u00a7 1997e(e) \u201cmust be more than de minimus [sic], but need not be significant.\u201d <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted); <em>see Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999) (applying <em>Siglar </em>to an Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement case). Robinson has not alleged a physical injury either below or on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Robinson argues that the dismissal was premature because he was not given an opportunity to amend his complaint. See <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9-10 (5th Cir.1994). Given that Robinson has not alleged any physical injury, additional factual development could not help him plead his case. The district court did not err in dismissing the complaint after finding that Robinson\u2019s claim for damages was without a legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">To the extent that Robinson is challenging the dismissal of his claim for injunctive relief, his allegations in the district court presented no legal basis for the grant of injunctive relief. Past exposure to illegal conduct, without any current, continuing adverse effects, is insufficient to establish a case or controversy for Article III purposes with respect to injunctive relief. <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 102-05, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1003, 1005 (5th Cir.1998) (holding that this court may affirm on any ground supported by the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
