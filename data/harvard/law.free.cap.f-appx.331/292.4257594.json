The 57-month sentence was at the bottom of the properly calculated guideline range. Payan contends that the sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to explain adequately the reasons for the sentence. He further argues that the sentence was excessive and that this court should not apply a presumption of reasonableness because the guideline provision for a 16-level increase for a prior felony is not empirically grounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-21\">We begin our review by determining whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the sentencing decision is proeedurally sound, we then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-22\">Payan\u2019s contention that the district court failed to give an adequate explanation of the sentence is reviewed for plain error because Payan did not object to the explanation at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 24, 2009) (No. 08-11099). Any error was not reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The district court read Payan\u2019s written objections, heard his arguments, and granted the Government\u2019s motion for a third level of reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court adopted the calculations and reasoning of the pre-sentence report and indicated that the 57-month sentence at the bottom of the guideline range satisfied the factors of \u00a7 3553(a). Payan fails to show that the district court\u2019s explanation was clearly or obviously inadequate. <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 524-26 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008) (finding brief explanation adequate). Moreover, Payan \u201cfails to show that an explanation would have changed his sentence.\u201d <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365. He thus fails to show plain error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Payan contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was excessive. He contends that the guideline provision resulting in the 16-level increase was not empirically grounded and is therefore not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Payan\u2019s sentence was within the guideline sentencing range and was presumptively reasonable, regardless of whether the guideline provision upon which the sentence was based is empirically grounded. <em>See United States v. DuaRe, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Mondragovr-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Payan fails to show that his sentence is unreasonable. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
