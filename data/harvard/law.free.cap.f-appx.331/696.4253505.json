On appeal, he argues the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding the bodily injury was \u201cserious\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Jordan argues that, although he punched his coworker, Robert Grubbs, Jr., in the mouth, he did not inflict \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d under the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">A claim of insufficient evidence to convict is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Nolan, </em>223 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2000). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affirm the conviction if, based on this evidence, \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing witness testimony, \u201c[t]he jury gets to make any credibility choices, and we will assume that they made them all in the way that supports the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIt is emphatically not within the province of an appellate court to reweigh the evidence and the credibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>witnesses at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>141 F.3d 1042, 1052 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(6), it is a federal crime to commit an \u201c[a]ssault resulting in serious bodily injury\u201d within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 113(b)(2), the term \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d applies as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365. That section defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as a bodily injury involving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">(A) a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">(B) extreme physical pain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(C) protracted and obvious disfigurement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">(D) protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(h)(3). The parties agree Grubbs did not face a substantial risk of death. Thus, the issue is whether his injury qualified as a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d under any of the remaining three subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Although our precedent does not provide much guidance as to what injuries constitute serious bodily injuries under subsections (B), (C), and (D), we have reviewed similar language in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Torrealba, </em>339 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.2003) (discussing whether the victim\u2019s injuries constituted \u201cpermanent or life-threatening bodily injuries\u201d such that an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(2)(A) was appropriate). Under the Guidelines, \u201cpermanent or life-threatening bodily injuries,\u201d include, <em>inter alia, </em>substantial impairments of the function of a bodily member that are likely to be permanent, and \u201cobvious disfigurement[s] that are likely to be permanent.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. 1(J) (formerly U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. 1(g)). We affirmed the sentencing court\u2019s finding that the victim suffered \u201cpermanent or life-threatening bodily injuries,\u201d because her facial symmetry was permanently altered and her nerve damage and scarring were likely to be permanent. <em>Torrealba, </em>339 F.3d at 1246. We also indicated that the district court\u2019s determination of whether the victim\u2019s injuries met this threshold was a factual finding. <em>Id. </em>(reviewing this determination for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-16\">We find our precedent addressing whether injuries a victim suffered were \u201cpermanent and life-threatening\u201d illuminating. We are also mindful that questions relating to the credibility of the evidence \u2014 including whether witness testimony was exaggerated \u2014 are issues for the jury to resolve, and we decline to reweigh the witnesses\u2019 credibility on appeal. As to the ultimate question of whether Jordan inflicted \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d on Grubbs, we note the evidence showed, <em>inter alia, </em>that: Jordan\u2019s punch knocked Grubbs to the ground; the punch split Grubbs\u2019 lip in half and chipped his tooth; Grubbs rated the pain an eight on a scale of one to ten; the punch injured three distinct layers of sensitive nerve endings on Grubbs\u2019 lip; the injury merited treatment with the strongest pain medication available; one witness testified there was a \u201cdecent amount\u201d of blood, and another stated there was \u201ca lot\u201d of blood and he had never seen anyone be hit that hard; Jordan was \u201cquite a bit bigger\u201d than Grubbs; Grubbs would have a permanent scar on his lip; and Grubbs\u2019 injury area would be permanently numb. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence for a rational juror to conclude Grubbs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>injury was a \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d and we affirm Jordan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-12\">. Section 113 does not define ''assault,\u201d thus we apply the common law meaning of the term, and we have determined the statute encompasses assaults committed by battery. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>197 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
