Barker also requests permission to file a supplemental appellate brief. The motion to file a supplemental brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Barker admittedly made no attempt to pursue prison administrative remedies, but he argues that the dismissal of his complaint was error because the Texas Department of Criminal Justice grievance procedures were not available to him. He contends that he should be excused from the \u00a7 1997e exhaustion requirement due to his physical and mental problems, and he argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint violates Fed. R.App. P. 28. We find no error in the disteiet court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 88-89, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006); <em>Booth v.
