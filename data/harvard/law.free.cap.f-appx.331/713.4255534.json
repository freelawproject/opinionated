Garvin\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, as amended by Amendments 711 and 715. Garvin argues that the district court failed to consider all the sentencing factors and grant him a reduction within the adjusted sentencing range. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to entertain Garvin\u2019s appeal, but we disagree. Under the mailbox rule, a notice of appeal filed pro <em>se </em>is treated as filed on the date the inmate delivers his notice to the prison authorities. <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 270, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 2382, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The district court entered its order denying Garvin\u2019s motion to reduce on March 12, 2009, and Garvin submitted to prison officials a notice of appeal dated March 23, 2009. \u201cAbsent evidence to the contrary in the form of prison logs or other records, we ... assume that [Garvin\u2019s] motion was delivered to prison authorities the day he signed it[.]\u201d <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.2001). Garvin\u2019s notice of appeal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Garvin\u2019s motion to reduce. The district court correctly calculated Garvin\u2019s adjusted offense level of 32 that provided a sentencing range between 210 and 262 months of imprisonment. The court next considered the sentencing factors and refused to reduce Garvin\u2019s sentence because, \u201cas demonstrated by [Garvin\u2019s] prior criminal record,\u201d which included one conviction \u201cfor aggravated assault, three [convictions] [as a] felon in possession of a weapon, and one [conviction] for drug distribution[,]\u201d Garvin \u201cposes a danger to the public.\u201d Although Garvin argues that the district court failed to account for his conduct after sentencing, the court was not required to do so. United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(B) (May 2008) (instructing district courts that they \u201cshall\u201d consider the sentencing factors and \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by the reduction\u201d and \u201cmay consider the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The denial of Garvin\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
