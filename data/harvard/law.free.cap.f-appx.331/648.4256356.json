Wiggins\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. Wiggins asserts <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300 (11th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), were wrongly decided to the extent we held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>crack-cocaine guideline amendments are not applicable to defendants originally sentenced as career offenders or armed career criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\u201c[This Court] review[s] <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201c[A] reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u2018the amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A))). \u201c[A] prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v.

Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">. Wiggins was found guilty by a jury of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e); possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C); possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D); and use of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The presentence investigation report (PSI) initially calculated Wiggins' base offense level at 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. 3D1 and 2K2.1(a)(2). Nevertheless, the PSI determined Wiggins qualified as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), and, because the statutory maximum penalty for the instant offense was 20 years' imprisonment, the PSI calculated Wiggins' offense level at 32. The PSI also determined that, because Wiggins qualified as an armed career offender under \u00a7 4B 1.4(a), his offense level was increased to 34, pursuant to \u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A). The PSI also stated Wiggins should be given a mandatory five-year consecutive sentence for the \u00a7 924 offense. Based on a total offense level of 34, and a criminal history category of VI, the Guidelines imprisonment range was 262 to 327 months' imprisonment. The district court sentenced Wiggins to concurrent terms of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment on the felon-in-possession of a firearm offense, 240 months' imprisonment on the crack-cocaine offense, and 60 months' imprisonment on the marijuana offense. The district court also imposed a 60-month consecutive sentence for the \u00a7 924 violation, resulting in a total term of 322 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
