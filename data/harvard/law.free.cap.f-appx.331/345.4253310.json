Tijerina\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Tijerina argues that his rights were violated when Detective Deon Clements of the Lubbock County Sheriffs Office interviewed Tijerina and took statements from him. Tijerina also moves this court to consolidate this appeal with others that he has pending. Tijerina does not analyze, and has thus abandoned, the issue whether th\u00e9 district court erred by determining that the instant suit was not timely filed and by dismissing it on that basis. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Tijerina has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.'3d at 202. Tijerina\u2019s motion to consolidate is likewise DENIED. His appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Tijeri-na\u2019s suit as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Tijer-ina is WARNED that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
