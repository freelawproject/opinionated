Conway, FNU Ferguson, E. McKenzie, and H. Breitinger of the Sheriffs Department of Gwinnett County. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). The district court concluded that Miller\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-30\">\u201cWe generally review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion, but we review questions of law <em>de novo\u201d Williams v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., </em>477 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>view <em>de 'novo </em>a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accept the allegations in the complaint as true, and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Doe v. Moore, </em>410 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The district court erred when it denied as futile Miller\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to include additional defendants. \u201cA party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course before being served with a responsive pleading.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1). Because none of the police officers named in the complaint had filed a responsive pleading when Miller sought to amend his complaint, Miller had the right to amend his complaint as a matter of course. <em>See Williams, </em>477 F.3d at 1292 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6. We vacate the order that denied Miller\u2019s motion to amend and remand for the district court to allow Miller to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The district court also erred when it dismissed Miller\u2019s claim about the \u201cno talking\u201d rule. \u201cDue process prohibits a state from punishing a pretrial detainee at all until he is lawfully convicted of a crime.\u201d <em>McMillian v. Johnson, </em>88 F.3d 1554, 1564 (11th Cir.1996). \u201c[A] showing of intent to punish suffices to show unconstitutional pretrial punishment\u201d and \u201cmay be inferred when a condition of pretrial detention is not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental goal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Miller alleged that the \u201cno talking\u201d rule was arbitrary and capricious, he stated a claim that the rule was imposed to punish him.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The district court did not err when it dismissed the remainder of Miller\u2019s complaint. Miller asserts that Breitinger made \u201chorrific threats\u201d to another inmate, but Miller lacks standing to pursue a claim on behalf of another person. <em>See Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. City of Clear water, Fla., </em>351 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir.2003). Miller argues that an officer retaliated against him for exercising his right to free speech, but he failed to allege facts that Conway, Ferguson, McKenzie, and Breitinger participated in the retaliation. <em>See Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1321-22 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Miller\u2019s complaint except his claim regarding the \u201cno talking\u201d rule and we REVERSE the dismissal of that claim. We VACATE the order that denied Miller\u2019s motion to amend and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART. VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
