The \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the offense levels associated with certain crack cocaine offenses. Isom argues that the district court erred by failing to address his requests to be sentenced: (1) pursuant to an advisory Guidelines system; and (2) for his time served, or at the very least, at the low end of the Guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further argues that <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>applies to his case, and the district court\u2019s failure to address <em>Booker\u2019s </em>application to his case constitutes harmful error. He contends that the court erred by failing to state the reasons for its decision as required under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He also argues that the court needed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when resentenc-ing him and not just the amended Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-19\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqS\">In the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">A district court \u201cmust make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). First, the court must substitute the amended Guideline range and determine the sentence it would have imposed. <em>Id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(1). \u201cSecond, in light of the conclusion reached in the first step, the court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d Vautier, 144 F.3d at 760. Section lB1.10(b)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that, generally when a defendant is initially sentenced within his original Guideline range, \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">The record here demonstrates that the district court calculated Isom\u2019s amended Guideline range, pursuant to the first step of the <em>Vautier </em>analysis, and re-sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of his amended range. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. While the record is unclear as to whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, pursuant to the second step of the <em>Vautier </em>analysis, the court still reduced Isom\u2019s sentence to the low end of his amended Guideline range. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Thus, even if the court erred by not considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such error is harmless because the court reduced Isom\u2019s sentence as much as it could. Furthermore, <em>Booker </em>and Kimbrough<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) is binding on district courts, forbidding them from imposing a sentence below the low end of an amended Guideline range when a defendant\u2019s original sentence was within his original Guideline range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S.Feb.10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting Isom a two-level reduction in offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-14\">. Although Isom contends that the district court erred by failing to sentence him at the low end of his Guideline range, the court sentenced him to 360 months' imprisonment, which is the lowest term pursuant to his amended Guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-22\">. <em>United States v.
