Gonzalez alleges that the Texas attorney who attempted unsuccessfully to notify him of his removal hearing had not been retained to represent him at the removal hearing, but only to represent him at a preliminary proceeding. He contends that the BIA incorrectly determined in <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 377, 384 (BIA 1986), that an alien is not entitled to partial representation in a removal proceeding and that he cannot be faulted for failing to provide the Texas attorney with a current address. We need not consider Gonzalez\u2019s contentions regarding <em>Velasquez </em>and the status of the Texas attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Gonzalez alleges for the first time in his petition for review that he did not provide immigration authorities with the incorrect address to which the Texas attorney attempted to send notice. We lack jurisdiction to consider that allegation. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). The immigration judge\u2019s finding that Gonzalez failed to provide the authorities with a current address is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The immigration judge\u2019s determination that Gonzalez\u2019s failure to provide a current address precluded him from receiving notice of his removal hearing, which was adopted by the BIA, is correct. An alien who has failed to provide his current address is not entitled to written notice before he is ordered removed in absentia. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(B); 1229(a)(2)(B). Because Gonzalez did not provide a current address, he was not entitled to notice at all, whether directly or through counsel. The denial of Gonzalez\u2019s motion to reopen was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Maknojiya v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 588, 588-89 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
