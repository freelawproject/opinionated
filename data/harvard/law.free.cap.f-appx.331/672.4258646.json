On appeal, Barreto argues that the district court erred in holding that Davie Marketplace had satisfied as a matter of law the \u201cexecutive exemption\u201d to the FLSA\u2019s overtime pay requirements because there are disputed facts as to three of the four prongs of the \u201cexecutive exemption\u201d test: (1) whether Barreto\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d as \u201cmanager\u201d of the produce department consisted of management; (2) whether Barreto customarily and regularly directed the work of two or more other employees; and (3) whether Barreto\u2019s recommendations with respect to hiring and firing employees were given \u201cparticular weight\u201d by management. Upon thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact as to all three of these elements. Accordingly, we reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand this case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, \u201capplying the same legal standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the evidence before the court shows \u2018that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 In making this determination, the court must view all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Haves v. City of Miami, </em>52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). The summary judgment movant bears the initial burden of showing the court, by reference to the record, that no genuine issues of material fact exist to be determined at trial. <em>Clark v. Coats &amp; Clark, Inc., </em>929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir.1991). The movant meets this burden by showing that there is an \u201cabsence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Jeffery v. Sarasota White Sox, Inc., </em>64 F.3d 590, 593 (11th Cir.1995). Once this initial burden is met, the other party must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings, and by its own affidavits, or by depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593-94 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">The FLSA provides that employees are generally entitled to receive overtime pay at one and one-half times their regular rate for all hours worked in excess of forty per week. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). The FLSA exempts from its overtime pay requirements \u201cany employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u00a7 213(a)(1); <em>see also Avery v. City of Talladega, </em>24 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.1994). The employer has the burden of showing entitlement to an exemption, <em>Jeffery v. Sarasota White Sox, Inc., </em>64 F.3d 590, 594 (11th Cir.1995), and we construe overtime exemptions narrowly, against the employer. <em>Avery, </em>24 F.3d at 1340 (citing <em>Brennan v. Sugar Cane Growers Co-Op, </em>486 F.2d 1006 (5th Cir.1973)). This court has recognized the \u201cSupreme Court\u2019s admonition that courts closely circumscribe the FLSA\u2019s exceptions.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. World Bus. Network, Inc., </em>105 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.1997). The executive exemption \u201cis to be applied only to those clearly and unmistakably within the terms and spirit of the exemption.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., </em>551 F.3d 1233, 1269 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The Code of Federal Regulations defines executive employees as those (1) who receive compensation \u201cof not less than $455 per week\u201d; (2) whose \u201cprimary duty\u201d is. the management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized department thereof; (3) who customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other employees; and (4) who have the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion, or any other change of status of other employees are given \u201cparticular weight.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.100(a). As evidence that Barreto met all four prongs on this test, Davie Marketplace submitted only the deposition of Barreto, with attached exhibits, and the three-page affidavit of store supervisor Ajay Dhawan. In responding, Bar-reto relied solely on his deposition. Thereafter, based only on this evidence, the district court granted summary judgment, finding that Davie Marketplace was entitled to the executive exemption defense as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AKY\">On appeal, it is uncontested that Barreto was paid a flat rate of $500.00 per week, thereby satisfying the first element of the executive employee definition. The parties, however, dispute the applicability of the remaining three elements. Accordingly, we first consider whether the evidence submitted by the parties creates a genuine issue of fact regarding whether management was Barreto\u2019s \u201cprimary duty\u201d in his employment as manager of the produce department at Davie Marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The Code of Federal Regulations defines \u201cprimary duty\u201d as \u201cthe principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs\u201d but explains that the \u201c[determination of an employee\u2019s primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee\u2019s job as a whole.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.700(a). The factors to consider in this analysis include: (1) the amount of time spent performing management duties; (2) the relative importance of the management duties as compared with other types of duties; (3) the frequency with which an employee may exercise discretionary powers; (4) the employee\u2019s relative freedom from direct supervision; and (5) the relationship between the employee\u2019s salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of non-management work performed by the employee. <em>Rodriguez v. Farm Stores Grocery, Inc., </em>518 F.3d 1259, 1264 (11th Cir.2008) (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.103). This analysis specifically requires an examination beyond an employee\u2019s title to the specific duties performed by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The district court, relying on Barreto\u2019s deposition and Dhawan\u2019s affidavit, found as a matter of law that Barreto\u2019s duties were primarily managerial. Barreto stated in his deposition that Davie Marketplace hired Barreto as the Manager of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Produce Department, paying him a flat rate of $500.00 per week for all hours worked. In this position, Barreto admitted to performing certain managerial tasks, namely, ordering and pricing produce as needed to meet proscribed profits and providing direction and work schedules to the other three employees in the department. Store supervisor Ajay Dha-wan\u2019s affidavit asserted that (1) Barreto was given wide latitude to run the produce department and received little supervision from upper management, (2) Barreto was responsible for reaching a certain level of productivity for the department and for using his judgment to accomplish that important business objective, and (3) Barreto earned more that two times the compensation earned by other employees in the produce department. The district court found that Barreto\u2019s deposition testimony did not directly dispute the assertions in Dhawan\u2019s affidavit and therefore deemed these assertions to be admitted. Accordingly, after acknowledging that Barreto\u2019s deposition also asserted that he spent the majority of his time performing non-managerial tasks and that his discretion was somewhat limited by the store\u2019s policies, the district court found that the evidence nonetheless required a finding that Barre-to\u2019s primary duties were managerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Barreto claims that although his title was that of \u201cmanager\u201d and he admittedly performed some managerial-type tasks, his deposition testimony, considered in the light most favorable to him, creates a genuine dispute as to whether management was his primary duty. We agree. The parties agree that Barreto performed the managerial tasks of ordering produce, pricing produce, and scheduling and directing produce department employees; however, it is also undisputed that Barreto spent more than 50% of his time performing tasks identical to those performed by the hourly, non-exempt employees. Indeed, Barreto testified that, due to management\u2019s under-staffing of the department, he was required to perform nonexempt work for such a large percentage of his time that he had no time to fulfill some of the managerial responsibilities he had been nominally given, i.e., to supervise other employees and to purchase the least expensive produce. He also testified that the four other non-exempt employees did not require his supervision, as they already \u201cknew what the job was.\u201d This evidence suggests that Barreto\u2019s non-management responsibilities were more important to the operation of the store than his few managerial duties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Diaz v. Team Oney, hie., </em>291 Fed.Appx. 947 (11th Cir.2008) (rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim that management was not his \u201cprime responsibility\u201d where the record was clear that \u201chis mana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>gerial duties \u2014 as the highest ranking employee on duty during the majority of his-shifts, in which he supervised the drivers, counterpersons, and cooks, apportioned work, made deposits, filled out required forms, interviewed prospective employees, and engaged in local restaurant marketing \u2014 were significantly more important to the operation of the restaurant than his non-managerial tasks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Barreto also presented evidence that his discretion in performing his managerial tasks was limited and his work was subject to supervision. Specifically, Barreto testified that he was required to order the cheapest produce available from a list of vendors pre-selected by management, to fix the pricing of the produce by increasing the wholesale prices according to a set scale given to him by management, and to order produce only as needed to restock preexisting supplies. He testified that he was told at the managers\u2019 meeting how many employees he needed to schedule for each shift and how many hours the employees would work. Barreto also testified that when he asked management to hire one or two more employees for his understaffed department, management denied his request and instructed him to cut the hours of the remaining hourly employees from 40 to 30 hours per week. This testimony, considered in the light most favorable to Barreto, contradicts Dhawan\u2019s con-clusory affidavit statements that Barreto was given \u201cwide latitude\u201d in managing his department and that he was responsible for using \u201chis judgment\u201d to accomplish certain business goals. As such, Barreto\u2019s testimony creates a genuine issue of fact regarding the extent of Barreto\u2019s discretionary powers and relative freedom from direct supervision while performing his identified managerial tasks, i.e., ordering produce, setting prices, and setting the work schedule for non-exempt employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In summary, Barreto\u2019s sworn testimony suggests that Barreto spent the majority of his time performing non-management duties; the management duties he did perform were less important to his position than the other types of duties he performed; and Barreto infrequently exercised his discretion and was subject to direct supervision. Accordingly, even though the evidence suggests that Barre-to\u2019s wages were significantly greater than the wages paid to the non-exempt employees in the produce department, we conclude that a reasonable factfinder could find that Barreto\u2019s managerial tasks did not constitute his \u201cprimary duties\u201d under the balancing test set forth in the Regulations. <em>See Morgan, </em>551 F.3d at 1280-81 (holding that store managers were not exempt executives where evidence showed that they \u201cspent most of their time performing manual, not managerial, tasks, that corporate manuals micro-managed store managers\u2019 performance of those tasks, that the 380 district managers closely supervised their store managers, and that store managers had little discretion or freedom from supervision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Based solely on Barreto\u2019s deposition, the district court also found that the evidence established that Barreto \u201ccustomarily and regularly directed the work of two or more employees\u201d and that his recommendations in hiring, firing or the advancement of employees were given \u201cparticular weight.\u201d Accordingly, the court found Davie Marketplace met the third and fourth prongs of the executive exemption test as a matter of law. Specifically, the district court noted that Barreto admitted that \u201che told employees who worked in the produce department their schedules and place[d] them on either the morning shift or afternoon shift,\u201d that \u201che would assign jobs to the employees to take merchandise outside, and had them rotate bad produce and refill missing produce,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and that \u201cnone of [the other employees] were experienced.\u201d The district court also noted that Barreto admitted that he had recommended that an employee be terminated for eating \u201cvery expensive fruit\u201d and that the employee had subsequently been fired. Furthermore, although Barreto made no recommendations regarding hiring or advancement of employees, the district court found that \u201cit is unlikely that evaluations and recommendations of advancement of employees would be made\u201d in the five months Barreto worked for Davie Marketplace. Therefore, although Dhawan\u2019s affidavit did not comment upon Barreto\u2019s authority to direct other employees or upon the weight given to his hiring or firing recommendations, the district court found that Barreto\u2019s deposition testimony alone established that the third and fourth prongs of the executive exemption had been met as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">We conclude, however, that Barreto\u2019s deposition testimony, when read in its entirety, does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion. First, regarding the third prong, the Regulations define \u201ctwo or more other employees\u201d as either two full-time workers or their equivalent. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.104(a). As to equivalency, \u201c[o]ne full-time and two half-time employees, for example, are equivalent to two full-time employees. Four half-time employees are also equivalent.\u201d <em>Id.; Morgan, </em>551 F.3d at 1274. In his deposition, Bar-reto testified that the produce department consisted of five employees, including himself, during his first week of employment, but that after the first week, \u201ctwo of them were reduced\u201d and that ultimately, there were \u201cthree less\u201d employees in the department. Barreto also testified that after the first week, there were \u201cthree [employees in the produce department] in the morning and one in the afternoon.\u201d Considering this testimony in the light most favorable to Barreto, after his first week on the job, Barreto supervised two half-time employees in the morning and was by himself in the department in the afternoon. Davie Marketplace offers no evidence refuting this testimony. Accordingly, we conclude that Davie Marketplace has not satisfied its burden of proving that Barreto regularly directed the work of two or more full-time employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Regarding the fourth prong, we disagree that evidence of one employment recommendation that was followed is sufficient to establish as a matter of law that Barreto\u2019s recommendations regarding hiring and firing were given a \u201cparticular weight.\u201d The Regulations explain that \u201c[t]o determine whether an employee\u2019s suggestions and recommendations are given \u2018particular weight,\u2019 factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, whether it is part of the employee\u2019s job duties to make such suggestions and recommendations; the frequency with which such suggestions and recommendations are made or requested; and the frequency with which the employee\u2019s suggestions and recommendations are relied upon.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.105. Here, Barreto\u2019s testimony established that, in one instance, his recommendation to fire an employee for a serious infraction \u2014 stealing\u2014was followed; however, his testimony also showed that in another instance, he recommended hiring additional employees and this advice was not heeded. Indeed, after he recommended that additional employees be hired, Barreto was directed instead to cut the hours of his remaining employees. Furthermore, Barreto stated that he did not evaluate the employees in his department and it is uncontested that he did not interview candidates or make any decisions regarding the hiring or advancement of other employees. As such, the evidence in the record creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether Barreto\u2019s employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>recommendations were given \u201cparticular weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Barreto, there are questions of fact as to whether his \u201cprimary duty\u201d consisted of management, whether he regularly directed the work of two or more full-time employees, and whether his recommendations in hiring, firing, or advancement of employees were given particular weight. Summary judgment based on the executive exemption is appropriate only where the four prongs of the \u201cexecutive exemption\u201d test are met as a matter of law; it is not the appropriate disposition where, as here, there remain issues of fact regarding three of the four elements. Accordingly, we vacate the entry of summary judgment and remand this matter to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\">. The district court correctly noted that \u201cemployees who do not spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt duties <em>may </em>nonetheless meet the primary duty requirement <em>if the other factors support such a conclusion.\" See 29 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 541.700(b), (c) (\"Time alone ... is not the sole test, and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work. Thus, for example, assistant managers in a retail establishment who perform exempt executive work such as supervising and directing the work of other employees, ordering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing payment of bills may have management as their primary duty even if the assistant managers spend more than 50 percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as running the cash register.\u201d). However, where an employee spends the majority of his time on nonexempt work and has admittedly few managerial-type obligations, there is at least a factual question as to whether the non-exempt duties are comparatively more important than the exempt duties. Such determinations of fact in the face of conflicting evidence are within the exclusive province of a jury. <em>See e.g., Morgan, </em>551 F.3d at 1269.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
