On appeal, Dinanto argues that the BIA by applying the \u201csystematic and pervasive\u201d standard did not properly review his \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution claim. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\">When the BIA issues a decision, we only review that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA issued its own decision and adopted th\u00e9 IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review both decisions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (discussing the standard of review for an IJ\u2019s factual determinations); <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(explaining the standard of review for a BIA\u2019s factual findings); <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001) (discussing the standard of review for a legal challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision). Under the substantial evidence test, we \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotations omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). \u201cTo reverse ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">An alien may establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA through evidence that he has suffered past persecution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or would more likely than not be persecuted on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion upon returning to his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">To establish a future threat to life or freedom, an alien may demonstrate either that he will be singled out for persecution or that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">there is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion^] and ... [t]he applicant establishes his ... own inclusion in and identification with such group of persons such that it is more likely than not that his ... life would be threatened upon return to that country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). The standard for withholding of removal \u201cis more stringent than the \u2018well-founded fear of future persecution\u2019 required for asylum.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1324 n. 2). We have said that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Here, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Dinanto did not establish that he would suffer persecution based on a pattern or practice of ethnic Chinese and Christians being persecuted in Indonesia. The 2007 Country-Report considered by the BIA indicates that conditions for ethnic Chinese have improved in Indonesia. Further, Dinan-to\u2019s siblings, who are ethnic Chinese and Christian, continue to reside in Indonesia without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In short, Dinanto does not raise any argument that the BIA ignored or overlooked his pattern or practice claim, or misconstrued the country reports. He limits his attack to the BIA\u2019s legal standard and its alleged vagueness, but he does not demonstrate how a further refinement of this standard would have changed the outcome in his favor. Given these considerations, the record does not compel a finding that Dinanto would suffer persecution upon return to Indonesia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny Dinanto\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-13\">. Even though Dinanto sets forth asylum law in his brief, he has abandoned his asylum claim by not challenging the BIA\u2019s finding that his asylum application was untimely without excuse. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that where a party fails to raise an argument on the merits of an issue in their brief or makes only passing references to an issue, such issue is deemed abandoned on appeal). He also has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief by failing to argue that he would more likely than not be tortured by the government. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that an alien seeking CAT relief must establish that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured with the government\u2019s acquiescence if sent to the proposed country of removal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\">. By not raising the issue on appeal, Dinanto has abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s finding that he did not suffer past persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-11\">. In addition, the Ninth Circuit's decision in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004), is not binding precedent, and even if it did apply, Dinanto would not be entitled to relief because he does not argue that he has an individualized risk of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 925-27 (holding that, even under the disfavored group approach, an applicant must show evidence of his own individualized risk of future persecution and cannot rely solely on being a member of the disfavored group for relief). Moreover, despite Dinanto\u2019s contentions, the Second Circuit in <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007), did not remand because of a disagreement with the BIA\u2019s \"systemic or pervasive\u201d standard, but because the IJ and BIA failed to address the petitioner\u2019s pattern or practice claim. <em>See id. </em>at 91-93. In contrast, the BIA addressed Dinanto's pattern or practice claim in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
