Jones, </em>on the brief), for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-9\">The ruling in <em>Pullman v. Hill, </em>1 Q. B. 524, (1891), that the dictation of a libellous letter to a shorthand writer and the copying of it by him on a typewriting machine is a publication so as to entitle the party to whom it is addressed to maintain an action of libel upon it, is effectively criticised in <em>Odgers on Libel and Slander, </em>174, and we are not aware that it has been adopted elsewhere. The conditions, moreover, in England and America are distinctly variant in respect to the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of private stenographers, and since the decision of the <em>Pullman </em>case, the use of stenographers has become practically universal in the United States for the transaction of private business. In view of the utility and almost universal employment of stenographers in America and the very confidential nature of their duties, the English rule ought not to be followed in this country. Public policy, convenience and necessity seem to forbid its adoption here. Looking at the question apart from authority and precedent, the requisite fact of publication is not apparent. Publication, in its most common sense, means the transmission of ideas and thoughts to the perceptions of people in general. Publication, in the law of libel and slander, means the transmission of ideas and thoughts to the perceptions of a person other than the parties to the suit. But to accomplish such a transmission in any aspect of the term, at least two mental operations are required. The idea or thought must be generated in the mind of the transmitter, and to perfect the publication thereof to the recipient, the mind of the latter must perform a distinct operation of a twofold nature. There must be not only a mere reception of the idea, but also a reflection on, or a digestion of, the same, in order to create a comprehension sufficient to complete the publication in the mind of the recipient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-5\">Now in the case before us, it is not denied that there was a <em>rcceptio?i </em>by the. stenographer of the thoughts expressed by the appellant. But this reception was but an instantaneous one, merely sufficient for their reduction to written characters. There was no attempt to digest the idea; there was no comprehension of its meaning. It found, indeed, no lodgment in the brain of the recipient. To the stenographer it meant nothing more than mere sound, mechanically transcribed as quickly as uttered. The stenographer acted here as a mere phonograph or as a piece of office machinery; the process which took place was purely a mechanical one: Her entire concentration of mind was on the characters representing the dictated thoughts. Her mind was not used at all, except as a channel, through which (as to her) meaningless utterances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>flowed from the brain of the appellant to the paper on which his ideas were transcribed. These ideas not being retained, not being reflected upon at all, and in fact not being comprehended in the slightest degree by the stenographer, it cannot possibly be said the facts as here presented satisfy the requirements mentioned above as necessary to constitute a publication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\">' The question involved in this case came up in <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Olgilvie Publishing Co., </em>32 N. Y. App. Div. 465; 53 N. Y. Supp. 1033. There the Court held that where the manager of a corporation in connection with its business dictated a libellous letter to a stenographer in the corporation\u2019s employment who copied it and mailed it to the plaintiff, the dictation, copying and mailing constituted but a single act of the corporation and did not amount to a publication of the letter. <em>Pullman </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>was not cited, but the New York decision shows the trend of American judicial opinion and the disinclination to adopt the narrow English view which was not applied in <em>Boxius </em>v. <em>Goblet Freres, </em>1 Q. B. (1894), 842.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">Apart from the question of publication, the defendant\u2019s second and third prayers bring up the propriety of the form of action arising from the facts of this case. For should the Court consider that the dictation by the appellant to Miss Willis of the two letters in question was such a communication to her of the defamatory words as to amount in law to a publication, it is respectfully submitted that it is only as <em>slander </em>that any cau.se of action could arise. At the moment of time when the alleged publication must have taken place, there had been in actual reality no writing whatever. It is only through the doctrine of identification of the agent with the principal that the subsequent writing down by Miss Willis of the defamatory words can be called an act of the appellant. But if this doctrine of identification is to be invoked to charge the appellant with having written out the defamatory words and so sustain the creation of a libel in the first instance, the logical consequence of the invocation of the doctrine will be so far to merge the agent and principal into one person as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>eliminate the idea of a third party from the whole matter and so destroy any foundation for treating the communication as a publication. On the other hand, eliminating the doctrine of identification, the use of which would, it seems, be fatal to the maintenance of an action in the form of slander as well as of libel, the appellee is relegated to the extremity of acknowledging, that at the time of occurrence of the publication no written defamanation was in existence, and that the communication up to this period of tim\u00e9 being entirely oral, slander is the only form of action which can be maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">Where the defamatory matter is published to one person only, proof of damage must be confined to the evidence of that person, for the plain reason that it is only <em>quoad </em>that single person, that the defamatory matter can possibly injuriously affect the plaintiff. <em>Dicken v. Shepherd, </em>22 Md. 412. And the Court properly so ruled in granting the appellant\u2019s fifth prayer,</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-6\">Here it cannot be pretended that the copying by Miss Willis upon her typewriter of the words dictated to her by the appellant occasioned any injury to the appellee, and she has testified that she never disclosed the contents of the letters to any person whatsoever. The allegation in the declaration is that \u201cin consequence of which premises, the plaintiff theretofore holding the situation of a railroad agent and doing a prosperous business as a general merchant and factor for merchants, lost his said situation, and his business and income became and are seriously diminished and impaired, and he has been and is greatly injured in his credit and reputation and other great loss and damage did sustain.\u201d But this allegation, appellee has distinctly failed to sustain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">There was no basis for the recovery of actual or substantial damages, nor did the appellee himself, as a witness, show any such actual damages. Such being the case, the Court below erred, we submit, in granting the appellee\u2019s fifth prayer, which instructed the jury that they could award the plaintiff such sum as under all the facts and circumstances of the case they should deem to be a fair and just <em>compensation </em>for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>injury sustained by him through the publication in question and <em>also </em>in their discretion could award <em>exemplary or punitive damages </em>as a punishment to the defendant for malice or ill-will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-5\">Again the Court erred, we submit, by rejecting the appellant\u2019s ninth prayer as follows : \u201cThat the plaintiff has offered no evidence of such actual and substantial damages sustained by him by the publication to Miss Willis, the confidential stenographer and typewriter of the defendant, of the two letters of August ioth, 1898, and February 8th, 1899, or either of them, as authorizes the allowance by the jury of exemplary or punitive damages, and that the jury cannot include in their verdict any allowance whatever for exemplary or vindictive damages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-6\">The proposition presented by this prayer is that where no actual damage has been claimed or shown, as it must be conceded is the case here, no exemplary or punitive damages can be allowed. <em>Stacy </em>v. <em>Portland Pub. Co., </em>68 Maine, 279; <em>Robinson &amp; Pattison v. Calvin Goins, </em>63 Miss. 500; <em>Louis Girard </em>v. <em>W. T. Moore, Jr., </em>86 Texas, 675. See also <em>Kuhn </em>v. <em>Ch. Ry. Co. </em>74 Iowa, 140-1; <em>Freese </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>70 Ill. 496; <em>Schippel </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>38 Kansas, 572; <em>Maxwell v.

App. 50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-7\">Apart from authority this ought to be the law. The rule is that where the libel really injures the plaintiff, this injury may be <em>compensated, </em>and when the plaintiff is shown to be really and actually injured, <em>and </em>express malice or ill-will is found, the jury, in addition to the <em>compensatory </em>damages, may give <em>punitive </em>damages. But <em>in the absence of actual injury, </em>entitling the plaintiff to <em>compensation, </em>it-surely cannot be right to permit the jury to <em>punish </em>the defendant. Exemplary or punitive damages are sometimes allowed in <em>addition </em>to actual damages, but should never be permitted to be given where no actual injury is shown demanding <em>compensation. Compensation, </em>in other words, is the foundation upon which the law sometimes allows <em>punishment </em>to be built. But <em>punishment </em>is not justifiable where there is no right to <em>compensation. </em>The injury done to the appellee was nominal, merely resulting at most from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>what is claimed to have been a <em>strictly technical publication. </em>Only nominal damages should therefore have been allowed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-5\"><em>William Colton, Harry C.

B. 524; <em>Poe on Pleading, </em>sec. 179; <em>Odgers on Libel and Slander, </em>ch. 6. A message sent by telegraph is actionable, because the contents of the telegram are necessarily communicated to all the clerks through whose hands it passes, and so with the postcard. <em>Whitfield et al. </em>v.

The delivery of a manuscript to a printer to be printed is a sufficient publication, if any copies be printed ; even though the author repented and suppressed all the copies printed. <em>For the compositor must have read it. Baldwin </em>v. <em>Elphinston, </em>2 W. Bl. 1037. This may be considered a somewhat harsh decision, as the compositor does not attend to the substance of the manuscript, but sets it up in type mechanically; but it has been recently acted on in America. <em>Trumbull v. Gibbons, </em>3 City Hall Rec. 97; and see <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Fraser et al., </em>7 Ad. &amp; E. 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\">Sending a libellous letter, or speaking defamatory words to the plaintiff\u2019s agent or solicitor, is a sufficient publication to a third person. <em>Tuson </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>12 Ad. &amp; E. 733; <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>1 F. &amp; F. 552; <em>Hancock </em>v. <em>Case, </em>2 F. &amp; F. 711; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Kitchener, </em>4 Times L. R. 159. Where the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff himself, but read to a friend before posting it, this was held a publication to the friend. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>6 Barbour, N. Y. 47; <em>McCoombs </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>5 Black. Ind. 431. So, where the defendant before posting a letter to the plaintiff had it copied, <em>held </em>a publication by the defendant to his own clerk, who copied it. <em>Kiene </em>v. <em>Ruff, </em>1 Clark, Iowa, 482; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>115 N.

Where two persons have participated in the composition of a libellous letter written by one of them, which was afterwards put in the postoffice and sent by mail to the person to whom addressed, such participation was held to be competent, and sufficient evidence to prove the publication by both. <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Cush. 72. Any person who by words causes another to write or print the thing conveying the libellous matter, may be guilty, <em>as if his own hand traced the lines. Cochran </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>18 N. H. 117; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>W. U. Telegraph Co., </em>65 Minn. 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-5\">Vindictive or exemplary damages are awarded where the jury desire to mark their sense of the defendant\u2019s harsh conduct by fining him to a certain extent. They, therefore, punish the defendant by awarding the plaintiff damages in excess of the amount which would be adequate compensation for the injury which he inflicted on his reputation. Thus, where a letter was sent privately to one person only, on whom it made no impression, the jury yet awarded 3,000 pounds damages on the ground that there must have been some vindictiveness. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Coleridge, </em>1 Times L. R., page 87. It is clearly competent to. a jury in a proper case to find vindictive damages in an action of libel or slander. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 Mod. 150; <em>Emblen </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>6 H. &amp; N. 54; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Midland Ry.

The damages in such an action are not limited to the amount of pecuniary loss which the plaintiff is able to prove. <em>Davis &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Shepstone, </em>11 App. Cas. 191; 13 <em>Am. &amp; Eng.

When words are actionable without special damages, the jury may take into consideration, not only the injury which has arisen, but which may arise rom the slander, because such fresh injury will constitute no fresh cause of action. <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>76 Ind. 216\u2014219; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Cook v.

No explanation of the terms used by the appellant in the letters addressed by him to the appellee is necessary. These letters are plainly actionable. The language is libellous <em>per se. </em>No attempt was made by the appellant to justify in the pleadings, under which the appellant admitted that the plaintiff was not guilty of any of said charges, and that the appellee was therefore entitled to recover in his action if the publication was made out as required by the plaintiff\u2019s and 4J^ prayers.

The plaintiff offered five prayers, all of which were granted, and the defendant offered fifteen prayers, of which the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 1 ith, 12th, 13th and 14th, were granted and his 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 15th were rejected. A single exception was taken by the defendant to this ruling on the prayers, and the three following questions arises upon the exception :</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">1st. -Whether the dictation of alleged libellous letters to defendant\u2019s private and confidential stenographer, their reduction by her to stenographic characters, and subsequent reduction to the characters of the alphabet by means of a typewriter, their signing by the defendant, and their transmission by his direction to the plaintiff, is in law a publication of such letters, where there is no communication of any of said letters, in any manner, to any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">2nd. Whether in such case, the proper action is for libel or slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">3rd. Whether under the testimony in this case, the jury was properly instructed as to the allowance of exemplary or vindictive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">There were three counts in the declaration upon three separate letters, and the case was tried on the general issue plea, there being no plea of justification alleging the truth of any of the charges contained in any of the letters, either in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Of the libellous character of each of these letters there can be no question, but the letter in the third count was shown by the uncontradicted testimony to be wholly in the handwriting of defendant and never to have been read or exhibited to any one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>but the plaintiff, and the jury was properly instructed by the defendant\u2019s fourth prayer that there could be no recovery on the third count.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">It was very earnestly and ably argued by the appellant\u2019s counsel that as the two letters in the first and second counts were not <em>otherwise published, </em>than as above stated, there was no <em>actionable publication </em>of either lettery so as to make either one a libel, and consequently, that the Court erred in granting the plaintiff\u2019s 3^ and prayers, and in rejecting the defendant\u2019s first, second and third prayers, which, respectively, raised the contentions of the parties on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">This is certainly an important question, and one which has never before been raised in this Court. Indeed, the appellant\u2019s counsel states in his brief, that it has never been expressly ruled upon in America, though he has referred us to a case in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York <em>(Owen </em>v. <em>Ogilvie Pub. Co., </em>32 App. Div. 465), which he contends supports his positions. The apppellee\u2019s counsel has submitted a very full brief, but has referred us to no American case upon this point. If such authorities existed, we may safely assume they would not have escaped the well-known diligence of counsel, and we have found none such in our own examination ; but the principles and considerations upon which this question should be decided, are not, in our opinion, difficult to determine, and the instructive English cases which have been cited are in accord with these principles and considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Before considering the argument of the appellant, it will be well to recall the definition of publication, given by competent authority, as necessary to constitute -slander a libel. Mr. Odgers, in his work on <em>Libel and Slander, </em>p. 150, defines publication, as applicable either to slander or libel, as, \u201cthe communication of the defamatory words to some third person and on page 1, he says: \u201cFalse defamatory words, if written <em>and published, </em>constitute a libel; if spoken, a slander.\u201d It is obvious however that publication is essential to either, and that the words, \u201cif published,\u201d though not repeated in the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>clause, must be understood, as if repeated. For, to shout aloud defamatory words on a desert moor where no one hears them, is not a publication of -the slander, nor is the utterance of such words in a foreign language, a publication, if no one present understands their meaning. <em>Idem. </em>151.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">For the same, reason, very clearly, if one should write a defamatory letter, and hand it to a third person, to be read, who -does not understand and cannot read that language, there would be no publication. of the libel. In <em>Pullman </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>1 Q. B. Div. (1891), p. 529, Lopes, L. J., defines publication of a libel -in the exact words cited from Mr. Odgers, and in the same case, Lord Esher, Master of the Rolls, defines it, more fully, and perhaps with more technical accuracy, as, \u201cthe making known the defamatory matter, <em>after it has been written, </em>to some person other than the person to whom it is written.\u201d Appellant's counsel, in his brief, says, with equal clearness and accuracy: \u201cPublication, in the law of libel and slander, means the transmission of ideas and thoughts to the perception of a person, other than the parties to the suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Bearing in mind these definitions and simple illustrations of what is, and what is not, publication, it will be seen that the argument that there has been no actionable publication in this -case, divides itself into two branches. The theory of the first branch is, that while there was in fact a physical or mechanical <em>reception </em>by the stenographer of the thoughts expressed by the appellant, that such reception was instantaneous only, and merely sufficient for their reduction to written characters; but that there was no comprehension, and no lodgment, of their meaning in the brain of the recipient, who acted as a mere phonograph, and whose function in that regard was not a mental, but purely a mechanical process; so that there was no such <em>perception </em>as is requisite to constitute publication. This theory is both ingenious and subtle, but we cannot be persuaded it is sound. \u2022 We cannot doubt that the dictation to Miss Willis, though taken down in stenographic characters, produced in her mind as full and complete perception of the 'thoughts of the appellant, as a slower dictation, for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>pose of reduction to ordinary characters, would have produced in the mind of one not a stenographer. If this were not so, there could be no assurance that there would be an accurate reproduction of the matter dictated, such as common knowledge gives assurance of from any skillful stenographer. A communication therefore to a stenographer must be regarded precisely as a communication to an ordinary amanuensis, and as establishing all that is ordinarily necessary to constitute publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The second branch of the argument is, that in view of the fact that Miss Willis was the private and confidential .stenographer of the defendant, and in view of the almost universal employment, in this country, of such stenographers, and the necessity for such employment consequent upon the demands of business, that a communication to such a stenographer, should be made an exception to the general rule, and be held' not to be an actionable publication. But we cannot adopt this view. Apart from any precedent or authority, we can perceive no good reason why such an exception should be made to the rule. Neither the prevalence of any business customs or methods, .nor the pressure of business which compels resort to stenographic assistance, can make that legal which is illegal, nor make that innocent which would otherwise be actionable. Nor can the fact that the stenographer is under contractual or moral obligation to regard all his employer\u2019s communications as confidential alter the reason of the matter. This defense was made in <em>Williamson </em>v. Freer, L. R. 9 C. P. 393, where it was held that the unnecessary transmission by a postoffice telegram, of libellous matter, which would have been privileged, if sent in a sealed letter, avoids the privilege ; Lord Coleridge, C. J. saying: \u201cAlthough the clerks are prohibited under severe penalties from disclosing the contents of telegrams passing through their hands, <em>still there is a disclosure to them!*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In <em>Pullman </em>v. Hill, already cited, the exact question here presented was decided. There, the letter containing the defamatory matter was dictated by the managing director of a corporation to a clerk, who took down the words in short-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Land, and then wrote them out fully by means of a typewriting machine, and the letter thus written was copied by an office boy in a letter-press book. When it reached its destination, it was in the ordinary course of business, opened by a clerk of the plaintiff; and it was held that the letter must be taken to have been published both to the typewriter and.to the \u2022copy-press boy., as well to the plaintiff\u2019s clerk. Lord Esher, M. R., in the course of his opinion said: \u201cI do not think that the necessities or the luxuries of business can alter the law of England. If a merchant wishes to write a letter containing defamatory matter, and to keep a copy of the letter, he had 'better make the copy himself.\u201d Lopes, L. J.,said: \u201cIt is said business cannot be carried on if merchants may not employ their clerks to write letters for them in the ordinary course of business. I think the answer to this is very simple. \u25a0 I have never yet heard that it is in the usual course of a merchant's business to write letters containing defamatory statements. If a merchant has <em>occasion to write such a letter, he </em>must write it himself and copy it himself, or he must take the consequences.\u201d Kay, L. J., said: <em>\u201c </em>The consequence of such an alteration in the law of libel would be this, that any merchant or solicitor who desired to write a libel concerning any person would be privileged to communicate the libel to any agent he pleased if it was in the ordinary course of his business. That would be an extraordinary alteration of the law, and it would enable people to defame others to an alarming extent,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We- were referred to <em>Boxsius </em>v. <em>Goblet Freres, </em>1 <em>Q. </em>B. Div. (1894), p. 843, as evincing a disposition to qualify the rule in <em>Pullman </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>but we cannot discover such disposition, and if we could, we should not be -inclined to follow it. There, the libellous letter was dictated by a solicitor, acting in behalf of and at the direction of his client, and copies were made as in the case mentioned. The Court distinguished the case very clearly from <em>Pullman </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>holding, through two of the same judges, that the solicitor owed to his client the duty to-act on his instructions, and that if the solicitor had communicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>directly with the plaintiff, the communication would have been privileged, and that he could discharge that duty, as he did other business of the office, in the ordinary way without losing the privilege. But there was no question of privilege in <em>Pullman </em>v. Hill, and there is none here, as the appellant owed no duty in the matter to any one. The typewriter had no conceivable interest in hearing or seeing the letters, and there could be therefore no privilege between her and the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Ogilvie Pub. Co., </em>32 App. Div. N. Y. 465, the alleged libellous letter relating to the business of a corporation, was dictated by its manager to its stenographer, who wrote it out in shorthand, copied it upon a typewriter and mailed it. The manager and stenographer were held to be servants of a common master, and to be engaged in the performance of duties which their respective employments required, and that under such circumstances, the stenographer should not be regarded as a third person, in the sense that either the dictation or the subsequent reading should be regarded as a publication by the corporation. The English cases mentioned were not referred to, but the Court nevertheless said : \u201c It may be that the dictation to the stenographer and her reading of the letter, would constitute a publication of the same by the person dictating it, if the relation existing between the manager and the copyist was that of master and servant, and the letter be held not to be privileged.\u201d Upon the exact question here involved, the above extract from the opinion in that case, seems to afford slender support to the appellant\u2019s contention, and what it does decide is not in accord with the views expressed by this Court in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Howe Machine Co., </em>51 Md. 294, in which Judge Alvey said it would seem to be now clear, whatever may have been the former state of judicial opinion upon the subject, that corporations are liable for all-acts, whether willful or malicious, of their agents or servants, done in the course of their employment, and that actions for such injuries, including libel, could be sustained against corporations in any case where, under similar circumstances, such actions could be sustained against individuals for the acts of their servants. It is true that that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>case was not an action for libel, but it sufficiently indicates that this Court would not be astute to find reasons for relieving corporations from liability in libel cases, for want of technical publication. We think for the reasons given above, that the defendants first prayer was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Apart from the question of publication, the defendant\u2019s second and third prayers raise the additional question whether,, under the pleadings in this case, the action must not have been for slander, instead of libel, but we have no difficulty on this point. We have no doubt that i the dictation of these letters-to the stenographer was the publication of a slander, for which if nothing further had been done by either, an action of slander could have been maintained, but we have no more doubt that the stenographic notes, the typewritten copy and the letter-press copy, constituted the publication of a libel, and that either slander or libel could be maintained, as the appellee should elect. This conclusion, we think, necessarily follows, from what we have already said, without more formally stating the reasons, and our conclusion is not shaken by Mr. Odgers\u2019 ciiticism of the decision in <em>Pullman </em>v. <em>Hill </em>upon the form of action, to be found on p. 174 of his last edition. We therefore think the defendants second and third prayers were properly rejected, not only for the reasons now given, but for those applicable to defendant\u2019s first pi'ayer, and that the plaintiff\u2019s and 4*^ prayers were for the same reasons properly granted. The plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers were not questioned at the argument and are so clearly correct as to-require no notice. The plaintiff\u2019s fifth pi'ayer was also properly granted for reasons which will appear when we come to-consider the defendant\u2019s ninth prayei'.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The defendant\u2019s ninth prayer was properly rejected, because it <em>precluded </em>the jury from including in their verdict any allowance whatever for exemplaxy or punitive damages. Whenever the words charged in an action for slander or libel, are actionable <em>per se, </em>as in this case, the damages are exclusively within the sound discretion of the jury. 13 <em>Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of </em>Law, 432; <em>Tripp </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Cress. 427; <em>Marks v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Jacobs, </em>76 Ind. 216; <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Traber, </em>49 Md. 470; <em>Negley </em>v. <em>Farrow, 60 </em>Md. 148. Whether exemplary damages shall be given or not, is in all cases for the jury. <em>Jerome </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>48 Vt. 230; <em>Boardman v. Goldsmith, </em>48 Vt. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The assessment of damages is peculiarly the province of a jury in an action for libel. The damages in such an action are not limited to the amount of pecuniary loss which the plaintiff is able to prove. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Shepstone, </em>11 App. Cases, 191, per Lord Herschell. The jury must not be restricted by a direction not to give such damages. <em>DeVaughn </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>37 Ala. 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer is in accord with these principles and was therefore properly granted. We cannot however avoid the conclusion that there was error in the rejection of the defendant\u2019s fifteenth prayer, which asked that the jury be instructed, if the defendant honestly and in good faith believed the statements contained in the letters to be true, and had grounds for such belief sufficient to satisfy an ordinarily prudent and cautious man that such stp^ements were true, then the jury might take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and in the exercise of their discretion, award to the plaintiff nominal damages merely. This prayer is very carefully guarded by the requirement to find honest belief of the truth of the charges, and of reasonable ground for such belief, and in its conclusion is substantially the converse of the proposition contained in the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer which we-have said was properly granted. By the rejection of the defendant\u2019s fifteenth prayer, the jury were practically told they must give exemplary damages, and were absolutely refused! the discretion to withhold them. But in no case has a plaintiff any legal right to exemplary damages. Such damages; depend upon the case, and the evidence and finding of the jury. <em>Jerome </em>v. <em>Smith, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Where there is evidence of circumstances sufficient to uphold a verdict for exemplary damages, the question whether they shall be given, or not, is one for the jury. <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>48 Vt. 403. And it is error to instruct them they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>must give exemplary damages. <em>Sedgwick on </em>Damages, 333; <em>Hawk </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>33 Ill. 473.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b102-8\">(Decided February 21st, 1901.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The words used here being actionable <em>per se, </em>although there was no proof of actual and substantial damages sustained by the publications to Miss Willis of the two letters, the jury \u25a0could not properly have been deprived of their discretion to give exemplary damages, if they found malice, nor could they on the other hand, either by the granting of an erroneous instruction or the rejection of a proper one, be deprived of their \u2022discretion to refuse to award exemplary damages if they found no malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">For the error in the rejection of the defendant\u2019s fifteenth prayer it will be necessary to reverse the judgment that a new trial may be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Judgment reversed with costs to appellant above and </em>below, <em>and new trial awarded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
