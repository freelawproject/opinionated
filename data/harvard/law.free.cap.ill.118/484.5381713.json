An instrument in the form of a check, by a depositor upon his banker, is not a draft or bill of exchange merely because it is drawn by a party out \u2022of this State on a bank in this State, or contains the words \u201coriginal, \u201d and '\u201csecond unpaid.\u201d The use of these words does not make its payment conditional.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b484-10\" pgmap=\"484\">' 3. The issue of more than one copy of a bill of exchange or check upon a bank does not, in any sense, render the instrument conditional. The whole of the sets constitutes, in law, but one bill, and the payment or cancellation of either of the sets is a discharge of all.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-11\" pgmap=\"484\">Writ of Error to the Appellate Court for the First District ;\u2014heard in that court on appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Foreign bills are drawn in sets, for the convenience of the holder in obtaining an early and sure acceptance. No other negotiable instrument is thus drawn. Downes v. Church, 13 Pet. 205.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-15\" pgmap=\"484(43) 485(35)\">Commonly, the drawer of foreign bills delivers to the payee different bills of the same tenor and date, each containing a condition that it is to be paid, provided the others remain unpaid, and all of them, collectively, amount to one bill, and a payment to the holder of either is good, and a payment of one of the set is a payment of the whole.

[Original.]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b486-8\" pgmap=\"486\">State of Indiana.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b486-9\" pgmap=\"486\">Banking House of A. &amp; J. C. S.

A. &amp; J. C. S. Harrison.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b486-12\" pgmap=\"486\">\u201cTo Merchants\u2019 National Bank, Chicago, 111.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b486-13\" pgmap=\"486\">\u201cNo. 130,263.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b486-14\" pgmap=\"486\">Indorsed across the face, \u201c$2000, William Haerle.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b486-15\" pgmap=\"486\">The trial court held in the affirmative, and this ruling was affirmed in the Appellate Court.</p> <p id=\"b486-16\" pgmap=\"486\">It is not contended, and could not he, on authority, that the fact that it is drawn by parties in Indiana on a bank in this State, can be held to determine that it is not a check. Parsons, in his work on Bills and Notes, (vol. 2, pp. 58, 59,) says: \u201cThey\u201d (i. e., checks,) \u201care much used here in drawing from one State upon houses of deposit in another.\u201d And Union National Bank v. Oceana County Bank, 80 Ill. 212, and National Bank of America v. Indiana Banking Co. 114 id. 483, disregard the fact that the drawer resides in one State and the drawee in another, upon the validity or character of instruments as checks.</p> <p id=\"b486-18\" pgmap=\"486(95) 487(132)\">The only reason urged why this instrument is not a check, is the fact that it contains the words, \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201c(second unpaid.) \u201d These, it is contended, make its payment conditional. We can not concur in this view. The practice of making more than one copy of an instrument ordering or requesting the payment of money, we concede, is generally confined to foreign bills of exchange; but there is nothing, in our opinion, in the purpose .or effect of that, practice, which should render it inapplicable, under all circumstances, to checks. The purpose is to guard against loss or question in case of miscarriage, the chances of the bill reaching, in due season, the party to whom it is transmitted, being increased by the number of copies. (1 Parsons on Notes and Bills, 58, 59.) But this does not render the instrument a conditional one, in any sense. The whole of the sets constitutes, in law, but one bill, and therefore payment or cancelling of either of the sets is a discharge. (1 Parsons on Notes and Bills, 59.) The essential characteristic of a check is, that it shall be instantly payable on demand. 2 Dani\u00e9ll on Negotiable Instruments, (3d ed.) sec. 1572; 2 Parsons on Notes and Bills, pp. 59,60. And that demand is effected, unconditionally, the moment either copy is presented.</p> <p id=\"b487-5\" pgmap=\"487\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b487-6\" pgmap=\"487\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
