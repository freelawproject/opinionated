A manufacturer sold and put up for a gas company the materials and apparatus for making gas, warranting their quality and soundness, which shortly after were destroyed by fire. The agent of the company falsely represented to the manufacturers that the loss was occasioned by defects in the machinery they had sold and supplied, under the belief of which the latter furnished other machinery in lieu of that destroyed, intending to make no charge therefor, and expended money in putting up the same: Held, that \u2022on account of the fraud, the manufacturer had the right to sue the company for the materials so.furnished and the money so expended, under the com.mon counts.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-5\" pgmap=\"267\">3.

The declaration contained the common counts only.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\" pgmap=\"267(211) 268(91)\">Appellees were builders of gas apparatus for the manufacture of \u201cwater gas,\u201d\u2014a patent process for making gas. Appellant bought a set of apparatus of appellees. The set included a superheater, generator, condenser, and various tanks, pumps, pipes, etc. They were placed in the works, and in a short time, from some unknown cause, the works took fire and burned up. The works were rebuilt, and new machinery of appellees\u2019 make, so far as new machinery was necessary, was used. In a short time another fire occurred, and again from an unknown cause. After some investigation of the causes, Mr. Hauk, the secretary of appellant, wrote to appellees, saying: \u201cWe very much regret to inform you that we have met with another serious loss. Our entire works burned down here Tuesday night, the 17th inst.; loss, heavy; cause of fire, the bursting of a pipe from small tank or pump to generator. The pressure you recommended (340 lbs.) was too much.\u201d Afterward, Mr. Hauk went to Philadelphia, to appellees\u2019 place of business, and it is claimed Mr. Hauk there made similar statements as to the cause of the fire, and that, \u25a0on the strength of such statements, appellees were induced to \u25a0and did give appellant various apparatus to repair the works destroyed by fire. Appellees claim the- statements made by Mr. Hauk as to the cause of the fire, were false, and therefore seek to avoid the contract under which they furnished the goods, and, under the common counts in assumpsit, recover the reasonable value of the goods. Appellant admits the writing of the above mentioned letter by Mr. Hauk, but denies that Mr. Hauk made any misstatements to appellees, either in the letter or orally, and says that, in any event, appellees can not recover on the common counts.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">After learning that no gas was being made when the fire occurred, that there was no pressure on the pipe, and that it was not in fact bursted, appellees made demand of payment of appellant, and, on refusal, brought this suit.

The two could not exist at the same time. Appellees admit the express contract was, that appellant was not to pay for the goods. But, as we understand, appellees claim the goods were procured tortiously, and they waive the tort, and sue for the value of the goods. That can only be done when the wrongdoer has converted the goods into money,\u2014then he is liable for goods had and received. Creel v. Kirkham, 47 Ill. 344; Johnson v.

At the time that request, was made, the agent of appellant falsely represented to appellees that a state of facts existed under which it was the duty of appellees to furnish the materials and expend the money for the use of appellant by virtue-of the terms of a prior contract, whereby appellees were obligated to sell and deliver to appellant, machinery, etc., of a-particular quality and soundness. If that representation had. been true, appellees were already paid for the materials furnished and money expended; but not being true, the amount remained to be paid by appellant. There was no mistake- or misrepresentation in regard to the use to which the materials furnished should be applied, and for which the money was to be expended,\u2014there was simply falsehood^and misrepresentation in regard to whether facts existed making it the duty of appellees to furnish these materials and pay out-that money on account of a consideration already received. The proof of the delivery of the materials and the payment. of the money made a prima facie case, entitling the plaintiff to recover, and that case was not rebutted by showing that the delivery and payment were pursuant to the old contract, when it was also shown that the facts which were represented to exist, whereby it would have been the duty of appellees to have made the delivery and payment under that contract, did not, in fact, exist, and that the representations of appellant\u2019s agent in that regard were false and fraudulent. The defence fails, because it is based on falsehood and fraud. The case, in principle, is as if A goes to a clerk in a store or shop and tells him to let him have certain goods\u2014that he has already made payment therefor to the principal or to another clerk. The clerk, believing him, delivers the goods. Subsequently the clerk learns that the representation that he had paid for the goods is false, and thereupon A is sued, on the common counts, for the value of the goods. The contract-is fully performed upon the one side, and nothing remains upon the other but to make payment. The fact that, by willful misrepresentation, the creditor is at first deceived into the belief that payment has already been made, can make no difference. It was never intended the goods and money should be given away, or that anything but money should be accepted in exchange for them.</p> <p id=\"b271-6\" pgmap=\"271\">But if the form of the action should have been in tort, the objection on that ground should have been specifically urged at the first opportunity, for, under the provisions of section 23 of chapter 110, entitled \u201cPractice,\u201d (2 Starr &amp; Curtis\u2019 Stat. 1787,) it was competent, at any time before final judgment, to so amend the pleadings as to change the form of action from assumpsit to case. The objection is of a purely formal character, and not having been urged in apt time, is to be deemed as waived.</p> <p id=\"b271-8\" pgmap=\"271(30) 272(19)\">An objection is urged in regard to the improper admission of certain evidence; but, on examining the record, we think the objection is based on a misapprehension. The ruling of the court seems to have been properly limited, and no question of law, in that respect, is presented.</p> <p id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272\">The main controversy in the trial court was one of fact. The judgment of the Appellate Court precludes further question in that regard, and we discover no error of law of sufficient importance to require a reversal of the judgment. -</p> <p id=\"ALQn\" pgmap=\"272\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b272-6\" pgmap=\"272\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
