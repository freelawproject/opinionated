Invention\u2014who to be regarded as the inventor. Where one party invents a new principle in machinery, as, to make a hard iron shoe with a soft iron stem, for stamping and pulverizing ores, and for which he applies for letters patent, and another suggests the plan of first pouring in the hard iron and then the soft iron, to fill up the place for the stem, which, on experiment by the inventor of the principle, proves successful, the fact of such suggestion being made to the first party will not defeat his claim as the inventor, especially when the other acquiesces in the claim, and accepts letters patent to both under an assignment of a half interest.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8z\" pgmap=\"99\">2.

Gates exhibited his bill in chancery, in the circuit court of Cook county, against David it. Fraser and Thomas Chalmers, in which, among other things, it .is, in substance, alleged that Gates invented a new and useful improved shoe for stamping or pulverizing ores, for which he made application for letters patent; that before the patent was issued, Gates assigned all his right, title and interest in the invention to himself and David E. Fraser, in consideration that Fraser then verbally agreed with him that each should pay one-half the expense to be incurred in procuring the patent, and that they would be equal partners in all losses and expenses relating to the patent, and in the gains and profits thereof, and in all royalties or patent fees to be derived therefrom; that letters patent for such invention were thereupon issued to said Gates and said Fraser, jointly; that soon after obtaining said letters patent, they, by mutual agreement, adopted and fixed as the royalty, or patent fee to be paid by persons who might sell or furnish for use said patent shoes, one cent per pound weight thereof, which was then, and still is, a reasonable patent fee therefor, and they collected and divided, between themselves, equally, as co-partners, from the date of the issuing of said letters patent until the 1st day of January, 1878, patent fees or royalties on sales of said patent shoes by other persons, at the rate of one cent per pound weight thereof, amounting to from $300 to $1000 \u2018or $1200 per year, except during a few months they charged and collected a royalty of only one-half cent per pound on sales, by reason of the competition of others in supplying to the trade, mining machinery of a similar kind. But such competition ceased on or about the 1st day of January, in the year 1878, and thereafter a reasonable and proper patent fee, for making and selling to others said improved shoe, was, and has been, one cent per pound weight thereof. It is alleged, that since May 14, 1879, Fraser and Thomas Chalmers have been doing business as machinists and manufacturers of mining machinery, in the city of Chicago, under the firm name of Fraser &amp; Chalmers, and have manufactured and sold large quantities of said patent shoes, upon which Gates claims that he is entitled to royalty; that Fraser &amp; Chalmers refuse to account for royalty on such shoes; that Gates is willing to account for royalty on sales made by him since said date, etc. Prayer is that Fraser &amp; Chalmers be required to account for royalty on sales made by them, and to pay over, etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\" pgmap=\"101(20) 102(327)\">The answer of Fraser admits that letters patent were-issued to Gates and himself, as co-owners, as alleged in the bill, but denies that Fraser, at any time, entered into an agreement with Gates in regard to the ownership or use of said letters patent; but he says that, being ignorant of his rights in the premises, he, for a long time, supposed that he was under legal obligation to account to Gates, because he and Gates were co-owners of said patent, and that he did account and pay over to Gates half the profits received by him from the use of the patent, down to January, 1878; that on the 22d of May, 1878, Gates filed a petition in bankruptcy, and was thereupon adjudged a bankrupt, and he insists that by the petition in bankruptcy of Gates, any relation of co-partnership between him and defendant, if any there was, became thereby terminated and dissolved. It is therein further alleged, that Fraser, becoming better advised in regard to his rights as co-owner of the patent, after the 1st of January, 1878, refused to account to Gates for one-half of the profits or royalties arising from said patent; that about the 14th of May, 1879, said letters patent were sold by Gates\u2019 assignee in bankruptcy, and purchased by Gates, to whom the assignee made conveyance; but Fraser denies that this revived any rights of Gates as co-partner with himself in the patent; denies that Fraser, as co-patentee, is, or ever has been, under any legal obligation to account to Gates for any part of the profits, royalties or license fees received by him for the use of the said patent, and denies that he is under any liability to account. The answer admits that since the 14th of May, 1879, and previous thereto, Fraser licensed the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers to use said letters patent, upon their paying him a license fee of half a cent a pound upon all articles manufactured under the same. Chalmers also answered, denying any liability to account.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\" pgmap=\"102(38) 103(61)\">Subsequently, Fraser filed an amended answer, denying that Gates was the sole inventor of said shoe for stamping ores, and claiming that Fraser was equally entitled with Gates to the patent issued for the same; denying that Gates assigned him a one-half interest in said letters patent because \u25a0of good will, or friendly feeling, or upon the condition that Fraser would divide- any of the royalties coming from the .same, with Gates; but charges that said letters patent were issued to Gates &amp; Fraser, jointly, because of their joint rights .and interests, etc. Replication was filed to the answer.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\" pgmap=\"103\">The court decreed in favor of the complainant. The decree finds the allegations of the bill to be proved, setting forth, specifically, the facts, and refers the cause to a master in chancery, to \u201ctake proof, and state an account since the 14th day of May, 1879, between complainant, and defendant, .'Fraser, in respect to said patent. \u201d The master afterwards reported, in substance, as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\" pgmap=\"103(222) 104(150)\">\u201cAfter fully considering the evidence and arguments of \u2022counsel, finds that the complainant, since May 14,1879, has licensed, under the patent mentioned in the decree, the firm \u2022of P. W. Gates\u2019 Sons &amp; Co., and the Gates &amp; Scoville Iron Works, to manufacture, and that few sales have been made by them, owing to Fraser &amp; Chalmers having practical control of the mining machinery business; that complainant had \u25a0not collected royalties of said firm and corporation licensed by him, as he had an interest in both, and had not settled his account with them, but he consents that he be charged the royalty on shoes sold, at one cent per pound, which are all shoes sold under his license since May 14, 1879. That \u25a0during said time the firm of Fras\u00e9r &amp; Chalmers did a large 'business in mining machinery, and all shoes made under the Fraser license were sold by said firm. At said last mentioned \u2022date, the defendant, Fraser, for the purpose of avoiding any \u2022accounting with the complainant for any royalties or license fees with which he might become chargeable if said firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers continued to have said shoes manufactured, made an arrangement with said Barnum &amp; Richardson Manufacturing Company, by \"which he, said David R. \u00a1Fraser, employed said Barnum &amp; Richardson Manufacturing Company to manufacture said shoes for him, said Fraser, and from March 1, 1881, to September, 1882, all shoes sold by said Fraser &amp; Chalmers were manufactured by said Barnum &amp; Richardson Manufacturing Company, and charged to-said Fraser individually, but his account was paid by the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers by their checks, and said Fraser was paid or credited on the books of Fraser &amp; Chalmers, with a one-half or one-fourth cent per pound on said shoes, in pursuance of some sort of indefinite understanding between said Fraser and said firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers. From September, 1882, to date of accounting before me, Fraser &amp; Chalmers manufactured in their own foundry, under Fraser\u2019s-license, the shoes, except those under date of June, 1882.\u201d From said findings, and evidence attached to report, the-master states the following account under the first direction, in the decree, to-wit:</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\" pgmap=\"104\">Charges Fraser with patent fees or royalties received by him on 950,244 pounds of shoes at one-half cent, and 722,381 pounds at one-fourth</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\" pgmap=\"104\">cent........$6557 IT</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\" pgmap=\"104\">Charges complainant, Gates, with patent fees or</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\" pgmap=\"104\">royalties on 17,521 pounds of shoes at one cent. 175 21</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\" pgmap=\"104\">Excess of Fraser\u2019s over Gates\u2019 royalties. - - $6381 96-</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-10\" pgmap=\"104\">December 15, 1883, due Gates from Fraser, one-</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\" pgmap=\"104\">half of said excess. ----- 3190 98</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-12\" pgmap=\"104\">\u201cI have charged the defendant, Fraser, with the amount, allowed to him by his said firm upon the shoes manufactured by him, through the Barnum &amp; Richardson Manufacturing-Company, from March 1, 1881, to September, 1882, because-it appears from said evidence that the change made by said Fraser, by which he caused said shoes to be charged to him upon the books of the Barnum &amp; Richardson Manufacturing Company, instead of to said firm, was done in order to avoid an accounting with the complainant for patent fees or royalties.\u201d\"</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\" pgmap=\"105\">From said findings and evidence the master states the following account under the second direction of the decree, viz: \u201cTotal shoes manufactured for Fraser &amp; Chalmers by Barnum &amp; Bichardson under Fraser\u2019s license, and sold by Fraser &amp; Chalmers, between May 14,1879, and March 1,1881,713,825 pounds; total shoes manufactured for Fraser by Barnum &amp; Bichardson, and sold to Fraser &amp; Chalmers by Fraser, 758,-825 pounds; total shoes manufactured and sold by Fraser &amp; Chalmers under license of Fraser, 199,978 pounds; total shoes manufactured and sold by P.

J. Chalmers, who seems, from his evidence, manner and appearance, to be a shrewd, well-informed and careful business man, both say that the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers was satisfied with a profit of one-half cent per pound, and while the profit on the sales made by Fraser &amp; Chalmers at $4.20 per hundred pounds, where Fraser has been allowed only one-fourth cent royalty, would amount to but forty-five cents per one hundred pounds,\u2014if he were allowed one-half cent royalty,\u2014 still, when all the sales of Fraser &amp; Chalmers in any one year are taken into consideration, their average net profit would be more than one-half cent per pound, after paying to Fraser a royalty of one-half cent per pound.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\" pgmap=\"105\">\u201cThe cost of manufacturing said patent shoes during the period in controversy, as appears from said evidence, is as follows: From May 14, 1879, to October 26, 1879, two and one-half cents per pound; from October 25,1879, to January 21, 1880, three cents per pound; from January 21, 1880, to February 13,1880, three and one-half cents per pound; from February 13, 1880, to June 29, 1880, three and one-quarter cents per pound; from June 29,1880, to July 24,1880, three and one-half cents per pound; from July 24, 1880, to September, 1882, three and one-quarter cents per pound.</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\" pgmap=\"106\">\u201cFrom September, 1882, said shoes were manufactured by the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers in their own foundry, but it does not appear during that period what was the cost of manufacturing said shoes. The prices obtained by the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers in the sale of said shoes are shown, as are also royalties paid Mr. Fraser during that period, and from such cash prices at the different periods embraced in this accounting, and- the prices obtained for shoes from time to time, I have made computations, on which are based the' above conclusions. It also appears from said evidence, that a profit of ten per cent on this character of manufacture and sale of machinery is a good profit, and that the average profit of Fraser &amp; Chalmers, after allowing said Fraser one-half cent royalty on all their sales, would be more than fifteen per cent on their investment. Another thing to be taken into consideration is, that the defendant, Fraser, has all along been a member of the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers, having from one-half to a third interest in said firm; and it is not to be expected that Mr. Fraser would exercise that business sagacity and strictness with his own'firm that he would have taken with strangers.</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\">\u201cAlthough I do not consider that it comes properly under the directions of said decree, at the request of the complainant\u2019s solicitor I have made a computation of what the defendant, Fraser, might and ought to have received, by the exercise of good business prudence and sagacity, as royalty or patent fees upon shoes manufactured by him, as hereinbefore shown, \u25a0as follows : Total number of pounds of shoes from which the \u25a0defendant, Fraser, received royalty after May 14, 1879, as shown by said evidence and exhibits, 1,672,625; amount of royalty on above, at one-half cent per pound, $8363.12; less royalty received by complainant, $175.21; excess of Fraser\u2019s over Gates' royalties, $8187.91.

D. 1882, namely, the sum of $2429.92, for the reason that the proof shows that said defendant did not receive any royalty or .license fee for the same, but made only a direct profit as .manufacturer.</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107\">\u201cThird\u2014Said defendant excepts to so much of said report \u25a0-as finds he could have received a royalty of one-half cent per pound upon all shoes made by the firm of Fraser &amp; Chalmers, under his license, for the reason that the evidence doos not \u25a0support said finding, and also for the reason that said finding is inconclusive, irrelevant, and not called for by the decree herein.</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\" pgmap=\"107(170) 108(47)\">\u201cFourth\u2014Said defendant excepts to all the statements and reports of facts contained in said report, for the reason that they are irrelevant, incomplete, and not warranted by the evidence or called for by the decree, and he asks that the following facts, as shown by the evidence, may be also reported, if any facts are so reported by the master, viz: that the uniform cost of the manufacture of the shoes during the period in controversy was three and three-quarters cents per pound; that in all cases, with one or two possible exceptions, where defendant only received one-fourth of a cent per pound royalty, Fraser &amp; Chalmers only got $4.20 per pound for the shoes; that after deducting said royalty of one-fourth cent, the net manufacturer\u2019s profit to Fraser &amp; Chalmers was j2^- or one-fifth of .a cent, which was at the rate of a trifle less than five per cent; that complainant testified, that under some circumstances twenty per cent was not an unusual manufacturer\u2019s profit. It appears that the shoes licensed to be sold by complainant from May, 1879, to date, realized a manufacturer\u2019s profit to the Gates &amp; Scoville Iron Works Company, of which complainant was chief owner, of one and one-half cents to two cents per pound.</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">\u201cFifth\u2014Said defendant excepts to so much of said report as finds and makes any computation of any amount of royalty received, or that is claimed to have been received by him, above the amount which the evidence shows was received by him, for the reason that the same is not in accordance with the facts, and is uncalled for by the decree, and irrelevant, and if such report means to find that said defendant should so be held for the same, he excepts to said finding for the same reason.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\" pgmap=\"108\">Final decree sustaining the third and fifth exceptions of the defendant to the master\u2019s report, and overruling other exceptions.

Washburn &amp; Moen Manufacturing Co. v. Chicago Galvanized Wire Fence Co. 109 Ill. 71; Vose v. Singer Manufacturing Co. 4 Allen, 226; Dewitt v. Elmira Manufacturing Co. 12 N. Y. (5 Hun,) 303; Curtis\u2019 Law of Patents, (4th ed.) secs. 186-191; Bump\u2019s Law of\" Patents, 141. But the preponderance of evidence here, in our opinion, establishes an agreement, whereby it was mutually agreed between Gates and Fraser, that in considera- \u25a0 tion of the assignment of the invention by Gates to them, jointly, they would each bear one-half the expenses of obtaining the patent, and after the patent should be issued, that-they would mutually account, each to the other, for one-half' of the profits derived from its use. Gates testifies to this-effect, and he is corroborated by the direct testimony of Fargo,. and by the conduct and action of both himself and Fraser. Fraser\u2019s denial is not sufficient to overcome this evidence.</p> <p id=\"b111-5\" pgmap=\"111\">The claim made by Fraser, that Gates was not the inventor, is not sustained by the evidence. The letters patent contradict the claim. Gates\u2019 evidence contradicts it, and he is sustained by the corroborating statements of others. Fraser\u2019s claim to be the inventor consists of a single remark,\u2014which he says he made to Gates, but which Gates denies,\u2014in the nature of a suggestion. It is said in Curtis on Patents, (3d ed.) 121, \u201cthat a person may be the real author of the plan of a complicated machine, or other invention which requires for its perfection the skill, and, to some extent, the inventive faculties, of workmen or engineers, in adapting the best means to the successful application of the principle. \u201d, The principle here was to make a hard iron shoe with a soft iron stem. There is no pretence but that, as to that principle, Gates was the inventor. But difficulty was experienced in making the two metals to mix. Fraser says he suggested, \u201cWhy not pour in the hard iron, and then pour in the soft iron, and fill up the place, \u201d and that ultimately this was done by Gates, and proved successful. The remark, when made, was not based upon actual knowledge, and was evidently intended as suggestive, merely, and until Gates, by repeated experiments, demonstrated that it was practical, Fraser did not know whether it was of value or not. But, at best, it related merely to the mechanical detail by which the principle previously conceived was to be made available. This will be illustrated by reference to Bloxam v. Elsee, 1 Carr. &amp; Payne, 567, and O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 Howard, 62. Fraser acquiesced in this claim of Gates, permitted him to apply for a patent, as inventor, and accepted letters patent to Gates and himself, jointly, reciting that Gates was inventor.</p> <p id=\"b111-6\" pgmap=\"111(30) 112(113)\">Counsel contend it is absurd, if Gates were inventor, that he should assign one-half interest to Fraser. There is nothing, to our apprehension, absurd, or even unusual, in what Gates says was the arrangement between them. They were brothers-in-law, mutually interested in manufacturing mining machinery, etc., and each somewhat given to experimenting in inventions in the machinery they were manufacturing. Each was to have one-half interest in the inventions of the other. Any advantage which Fraser derived from this patent' might therefore be fully offset by advantages which Gates would derive from other inventions of Fraser. But the sharing in the expense of obtaining the patent, and the advantage of having a manufacturer to aid in introducing the patent to the public, under favorable circumstances might, alone, very reasonably afford a consideration for the assignment of one-half of the patent.</p> <p id=\"b112-14\" pgmap=\"112\">But, conceding an agreement proved, two objections are urged against its enforcement in this action: First, that it was not in writing, and is therefore insusceptible of being enforced, by reason of the Statute of Frauds; and second, that, at most, it was but an agreement of co-partnership, which terminated upon Gates becoming bankrupt.</p> <p id=\"b112-20\" pgmap=\"112\">We think the case is not affected by the Statute of Frauds, in two views authorized by the evidence: First, the contract, on one side, has been fully executed. The letters patent were issued in pursuance of the agreement, and the obligation to account for the profits results from the use of those letters, by virtue of the agreement, and ceases with the use. (White v. Murtland, 71 Ill. 251; Browne on Statute of Frauds, sec. 117.) Second, although the agreement was not expected to be performed within a year, yet, by reason of peculiar circumstances, it might have been performed within the year. Browne on Statute of Frauds, secs. 275, 276, et seq.</p> <p id=\"b112-31\" pgmap=\"112(56) 113(117)\">It is quite plain, the agreement was not an agreement of co-partnership, because neither has an interest in the use of the patent by the other. They are simply tenants in common, with the right to require each other to account for one-half the profits derived by them severally from the use of the patent. The agreement to account and pay over is a continuing consideration of the grant of the letters patent. Chitty on Contracts, (11th Am. ed.) 73. . Being continuing, it was unaffected by the bankruptcy of Gates,\u2014Bump on Bankruptcy, (10th ed.) 493,\u2014and the right to enforce it hence passed, upon the assignment in bankruptcy, to the assignee, and by the assignee\u2019s deed back to Gates. Fraser\u2019s relations to the letters patent have remained all the time unaffected, and his obligations in respect thereof must, consequently, also remain unaffected. The reasoning of the Appellate Court, in Gates v. Fraser, 9 Bradw. 631, meets with our concurrence, so far as relates to this part of the ease.</p> <p id=\"b113-4\" pgmap=\"113\">The rulings of the circuit court upon the exceptions to the master\u2019s report we think correct, and we deem it unnecessary to review the evidence bearing upon the subject.</p> <p id=\"b113-5\" pgmap=\"113\">We find no sufficient ground in the record to warrant us in disturbing the decree below. It is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b113-6\" pgmap=\"113\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
