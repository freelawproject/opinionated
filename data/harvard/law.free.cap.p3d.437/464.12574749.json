In particular, he contends that the court failed to perform the income imputation test outlined in Utah Code section 78B-12-203(7)(b).

For purposes of calculating child support, the district court imputed $55,000 of annual income to Christopher. It arrived at this figure by relying on a vocational expert's opinion and the domestic relations commissioner's findings regarding income. In doing so, the court stated that \"[t]he actual income of [Christopher] is impossible to determine\" due to Christopher's \"dishonesty to this Court, to his unaccountable income, [and to] his failure and refusal to obtain traditional employment.\" Indeed, the court noted that \"much of the income that [Christopher] derives through his purchase and sale of [equipment] is unaccountable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Contrary to Christopher's assertions, the court clearly stated in its oral and written findings that it based its imputation in part on the vocational expert's opinion, which addressed the section 78B-12-203(7)(b) factors.

Tax Exemptions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Christopher next argues that the court erred in awarding Julie the annual tax exemptions for both of their children through the age of majority. We generally review a district court's decision to award tax exemptions for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362967\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/869/963/#p967\">\n    869 P.2d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 967 (Utah Ct. App. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 Tax exemption awards are governed by Utah Code section 78B-12-217, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) No presumption exists as to which parent should be awarded the right to claim a child or children as exemptions for federal and state income tax purposes. Unless the parties otherwise stipulate in writing, the court ... shall award in any final order the exemption on a case-by-case basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) In awarding the exemption, the court ... shall consider: (a) as the primary factor, the relative contribution of each parent to the cost of raising the child; and (b) among other factors, the relative tax benefit to each parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) Notwithstanding Subsection (2), the court ... may not award any exemption to the noncustodial parent if that parent is not current in his child support obligation, in which case the court ... may award an exemption to the custodial parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (4) An exemption may not be awarded to a parent unless the award will result in a tax benefit to that parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the court awarded Julie the annual tax exemptions for both children for two reasons. First, it determined that Julie bore \"the bulk of the expenses of the children.\" Second, it determined that, given that Julie earned more than twice Christopher's income at the time of trial, the tax advantages would work in both parties' favor if Julie claimed the exemptions because of their respective tax rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b614 Christopher argues that the court erred because the statute should be interpreted to mean that exemptions should be awarded \"exclusively to a party [only] when the other party gives very little or nothing to the custodial parent in the way of child support or other financial benefits,\" which he contends are not the circumstances in this case. On this basis, he claims that the annual exemptions should have been split and that he was entitled to one of the two exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615 Christopher's argument requires us to construe the tax exemption statute. The \"primary objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intent of the legislature,\" and \"the best evidence of the legislature's intent is the plain language of the statute itself.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bagley v. Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152514\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/1000/\">\n    2016 UT 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152514\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/1000/\">\n    387 P.3d 1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations simplified). We therefore \"look first to the plain language of the statute,\" presuming that \"the legislature used each word advisedly,\" and \"when we can ascertain the intent of the legislature from the statutory terms alone, no other interpretive tools are needed, and our task of statutory construction is typically at an end.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152514\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/1000/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotations simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 The plain language of section 78B-12-217 does not support Christopher's proposed interpretation or application. Rather than dictate circumstances through which a parent may gain entitlement to an exemption, section 78B-12-217 instructs that \"[n]o presumption\" governs the award of tax exemptions and that, instead, they must be awarded \"on a case-by-case basis.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-12-217(1) (LexisNexis 2012). In this regard, courts are instructed to consider relevant factors, including two in particular: \"as the primary factor, the relative contribution of each parent to the cost of raising the child\"; and, next, \"the relative tax benefit to each parent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152514\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/1000/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-12-217(2). But the statute does not instruct the court to treat the factors as vesting requirements toward a parent's entitlement to an exemption-that,\n   for example, a parent becomes entitled to an exemption if he or she pays child support and may enjoy some tax benefit. Indeed, while the statute provides that a noncustodial parent may not be awarded an exemption if he or she is not current as to any child support obligation or will not enjoy a tax benefit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152514\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/1000/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-12-217(3) - (4), the statute does not provide for the inverse-that when a noncustodial parent\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   current on his or her child support obligation or may enjoy a tax benefit, he or she is always entitled to an award of a tax exemption. Thus, the plain language of the statute leaves the awarding of exemptions squarely in the sound discretion of the district court and its assessment of the unique circumstances of each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 In this case, the district court appropriately followed the statute in rendering its decision. As required, it specifically considered each party's relative contributions to the cost of raising their children and the relative tax benefits to each. Because it determined that Julie bears \"the bulk of the expenses of the children\" and that the tax advantages to both parents are more favorable if Julie claimed both children on her taxes, it awarded both exemptions to Julie. We can discern no abuse of discretion in its decision, under these circumstances, to award them both to Julie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 Still, Christopher disagrees with the court's assessment of the evidence. He asserts that the court failed to consider the monetary support he provides to raise the children and that he would receive a \"very good tax benefit if allowed to take an exemption.\" He argues that both his financial contributions and the tax benefit he could receive \"should have been sufficient to be awarded one of the child tax exemptions.\" But Christopher has not pointed to anything in the record suggesting that the court failed to consider his monetary support in rendering its decision.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shuman v.

Retirement Account\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 Christopher argues that the court exceeded its discretion in setting the terms of Julie's retirement account division. The court awarded Christopher half of Julie's retirement account and provided that Julie would have the \"sole discretion\" to decide \"whether or not that amount comes from her retirement account or whether it comes from the other amounts awarded in this ruling.\" Christopher contends that it was an abuse of discretion to permit Julie the \"sole discretion\" to decide from which funds to pay Christopher his portion of her retirement account. He claims that, because the parties \"have been so acrimonious throughout this divorce process, giving [Julie] discretion as to how or when [Christopher] receives his portion of the retirement is tantamount to his never receiving it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b624 Christopher relies on the contentious nature of the divorce to claim error in the court's decision, but he has provided no reasoned analysis to suggest that it is an abuse of discretion to allow one of the parties in an acrimonious divorce the discretion to determine the source of funds to pay the other party his or her half of a retirement account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

For example, Christopher does not explain why the acrimonious nature of the divorce necessarily renders his retirement account award illusory, nor does he cite any evidence in the record suggesting that Julie has exercised her discretion, or intends to exercise her discretion, in a manner that will result in him not receiving his awarded portion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6911914\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/335/378/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, we conclude that Christopher has not demonstrated that no reasonable person would afford Julie the discretion to determine from which funds she will pay Christopher his share of her retirement account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   2. The Parties' Real Properties\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b625 Christopher argues that the district court erred by not ordering that all of the parties' four properties-particularly, the marital home-be sold.

As to the marital home, the court determined that Julie could stay in the marital home with the children and that Christopher would be entitled to one-half of the equity in the home, less amounts of liens, encumbrances, and the\n   costs of repairs and improvements. For Christopher, Julie was entitled to half of the equity in the property he resided in, subject to the same deductions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b627 Although Christopher disagrees with the court's decision to allow Julie to stay in the marital home with the children, Christopher has not shown that \"no reasonable person\" would have awarded Julie the marital home and permitted her to live in it with the children rather than sell it.\n   <em>\n    Gerwe v.

While the district court perhaps\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have ordered all of the properties sold, including the marital home, Christopher has not demonstrated that it was an abuse of the court's discretion not to do so under the circumstances.

The court also generally invited the parties to submit a motion for reconsideration on issues they felt were incorrect, so long as they did so within fourteen days of the court's ruling. Otherwise, there would be \"no award or offset for personal property, other than [what was] designated\" in the court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b630 Christopher never filed a request for his unique personal property after the court's order was entered. Instead, Christopher's assertion of error on appeal relies on only his \"belie[f]\" that Julie \"has almost all of the personal property.\" But assertions of error based on speculation or individual belief are not sufficient to overcome the presumption that the court's personal property award was proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andersen v.

That rejection stands.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In this regard, Christopher concedes on appeal that there is \"much still to be determined between the parties as to what is owed each party\" regarding the property division, given that the parties are still in the process of selling their several homes, which seems to support the court's decision to vest Julie with this discretion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Christopher also argues that the court erred in relying on Julie's appraisal for the marital home, which he claims undervalued it. However, Christopher concedes that the court's reliance on Julie's appraisal was apparently done in a June 2017 proceeding, nearly one year after the court entered its final decree. Christopher filed his notice of appeal before that time, and he has not shown where this issue was preserved or that it falls within the scope of our jurisdiction. We therefore do not consider whether the court's decision to rely on Julie's appraisal to value the marital home was proper.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    At trial, Christopher offered a list of the marital personal property. While the list he offered did not include a value of the marital personal property, he contended that, except for jewelry and collector cards, the value of the marital personal property was around $10,000.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Christopher's plea for equality suggests that the court treated income Julie earned during the marriage as her separate property. But Christopher identifies nothing in the record to validate that suggestion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Christopher claims that the ruling is vague regarding whether the district court awarded Julie half of the inventory's value because it designated the inventory as marital property or because it did so to sanction Christopher for his dishonesty. We disagree. There is no mention of sanctions in the court's findings; rather, they indicate that the court found incredible Christopher's contention that this inventory was not part of the marital estate because it had been sold. We therefore construe the court's findings regarding Christopher's dishonesty as on-the-record credibility determinations related to its assessment of whether the equipment was part of the marital estate, rather than findings to support imposing a sanction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Although Christopher filed an objection to Julie's proposed decree on June 13, 2016, he did not include the allegedly pending issues as a basis for an objection.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Christopher includes his challenge to the court's ruling regarding the broken windows in the section of his brief dedicated to the issues we resolve in Part I. But Christopher's challenge is primarily directed toward the adequacy of the court's findings-an issue he raised in his post-trial motion.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re K.F.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166400\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/201/985/\">\n     2009 UT 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 61-63,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166400\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/201/985/\">\n     201 P.3d 985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (requiring appellants to \"object to the adequacy of the detail of the trial court's findings before appeal\" and to present the issue to the trial court \"in such a way that the trial court has an opportunity to rule on that issue\" (quotation simplified) ). For the reasons stated above, we do not have jurisdiction to consider this challenge. To the extent Christopher contends there was insufficient evidence to hold him responsible for the cost to repair two windows, we would have jurisdiction over that challenge, but we reject his argument. Christopher testified that he broke a large picture window when he slipped off a toolbox while trying to gain access to the house. Julie testified that the basement window underneath the picture window was broken at the same time. The parties' testimony, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, provided sufficient evidence to support the district court's ruling.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Choate v.
