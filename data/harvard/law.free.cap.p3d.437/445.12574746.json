Mother argues that the district court erred when it awarded Father sole physical custody of the parties' minor child (Child), asserting the modified decree met the statutory requirements for joint physical custody. Mother further argues the court erred when it calculated Mother's child support obligation on the award of sole physical custody to Father, asserting it should have used a joint physical custody worksheet. Father cross-appeals, asserting the district court erred when it denied his requested relief for parent-time modification. We affirm with respect to the sole physical custody designation and the child support award. But we reverse and remand for the district court to make additional findings with respect to the parent-time award and, after doing so, to adjust its order as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Father and Mother divorced in 2011. The parties were awarded joint legal custody of Child, but Father was awarded sole physical custody subject to Mother's liberal parent-time. Under the parent-time arrangement, Child stayed overnight with Mother for more than thirty percent of the year. Because Mother was unemployed, her child support obligation was calculated based on an imputed minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Four years later, Father filed a petition to modify the divorce decree, asserting that a substantial and material change of circumstances supported a reduction in Mother's parent-time and an increase of Mother's child support obligation. As to parent-time, Father claimed Mother had abused Child. The abuse allegation was based primarily on a supported finding of child abuse by the Utah Division of Child and Family Services (the DCFS Finding). With regard to the child support issue, Father claimed Mother had returned to work and asked for a modification based on her new income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Mother answered the petition, denying the abuse allegation. Mother also filed a counter-petition to modify, asking for an award of joint physical custody that designated\n   her as primary custodian. Mother's counter-petition alleged Father did not communicate with her about Child, Father \"failed to work with [Child]\" regarding Child's learning difficulties, and that she was \"concerned about [Child's] nutrition and hygiene while in [Father's] custody.\" Mother acknowledged her new employment and asked that child support be modified \"based on the parties' current income and the parent-time ordered, in compliance with [Utah's] child support guidelines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Based on the DCFS Finding, the district court entered a temporary order, greatly reducing Mother's parent-time, terminating her overnight parent-time, and requiring supervision during all visits. The district court also appointed a private guardian ad litem (the GAL) to represent Child's best interest. The GAL was to make recommendations regarding the alleged abuse and whether Mother's parent-time should be supervised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The GAL interviewed Child, who reported \"substantial communication issues\" with Mother, as well as physical and emotional abuse. For example, Mother called Child \"fat\" and \"stupid,\" causing Child \"distress and problems with her self-image.\" Mother also \"required\" Child to call her every day, and if Child missed a call, Mother became angry with her. In addition, Child described witnessing episodes of violence by Mother directed toward one of Mother's other children and Child's step-father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Child also detailed the incident that gave rise to the DCFS Finding. According to Child, Mother was upset because Child had not called her the previous night. Mother asked Child \"what goes on in her head,\" while forcefully and repeatedly jabbing and poking Child's face, then hit Child's leg with a fist. Child ultimately told the GAL she was \"terrified of [Mother]\" and would fear for her safety sleeping at Mother's house if the overnights resumed. Child feared Mother would \"speak to her inappropriately, hit her, or lash out at her in other ways.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The GAL next interviewed Mother and was \"openly shocked\" at the way Mother communicated about Child. The GAL noted it was easy to understand why Child thought Mother called her \"fat\" or \"dumb,\" \"despite different verbiage or use of words.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The GAL also interviewed Child's personal therapist. The personal therapist began treating Child for anxiety at school, but the treatment evolved to include Child's relationship with Mother and a potential diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from the incident that gave rise to the DCFS Finding. The personal therapist concluded that Mother's damaging comments and the domestic violence toward Child had created Child's anxiety and caused her relationship with Mother to become \"toxic.\" Child constantly worried about their interactions because at \"any moment [Mother] could go off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Based on the investigation, the GAL recommended the court adopt a provisional \"step-up\" parenting plan. That plan eventually eliminated supervision during Mother's visits, and allowed Mother a path to regain the parent-time awarded in the original divorce decree. The plan gradually increased Mother's visits each week, with a return to parent-time as established in the original decree after a successful six-week period. The GAL recommended continued therapy for Mother and Child as well as feedback from the therapists as the process moved forward. Also, the plan made returning to the original parent-time schedule contingent on Mother refraining from further abusive behavior. If Mother engaged in additional incidents of violence or abuse directed at Child, the step-up plan would cease immediately and Mother's parent-time would return to what it was under the temporary order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The district court also received evidence at trial. Father detailed his understanding of the incident giving rise to the DCFS Finding and testified to Mother's other violent outbursts. Father also testified that Child smoked marijuana during a supervised visit at Mother's house. Ultimately, Father asked the court to adopt an extended step-up plan that would allow Mother overnight parent-time only after six months and cap Mother's potential parent-time at the statutory minimum under Utah Code section 30-3-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Mother also testified, denying Child's version of the incident giving rise to the DCFS Finding. Mother admitted \"tapping\" Child on the head, but she disputed the number of taps, and denied hitting Child's leg. In addition, Mother denied that Child smoked marijuana at Mother's house. Mother ultimately asked the court to award joint physical custody, identifying her as primary custodian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 The court also considered \"affidavit-style answers\" to the parties' questions submitted by the Child's personal therapist and Mother and Child's reunification therapist. The personal therapist reported Child's symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and recommended continued personal and reunification therapy to increase Child's \"feelings of safety in the presence of [M]other.\" The personal therapist said she felt a step-up plan was appropriate, but she believed Child and Mother needed more than six weeks for reunification therapy before the plan was set in place. The personal therapist also recommended a \"safety plan\" to assist Child in the eventual transition back to increased, overnight parent-time with Mother, and to reduce the risk of physical violence that Child felt was \"high as changes in [parent-time] [were] being addressed.\" That safety plan included (1) allowing Child to have her phone with her at all times when she is with Mother, (2) allowing Child to state \"I feel unsafe right now\" and go to a secluded area for at least half an hour of alone time, and (3) requiring a lock on Child's bedroom door at Mother's house that Child could lock before going to sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 The reunification therapist explained, \"[Child] and [Mother] have been able to do some repair in their relationship, but it is both mine and [Child's] opinion that the work isn't completed and family therapy should continue.\" The reunification therapist said Child was still working to develop \"some power in the relationship between her and [Mother]\" and that \"it is going to likely require a combination of more counseling (both individual and family) and getting older and more mature.\" The reunification therapist said she believed the six-week step-up plan was \"appropriate because it gives [Child] a chance to ... get used [to] the changes gradually.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 After considering the evidence, the district court entered an order supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law. First, the district court found Mother's abuse of Child constituted a significant and material change in circumstances warranting modification of parent-time. The findings stated that the abuse was \"well documented,\" citing the DCFS Finding, Child's confirmation of that finding, and Father's testimony regarding the incident. The district court also found Mother had made other \"violent outbursts in the presence of or directed at\" Child, and that Child used marijuana at Mother's house during a supervised visit. The court concluded Child was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and her relationship with Mother had become strained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 Despite the findings of abuse, the district court found the relationship between Mother and Child had improved through temporary parent-time restrictions and counseling. As such, the district court concluded it remained in Child's best interest that the original custody order remain in place-that Father retain sole physical custody and Mother have parent-time as set forth in the original decree-subject to a \"step-up\" plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 The district court granted, in part, Father's petition to modify. First, it ordered the immediate adoption of the six-week step-up plan (without supervision), and the \"safety plan,\" as recommended by Child's personal therapist. To support that modification, the court relied on the declarations of both the personal therapist and the reunification therapist \"that a step-up and reunification plan [were] in the best interest of [Child].\" Additionally, the district court ordered that Child continue personal therapy, and that Mother and Child continue reunification therapy until the reunification therapist determined, \"with input from [Child],\" it was no longer necessary. The court also conditioned the return to the original parent-time arrangement, noting that if Mother engaged in additional episodes or incidents of violence or physical abuse against Child, the step-up plan would cease immediately and supervised visits would be\n   restored in accordance with the terms of the temporary orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 The court also modified the parties' child support obligations to an amount consistent with Mother's new income, noting that \"[b]oth parties acknowledged that there was a material change in circumstances related to [Mother's] employment status and this was not a contested issue in this case.\" It made the calculation based on the sole physical custody calculation in Utah Code section 78B-12-205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 Mother appeals and Father cross-appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 Mother contends the district court erred in two respects. She argues it should not have granted sole physical custody to Father, asserting the modified order satisfies Utah's statutory definition of joint physical custody. Next, Mother contends the court erred by not using a joint physical custody child support worksheet to calculate her obligation. \"A [district] court's interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Spall-Goldsmith v.

App. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 Here, the district court awarded Father sole physical custody in the original divorce decree. In Mother's counter-petition, she asked the district court to change that designation to joint physical custody and award her primary custody. But the court denied Mother's request, finding that Mother had not met her burden. Although the court noted \"that [Father] has not shared all important information with [Mother] in a timely\n   manner,\" and that \"both parties testified that [Child] struggles with schooling,\" the court found there was insufficient \"credible evidence that changing parent-time or custody as requested by [Mother] would resolve these struggles-particularly given the abuse findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Mother's request to modify the custody designation. Father's actions, and the lack of communication between Mother and Father, do not \"indicate that the custodial circumstances of [Child] or the parenting capabilities of [Father]\" have been affected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becker v.

Thus, the court acted within its discretion in denying Mother's counter-petition to modify custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 Further, the parent-time modifications the court made did not require an alteration of the physical custody designation. The district court granted, in part, Father's petition to modify parent-time. First, it implemented the temporary order, greatly limiting Mother's parent-time. Next, the court ordered the step-up plan, allowing Mother to regain the parent-time she was awarded in the original divorce decree so long as she satisfied the plan's conditions. Those modifications, however, did not necessarily affect the award of custody as designated in the original divorce decree. The court specifically found the custody arrangement as entered in the original decree remained in Child's best interest and would remain in place. Because Mother did not establish a change in circumstances warranting reconsideration of the issue, the original order remained unchanged regarding Father's sole physical custody designation and the court was not required to modify the physical custody designation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II. Child Support\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b628 Mother next argues the district court failed to comply with Utah's statutory child support guidelines when it used a sole physical custody worksheet to calculate her child support obligation. We disagree. Because the step-up parenting plan allowed Mother the time required for joint physical custody only after six weeks, contingent on Mother's actions, the modified parent-time order did not meet the requirements for a joint physical custody child support calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 Under the Utah Child Support Act, child support obligations are generally calculated using a worksheet in cases of joint physical custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spall-Goldsmith v.

Moreover, for purposes of calculating child support, the designation of \"joint physical custody\" or \"sole physical custody\" is not as important as whether the custody arrangement \"exceed[s] the [statutory] threshold for joint physical custody.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Udy v.

In Utah, a custody plan meets the requirements for joint physical custody when \"the child stays with each parent overnight for more than 30% of the year, and both parents contribute to the expenses of the child in addition to paying child support.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-12-102(15) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018).

But under the modified decree, Mother could not achieve such parent-time until after successfully completing the six-week step-up plan. Further, Mother's increased parent-time was conditioned on her refraining from engaging in further abusive behavior toward Child. Thus, at the time the court entered the order, Mother was not entitled to overnight parent-time with Child for more than thirty percent of the year.

The only findings to support a return to Mother's original parent-time after completion of the six-week step-up plan were that the relationship between Mother and Child had \"improved through counseling and due to the restrictions that [had] been in place since the temporary orders were entered,\" and that the court \"found credible\" the therapists' opinions \"that a step-up and reunification plan are in the best interest of [Child].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b639 As to the therapists' opinions, the district court's finding was that the therapists supported \"a\" step-up plan, not \"the\" step-up plan. As Father notes, Child's personal therapist recommended a longer period for reunification and a \"step-down\" schedule, basing that recommendation on the lack of progress Child felt had taken place in therapy. The court did not explain why it deemed the reunification therapist's recommendation of a six-week step-up plan was more appropriate than the the personal therapist's recommendation regarding a longer period of time for further reunification therapy before Mother regained her parent-time. The court may have reached that conclusion because it found the reunification therapist's testimony more credible than Child's personal therapist's testimony. But the court \"did not provide any such explanation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b640 Further, compelling evidence in the record supports a contrary conclusion regarding Mother and Child's relationship. Child stated she was \" 'afraid' of [Mother], and [did] not feel [Mother] [had] the capacity to change or learn anything from therapy.\" Through the GAL, Child told the district court she would be \"in fear for her safety\" if she slept at Mother's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b641 Child's personal therapist reported that the relationship between Mother and Child had not improved. At the time of the personal therapist's recommendation, Mother and Child had completed only two months of reunification therapy and attended only eight sessions. Indeed, the record indicates that both therapists and the GAL expressed concerns about the uncertain results of the reunification therapy. Those concerns are highlighted by several statements, including \"there hasn't been progress,\" \"the work isn't complete,\" and \"[I] am concerned by the\n   actions of [Mother] and the effect of her actions on [Child].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b642 \"A [district] court's failure to provide adequate findings is reversible error when the facts are not clear from the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartlett v.
