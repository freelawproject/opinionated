Did the district court err in finding that counsel for Mr. Farrow was not ineffective and denying his Rule 21 motion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b63] On the evening of December 20, 2014, Mr. Farrow and the woman he was living with, Whitney Lowham, went to a bar in Afton, Wyoming to celebrate a friend's birthday. After having a couple of drinks with friends, Ms. Lowham left the bar without Mr. Farrow and made her way to a party at Blake Jensen's apartment. Once at the apartment, the intoxicated Ms. Lowham kept falling asleep. Tyler Lindsey took her to Mr. Jensen's bedroom so that she could sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b64] While still at the bar, Mr. Farrow confided in an acquaintance, Andy Johnson, that he was concerned that Ms. Lowham was with another man and worried that things would not work out between them. Mr. Farrow and Mr. Johnson stayed at the bar and talked until 2:00 a.m., then spent an additional twenty to thirty minutes talking in the parking lot. The pair then walked to Mr. Johnson's house where they continued to talk for an additional hour and a half. Mr. Johnson felt that Farrow was in a \"pretty good spot emotionally\" and that \"everything kind of settled down\" by that time, and the two decided to go look for Ms. Lowham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] Mr. Johnson drove them to Mr. Farrow's apartment. Mr. Farrow went in to look for Ms. Lowham, but she was not there. Mr. Farrow returned to Mr. Johnson's truck, at which time he removed a pistol from the back of his pants and set it on his lap. The two then went to Mr. Jensen's apartment to look for Ms. Lowham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] Before going to the apartment, Mr. Farrow tucked the pistol into the back of his pants. He and Mr. Johnson entered the apartment, where Farrow asked about Ms.\n   Lowham. He was told that Mr. Lindsey had taken Ms. Lowham back to one of the bedrooms, where she was asleep. Tony Hansen, who had been on the couch, began talking to Farrow. During the conversation, Mr. Farrow made a comment that Mr. Hansen perceived as derogatory towards Mr. Lindsey. Mr. Hansen began \"lipping off,\" calling Farrow names and suggesting that the two go outside to fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] Mr. Farrow went back to the bedroom to check on Ms. Lowham. He spent approximately ten minutes with her before he walked back into the living room and sought help to get her out of the apartment and home. Mr. Hansen resumed taunting Mr. Farrow, calling him more names and continuing to insist that they should go outside and fight. Another individual suggested that the two should play beer pong to settle their dispute, and when Mr. Farrow agreed, Mr. Hansen responded, \"Why, cuz you're a bitch?\" In response, Mr. Farrow pulled out his pistol and either shoved it in Mr. Hansen's face or hit him across the face with it. Witnesses disagree over whether Mr. Hansen froze or threw a punch at Mr. Farrow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] Mr. Farrow then turned his back to Mr. Hansen, placed the pistol up under his arm, and fired directly into Mr. Hansen's chest. Melanie Pumphrey attempted to separate the pair, and as a result was shot in the hip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] After being shot the first time, Mr. Hansen fell on his back. Mr. Farrow positioned himself \"straight over the top\" of Mr. Hansen, steadied both hands on the pistol, and fired the remaining rounds into his body. Mr. Hansen sustained a total of seven gunshot wounds. Mr. Farrow fled the apartment and waited outside for law enforcement to arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b610] Mr. Farrow testified to a different version of events. He told the jury that he did not want to leave without Ms. Lowham, and so he decided to ask Mr. Johnson to help him carry her out of the apartment. As soon as he returned to the living room after checking on Ms. Lowham, Mr. Hansen again suggested that they go outside to fight. Mr. Farrow turned his back to Mr. Hansen, and Mr. Hansen struck him in the back \"really hard.\" Mr. Farrow testified that, in pain and in fear, he pulled out the pistol and stuck it in Mr. Hansen's face, though he was not planning to shoot him. Mr. Farrow slumped over, was getting hit repeatedly, and two other individuals had their hands on the pistol when his vision started to go black and the pistol fired. Mr. Farrow regained control of the pistol, saw Mr. Hansen standing, and shot him again several times. Mr. Hansen then fell back, and Mr. Farrow ran from the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b611] Mr. Farrow was charged with first-degree murder for the shooting death of Mr. Hansen and with aggravated assault and battery for the injury to Ms. Pumphrey. The jury acquitted him of first-degree murder, but found him guilty of the lesser included offense of second-degree murder. It also acquitted him of the aggravated assault and battery charge. The district court sentenced Mr. Farrow to serve thirty-five to sixty-five years imprisonment. Mr. Farrow appealed his conviction and sentence. He also filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to W.R.A.P. 21, asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel. After holding an evidentiary hearing on the motion, the district court denied it. Mr. Farrow appealed that decision as well, and we consolidated his two appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b612] Mr. Farrow asserts that the district court committed five reversible errors in instructing the jury. The district court \"has extensive discretion in tailoring jury instructions, so long as they correctly state the law and fairly and adequately cover the issues presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Merit Energy Co., LLC v. Horr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822967\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/366/489/\">\n    2016 WY 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822967\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/366/489/\">\n    366 P.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (Wyo. 2016). \"Accordingly, our review of a district court's decision to give or refuse a particular jury instruction is for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . When there is no objection to a jury instruction, however, we must review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    Schmuck v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346338\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/286/\">\n    2017 WY 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346338\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/286/\">\n    406 P.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (Wyo. 2017). We apply the appropriate standard of review to each of Mr. Farrow's claims. We begin with his three claims of improper instructions relating\n   to the issue of self-defense, then turn to his remaining two claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Right to Arm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Farrow's first claim is that the district court improperly refused to give his proposed instruction explaining his right to arm himself. Because the question was presented to the district court, we review for abuse of discretion. Mr. Farrow proposed a jury instruction based on Wyoming Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 8.05, which reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   One who has reasonable grounds to believe that another will attack him, and that the anticipated attack will be of such a character as to endanger his life or limb, or to cause him serious bodily harm, has a right to arm himself for the purpose of resisting such attack.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   If the defendant armed himself in reasonable anticipation of such an attack, that fact alone does not make the defendant the aggressor or deprive the defendant of the right of self-defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court declined to give this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b614] On appeal, Mr. Farrow asserts that long-standing precedent supports his claim that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to give this jury instruction. He relies on several cases, including\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8512821\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/80/12/\">\n    80 Wyo. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10489050,8512821\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/336/794/\">\n    336 P.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959), for the proposition that, when the evidence conflicts as to who the initial aggressor was, the jury should be instructed \"as to [the] accused's right to arm himself in anticipation of danger, and, where such an instruction is warranted by the evidence, a refusal to give it constitutes error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10489050,8512821\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/336/794/\">\n    336 P.2d at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Baier v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347261\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/891/754/\">\n    891 P.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 1995), we quoted with approval from 41 C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Homicide\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 350c, which said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Where the court restricts the issue of self-defense by submitting the issue of provoking the difficulty, it should also instruct the jury as to accused's right to arm himself in anticipation of danger. Such an instruction is not required where the court instructs as to self-defense without any limitation as to provoking the difficulty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Baier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10347261\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/891/754/\">\n    891 P.2d at 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Farrow contends that the identity of the first aggressor was not merely at issue in his case, but \"likely ... one of the most crucial issues for the jury to decide.\" The record supports this contention, with evidence including testimony from Mr. Johnson that \"Mr. Hansen was definitely the one, you know, kind of - kind of initiating it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b615] However, the prosecution argued to the district court that this instruction was inappropriate because Mr. Farrow did not testify that he armed himself in anticipation of an attack. His testimony, to the contrary, was that he picked up the firearm \"just out of habit,\" and that it was his habit to carry the pistol with him. The district court agreed with the prosecution, and it declined to give the proposed jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b616] In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , we quoted 41 C.J.S.\n   <em>\n    Homicide\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 378 c (4) to the effect that an instruction on the right of the defendant to arm himself in anticipation of attack\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   is neither necessary nor proper where such an issue is not raised by the evidence in the case, as where the evidence shows that, although accused was carrying a weapon at the time, he was doing so merely as was his usual custom, and not in anticipation of danger from deceased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8512821\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wyo/80/12/\">\n    80 Wyo. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10489050,8512821\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/336/794/\">\n    336 P.2d at 800-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b617] The record includes some evidence that Mr. Farrow had anticipated an attack. For example, Mr. Johnson testified that when he asked about the pistol, Mr. Farrow said he \"needed it in case he was attacked.\" This evidence conflicts with Mr. Farrow's own testimony that he carried the pistol as a matter of habit. In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we view the record \"in the light most favorable to that decision and to the prevailing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Nicodemus v. Lampert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907903\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/336/671/\">\n    2014 WY 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907903\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/336/671/\">\n    336 P.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674 (Wyo. 2014). The district court gave greater credit to Mr. Farrow's testimony that he carried the pistol as a matter of habit and discounted evidence to the contrary. Viewing the evidence in a light favorable to that decision, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to instruct the jury on Mr. Farrow's claimed\n   right to arm himself in anticipation of an attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Determination of Aggressor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b618] Mr. Farrow's second claim of error on the issue of self-defense involves the instruction informing the jury that it must determine whether Mr. Farrow or Mr. Hansen was the aggressor. Instruction No. 22 read in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In considering the claim of self-defense in this case, you must first determine whether the defendant was the aggressor in this case or whether Mr. Hans[e]n was the aggressor in this case. Some sort of physical aggression or a threat of imminent use of deadly force is required before a person will be considered an aggressor. Verbal provocation without more is generally insufficient to justify an initial aggressor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The jury was further instructed that if it found that Mr. Farrow was the initial aggressor, he was \"justified in using deadly force to repel the danger only if he retreated as far as he safely could do before using deadly force.\" In the alternative, the jury was informed that if it found that Mr. Hansen was the initial aggressor, then Mr. Farrow could \"use deadly force only if necessary, and must consider reasonable alternatives under the circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b619] Mr. Farrow contends that the disputed jury instruction improperly required the jury to choose whether Mr. Farrow or Mr. Hansen was the aggressor. In other words, he claims that it was improper to force the jury to conclude that if Mr. Hansen was not the aggressor, then Mr. Farrow had to be. He asserts that the law requires the jury to decide only if the defendant was or was not the aggressor, but that it does not require the jury to decide whether the victim was the aggressor. \"The victim is not on trial,\" Mr. Farrow maintains, \"and a defendant is not required to vilify the victim at trial in order to establish that the defendant was not the aggressor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b620] Mr. Farrow further asserts that because the instruction indicated that either Mr. Farrow or Mr. Hansen had to be the aggressor, the jury was not allowed to consider other possibilities. He posits that both could have been aggressors, or that neither one might have been. Mr. Farrow contends that the jury was misled about the law of self-defense because it was forced to make an artificial choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b621] As a preliminary matter, we must resolve the parties' disagreement over the standard of review. Mr. Farrow asserts that he objected to this instruction at trial, which would cause us to review for abuse of discretion. The State counters that we should review for plain error because Mr. Farrow's objection at trial was different from his issue on appeal. The record reflects that Mr. Farrow made this objection at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   We do object to this, your Honor. I think this is adequately covered in other instructions. Particularly, I'm concerned with the language .... The verbal provocation without more is generally insufficient to justify an initial aggressor. I'm not quite sure exactly what that means but I think it's confusing and unduly emphasizes one aspect of the evidence over the others. We would object to giving this one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b622] We agree with the State that Mr. Farrow's issue on appeal is different from the objection made at trial. \"Where the objection was not originally made on the ground now urged, the argument is without force. ... The objector should lay his finger on the particular point intended to be raised so that the trial court will have notice and an opportunity to cure the alleged error.\"\n   <em>\n    Buszkiewic v.

The law requires a person to retreat rather than to take the life of an adversary if\n   there was a convenient mode of retreat without increasing his actual or apparent peril. To excuse a failure to retreat, it is necessary that the defendant's peril would be increased, or that it reasonably appeared that it would be increased, by retreat.

But because withdrawal is something more than retreat, the instruction on retreat held Mr. Farrow to a lower standard than if it had also referred to withdrawal. Even if the instruction was erroneous, the error worked to Mr. Farrow's advantage, not to his prejudice. Accordingly, Mr. Farrow has not demonstrated that the district court committed plain error by giving this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b631] An initial aggressor has the greater burden of withdrawing before resorting to deadly force. Wyoming Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 8.03A correctly reflects this duty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Generally, the right to use self-defense is not available to an aggressor who provokes the conflict. However, if one provokes a conflict but thereafter withdraws in good faith and informs the adversary by words or actions of the desire to end the conflict and is thereafter pursued, that person then has the same right of self-defense as any other person. The person is justified in using force to the same extent that any other person would be who was acting in self-defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Wyoming Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 8.03B is also an accurate explanation of this duty. However, Wyoming Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 8.08B is inaccurate because it is indicated for use when the defendant is the aggressor, but deals with the duty to retreat rather than the duty to withdraw. Instructions relating to the initial aggressor should use the term \"withdraw,\" as explained in Wyoming Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 8.03A or 8.03B, not the term \"retreat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

The heat of passion must be aroused suddenly, and the act resulting in death must occur while the defendant was acting under the direct and immediate influence of such heat of passion, and before sufficient time has elapsed to permit the heat of passion to cool.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b636] As evidence that he acted under a sudden heat of passion, Mr. Farrow points out that he and Ms. Lowham were in, or had been in, a romantic relationship, and that they were living together. He and Ms. Lowham went to a bar together that evening, but she left the bar with another man without telling Mr. Farrow. He later found her in bed and intoxicated at the apartment where a party was taking place. He testified that he wanted to take her away from that apartment, but was unable to do that by himself, and was thwarted in his attempts to get help. In particular, his efforts were thwarted by Mr. Hansen, who tried to provoke a fight with Mr. Farrow by insulting him and calling him names. Mr. Farrow indicated that he felt trapped by the situation, \"and it was weird to me that this altercation is happening and nobody really cares or is doing anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b637] These circumstances are insufficient alone to give rise to a duty to instruct on sudden heat of passion. As stated in the pattern jury instruction, heat of passion must be aroused suddenly. Mr. Farrow waited nearly three hours after Ms. Lowham left the bar before going to the apartment to look for her. Mr. Johnson, who left the bar with Mr. Farrow and talked to him about his relationship with Ms. Lowham, believed that Mr. Farrow was \"in a pretty good spot emotionally\" and that \"everything kind of settled down\" before they went to the apartment to look for Ms. Lowham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b638] Several witnesses testified that Mr. Hansen confronted Mr. Farrow and tried to spur him into a fight very soon after Mr. Farrow arrived at the apartment. This continued until Mr. Farrow went back to the bedroom to check on Ms. Lowham. When Mr. Farrow returned from the bedroom, Mr. Hansen immediately confronted him again. In response to Mr. Hansen's efforts to start a fight, Mr. Farrow said, \"I'm not going to fight. ... I don't have any reason to fight.\" When Mr. Hansen called him a \"bunch of names,\" Mr. Farrow \"was trying to ignore him at that time and turn away from him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b639] When someone suggested playing beer pong, Mr. Farrow agreed, because \"if a game of beer pong will settle it, [he would] play a game of beer pong.\" When Mr. Hansen declared, \"Well, one way or the other, I'm fucking you up,\" Mr. Farrow decided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   I'm done with this and at this point in time I realized the situation wasn't getting better. It wasn't going to get better. And so I was like, I'm done with this. And I turned around and as I turned around, I heard him say, \"That's what I thought, bitch.\" And then I took a step or two and I got struck - I - I was walking back that way and I got struck in the back really hard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   When struck with this blow, Mr. Farrow felt sharp pain, had difficulty breathing, and felt back spasms. He testified that when he got struck again, he \"was in a lot of pain and in fear for my well-being and that's when I drew the gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b640] Mr. Farrow's testimony does not suggest that he reacted to Mr. Hansen's provocations in a sudden heat of passion. It indicates, rather, that he acted out of pain and fear, and thus in self-defense. Because Mr. Farrow failed to present evidence that he acted in a sudden heat of passion - either as to Ms. Lowham or as to Mr. Hansen - the district court was not required to instruct the jury that the State had the burden of disproving that he acted in a sudden heat of passion. The district court's failure to do so did not work to Mr. Farrow's material prejudice, and Mr. Farrow has failed to demonstrate plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5.

W.R.E. 802 provides that hearsay evidence is\n   generally inadmissible. However, W.R.E. 803(3) provides a potentially applicable exception, allowing the admission of hearsay if it is a statement \"of the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition.\" Again, because we decide this issue on other grounds, we need not decide if this hearsay exception applies to Mr. Sandoval's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [\u00b656] Further, we do not need to decide whether the district court's ruling was an abuse of discretion.

Given this evidence, Mr. Sandoval's testimony that Mr. Hansen said he wanted to get into a fight was not only cumulative, but also more remote in time from the confrontation between Mr. Farrow and Mr. Hansen than the eye-witness accounts.

For example, in his opening statement, defense counsel articulated the correct burden of proof: \"The State has a heavy burden in this case to show that [Mr. Farrow] didn't act in self-defense. That's the burden - that's one of their burdens of proof. They have to show that Mr. Farrow did not act in self-defense.\" The district court, in Instruction No. 18, instructed the jury on the correct burden of proof: \"Before the defendant may be convicted of any crime, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.\" We presume that the jury followed its instructions.\n   <em>\n    Guy v.

He does not challenge trial counsel's decision not to call this witness to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   [\u00b679] Given the state of the record in this case, such a contention would be difficult to sustain. Even if an expert witness were available, \"the defendant must also show that counsel's decision regarding the use of an expert reflected incompetency rather than a reasonable tactical choice.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343831\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/1257/\">\n    393 P.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Trial counsel for Mr. Farrow testified at the Rule 21 hearing that he \"thought we had a good enough record at that point\" so that it was unnecessary to call this expert witness or to engage another. \"Judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\"\n   <em>\n    Calene v.

We must defer to trial counsel's tactical choice and conclude that Mr. Farrow has not demonstrated that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by choosing not to call a witness to testify about shooting in stressful situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   [\u00b680] Third, Mr. Farrow claims that trial counsel \"failed to cross-examine two of the State's witnesses in any meaningful way.\" The first such was the State's pathologist who had prepared the autopsy report on Mr.\n   Hansen. This report indicated that Mr. Hansen suffered seven gunshot wounds, and further indicated the directions of the rounds inflicting these wounds. Mr. Farrow contends that this evidence was contrary to the State's theory that Mr. Hansen was lying on the floor when Mr. Farrow shot him. He claims that trial counsel failed to question the pathologist about this contradictory evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   [\u00b681] At the Rule 21 hearing, trial counsel identified the reason that he did not ask such questions of the State's pathologist: he \"wanted [this witness] off the stand as quickly as possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   He was the nicest, old man in the world. I wanted him off the stand. All he did was hurt [the defense case]. I wanted to see him go away. Have you ever tried a case? Have you ever had to make that decision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   [\u00b682] \"Cross-examination technique is an aspect of trial strategy which is best left to the trial attorney rather than to the supervision of appellate courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Mraz v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774822\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/280/\">\n    2016 WY 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774822\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/280/\">\n    378 P.3d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (Wyo. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hamburg v.

Mr. Farrow's assertion that the cross-examination should have been more thorough is insufficient to overcome trial counsel's specific explanation of his strategy for limiting his cross-examination of the State's pathologist. \"Speculation as to how the cross-examination could have been conducted differently does not meet the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test for ineffective assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Barkell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365692\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/55/1239/\">\n    2002 WY 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365692\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/55/1239/\">\n    55 P.3d 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1244 (Wyo. 2002). Mr. Farrow has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel's strategy amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   [\u00b683] Next, Mr. Farrow contends that trial counsel inadequately cross-examined the detective who testified about finding spent bullets in the rug, carpet, and floor where Mr. Hansen's body came to rest. He also testified that he found no bullets in the walls in the hallway. Mr. Farrow claims, however, that there was evidence of a bullet hole in the closet door behind or to the side of Mr. Hansen. He contends that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to cross-examine the detective about this contrary evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   [\u00b684] Again, trial counsel's testimony at the Rule 21 hearing explained why he did not cross-examine the detective about this evidence. The location of the bullets \"wasn't the focus of the case for me.\" Further, the testimony of the detective \"hurt us\" by reinforcing the State's theory that Mr. Farrow had fired down at Mr. Hansen while he was lying on the floor. Under these circumstances, trial counsel felt that limited cross-examination was appropriate because he was a neutral witness and he had little or no way to impeach him. \"You know, sometimes limited cross-examination ... sit down and shut up. They taught me that in law school.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   [\u00b685] Again, \"[c]ross-examination technique is an aspect of trial strategy which is best left to the trial attorney rather than to the supervision of appellate courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Mraz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774822\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/280/\">\n    378 P.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Farrow's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is untenable in light of trial counsel's explanation of his decision to limit his cross-examination of the detective. In this claim, as in his others, Mr. Farrow has failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   [\u00b686] We have determined that the district court did not err in instructing the jury, or that where it did err, the error was not prejudicial to Mr. Farrow. We have concluded that the district court properly excluded testimony that Mr. Hansen made previous statements indicating that he wanted to get into a fight. We have concluded that, although the prosecutor did commit misconduct by suggesting that Mr. Farrow had the burden of proof on certain issues relating to his claim of self-defense, there is no reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to Mr. Farrow absent this misconduct. Finally, we confirm the district court's decision that Mr. Farrow's trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance. We therefore affirm Mr. Farrow's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    We recognize that the definition of \"maliciously\" for purposes of first-degree murder, as in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , is somewhat different from the definition of \"maliciously\" for purposes of second-degree murder, as in Mr. Farrow's case. However, the question in both cases is whether the defendant was materially prejudiced when the jury was given an incorrect definition of the term \"maliciously.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    We are also reluctant to find plain error within closing argument \"lest the trial court becomes required to control argument because opposing counsel does not object.\"\n    <em>\n     Trujillo v.
