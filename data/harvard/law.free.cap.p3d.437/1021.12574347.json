Although the statute of limitations on claims is two years, she argues she tolled the limitations period one day before the statute ran by moving to amend her petition to add additional defendants. For the first time on appeal, Scott also argues her petition against the defendants cannot be dismissed because her amended petition adding those defendants relates back to her first petition. For the reasons explained later, we agree Scott tolled the statute of limitations upon filing her motion to amend her petition. We also find Scott waived her relation-back issue below and cannot raise it for the first time on appeal. The district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scott claims someone injured her by shooting fireworks in a trailer park during an Independence Day celebration on July 4, 2015. Scott sued Donald Ewing on June 30, 2016, alleging he hosted the event and set off the fireworks. Donald answered, denied the allegations, raised a defense of comparative fault, and asserted Scott failed to mitigate her damages. The two exchanged interrogatories and responses through January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 4, 2017, Scott electronically filed her motion to amend her petition and asked the district court for permission to add\n   Dawn Ewing, Ronald Ewing, Dustin Ewing, James Basey, Donald Smith, and Smith's minor son, K.S. as other defendants (the defendants). Scott claimed Donald now denied shooting the fireworks and he blamed the other proposed defendants. Scott also claimed Donald alleged Scott's injuries arose on another person's property in the trailer park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 17, 2017, the district court allowed Scott to amend her petition and add the additional defendants. Scott did so the same day. On August 23, 2017, Scott served her amended petition on Dawn, Donald, Ronald, Dustin, Smith, and K.S. On September 24, 2017, Scott served her amended petition on Basey. The defendants moved to dismiss the case, alleging the statute of limitations barred Scott from recovery because her amended petition was not granted until after the limitations period had expired on July 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At a motions hearing, Scott claimed she tolled the statute of limitations when she moved to amend her petition. She advised the district court she was not arguing her amended petition related back to her first petition. She also explained Donald Ewing, through discovery, raised an additional defense that he did not light the fireworks and he did not control the property where Scott sustained her injuries. According to Scott, Donald Ewing alleged K.S. was the party who injured Scott. Donald Ewing did not provide other details about K.S., so Scott had to conduct more investigation about the additional defendants before she moved to amend her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court dismissed Scott's amended petition. It found the statute of limitations expired on July 4, 2017, but Scott's amended petition was not granted or filed until August 17, 2017. The district court also found the defendants did not receive notice of Scott's claims until after July 4, 2017, citing favorably to\n   <em>\n    Hajda v. University of Kansas Hosp.

Both Scott and the defendants agree Scott's statute of limitations expired on July 5, 2017.

Under K.S.A. 60-513(a)(4), Scott's claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. Even so, K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-206 explains how to calculate time under Chapter 60 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated. If \"the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-206(a)(1)(C). When a party files electronically, the last day ends at midnight in the court's time zone. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-206(a)(4)(A). July 4, 2017, was a Tuesday and a legal holiday, so Scott's statute of limitations expired at the end of the next day, July 5, 2017. Scott electronically filed her motion to amend her petition on July 4, 2017. She timely filed before the statute of limitations expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    The filing of Scott's amended petition tolled the statute of limitations from running.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Whether the district court erred by dismissing Scott's petition is a question of\n   law subject to unlimited review. The appellate court will view the well-pleaded facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiff and assume as true those facts and any inferences reasonably drawn from them. If those facts and inferences state\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim upon which relief can be granted, then dismissal is improper.\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

One hundred fifteen days after suing, Read moved for additional time to serve the defendants and the district court granted Read's request. On appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court emphasized K.S.A. 60-203(a) relies on the word \"extend\" and a court cannot \"extend\" a deadline after it has passed because there is nothing left to extend.\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436887\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/247/557/\">\n    247 Kan. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436887\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/247/557/\">\n    802 P.2d 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Unlike Read, Tharp filed his request before 90 days expired, but the district court granted Tharp's request after the 90-day expiration. The\n   <em>\n    Tharp\n   </em>\n   court relied on\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   , finding the district court could not grant an extension because there was nothing left to extend.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"624112\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/32/628/\">\n    32 Kan.

Under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-215(a)(1), a party may amend his or her pleading once without court approval if the party does so within 21 days after serving the pleading or, if the pleading is one which requires a responsive pleading, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading. Under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-215(a)(2), \"[i]n all other cases, a party may amend\n   its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent, or the court's leave.

Yet the language of K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-215(a) creates no time limitation on the district court's authority to grant a party an amendment to a pleading.

With the civil suit pending, Phelps referred Drake to two other attorneys who filed her bankruptcy. The bankruptcy trustee settled Drake's civil suit because the settlement became part of the bankruptcy estate. Drake then sued Phelps and her bankruptcy attorneys, alleging Phelps was negligent for recommending settlement of her discrimination suit and the bankruptcy\n   attorneys failed to advise her the settlement would be part of the bankruptcy estate. Drake moved to amend her petition against the attorneys on November 15, 1989. Based on facts not relevant here, Drake's statute of limitations likely expired on November 16, 1989.

The\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   court noted K.S.A. 60-224 (Ensley 1983) was uniformly the same as Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

When a plaintiff timely moves the court for an amended petition, the plaintiff's claims should not be barred because the court must apply its time and energy elsewhere before turning to the plaintiff's request. Scott timely moved for her amended petition because she filed the day before the last day of her limitations period. The district court took more than 30 days before it allowed Scott to amend her petition. Scott's claims were\n   timely filed, and we cannot penalize her for waiting on the court.

Dustin's counsel argued to the district court there could be no relation back under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-215(c) because he claimed Scott added the additional defendants as new parties when she filed her amended petition. In response, Scott's counsel told the district court she was \"not arguing that this is a relation back issue, so I agree that we don't get into that analysis.\" Scott cannot now raise her claim of relation back in this appeal when she specifically told the district court she was not making a relation-back claim under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 60-215(c).
