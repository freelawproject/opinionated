The plaintiffs in this case (\"the Patients\") received settlements or damage awards from third-party tortfeasors for injuries that required treatment at the Hospitals. The Patients sued to enjoin the Hospitals from enforcing liens on their tort recoveries for the balance between the rates the Hospitals agreed to accept from AHCCCS and what the Hospitals would have charged non-AHCCCS patients. We hold that\n   federal law preempts state statutes authorizing the Hospitals to impose and enforce those liens, and affirm the superior court's order enjoining the liens. For reasons set forth below, we also reverse the court's judgment against the Patients on their third-party-beneficiary claim for breach of contract and vacate and remand for further consideration a portion of the attorney's fee award to the Patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 The Hospitals recorded their liens pursuant to two statutes, Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 33-931 (2019) and 36-2903.01(G)(4) (2019).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The former allows a health-care provider to file a lien for its \"customary\" charges against a patient's tort recovery. The latter specifically applies when a hospital has served an AHCCCS member and allows that hospital to \"collect any unpaid portion of its bill from other third-party payors or in situations\" in which the general medical-lien statute applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In their complaint, the Patients alleged federal Medicaid law preempts the Arizona lien statutes in cases such as theirs, and sought an injunction barring the Hospitals from recording liens on their tort recoveries. The Patients argued the liens constitute impermissible \"balance billing,\" a term describing a health-care provider's effort to collect from a patient \"the difference in the amount paid by Medicaid, or a state plan like AHCCCS, and the amount\" the provider typically charges.\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Those plaintiffs appealed, arguing their settlements lacked consideration because federal law preempted the Hospitals' liens. This court accepted that argument,\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

The superior court ruled in favor of the Patients on their claim for a declaratory judgment, holding that when a hospital has accepted payment from AHCCCS for treating a patient, 42 Code of Federal Regulations (\"C.F.R.\") \u00a7 447.15 (2019) preempts the hospital's state-law right to a lien on the patient's tort recovery for the balance between what AHCCCS paid and the hospital's customary charges. The court then enjoined the Hospitals from \"filing or asserting any lien or claim against a patient's personal injury recovery, after having received\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   payment from AHCCCS for the same patient's care.\" The court granted summary judgment to the Hospitals, however, on the Patients' third-party-beneficiary claim, which alleged the Hospitals breached their contracts with AHCCCS by imposing the liens. Finally, the superior court awarded attorney's fees to the Patients under the private attorney general doctrine and denied both sides' motions for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The Hospitals appealed the preemption ruling and injunction, and the Patients cross-appealed the judgment against them on their contract claim. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2019) and -2101(A)(1) (2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 In our initial opinion in the current appeal, we did not address the superior court's order granting the Patients' claim for a declaratory judgment that federal law preempts the Hospitals' state-law lien rights. We concluded instead that the Patients were\n   entitled to injunctive relief as third-party beneficiaries of the contracts the Hospitals entered with AHCCCS. Those contracts require the Hospitals to comply with applicable federal law. Under that federal law, we held the Hospitals could not enforce liens against the Patients' tort recoveries for the balance between what AHCCCS paid the Hospitals and the Hospitals' customary rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The Hospitals moved for reconsideration, arguing for the first time that under\n   <em>\n    Astra USA, Inc. v. Santa Clara County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940325,12457893\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/110/\">\n    563 U.S. 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940325,12457893\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/110/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5940325,12457893\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/110/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), the Patients could not sue as third-party beneficiaries of the contracts because the federal law on which they based their claim affords no private right of action. The Hospitals' argument under\n   <em>\n    Astra\n   </em>\n   requires us to address the issue we deferred in our initial opinion.

But the Arizona plan does not address balance billing, let alone endorse it. For their contention to the contrary, the Hospitals rely on a brief portion of \"Attachment 4.19-A,\" a 66-page section of the AHCCCS plan titled \"Methods and Standards for Establishing Payment Rates [for] Inpatient Hospital Care.\" In the definitions section, Attachment 4.19-A provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Prospective rates are inpatient hospital rates defined in advance of a payment period and represent payment in full for covered services excluding any quick-pay discounts, slow pay penalties, and third party payments regardless of billed charges or individual hospital costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Hospitals contend this language means that after a hospital has accepted \"payment in full\" from AHCCCS for treating a patient, it may impose a lien on the patient's tort recovery as a permissible \"third party payment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 But the brief reference in Attachment 4.19 to \"third party payments\" in a section of the plan specifying the rates AHCCCS will pay hospitals does not constitute an endorsement of a hospital's right to accept payment from AHCCCS, then impose a lien on the patient's tort recovery for more. The word \"lien\" is not even used. As set out in \u00b6 11,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , because AHCCCS is the \"payer of last resort,\" a hospital must determine whether a third party may be liable for the cost of treatment before the hospital bills AHCCCS. If the hospital ascertains that a third party is liable, it may bill AHCCCS only for the difference between what it has recovered from the third party and the AHCCCS scheduled rate. Against that backdrop, the reference to \"third party payment\" in Attachment 4.19-A refers to a payment made\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the hospital accepts payment from AHCCCS, not after.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 The Hospitals also point to A.A.C. R9-22-1007 as support for their contention that Arizona's AHCCCS plan allows balance billing. The cited regulation is titled \"Notification for Perfection, Recording, and Assignment of AHCCCS Liens.\" It requires that when a hospital has treated an AHCCCS member for an injury \"reflecting the probable\n   liability of a first- or third-party,\" the hospital must, within 30 days of discharging the patient, notify AHCCCS \"under R9-22-1008\" or mail the agency \"a copy of the lien the hospital proposes to record or has recorded under A.R.S. \u00a7 33-932.\" A.A.C. R9-22-1007. The Hospitals argue the regulation effectively acknowledges a hospital's right to record a lien against a patient's tort recovery after accepting payment from AHCCCS. But read in context with A.A.C. R9-22-1008, which requires providers to notify AHCCCS of the \"[a]mount estimated to be due for care of member,\" it is clear that R9-22-1007 concerns a lien the hospital would record\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   AHCCCS determines what to pay the hospital, not after.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b628 The Hospitals' argument that the AHCCCS plan permits them to use liens to balance bill patients also disregards the mandate in A.A.C. R9-22-702(B), under which a provider \"must accept payment from [AHCCCS] or a contractor as payment in full.\" Beyond repeating the requirement prescribed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20447.15\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Arizona regulation goes on to specifically limit the circumstances under which a provider may demand payment from a patient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R9-22-702(C), (D). As relevant here, the regulation allows a provider to pursue a patient only (1) to collect a copayment and (2) to collect \"that portion of a payment made [to the patient] by a third party\" that is subject to the patient's \"statutory assignment of rights to AHCCCS.\" A.A.C. R9-22-702(D) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-2946(A) (patient's assignment of medical benefits), -2915(A) (AHCCCS lien on patient's tort claim). In other words, the only specified circumstance in which a hospital may demand that a patient turn over a tort recovery is when the proceeds are subject to an assignment or lien in favor\n   <em>\n    of AHCCCS\n   </em>\n   . There is no corresponding provision in the regulation allowing a hospital to compel a patient to relinquish a tort recovery to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    hospital's\n   </em>\n   lien rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b629 In short, the provisions the Hospitals cite in the Arizona plan are part and parcel of a provider's duty under the plan to \"cost avoid\" before it bills AHCCCS, not a license to accept payment from AHCCCS, then enforce a lien against the patient's tort recovery for the balance between that payment and what the provider would have charged another patient. Accordingly, we hold that when CMS approved the AHCCCS plan, it did not authorize providers to accept payment from AHCCCS, then enforce liens against patients' recoveries from tortfeasors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b630 In their motion for reconsideration, the Hospitals cite\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

In rejecting their claim, the Court held that when a state Medicaid plan fails to comply with the federal act, the only remedy \"is the withholding of Medicaid funds by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1384\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c. That provision empowers HHS to withhold funding when it finds that a state Medicaid plan \"no longer complies\" with federal law or that \"in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially\" with federal law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b640 But here, and in contrast to the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   , the Patients do not contend anything in Arizona's AHCCCS\n   <em>\n    plan\n   </em>\n   is preempted by federal law. They have no complaint with the Arizona plan or how AHCCCS implements the Arizona plan. Instead, they claim federal law preempts the Hospitals' rights to enforce liens that state law otherwise allows. As we have held,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-28, Arizona's AHCCCS plan neither incorporates nor countenances application of the Arizona lien statutes under the circumstances presented here. When hospitals seek to intercept AHCCCS members' tort recoveries, they are exercising their rights under state statute, not under the AHCCCS plan or the administration of that plan subject to review by HHS. For that reason, \u00a7 1396c of the Medicaid Act is irrelevant to the Patients' claim against the Hospitals, and the Hospitals cite no authority to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tohono O'odham Nation v.

As we have held, the regulation preempts a hospital's right under state law to impose a lien on a patient's tort recovery to collect the balance between the hospital's customary rates and what it accepted from AHCCCS for treating the patient. The regulation raises none of the \"administrability\" issues that \u00a7 30(A) posed in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   . Nor does enforcement of \u00a7 447.15 require any exercise of agency expertise or discretion. Whether the regulation preempts a state lien statute that otherwise would allow a hospital to balance bill is a legal issue of the sort that courts typically resolve. Indeed, as noted above, the injunction the superior court entered here gave the Patients the same relief that would have been available to them in defending a hypothetical action by the Hospitals to enforce liens against the Patients' tort recoveries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1384\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a court may not hold a civil defendant liable under state law for conduct federal law requires\");\n   <em>\n    Public Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12002562,12002723\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/693/562/\">\n    693 So.2d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming judgment based on preemption in favor of Medicaid patient when hospital sued to enforce lien).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b643 In sum, the Patients' preemption claim presents neither of the concerns that caused the\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   Court to conclude that Congress intended to preclude equitable relief to the providers in that case.
