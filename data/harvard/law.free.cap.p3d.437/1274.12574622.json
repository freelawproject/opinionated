We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In August 2007, JENCO LC and VC Holdings LLC teamed up to purchase real property (the Property) in St. George, Utah. Gilbert Jennings formed, and was the manager of, JENCO. Vaughn Hansen and Carolyn Hansen formed VC Holdings in 2005. VC Holdings was a manager-managed company, and the Hansens were the company's only members. Together, the two companies purchased the Property, with JENCO receiving a 68.2% interest in the Property and VC Holdings receiving a 31.8% interest. Shortly after purchasing its interest in the Property, VC Holdings named Mr. Hansen as manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In March 2008, JENCO and VC Holdings formed JVC Leasing LC, and Mr. Jennings was appointed manager of the company. A few months later, JENCO and VC Holdings transferred 100% of their respective interests in the Property to JVC Leasing. In return, JENCO received a 68.2% interest in JVC Leasing, and VC Holdings received a 31.8% interest in JVC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In May 2009, the Eskelsens loaned the Hansens $120,000. The Hansens signed a promissory note for the full amount of the loan, and, as security for the loan, they executed a \"Limited Liability Company Membership Interest Pledge Agreement,\" pledging to the Eskelsens 100% of the total issued and outstanding membership interests in VC Holdings. Importantly, VC Holdings was not a party to the promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In June 2010, the Hansens defaulted on the promissory note, and the Eskelsens hired attorney Daniel J. Tobler to help them collect on the promissory note.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Eskelsens also filed a UCC-1 financing statement with the Utah Department of Commerce to perfect their security interest in 100% of the membership interests in VC Holdings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In late December 2010, as part of his collection efforts, Mr. Tobler sent a letter (the Foreclosure Letter) to the Hansens, stating that the Eskelsens were \"accepting [the Hansens'] total issued and outstanding membership interests in VC Holdings\" \"in full satisfaction\" of the promissory note. The letter stated that the Eskelsens \"were the sole members of VC Holdings\" and that they were removing the Hansens as members and managers of the company. Finally, the letter said the Hansens had twenty days to object to the Eskelsens' proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Mr. Tobler also sent a letter to JVC Leasing in care of Mr. Jennings. That letter stated that the Eskelsens \"have elected to be admitted as members of VC Holdings, and are now managers of the same. Thus all notices from JVC Leasing, LC, and payments or distributions for VC Holdings, LLC's 31.8% interest in JVC Leasing, LC, shall be paid to the Eskelsens at the address listed below.\" The letter did not include a copy of the Foreclosure Letter sent to the Hansens or the loan documents between the Eskelsens and the Hansens. In addition, the letter did not state that Mr. Hansen would be removed as manager of VC Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In January 2011, Mr. Tobler received a telephone call from another attorney, Mr. Blanchard, who was calling as a favor to the Hansens. Mr. Blanchard stated that his firm officially represented Mr. Jennings. Mr. Blanchard also stated that he did not believe the Eskelsens had properly foreclosed on the Hansens' membership interests in VC Holdings, but he nevertheless suggested a compromise whereby Mr. Hansen would broker a sale of the Property to Mr. Jennings (through one of Mr. Jennings's entities) and place in escrow the proceeds of the sale. The Hansens and the Eskelsens could then determine how the proceeds should be distributed. Mr. Tobler agreed to consult with the Eskelsens and to contact Mr. Blanchard with their answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 After his discussion with Mr. Blanchard, Mr. Tobler received a letter from Mr. Jennings in response to Mr. Tobler's December 2010 letter. Mr. Jennings asked for \"documentary proof of the transition of ownership\" of VC Holdings. He also stated that VC Holdings was \"indebted to [JVC Leasing] in the amount of $54,270.50\" and suggested that the Eskelsens contact him to \"work out a repayment plan.\" Mr. Tobler never provided Mr. Jennings or Mr. Blanchard with the Foreclosure Letter or the signed agreement between the Eskelsens and the Hansens. He also never provided Mr. Jennings or Mr. Blanchard with the requested \"documentary proof\" of the transfer of ownership of VC Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 According to Mr. Jennings, after he received the Eskelsens' December 27, 2010 letter, he consulted with Mr. Hansen about the Eskelsens' claims. Mr. Jennings testified that Mr. Hansen claimed that he (Mr. Hansen) was still the owner of VC Holdings. Mr. Jennings also searched Utah's Department of Commerce website and found that Mr. Hansen was still listed as VC Holdings' manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 In January 2011, Mr. Tobler contacted Mr. Blanchard and informed him that the Eskelsens would agree to the proposed escrow agreement. Both attorneys later testified that they understood that the Eskelsens, the Hansens, and Mr. Jennings would agree to sign the escrow agreement. Approximately one month later, Mr. Blanchard contacted Mr. Tobler and informed him that he had not yet had a chance to put together the escrow agreement. Then, on March 22, Mr. Blanchard informed Mr. Tobler that the Hansens wished to work directly with the Eskelsens. Mr. Blanchard stated that he had not prepared an escrow agreement. He also stated that Mr. Tobler should contact him if the Eskelsens did not hear from the Hansens within the next few days. Mr. Blanchard later testified that when he contacted Mr. Tobler on March 22, he was unaware that the Hansens and Mr. Jennings planned to sell VC Holdings' interest in the Property. Mr. Tobler did not contact Mr. Blanchard within the next few days as requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Ultimately, the Hansens and Mr. Jennings agreed that VC Holdings would sell its ownership interest in JVC Leasing to Theta for $236,337. At that time, Mr. Jennings was the vice president of Theta. Mr. Jennings later testified that he asked Mr. Hansen if he had authority to conduct business on behalf of VC Holdings, and Mr. Hansen confirmed that he did. Mr. Hansen also told Mr. Jennings that the Eskelsens did not have a valid claim to VC Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 On March 23, 2011, Mr. Engstrom, a partner at Mr. Blanchard's firm, ordered closing documents from Southern Utah Title Company for a transfer of 31.8% of the Property interest from JVC Leasing to VC Holdings and then to Theta. Before closing, Southern Utah Title independently verified that Mr. Hansen had the authority to sign the closing documents for VC Holdings. On March 29, Mr. Hansen, acting as manager of VC Holdings, signed an agreement redeeming VC Holdings' 31.8% membership interest\n   in JVC Leasing. In return, JVC Leasing conveyed a 31.8% interest in the Property to VC Holdings. VC Holdings then sold its 31.8% interest in the Property to Theta for $236,337. After satisfying the $54,270 debt VC Holdings owed to JVC Leasing, Theta placed $180,000 in escrow with Southern Utah Title. Mr. Hansen instructed Southern Utah Title to release the $180,000 to a company called ME Jenkins Management LLC. Mr. Hansen later testified that he used the money for personal expenses instead of repaying the Eskelsens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 In August 2011, the Eskelsens received notice of the Hansens' chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. That same day, Mr. Tobler searched the relevant recorder's office website and discovered the March 29 transfer documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 The Eskelsens sued the Hansens, VC Holdings, and Theta. The Eskelsens sought a judgment declaring that VC Holdings, not Theta, owned the 31.8% interest in the Property. The Eskelsens asserted that (1) the transfer to Theta was void as a fraudulent transfer, (2) even if the transfer was not fraudulent, it was void because Mr. Hansen lacked authority to act as VC Holdings' manager, and (3) even if the transfer was not fraudulent and Mr. Hansen had authority to act as VC Holdings' manager, the transfer was void because it was \"outside of the ordinary course of business\" and \"Mr. Hansen did not have specific authority to transfer away all of VC Holdings' assets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 After a two-day bench trial, the trial court ruled in Theta's favor. In its written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court concluded (1) that the March 29, 2011 transfer was not a fraudulent transfer, (2) that the Eskelsens failed to properly remove Mr. Hansen as VC Holdings' manager and Mr. Hansen was therefore VC Holdings' manager on the date of the transfer, (3) and that Mr. Hansen's actions as manager bound VC Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 After trial, the Eskelsens filed a motion to amend and make additional findings pursuant to rule 52(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court granted the Eskelsens' motion to amend several clerical errors, such as replacing \"Theta\" with \"JENCO\" and \"2015\" with \"2011.\" But the court \"otherwise denied\" their motion. The Eskelsens appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 The Eskelsens first contend that the trial court erred in determining that Mr. Hansen \"did not commit a fraudulent transfer under the Utah [Uniform] Fraudulent Transfer Act.\" With regard to this claim, we review questions of fact for clear error and questions of law for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Tolle v.

They assert error in the trial court's determination that \"Theta ... did not\n   have notice of the Eskelsens' superior claim.\" A finding that Theta had notice of the Eskelsens' claim, they assert, means Theta could not have been a good faith transferee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-6-9\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 25-6-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2015) (stating that a fraudulent transfer \"is not voidable ... against a person that took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value\"). The Eskelsens also contend that the trial court erred in determining that Mr. Hansen had authority to act on behalf of VC Holdings on March 29, 2011. Theta correctly observes that this issue \"depends entirely on the trial court's determination of whether Theta had notice or knowledge of any restrictions on [Mr. Hansen's] authority[,] which is a fact question.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    4447 Assocs. v.

Therefore, the trial court concluded, VC Holdings was not a \"debtor\" under the Act, and the Eskelsens' fraudulent transfer claim against VC Holdings necessarily failed. We agree.

Consequently, we agree with the trial court that the Hansens \"could not and did not transfer any interest in JVC Leasing at the March 29, 2011 closing.\" We therefore conclude that, because the Hansens did not transfer \"property of a debtor,\" the Act does not afford the Eskelsens a remedy against the Hansens.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b630 The record also does not establish, and the Eskelsens do not directly argue, that VC Holdings was Mr. Hansen's \"alter ego\" so that the sale of VC Holdings' interest in JVC Leasing could nevertheless be considered a transfer of a debtor's property.

More specifically, the Eskelsens assert that Theta had the burden of showing that it \"paid valuable consideration and did so without notice\" in order to be protected as a good faith transferee, and that the trial court incorrectly shifted that burden to the Eskelsens. Theta, on the other hand, contends that because \"[t]he Eskelsens never demonstrated a fraudulent transfer,\" \"the burden never shifted to Theta on its affirmative defense.\" We agree with Theta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b634 Section 25-6-5(1) of the Act provides that a fraudulent transfer occurs when a debtor (a) transfers property with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor, or (b) transfers property under certain circumstances without receiving reasonably equivalent value in exchange.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-6-5\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 25-6-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis 2013).

According to the Eskelsens, \"[t]he December 27, 2010 letter sent to Mr. Jennings ... gave actual notice of the Hansens' lack of authority\" to act on VC Holdings' behalf and transfer its interest in JVC Leasing to Theta. They further assert that the December 2010 letter \"was sufficient information to create a duty to investigate the Eskelsens' claim further\" and \"amounted to inquiry notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b637 In the context of the good faith transferee defense \"[i]t is notice, not knowledge, that the purchaser must have, and it need not be actual notice[-]constructive notice is sufficient to defeat the purchaser's claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

Here, the trial court concluded that Mr. Jennings was made aware of the Eskelsens' claim when he received the December 2010 letter, and that Mr. Jennings therefore \"had a duty to inquire about the Eskelsens' claims.\" The court further concluded that Mr. Jennings had indeed conducted \"a reasonable inquiry into the Eskelsens' claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b638 Specifically, the court found that upon receipt of the December 2010 letter, Mr. Jennings immediately responded with his own letter asking for \"documentary proof of the transition of ownership,\" but that the Eskelsens never responded to that request. Mr. Jennings also asked Mr. Hansen about the Eskelsens' claim, and Mr. Hansen told Mr. Jennings that their claim was not valid and that he (Mr. Hansen) had authority to sign for VC Holdings. Mr. Jennings then searched the Utah Department of Commerce's website and saw that Mr. Hansen was listed as the manager for VC Holdings. Theta conducted the closing through Southern Utah Title Company, which had performed its own search of the Department of Commerce's website and found that Mr. Hansen was listed as manager of VC Holdings. Theta also received a title commitment that did not show any encumbrances to JVC Leasing's interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b639 The court further found that (1) Mr. Jennings relied on Mr. Hansen's representations\n   and the documents he signed to determine that Mr. Hansen \"had authority to execute the closing documents,\" (2) \"Mr. Jennings relied on Southern Utah Title Company's determination that [Mr.] Hansen had authority to execute the closing documents,\" (3) Theta \"paid sufficient value to VC Holdings for [Mr.] Hansen to pay his debts,\" and (4) both Mr. Jennings and Mr. Blanchard separately believed that Mr. Hansen intended to pay his debts. Although the Eskelsens asserted that Mr. Jennings should have contacted them a second time when he did not hear back from them in response to his letter requesting \"documentary proof\" of their claims, the court determined that \"[t]he ball, so to speak, was in the Eskelsens['] court and they had the duty to provide the information Mr. Jennings requested.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b640 \"[T]o successfully challenge a trial court's factual findings on appeal, the appellant must overcome the healthy dose of deference owed to factual findings by identifying and dealing with the supportive evidence and demonstrating the legal problem in that evidence, generally through marshaling the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Taft v.

For example, the Eskelsens assert that \"[h]ad [Mr. Jennings] investigated further or possibly inquired of his own attorneys he would have learned the Eskelsens' claim was legitimate.\" They also assert that \"relying on the Utah Department of Commerce's website ... was inadequate\" because \"Mr. Jennings himself had not update[d] the Department's website when he moved from vice-president to president of Theta ... for at least three to four years, indicating he should know it is not a reliable source for definitive information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 The Eskelsens' self-serving statements do not discharge their burden of demonstrating that the trial court's findings are not adequately supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785180\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/890/\">\n    2016 UT App 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785180\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/890/\">\n    379 P.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, article 5.4 of the Operating Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, without the approval of Members whose aggregate Membership Interest is at least 51 percent, the Managers may take no action with respect to: the sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Based on Utah Code section 48-2c-802 and article 5.4 of the Operating Agreement, the court determined that the issue was \"whether Mr. Jennings knew that Mr. Hansen had to have VC Holdings' members' approval before participating in the March 29, 2011 closing.\" Observing that the Eskelsens had \"presented no evidence at trial regarding this issue,\" the court concluded that Mr. Jennings had no knowledge of article 5.4's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b650 Theta correctly observes that the Eskelsens do not challenge the trial court's finding that Mr. Jennings did not have notice of any restriction on Mr. Hansen's authority to act pursuant to section 5.4 of VC Holdings' Operating Agreement. Rather, the Eskelsens acknowledge the trial court's finding and continue to assert that Mr. Jennings \"had significant and continual notice of the Eskelsens' claim,\" which \"must amount to knowledge that the Hansens lacked authority\" to act on behalf of VC Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b651 As previously discussed, however, the court found that Mr. Jennings conducted a reasonable inquiry into the Eskelsens' claim. Mr. Jennings asked for \"documentary proof\" of their claim but never received it. Mr. Jennings spoke with Mr. Hansen about his authority to act on VC Holdings' behalf. He also searched the Department of Commerce's website and discovered that Mr. Hansen was listed as VC Holdings' manager. As the trial court observed, the \"simple act\" of updating the Department of Commerce's website, as required by section 8.1(a) of VC Holdings' Operating Agreement, would have \"provided part of the additional proof that Mr. Jennings requested\" from the Eskelsens. That update also would have put Southern Utah Title, which conducted its own search of the Department of Commerce's website, on notice that the Eskelsens' did not intend to retain Mr. Hansen as the manager of VC Holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b652 In addition, pursuant to Utah Code section 48-2c-121, \"Articles of organization that have been filed with the [state division of corporations] constitute notice to third persons ... of all statements set forth in the articles of organization that are ... expressly permitted to be set forth in the articles of organization by [ Utah Code section] 48-2c-403(4).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2048\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -2c-121(1) (LexisNexis 2010). Utah Code section 48-2c-403(4) further provides, in relevant part, \"The articles of organization may contain any other provision not inconsistent with law, including ... a statement of whether there are limitations on the authority of managers or members to bind the company and, if so, what the limitations are....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b653 Here, the trial court correctly recognized that, although section 5.4 of VC Holdings' Operating Agreement contained a restriction on Mr. Hansen's authority to act, the company's articles of organization, which are a matter of public record, did not contain a similar restriction on authority. Thus, the trial court appropriately considered whether Mr. Jennings knew of section 5.4's requirement \"that Mr. Hansen had to have VC Holding[s's] members['] approval before participating in the March 29, 2011 closing,\" and the court concluded that Mr. Jennings had no notice or knowledge of section 5.4's restriction on Mr. Hansen's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b654 The trial court found additional support for its conclusion that Mr. Jennings had no knowledge of any restrictions on Mr. Hansen's authority under article 5.5 of the Operating Agreement, titled \"Agency Power and Authority,\" which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A Manager apparently acting for the Company in the usual course of business has the power to bind the Company and\n   <em>\n    no person has an obligation to inquire into the Manager's actual authority to act on the company's behalf\n   </em>\n   . However, if a Manager acts outside the scope of the Manager's actual authority, the Manager will indemnify the Company for and costs of damages it incurs as a result of the unauthorized act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The court observed that each of the Hansens signed a \"Resolution of Members\" authorizing the sale of VC Holdings' ownership interest in JVC Leasing. And although neither of the Hansens were actually members of VC Holdings on March 29, 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"no evidence was produced at trial that\n   Mr. Jennings was aware of that fact.\" Because Mr. Jennings \"had known and done business with Mr. Hansen ..., and VC Holdings for years,\" the court determined that Mr. Jennings had no obligation to make further inquiries regarding member approval as to Mr. Hansen's authority to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b655 On appeal, the Eskelsens fail to acknowledge the trial court's findings regarding section 5.5 of the Operating Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden Meadows Props., LC v.

Consequently, we are not persuaded the trial court erred in determining that Mr. Hansen had the authority to act on VC Holdings's behalf on March 29, 2011, the date the Property was transferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IV. The Principal-Agency Relationship\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b657 The Eskelsens next contend that \"[t]he trial court erred by not imputing knowledge through the principal-agency relationship between Theta Investment and its attorneys.\" According to the Eskelsens, \"[t]hrough his attorneys\"-Mr. Blanchard and Mr. Engstrom-\"Mr. Jennings had full knowledge of the loan between the Eskelsens and the Hansens because Mr. Blanchard had actually drafted those agreements.\" \"Further,\" the Eskelsens assert, \"Mr. Jennings knew the only reason the Eskelsens were not taking further steps to exclude the Hansens after accepting their membership interest in VC Holdings is because of a tentative agreement to allow the Hansens to broker a sale,\" i.e., the escrow agreement. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b658 To begin, Mr. Blanchard prepared the loan agreement for the Hansens, not Mr. Jennings. Pursuant to the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, \"[u]nder traditional agency principles, a lawyer's knowledge relating to the representation is attributed to the lawyer's client.\" Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 28 cmt.

Prof'l Cond. 1.6(a) (\"A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent....\"). Thus, the fact that Mr. Blanchard prepared the loan agreement for the Hansens in one transaction does not automatically impute his knowledge of that transaction to a different client-Mr. Jennings-in a different transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b659 Moreover, at trial, Mr. Blanchard struggled to remember the loan agreement he prepared for the Hansens. He was unsure whether he wrote it or whether a paralegal wrote it under his direction. Mr. Blanchard could tell from the agreement that he sent it to the Hansens with blanks for them to fill in. He could not recall if he was present when the agreement was signed, and he did not \"remember ever having a signed copy.\" When asked if he recalled preparing the loan agreement at the time he spoke with Mr. Tobler, Mr. Blanchard stated, \"It's possible I had forgotten. I think I remembered, but maybe I-maybe I didn't. Again, I didn't pull it up. I didn't look at it. I didn't see it. Frankly, I didn't spend a lot of time on it.\" Mr. Engstrom was not called to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b660 The trial court listened to the testimony of Mr. Jennings and Mr. Blanchard and declined to find that Mr. Blanchard knew what the Eskelsens claim he should have known and that any of Mr. Blanchard's knowledge should be imputed to Mr. Jennings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Fork City v.

Indeed,\n   the court found that if \"Mr. Jennings is deemed to know what Mr. Blanchard knew, he would know that Mr. Blanchard contacted Mr. Tobler in March and informed him (Mr. Tobler) that Mr. Hansen wanted to work directly with the Eskelsens and that he (Mr. Blanchard) would not be preparing an escrow agreement.\" The court found that when Mr. Blanchard sent that email to Mr. Tobler, Mr. Blanchard \"did not know there was any plan between the Hansens and Mr. Jennings to sell the property interest at issue.\" The court also found that \"[Mr.] Jennings and [Mr.] Blanchard separately believed that [Mr.] Hansen intended to pay the debts he had.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b661 Based upon the trial court's advantaged position in judging credibility and resolving conflicts in the evidence, and the deference we thus owe it, we conclude that the court did not err in declining to impute unproven \"knowledge\" to Mr. Jennings or Theta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   V. The Eskelsens' Motion to Amend\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b662 Finally, the Eskelsens assert that \"[t]he trial court erred in denying in part [their] motion to amend its findings.\" According to the Eskelsens, \"the Trial Court made a few incorrect Findings of Fact\" that \"\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   had a significant impact on the Court's conclusions.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b663 First, the Eskelsens challenge paragraph 31 of the trial court's findings of fact, which states, \"Mr. Tobler never gave Mr. Blanchard the Foreclosure Letter or the signed Agreements.\" The Eskelsens assert that the court should also have found that \"Mr. Blanchard actually drafted those exact agreements and remembered that fact at the time he was discussing these matters with Mr. Tobler.\" Thus, according to the Eskelsens, \"it is really of no significance that Mr. Tobler did not provide [Mr. Blanchard] with signed agreements because [Mr. Blanchard] already knew exactly what was in them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b664 At trial, however, Mr. Blanchard had no clear recollection on the matter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Q.

It's possible I had forgotten. I think I remembered, but maybe I-maybe I didn't. Again, I didn't pull it up. I didn't look at it. I didn't see it. Frankly, I didn't spend a lot of time on it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition, he was unsure whether he wrote the loan agreement or whether a paralegal wrote it under his direction. Mr. Blanchard could not recall whether he was present when the agreement was signed, and he did not \"remember ever having a signed copy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b665 \"We defer to the trial court's ability and opportunity to evaluate credibility and demeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    American Fork City v.

Here, the trial court listened to Mr. Blanchard's testimony and had the opportunity to evaluate his credibility and demeanor. Based on that testimony, the trial court reasonably could have determined that Mr. Blanchard did not have any specific memory of the loan agreement he prepared for the Hansens and the Eskelsens. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the court exceeded its discretion in declining to make the Eskelsens' requested finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b666 Second, the Eskelsens challenge paragraph 32 of the trial court's findings of fact, which states, \"Mr. Tobler never discussed [Mr. Jennings's] request for documents with Mr. Blanchard.\" According to the Eskelsens, Mr. Blanchard testified that \"he did not remember it being discussed, not that it was never discussed.\" At trial, the following exchange with Mr. Blanchard took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Q. Did Mr. Tobler ever tell you about a document request from [Mr.] Jennings?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A. No, I don't remember that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q. Did Mr. Tobler[,] during these conversations in January, February, and March of 2011, did Mr. Tobler provide you with any documentary proof that ... the Hansens' interests were validly foreclosed on?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   A. No. Again, we did not-that was not a heavy item of discussion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The trial court heard Mr. Blanchard's testimony and observed his demeanor at trial. Based on Mr. Blanchard's testimony, the court reasonably could infer that Mr. Blanchard did not remember Mr. Tobler telling him about a document request from Mr. Jennings because that conversation never occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b667 Third, the Eskelsens challenge paragraph 45 of the trial court's findings of fact, which states, \"[O]n March 22, 2011, Mr. Blanchard informed Mr. Tobler that [Mr.] Hansen wanted to work directly with the Eskelsens and that he (Mr. Blanchard) would not be preparing an agreement.\" (Emphasis omitted.) The Eskelsens assert that it was not until May 2011, that Mr. Blanchard informed Mr. Tobler that he would not be preparing an escrow agreement. According to the Eskelsens, the timing of these communications is of \"paramount\" concern because it \"lulled [them] into continuing to wait for a mutually beneficial outcome involving all parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b668 But the email Mr. Blanchard sent to Mr. Tobler on March 22, 2011, also stated, \"If your clients don't hear from [Mr. Hansen] in the next day or so please let me know.\" Thus, Mr. Blanchard's email indicated he was waiting to hear from Mr. Tobler, and Mr. Blanchard testified at trial that he did not receive a response from Mr. Tobler or the Eskelsens \"in the next day or so\" and \"at that point [he] thought it was done and resolved.\" Mr. Tobler confirmed at trial that he did not contact Mr. Blanchard in the next couple of days to let him know whether Mr. Hansen had spoken with the Eskelsens. Based on the foregoing, we agree with Theta that \"the trial court could reasonably infer and therefore find, as it did, that as of March 22, the Eskelsens were to work directly with the Hansens and that [Mr.] Blanchard would not be preparing any agreement unless he heard otherwise from [Mr.] Tobler.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b669 Lastly, we note that the Eskelsens have failed to explain, in the context of the trial court's unchallenged findings, what impact these allegedly incorrect findings had on the trial court's ultimate conclusions. Rather, the Eskelsens merely assert that \"[t]hese incorrect findings\n   <em>\n    potentially\n   </em>\n   had a significant impact on the Court's conclusions.\" (Emphasis added.) That is not sufficient to demonstrate that the trial court exceeded its discretion in declining to amend its findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 61 (\"The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b670 We conclude that Utah's Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act does not afford the Eskelsens a remedy against Theta, VC Holdings, or the Hansens. In addition, the trial court did not err in determining that Mr. Jennings conducted a reasonable inquiry into the Eskelsens' claim, that Theta and Mr. Jennings had no notice or knowledge of any restrictions on Mr. Hansen's authority to act, and that Mr. Hansen had the authority to act on behalf of VC Holdings on March 29, 2011. Lastly, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its discretion when it denied the Eskelsens' motion to amend and make additional findings of fact.
