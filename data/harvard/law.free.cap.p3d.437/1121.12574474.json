This criminal case requires us to determine whether certain evidence that defendant sought to offer at his trial violated that rule. Defendant was charged with sexually abusing several minors, and, as part of his defense, sought to introduce expert testimony not only about established protocols for conducting interviews of minors, but also about whether interviews of two of the alleged victims were consistent with those protocols. We conclude that the proffered testimony did not violate the vouching rule and that the trial court's preclusion of that evidence was not harmless.

He explained that appropriate protocols include asking open-ended questions and avoiding leading, suggestive, and emotionally coercive questions.

Johnson did not testify about whether the interviewers in this case followed those protocols or asked appropriate questions when they interviewed GP and JN. Nor did he testify about the victims' answers to the interviewers' questions or expressly state an opinion about whether the victims' statements about what had happened to them were truthful. Following the presentation of evidence and the parties' closing arguments, the jury found defendant guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant appealed. He argued that the trial court had erred when it sustained the state's vouching objection and prohibited Johnson from testifying that aspects of the\n   interviews at issue were not conducted in accordance with established standards.

The question this case presents is whether Johnson's proposed testimony would have been tantamount to such direct statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We have stated before that \"it is not always easy to draw the line between an inadmissible statement that is tantamount to a direct comment on the credibility of a witness and an admissible statement that is relevant for a different reason but that tends to show that a witness is telling the truth.\"\n   <em>\n    Beauvais\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n    357 Or. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n    354 P.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both parties propose rules that, they argue, help separate statements that are tantamount to a direct comment on\n   the credibility of a witness from those that are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's rule is categorical: Testimony is tantamount to a direct comment on the credibility of a witness and must be excluded if it rests on the witness's opinion that another witness is truthful or untruthful and conveys that opinion to the factfinder; testimony that conveys information from which the factfinder can make an independent determination of truthfulness is not vouching, and, subject to the other rules of evidence, is admissible. Applied here, defendant argues that Johnson's proposed testimony was not predicated upon his belief or disbelief of GP's or JN's statements. In fact, defendant asserts, he did not intend to ask Johnson any questions about those victims' statements, conduct, or demeanor; instead, he intended to ask Johnson about whether the interviewers had appropriately conducted their interviews of GP and JN. That testimony, defendant urges, would have been relevant and helpful to the jury notwithstanding whether Johnson believed or disbelieved the statements that GP and JN made in response to the questions that they were asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In contrast, the state's rule casts the vouching inquiry as requiring a weighing process. The state proposes that, when an expert witness does not make a direct\n   statement about the credibility of another witness, but instead makes a statement that reflects an implicit opinion about that witness's credibility, a court must assess both the helpful effect of the evidence and the implicit opinion that inheres in it. A court may permit the implicit opinion if the primary effect of the evidence is helpful and sufficiently remote from the implicit credibility opinion. That analysis, the state argues, implicates the trial court's discretionary authority under OEC 702\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to assess the helpfulness of expert testimony and to balance (consistently with the principles established in OEC 403\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) the merits of the testimony against the risk that it will improperly influence the jury. Applied here, the state contends that the trial court did not err in deciding to preclude Johnson from providing the proffered testimony. The jury had been provided with the established protocols and could identify the breach of those protocols on its own, so Johnson's testimony was not particularly helpful. On the other side of the balance, permitting Johnson to connect the dots for the jury carried a risk of conveying an improper opinion about witness credibility. In that instance, the state contends, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting the testimony because the risk of improperly influencing the jury outweighed the minimal assistance that Johnson could provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As we will explain, both parties identify relevant questions that a court must address when considering the admissibility of expert testimony, but a trial court's determination of whether testimony violates the vouching rule is distinct from a determination of whether that testimony is permitted by the Oregon Evidence Code. As the trial court correctly understood, testimony that constitutes vouching is categorically inadmissible. Whether proffered testimony\n   constitutes impermissible vouching is measured by whether it conveys one witness's opinion of the truthfulness of another witness, or, instead, provides information that permits the jury to make that determination.

We explained that testimony that might be admissible when considered independently must be considered in context and, when so considered in that case, could not be separated from the related diagnoses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671650\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/346/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because, under\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   , it is OEC 403 and OEC 702 that make a diagnosis of sex abuse inadmissible when it is not based on physical evidence, it is logical to conclude that it also is those rules\n   of evidence that make testimony about the criteria used in such a diagnosis inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This court's discussion in\n   <em>\n    Beauvais\n   </em>\n   is consistent with that analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Beauvais\n   </em>\n   , this court concluded that, when a diagnosis of sexual abuse is admissible because it is adequately supported by physical evidence, testimony about the evaluative criteria underlying that diagnosis and the characteristics of the child that led to the diagnosis generally comports with the rules of evidence and is admissible.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n    357 Or. at 545-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n    354 P.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such testimony cannot, however, include \"a direct comment or a statement that is tantamount to stating that the child is telling the truth.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n    at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363939\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/524/#p543\">\n    354 P.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we understand\n   <em>\n    Beauvais\n   </em>\n   as recognizing a distinction between the rules of evidence, particularly those identified in\n   <em>\n    Southard\n   </em>\n   , and the vouching rule. An expert's opinion that reflects on the credibility of another witness must satisfy all evidentiary requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, when a party objects to testimony as improper vouching, a court must determine whether the testimony provides an opinion on truthfulness or, instead, provides a tool that the factfinder could use in assessing credibility. That determination does not necessarily require an assessment of whether that specific tool is permitted under the rules of evidence. For example, a court need not consider, as part of a vouching inquiry, whether expert testimony is sufficiently beyond the experience of a lay juror to meet the test of admissibility under OEC 702 and OEC 403. If a court determines that testimony constitutes vouching because it provides an opinion about the truthfulness of another witness and not information that could be helpful to jurors in forming their own opinions about that subject, the court must prohibit the testimony. If the testimony does not provide such an opinion, the court must then consider any other objections to the testimony that are raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Applying the foregoing to the evidence at issue here, Johnson's proposed testimony would not have provided jurors with his opinion on the truthfulness of GP or JN. Rather, Johnson's testimony would have identified the ways in which the interviews of GP and JN fell short of established interviewing protocols and would have provided information that\n   would have been helpful to the jury in assessing the credibility of those witnesses. The trial court erred in concluding that the testimony would have been impermissible vouching and in prohibiting it under that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As indicated, however, that does not necessarily mean that the testimony that the trial court precluded Johnson from relating was admissible. All testimony must meet the requirements of the Oregon Rules of Evidence, and the state contends that that portion of Johnson's testimony was inadmissible under OEC 702 and OEC 403. Specifically, the state argues that the trial court reasonably concluded that Johnson's proposed testimony about the interviewers' alleged shortcomings would provide little help to the jury while carrying a risk of conveying an improper opinion about witness credibility. For that reason, the state argues, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Johnson's testimony under those rules of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The record does not indicate, though, that the trial court ever exercised its discretion under OEC 702 and OEC 403.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an initial matter, the state's objection to Johnson testifying with respect to the specific interviews was that it would be an impermissible comment on the credibility of witnesses. And, the trial court made clear that it agreed with the state, ruling that Johnson could not talk about any specific interview because it would be \"commenting on the credibility of a witness.\" The trial court did state, as it finished its explanation for its ruling, that Johnson could testify to the established standards of interviews and that \"these jurors are smart enough-in fact, very smart folks, that they can-they can [tie] together whatever you need them to tie together.\" However, we cannot say that that amounted to a ruling that Johnson's proposed expert testimony was inadmissible under OEC 702.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2171499\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/292/388/#p391\">\n    292 Or. at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2171499\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/292/388/#p391\">\n    639 P.2d 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The test is not whether a jury is capable of drawing its own inferences from the evidence presented.

In fact, if anything, the trial court suggested that Johnson's testimony, at least generally, would be admissible under OEC 702 ; the court determined, and the parties agreed, that no OEC 104 hearing was necessary because, in the court's view, \"there's [not] going to be any issues whether [Johnson's testimony] is scientific\" and would meet all relevant requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, although the record suggests that the trial court identified the prejudicial effect of allowing Johnson to testify to the specific interviews-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it would get \"too close to comment on the credibility\"-the record does not support an inference that the trial court identified the probative value of that evidence or weighed it against the prejudicial effect it identified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

With respect to its first reason, the state contends that defendant took the position at trial that the allegations against him were fabricated for reasons unrelated to flaws in forensic interviewing. Thus, the state asserts, the principal question before the jury was whether it should give any credence to the victims' allegations of abuse, including allegations that were made before any forensic interviews were conducted. In that context, the state urges, there is little likelihood that the jury's ultimate conclusion would have been affected by Johnson's identification of potential flaws in those interviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The state is correct that defendant questioned the credibility of the victims' initial allegations of abuse, but his case was not so limited. Throughout trial, defendant consistently raised an issue with the quality of the state's investigation in its entirety. Defendant argued in opening statements that, although it was conducted with the best intentions, the investigation was not objective and law enforcement settled on defendant's guilt as soon as the first disclosure by GP was made. Defendant thoroughly questioned witnesses on those issues and drew the jury's attention to them in closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"It's not about a conspiracy.

How the government sculpted the flow of evidence in this case through its conduct, and only look at selective evidence that was consistent with the State's theory of guilt, and then of course appeal to your emotions, and ask you to find the defendant guilty.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Johnson's testimony was crucial to defendant's assertion that the conclusions that the state reached were not reliable, and the state is incorrect in its argument that his testimony did not relate to a central issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The second reason that the state advances to support its argument that the trial court's error was harmless also is unpersuasive. The state contends that Johnson's proposed testimony would have been cumulative of, and not qualitatively different than, evidence that defendant adduced from other witnesses. Specifically, the state argues that Johnson's general testimony about the appropriate interview protocols, including the kinds of questions that are permitted and the need to\n   explore secondary gain, fully equipped the jury to identify \"potential flaws\" in the forensic interviews of GP and JN. Having Johnson explicitly identify problematic portions of those interviews, the state posits, was unnecessary, especially considering that defendant repeatedly focused the jury's attention on those portions of the interviews throughout trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The state is correct that there was evidence from which the jury could have identified flaws in the forensic interviews of GP and JN. Defendant thoroughly questioned\n   the interviewers about questionable aspects of their respective interviews, and, in doing so, he highlighted their \"potential flaws.\" But those examinations did not yield any admissions that those aspects of the interviews were in fact problematic. Rather, the interviewers explained away or justified their techniques, or, at best, they minimized the significance of their errors. Although defendant's offer of proof was abbreviated, it informed the court that Johnson would not only identify established interview protocols but also would specify the deficiencies in the interviews that were conducted in this case. The interviewers' testimony did not fit that bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To be sure, the detective who interviewed JN acknowledged that interviews must be carefully constructed to avoid influence on the answers given, and that he had begun his interview with JN by telling him that it was important to hold defendant accountable and that the information JN had was important. The detective did not concede error, however; instead, he offered a justification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"[Beginning the interview that way] would be consistent in my behavior when I'm talking to any young person, or anybody whatsoever that is involved in a case, is just discussing how important what they have to tell me is, and reassuring them that, you know, I'm there to listen and what they have to say to me is important.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The detective also did the same thing in another exchange highlighted by the state. There, the detective acknowledged telling JN about \"classic defense strategies\" in these kinds of cases; but, when asked how defense strategies were relevant, he did not concede that that topic was improper. Instead, the detective again defended his approach:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Well, if it was toward the end of the interview and I didn't know how much more contact I would have with them, I'd like to do everything I could to prepare them for the difficulties of what might be ahead of them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Justification and defense of an interview is qualitatively different than expert testimony that the interview was flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Perhaps the exchange referenced by the state that best supports its argument that Johnson's testimony would have been duplicative is the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Counsel: \"Do you remember talking to [JN] that his coming forward and what he had to say could stop [defendant] from harming other kids?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Detective: \"I don't specifically recall those words, but-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Counsel: \"Would you agree that that concept or that kind of statement puts a lot of pressure and responsibility onto an 18- or 19-year-old?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Detective: \"It may.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Counsel: \"And of course, one of the things that pressure can do is it can influence people, can it not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Detective: \"Depending on the circumstances, possibly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Counsel: \"Do you recall sharing with [JN] relevant to [defendant] that, 'It's really important that we stop him?'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Detective: \"I don't recall those specific words, but it was very important for me, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Counsel: \"But you agree, you have a job, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Detective: \"Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Counsel: \"This wasn't about [JN's] job, right? [JN], in terms of whether or not he's a victim of a crime, it's not about his employment obligations, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Detective: \"That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Counsel: \"It's about what has or has not happened to him, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Detective: \"That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Counsel: \"It's not about what his social obligations or responsibilities are to society or the community, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Detective: \"[JN]'s social responsibilities are completely up to [him]. I cannot answer that question, Sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Counsel: \"And you would agree that it's not part of your job, when conducting a forensic interview or a first interview, to try and influence [JN] in terms of what his responsibilities are or are not, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Detective: \"No [that is not my job].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   But even the detective's acknowledgments in that discussion were not definitive. The detective testified only that such statements \"may\" put pressure on a teenager; it depended on the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considered as a whole, the detective's testimony suggests that he did not think such circumstances were present here. For example, when questioned by defense counsel about the use of leading-questions in an interview, the detective again stated that it depended on the circumstances whether their use was appropriate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Counsel: \"You have training about how to conduct an interview, do you not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Detective: \"Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Counsel: \"And * * * one of your goals is to ask reasonably open-ended questions so that you are not over-influencing an answer with your presuppositions or goals, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Detective: \"Based on circumstances, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Counsel: \"Well, is it ever appropriate for you to ask questions in a manner that shapes or sculpts the answer to be consistent with a presupposition or bias about what may have happened in your opinion? Is it ever appropriate to ask those kinds of questions of a critical witness as a detective?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Detective: \"Based upon-depending on the circumstances, sometimes that can happen. It's not ideal. But, yeah, sometimes it can happen. If you're trying to recap something that somebody has already gone over with you briefly, it's a difficult moment for them to explain it, sometimes you do ask leading questions to help them get through it, you know, especially if it's something that you're already previously aware of.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The detective also offered a similar justification when the prosecutor questioned him about the same topic:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Prosecutor: \"Open-ended questions, lots of talk about leading witnesses, you described some times in which leading witnesses would be appropriate. In your training and experience are-how might your concern be different about leading witnesses when you're dealing with teenagers, meaning 14 to 17-year-olds, as opposed to preschool ages?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Detective: \"There's a significant difference in the cognitive abilities of teenagers versus preschoolers or grade school children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Prosecutor: \"So would you be more likely as a detective to use leading questions when having a conversation with a teenager or a preschooler?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Detective: \"Much more likely with a teenager.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   And the detective justified his approach to the investigation when defense counsel questioned him about his investigation of GP's allegations. Defendant noted that when GP first officially disclosed defendant's abuse, he told his primary care provider that he was\n   upset with defendant because defendant had imposed dating restrictions on his daughter after discovering that she and GP had been intimate. Although the report containing that statement was available to the detective, neither the detective nor the CARES interviewer had attempted to obtain it or were aware of the notation. When questioned about that report, the detective acknowledged that such documentation can be important but testified that in this case it was not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Counsel: \"[I]sn't it important, Detective, when you get contextual information about potential bias, secondary gain or motive on the part of a complaining witness or victim, isn't it important when you have documentation both from the suspect and the alleged victim that addresses the same topic or the same potential motive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Detective: \"In some cases it can be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Counsel: \"Okay. In this case you didn't consider it to be important?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Detective: \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In all, we do not consider the detective's testimony to be an adequate substitute for Johnson's proposed testimony. The detective did not acknowledge that his statements or questions were problematic, and, when pressed on certain statements, he stated that their use would not be problematic under some circumstances. Particularly in light of the fact that the detective had testified that he had received training in how to conduct interviews and had experience in doing so, the jury may have given substantial weight to his explanations and relied on the answers that JN and GP gave in their interviews. Had Johnson been permitted to testify, he would have been able to point out the specific ways in which the detective failed to follow standard protocols and to explain whether deviations from those protocols were warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We also do not view Johnson's prospective testimony about GP's CARES interview as necessarily duplicative. The error that defendant identified in that interview was that the CARES interviewer did not fully explore the motives for GP's allegations, specifically that GP had expressed frustration with defendant's dating restrictions. Although the CARES interviewer acknowledged that she had not obtained the primary care provider's report containing that information and that she had not specifically explored whether GP was frustrated with defendant for interfering with GP's relationship with his daughter, she did not acknowledge that that mistake was significant. The CARES interviewer testified that she had generally explored the topic of secondary gain and that she was unsure that the primary care provider's report \"would have changed any of [her] interview with\" GP. Johnson could have testified about whether the interviewer should have proceeded differently in light of that report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In sum, we hold that Johnson's proposed testimony related to central issues in the case and would not have been cumulative of the evidence that defendant was able to adduce from other witnesses. Johnson would have testified to the specific instances in which the interviewers failed to follow established protocols. The interviewers did not acknowledge those deficiencies, and we therefore conclude that the trial court's failure to admit the proffered evidence was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

In support of defendant's theory, defendant cross-examined the detective and the CARES interviewer on those topics. Then, Johnson testified generally about the problems that leading and emotionally coercive questions pose for the reliability of interviews, including by offering hypothetical examples of problematic questions and statements. He further explained what \"secondary gain\" is and the importance of exploring it in interviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Our only source of understanding what additional testimony Johnson would have given but for the trial court's ruling is defendant's offer of proof, which defendant presented after cross-examining the detective and the CARES interviewer. The offer of proof identifies two discrete topics about which Johnson would have testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    What's already pretty much established\n   </em>\n   . The absence of exploration of alternative theories or secondary gain in the interview of [GP] relative to [JN].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \"The fact that the methodology used by [the detective in his interview of JN] involved not only leading questions, but suggestive questions, and to some degree, what an emotionally coercive question is.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Importantly, however, defendant-undoubtedly aware of the vouching issue-made broader representations about what Johnson would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    He will not be offering testimony on any bottom lines\n   </em>\n   . He will not be opining on the credibility of any witness or any victim or the defendant. He will not be talking about the results of any psychosexual evaluation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   (Emphasis added.) On review, defendant reiterates that Johnson \"in no way\" would have commented on the statements of JN and GP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Thus, we can discern from defendant's offer of proof that Johnson, after testifying about the importance of exploring secondary gain, would have testified that the CARES interviewer failed to do that, and, after testifying about the importance of not asking leading and emotionally coercive questions, would have testified that the detective did that. But Johnson would have avoided offering any \"bottom line\" conclusions about the impact on either victim's credibility. In short, the offer of proof permits the inference that Johnson would have done just two specific things: point out that the CARES interviewer did not explore secondary gain and highlight discrete parts of the detective's interview in which the detective asked questions and made statements that could be considered leading or emotionally coercive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   But the jury heard that evidence in other ways. With respect to the CARES interview of GP, defendant presented evidence in the form of medical records kept by GP's primary care provider indicating that GP had\n   disclosed abuse to GP's primary care provider more than a week before the CARES interview, and that the primary care provider's notes indicated that GP could have had a motive to try to achieve \"some other end\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   \"Now [GP] is upset at [defendant] because he is restricting access to his daughter, [A], after discovering [A] and [GP] had been intimate beyond what is allowed under family rules.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   On cross-examination, the CARES interviewer admitted that she had not reviewed the primary care provider's notes before evaluating GP and that the above-quoted entry was not something of which she was aware when she interviewed GP. The CARES interviewer then acknowledged that she had not asked GP whether he was angry that defendant was interfering with his relationship with defendant's daughter. Thus, in substance, the CARES interviewer admitted that she had not explored that theory of secondary gain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   That evidence is not qualitatively different than what Johnson would have said about the CARES interview,\n   at least as far as we can tell from the narrow offer of proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Bement\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571290\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/429/715/#p779\">\n    363 Or. 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571290\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/429/715/#p779\">\n    429 P.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (\"[E]ven when evidence relates to a central factual issue, its exclusion may be harmless if it is 'merely cumulative of,' instead of 'qualitatively different than,' evidence presented to the factfinder.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60666\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/19/#p34\">\n    336 Or. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60666\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/19/#p34\">\n    77 P.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)). Moreover, the state did not attempt to refute, either in redirect of the CARES interviewer or in closing argument, that GP's documented animus for defendant's dating restrictions would be the kind of secondary gain that should be explored in an interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   With respect to the detective's interview of JN, during cross-examination, the detective acknowledged the differences among open-ended, leading, and emotionally coercive questions, and agreed that it is important to ask open-ended questions so that the answer is not influenced or \"contaminated.\" After doing so, the detective acknowledged, among other things, that he told JN that coming forward could stop defendant from harming other kids, and that that statement \"may\" have put \"a lot of pressure and responsibility onto an 18- or 19-year old.\" The detective further conceded that, \"[d]epending on the circumstances,\" such pressure can \"influence people.\" A videotape of the detective's interview of JN was played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In light of the concessions that defendant elicited from the detective on cross-examination, it is not clear what the excluded testimony from Johnson would have added except for a kind of confirmation that the detective's interview had those features that the detective had already described in his own testimony. And, although the detective did not expressly admit that some other questions were \"leading\" questions, defendant had everything he needed to point out during his closing argument which questions and statements were leading or suggestive by Johnson's standards:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \"Detective Massey applied a lot of pressure in this case. And he certainly put a lot of pressure on [JN]. * * * Right at the start of the conversation, * * * Detective Massey says to\n   [JN], 'We really need your help. We need to hold this guy accountable.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   \"* * * And when you watch that [in the interview], say to yourself, '* * * Why is he starting out with a cheerleading alliance reference? An appeal to emotionality and double appeal to emotionality, why is he doing that if we're involved in a process that seeks facts and seeks the truth?'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \"Why does Detective Massey start out * * * 'We need to hold this guy accountable for his behavior.' Just look at that statement, and think of how emotionally laden it is. It creates a sense of responsibility for [JN], on multiple levels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   \"And then depending on what [JN's] predisposition social alliances [with the other victims and parties involved], issues with secondary gain may be. Think about how that emotionally coercive alliance approach can contaminate the production of evidence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The state made no attempt at trial to argue that the detective's interview did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include questions and statements that were leading, suggestive, and emotionally coercive. Nevertheless, the majority points to the detective's testimony that he believed that his use of certain questioning techniques in the JN interview was justified under the circumstances. The majority relies on that testimony to suggest that the exclusion of Johnson's additional testimony was prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   But that suggestion ignores the limited understanding of the excluded evidence that we can gain from defendant's narrow offer of proof, which does not allow an inference that Johnson would have\n   <em>\n    contested\n   </em>\n   the detective's assertion that, under the circumstances, his technique was justified. If anything, the offer of proof suggests the contrary, as it indicates that Johnson would have simply observed \"[w]hat's already pretty much established\"-that is, that the detective's interview had certain features-and that Johnson would have avoided any bottom line conclusions flowing from that observation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   On review, defendant himself has done little to develop an argument that the error was not harmless, other\n   than to point out that counsel's arguments are not evidence and that the jury might have been more likely to reach defendant's desired conclusions if there was evidence from an expert expressly drawing the same conclusions. To be sure, counsel's arguments are not evidence, and evidence perceived by lay jurors to be scientific in nature can tend to be more persuasive than other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Henley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568845\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/217/#p307\">\n    363 Or. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568845\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/217/#p307\">\n    422 P.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Here, however, the conclusions that defendant asked the jury to draw-that certain questions could be considered \"leading,\" \"suggestive,\" or \"coercive\" under the standards articulated by Johnson-were not especially scientific or complicated. From Johnson's clear explanations and hypotheticals, as well as the detective's own concessions on cross-examination, the jury could readily determine that the detective had asked potentially leading, suggestive, and coercive questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is little reason to think that additional testimony from Johnson-stating what, by that point, was plain and uncontested-would have caused the jury to reach a different verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   If, as the majority concludes, it is not harmless error for a trial court to preclude an expert from offering testimony that is as limited and unessential as this, it is difficult to imagine when an error in excluding testimony from any witness-either expert or lay-would ever be harmless.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.
