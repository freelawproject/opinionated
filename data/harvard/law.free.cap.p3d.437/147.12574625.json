We address the following dispositive issue on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Johnson's motion to excuse a prospective juror for cause?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Based on an alleged assault on May 29, 2014, the State of Montana charged Johnson with PFMA, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206(1)(a), MCA. During jury voir dire on the morning of trial, defense counsel informed the venire that a central fact dispute in the case would be whether Johnson was a \"partner\" as alleged by the State as an essential element of proof of PFMA. Counsel thus inquired of three prospective jurors whether they could vote \"not guilty\" if the State proved that Johnson assaulted the alleged victim but was unable to prove that she was his \"partner.\" All three generally responded that they could and would require the State to prove each essential element of the charged PFMA beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 However, the following colloquy later took place between defense counsel and prospective Juror S.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Prospective Juror: So you're telling me that ... the State has to prove that she is a partner and that he beat her up. If they can't prove that she's a partner or a girlfriend, is that what we're talking about? If they don't prove beyond a reasonable doubt, say, maybe they're just acquaintances, she isn't a partner,\n   they haven't had a relationship, then it's okay that he beat her up?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Defense counsel: No, I'm not saying that it's okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   What I'm asking you is, what if that was the case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Prospective Juror: If that was the case, I would have a hard time. Because if he truly beat her up, it makes no difference to me whether they were an acquaintance or they were-had a relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Defense counsel: Okay. Even if he's not charged with that? Even if you're-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Prospective Juror: I personally would probably have a problem with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Defense counsel: So you would find him guilty because he's a bad man, not because he did what they say he did?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Prospective Juror: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defense counsel later returned to prospective Juror S. and further inquired whether her work with assault victims at a local hospital would bias her against Johnson. After answering to the contrary and further opining that she thought her work experience would actually make her a better juror because she would not be shocked by photographs of gruesome injuries, prospective Juror S. spontaneously reiterated her previously stated problem with requiring the State to prove that the alleged victim was the Defendant's \"partner,\" to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Defense counsel: You think you'd be better as a juror with your background?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Prospective Juror: Probably. But I do have a problem with the partner aspect of it all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Prospective Juror S. later unequivocally stated her problem yet a third time when generally asked by defense counsel if she could be fair and objective:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   No, I don't know. I have a real problem with, if he beat the girl up, it makes no difference to me. I didn't realize ... there was such a thing as [PFMA]-that distinction. That would be a problem for me. If he beat her up, I think he should be punished, whether she was a partner or an acquaintance. ... And I would have a hard time with my decision. I would try to not let that affect me, but I just truthfully think it would.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b65 Defense counsel then challenged prospective Juror S. for cause. After the State sought and obtained leave to further voir dire her prior to the court's ruling, the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Prosecutor: Ms. [S.], you've given answers that it would be difficult for you. Would it be impossible for you to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defense counsel: I'd object. I don't think impossibility is the standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   District Court: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Prosecutor: ... I'll withdraw it-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   District Court: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Prosecutor: -and go a different route. Difficulty notwithstanding, have you had to make decisions that were difficult for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Prospective Juror: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Prosecutor: Are you willing to set aside your-any difficulty that you have if the Judge orders you to follow the instruction that the State must prove all elements of the crime?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Prospective Juror: Say it again, please.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Prosecutor: If the Judge orders you to follow the jury instructions, will you follow the jury instructions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Prospective Juror: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Prosecutor: And if the jury instructions include that the State must prove that the victim was a partner, will you follow that instruction even if that is difficult for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Prospective Juror: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The District Court thus summarily denied Johnson's challenge of prospective Juror S. for cause. Johnson then used his first peremptory challenge to strike Juror S. from the panel and subsequently exhausted all of his remaining peremptory challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b66 At the close of trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. At the subsequent sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Johnson as a persistent felony offender to a 20-year term of commitment to the Montana State Prison, consecutive to his sentence in a\n   parallel-pending case independently appealed to this Court. Johnson timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b67 We review district court denials of challenges of prospective jurors for cause for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

She twice stated emphatically that \"it makes no difference to me\"-if the defendant \"beat her up,\" then \"he should be punished\" regardless of whether the victim was his partner or merely an acquaintance. In her final spontaneous statement, the prospective juror candidly stated that she \"would try to not let\" her desire for punishment of all assaults \"affect\" her, \"but I just truthfully think it would.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b615 For whatever reason, the State chose to charge Johnson with PFMA rather than assault. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt\n   that the alleged victim was a \"partner\" of the accused, as defined by\n   \u00a7 45-5-206(2)(b), MCA, was an essential element of the State's burden of proof of the charged offense of PFMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 26-1-403(2), 45-5-206(2)(b), MCA. The prospective juror's multiple spontaneous statements were consistent, clear, unequivocal, and emphatic-she would likely be unable or unwilling to set her personal view and bias aside and vote for acquittal if the State proved that Johnson assaulted the alleged victim but was unable to prove that she was his \"partner.\" The record clearly and unequivocally manifests that the prospective juror would likely be unable or unwilling to follow the court's jury instructions due to her strongly-held personal bias that, if he assaulted the alleged victim, Johnson should be punished regardless of whether the victim was his \"partner\" or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b616 When faced with the prospective juror's unequivocal bias, whether because it would have been futile or for another reason, the State made no attempt to use open-ended questions to allow the prospective juror to clarify or allay the obvious problem with her patently biased responses. Rather, precisely as we have repeatedly warned against, the State followed up with a series of leading and loaded questions which squarely put the prospective juror in the position of either having to acquiesce to those questions or state her intent to defy the court and the law. Not too surprisingly, the juror acquiesced. In coaxed, single-syllable answers, she answered \"yes,\" she would follow the court's order and jury instructions. This is a clear, if not quintessential, case of a prospective juror clearly and unequivocally manifesting a serious question as to whether she could be fair and impartial, followed by a recantation improperly coaxed by leading and loaded questions that would otherwise have required the juror to defy the court and the law.

Rather than an attempt to find jurors who do not hold any opinions, jury selection is about finding jurors who respect the process and understand that it requires them to apply the law as provided in the instructions impartially. Thus, educating jurors about the process and dispelling honest misconceptions they may hold is a proper function of voir dire, and should not be viewed as alarming or disqualifying.

For example, the state could have explained that prosecutors must determine the appropriate charges to bring, that they make that decision based upon many factors beyond a jury's consideration, and, here, prosecutors decided to bring this particular charge. Given that, the juror could have been asked whether she understood the trial was about a particular charge, and whether she could explain, in light of her expressed opinions, if she would be able to undertake the process of assessing whether the State had proved the elements of that particular charge. Granted, these questions may touch on areas the prosecution would rather not discuss, but the state could use other kinds of probing questions, or opt not to attempt rehabilitation at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b621 I concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
