He now argues Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 28-1383(A)(3) (2019) required the State to prove he knew his passenger was younger than 15 and that the superior court erred by failing to so instruct the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold the defendant's knowledge of the passenger's age is not an element of the offense and affirm the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Gomez crashed his car while driving a 14-year-old girl home from a party one night. He did not know the girl well and did not know how old she was. At the scene, police found a bottle of pills in Gomez's car and he admitted smoking marijuana earlier in the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 As relevant here, Gomez was charged with two counts of aggravated driving while under the influence (\"DUI\") with a passenger under 15 years of age, each a Class 6 felony. A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3). Before trial, Gomez asked the superior court to instruct the jury that the State must prove he knew his passenger was younger than 15. The court declined to give the instruction, and the jury convicted him of both charges, along with four other felony offenses. The superior court sentenced him on the DUI offenses to two concurrent one-year terms of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Gomez timely appealed, challenging only his convictions under \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3). We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2019), 13-4031 (2019) and -4033(A)(1) (2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Gomez argues \u00a7 28-1383 required the State to prove he knew his passenger was younger than 15 at the time he committed the DUI offenses.

Gomez argues children under 15 are most likely to be driven around by their parents, who of course will know how old they are. That may be usually so, but as this case shows, not everyone who transports a child \"necessarily\" knows whether the child is younger than 15.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-202(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Gomez argues we should imply a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement in \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3) because the provision was enacted after our supreme court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   in 1985. The legislature enacted the predecessor to \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3) in 1996, and the following year, moved it to its current location in the code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1996 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 76, \u00a7 29 (2d Reg. Sess.); 1997 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 108, 112 (1st Reg. Sess.). We cannot infer that when the legislature enacted the subsection at issue without specifying a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement, it knew or expected from\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   that courts would require the prosecution to prove a culpable mental state. The opposite conclusion is just as likely: The legislature might have concluded that because the youthful-passenger provision came with none of the notice guarantees the court identified in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , consistent with \u00a7 13-202(B), courts would refrain from implying a mental-state requirement when the statute omitted one. This is particularly so, given\n   that lawmakers knew of the mandate of \u00a7 13-202, which was enacted in 1977, when they first adopted \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

P. 15.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 By contrast to \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3) and the other statutes at issue in \u00b6 13, the legislature has been clear elsewhere when it means to require the State to prove the defendant knew the victim was a minor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3212(B)(2) (2019) (\"A person who is at least eighteen years of age commits child sex trafficking by knowingly: ... Engaging in prostitution with a minor who the person knows or should have known is fifteen, sixteen or seventeen years of age.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1204(A)(8)(a) (2019) (aggravated assault of victim the defendant \"know[s] or ha[s] reason to know\" is a peace officer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 In sum, the plain language of \u00a7 28-1383(A)(3) does not state a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element, and we \"assum[e] that the legislature has said what it means.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999022\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/280/#p283\">\n    214 Ariz. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283, \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3999022\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/280/#p283\">\n    151 P.3d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1264 (App. 2007) (quotation omitted). Further, applying \u00a7 13-202(B), the crime does not \"necessarily\" involve a culpable mental state. Accordingly, we conclude the State did not need to prove Gomez knew his victim was under 15, and the superior court did not err in denying Gomez's requested jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 For the above reasons, we affirm Gomez's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Absent material revision after the date of an alleged offense, we cite the current version of a statute or rule.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
