Kepfield, of Hutchinson, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 1989.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 3, 2015, the court suspended respondent's license to practice law for a period of one year for violating Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). Imposition of that discipline was suspended and respondent was placed on supervised probation for a period of three years. See\n   <em>\n    In re Kepfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417906\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/662/#p670\">\n    301 Kan. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 670,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417906\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/662/#p670\">\n    346 P.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 14, 2018, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against respondent alleging new violations of the KRPC. On March 29, 2018, the respondent timely filed an answer to the formal complaint. In his answer, the respondent generally admitted to violations of KRPC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 11, 2018, the Disciplinary Administrator filed a motion with this court to revoke respondent's three-year supervised probation. Thereafter, the chairperson of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys entered an order consolidating the motion to revoke respondent's probation with the pending formal complaint. See Rule 211(g)(10) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 8, 2018, the hearing panel called the consolidated\n   matters. Respondent appeared in person and by counsel. Before the hearing began, respondent stipulated to certain facts and rule violations alleged against him in the formal complaint. Specifically, respondent stipulated his conduct violated KRPC 1.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 289) (competence); 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.4 (2018 S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.15(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (terminating representation); and 8.4(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). Because the respondent admitted to rule violations, the panel heard evidence on the merits of the formal complaint and motion to revoke probation as well as evidence in aggravation and mitigation at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although respondent stipulated to violating KRPC 1.1 and 1.4, after hearing additional evidence, the panel concluded respondent did not violate these rules. Further, the panel concluded respondent did not violate KRPC 3.1 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 343) (meritorious claims and contentions) and 3.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 344) (candor toward the tribunal). Accordingly, these four allegations were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A majority of the hearing panel determined respondent violated KRPC 1.3 and 1.16(d). The panel unanimously determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.15(a) ; 8.1(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (false statement in\n   connection with disciplinary matter); and 8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the hearing panel concluded the respondent violated certain Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in the formal complaint, the panel determined respondent violated certain terms and conditions of his current probation plan. See Rule 211(g)(11) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the hearing, the panel made the following detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"8.

On or about January 7, 2016, Respondent was appointed by Reno County District Court Judge Timothy Chambers, to represent [E.S.], in the appeal of District Court Case No. 2008-CR-492 (Appeal Case No. 114,55), wherein the\n   district court summarily dismissed [E.S.]'s post-conviction motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   '6.

Respondent did not tell [E.S.]: (1) that he would file the petition for [E.S.]; (2) that [E.S.] needed to let him know if [E.S.] wanted to petition for review; or (3) what would happen if [E.S.] did not let him know one way or another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   '9. On September 19, 2016, [E.S.] sent a \"Notice of Intent [to] Petition for Review\" (\"notice\") to the Kansas Appellate Court Clerk's office. The notice stated that [E.S.] wanted to pursue review. The notice also contained allegations critical to respondent and [E.S.]'s prior attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   '10. Respondent received [E.S.]'s notice on September 23, 2016, three days before the deadline for filing a petition for review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   '11. On September 23, 2016, Respondent sent [E.S.] a letter stating, \"I take it that by filing a notice pro se, combined with your motion to have me removed as appellate counsel for your latest post-conviction motion, you do not wish me to file a petition for review.

On October 31, 2016, Respondent sent a responsive letter wherein\n   he stated that prior to sending [E.S.] the September 23, 2016 letter, he met with Sarah McKinnon, his probation supervisor. Respondent further alleged: \"She read [E.S.'s notice] and agreed that it appeared that Mr. [E.S.] wished to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . She advised me to write him a letter, and inform Mr. [E.S.] that since he wished to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , my involvement was apparently at an end.\" Respondent further alleged that McKinnon strongly suggested that he write such a letter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   '19. McKinnon was subsequently contacted by the Disciplinary Administrator's Office.

McKinnon stated that had she known of the deadline, she would not\n   have approved of the letter; but would have instead informed Respondent that he needed to file the petition for review.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"15. In addition to the facts contained in the stipulation, it is also relevant that on August 16, 2016, E.S. filed a motion to remove the respondent as counsel of record.

On August 16,\n   2016, by filing a motion to have the respondent removed as counsel of record, E.S. made it clear to the respondent that he no longer desired the respondent's representation. At that point, diligent representation required the respondent to file a motion to withdraw.

As such, the Clerk of the Appellate Courts could not accept E.S.'s\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for review filed on September 19, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5.09(1)(d). Finally, the respondent's lack of diligence caused E.S. to lose his chance to have the Kansas Supreme Court review the Kansas Court of Appeals' decision. At the hearing on this matter, the\n   respondent argued that there was little likelihood that E.S. would have received any relief from the petition for review. The respondent's misconduct is not diminished by the respondent's belief that the petition for review had little likelihood of success. What E.S. lost was his opportunity to present his case to the Kansas Supreme Court for review. Because the respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his client, a majority of the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated Rule 1.3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \" Rule 1.16\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \"21.

First, when an attorney is discharged, the attorney must withdraw from the representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 1.16(a)(3). Clearly, E.S. did not want the respondent to continue to represent him. After E.S. filed his August 16, 2016, motion to remove the respondent as counsel of record, the respondent should have filed a motion to withdraw from the representation. The respondent failed to do so. The respondent's failure to file a motion to withdraw from the representation precluded E.S.'s ability to file pleadings on his own behalf.

Respondent was also given adequate notice of the hearing before the panel and the hearing before this court. He filed no exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing report. With no exceptions before us, the panel's findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255). Furthermore, the evidence before the hearing panel establishes the charged misconduct in violation of KRPC 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence); 1.15(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (terminating representation); 8.1(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (false statement in connection with disciplinary matter); and 8.4(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) by clear and convincing evidence and supports the panel conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   We adopt all of the panel's findings and conclusions except for the finding in \u00b6 35c that respondent violated KRPC 1.4 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication) as this allegation had been dismissed by the hearing panel. Accordingly, we find respondent violated his existing probation plan by again violating the KRPC during his probationary period. See Rule 211(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. At the hearing before this court, at which respondent appeared, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. The hearing panel recommended that respondent be suspended for three years from the practice of law, that after six months of that suspension, respondent be placed on a three-year probation subject to the terms and conditions of his previous probation plan with two additional terms and conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The panel's recommendation is advisory and does not prevent this court from imposing a greater or lesser punishment.\n   <em>\n    In re Harrington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416811\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/380/#p387\">\n    296 Kan. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416811\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/380/#p387\">\n    293 P.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (citing Supreme Court Rule 212 [f] ). In determining the appropriate sanction, this court considers the facts and circumstances of the case as well as aggravating and mitigating factors.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416811\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/380/#p387\">\n    296 Kan. at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416811\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/296/380/#p387\">\n    293 P.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   After carefully balancing the aggravating factors with the mitigating factors, the court determines the motion to revoke respondent's probation should be granted and the original one-year suspension from the practice of law should be reinstated. After respondent serves this one-year suspension, the court accepts the panel's recommendation that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for three years, that after six months of that suspension the respondent be placed on a three-year probation subject to the terms of his previous probation plan, plus the two new conditions recommended by the hearing panel. A minority of this court would impose the harsher sanction recommended by the Disciplinary Administrator of indefinite suspension from the practice of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   In summary, respondent's total suspension from the practice of law is for 18 months followed by a three-year supervised probation. During respondent's probationary period he must comply with the probation terms set forth in the hearing panel's final report, \u00b6 43, including new terms 23 and 24. See Supreme Court Rule 211(g)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Sam S. Kepfield be and is hereby ordered to serve his original one-year suspension from the\n   practice of law followed by a three-year suspension from the practice of law.
