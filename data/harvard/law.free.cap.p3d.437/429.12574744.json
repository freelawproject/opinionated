After trial, Newton obtained new counsel and filed a motion to arrest judgment and for a new trial (the Motion for New Trial), claiming a jury instruction error, a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation related to Victim's cell phone, and four instances of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The district court denied the Motion for New Trial. We agree with the district court that there was no error in the jury instruction, that the State did not commit a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, and that the evidence on Victim's phone was neither material nor exculpatory. Because Newton fails to address the district court's ruling on the remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we decline to address them on appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Victim attended a party at a friend's house where she met Newton and his girlfriend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Everyone at the party had been consuming alcohol. Victim spoke with Newton at the party but felt uncomfortable around him, at first, and told him that she thought \"he was weird and creepy.\" But he was \"nice after that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The party continued through the early morning hours of the following day. At around 3:00 a.m., Newton asked Victim if she wanted to leave and get something to eat. Victim agreed, stating that she \"didn't want to fall asleep\" because she was waiting for her boyfriend. Newton first drove Victim to a fast food restaurant where Newton ordered food. He then drove Victim to a truck stop and parked in a dark part of the parking lot, away from other vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Newton and Victim listened to music for a while, and then he exited the vehicle, opened Victim's door, leaned her seat back, and got on top of her. Victim testified that she did not say anything at first but thought to herself, \"What's going on.\" Newton \"[f]orcibly\" removed all of Victim's clothing and undergarments while she was \"screaming and crying and pushing him.\" Newton put his\n   hand around her neck and choked her to the point that she felt she was \"going to lose consciousness\" and then raped her. He first penetrated his penis into her vagina and then attempted to penetrate his penis into her anus but was unsuccessful because she \"freaked out even more.\" Newton then grabbed a gun, held it to her head, and continued to rape her vaginally while she \"cr[ied] quietly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At one point, Victim said she needed to throw up. After Newton rolled down the window, she attempted to make loud retching noises to get the attention of anyone who might be nearby. She did not try to scream or call for help while the window was rolled down, because she feared that Newton would shoot her. Victim's efforts to summon assistance were unsuccessful. After ejaculating, Newton returned to the driver's side of the vehicle and Victim dressed. Newton drove away from the truck stop and told Victim that \"he had to make a phone call to a friend to see if he had to kill [her] or not.\" When he slowed down at a red light, Victim jumped out and ran barefoot to the nearest neighborhood she could find, leaving her cell phone in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Victim eventually arrived at a gas station where a man offered to help by giving her a ride. Although Victim did not know the man, Victim felt \"scatterbrained\" and \"needed help,\" so she accepted his offer, and he drove her to her friend's house. When Victim arrived at the friend's house the police were already there. Victim explained to an officer that Newton raped her and threatened her with a gun. The officer told her to go to the hospital for a sexual assault examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 During the examination, the sexual assault nurse examiner (Nurse) swabbed Victim's vagina, mouth, and belly button to collect DNA, which matched Newton's DNA. Nurse also took photographs of Victim's body. One photograph revealed a petechia-redness of the skin caused by pressure, either sucking or pushing-on Victim's trachea, which is an injury \"consistent with strangulation.\" The other photographs included: three injuries on Victim's breasts and one on the front of a shoulder, marked by redness and a petechia ; a bruise on the inside of an elbow and one on a forearm; numerous bruises and a petechia on her thighs; bruises on her knees and an ankle; and a blister on her heel\"from walking barefoot after the assault.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nurse also examined Victim's genital injuries and noted bruises and an open abrasion in and around her labia. At trial, Nurse testified that there was also a \"little chunk of skin\" missing in a location where \"[a]nybody who had [sustained] an injury like that consensually would be [the result of] an accident and ... [i]ntercourse would be stopped by the woman because it would be very painful.\" Nurse also testified that the injuries could be \"consistent with non-consensual intercourse,\" but she also conceded that \"regardless of how careful you are, there can be some sort of injuries sometimes during consensual intercourse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Newton testified in his defense at trial. He said that, at the party, Victim \"asked [him] if [he] wanted to go get something to eat.\" He agreed and escorted her to his car where he \"checked for [his] concealed carry [gun] because [he] wouldn't want it to be missing and be used in a possible crime.\" Newton kept his gun in a safe under his seat that requires a \"four to six entry combination\" to open. He then drove Victim to a fast food restaurant. After picking up his order, they returned to his car and he started to drive away. He testified that when he \"reached back to put [his] hand on [her] headrest,\" she put her hand on his leg and \"proceeded to move her hand up ... [and] started to undo [his] pants.\" Newton decided to pull over into a parking lot. Victim began to stroke his penis and then they started to kiss. According to Newton, Victim \"climbed over on top of [him] in the driver's seat\" and they removed their clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 According to Newton, while engaging in sexual intercourse, Victim bumped the horn on the steering wheel, and they both agreed to move to the passenger seat. Newton described different sexual positions they used,\n   including being on top of and behind Victim. At one point, Victim said she needed to throw up. Newton rolled down the window and heard some retching noises after which Victim said she felt fine. He testified they both put their clothes back on after having sex and he drove Victim to her house. Newton testified that Victim \"passed out\" during the drive. When he got to her house, he left Victim sitting on a wooden bench on the porch. He also testified that he never removed the gun from the safe and the only time Victim could have seen it was when he \"opened the safe to check\" that it was still there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The jury convicted Newton of one count of first-degree aggravated sexual assault and one count of third-degree aggravated assault. He was acquitted of a second count of first-degree aggravated sexual assault and one count of first-degree aggravated kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Following the convictions, Newton hired new counsel who filed the Motion for New Trial. Newton argued that his original trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to the jury instruction defining rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also argued that the State committed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation when it did not conduct a forensic examination of Victim's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 The court first addressed the jury instruction claim. The jury was instructed that to convict Newton of aggravated sexual assault, the jury was required to find:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. The defendant, BRIAN NEWTON,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. In the course of committing rape,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3. Did any one of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a. Used, or threated [Victim] with the use of, a dangerous weapon, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   b. Compelled, or attempted to compel, [Victim] to submit to rape, by threat of kidnapping, death, or serious bodily injury to be inflicted imminently on any person; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   4. The defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The next instruction read: \" 'Rape' as defined in the law means the actor knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly has sexual intercourse with another without that person's consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 Newton argued that\n   <em>\n    State v. Barela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868943\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/676/\">\n    2015 UT 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868943\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/676/\">\n    349 P.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"compel[led the] court to find [his] trial counsel ineffective for failing to object to the jury instruction given on the elements of the crime of Rape because [it] did not clearly establish the requirement of mens rea as to [Victim's] non consent.\" But the court disagreed, distinguishing the rape instruction in\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   from the instruction given at Newton's trial. It explained that, because the instruction was one sentence long and the terms \"knowingly, intentionally or recklessly ... immediately precede[d] words describing the prohibited conduct, sexual intercourse with another person without that person's consent,\" \"[t]here [was] no room for the jury to imply a difference between the act of intercourse and the non-consent of [Victim].\" Accordingly, the court concluded that trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the instruction and that the district court did not commit plain error when it gave the rape instruction to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 The court also considered Newton's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim. In support of his argument that the State committed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, Newton directed the court to his pretrial motion for access to Victim's cell phone \"for the purpose of a forensic examination,\" asserting that the cell phone \"may have exculpatory evidence contained within it\" and may undermine the jury's verdict. The State opposed the motion, arguing that \"the State is not aware of evidence contained on the phone that 'tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the guilt of the defendant, or mitigate\n   the degree of the offense for reduced punishment.' \" (Quoting Utah R. Crim. P. 16(a)(4).) The State further noted that Newton did not show \"good cause\" to authorize the search of Victim's cell phone because the motion was based on Newton's \"naked belief that the phone 'may have exculpatory evidence contained within it.' \" (Quoting Utah R. Crim. P. 16(a)(5).) The police did not conduct a forensic examination of Victim's cell phone, but the State provided trial counsel with the \"call and text records\" obtained from it. Following the Motion for New Trial, the court determined that the content of the phone and its condition when found were relevant to Newton's post-trial claims and ordered a \"full forensic examination of the cell phone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 The forensic analysis revealed that Victim entered Newton's name and cell phone number into her phone at around 3:09 a.m., shortly after they left the party and prior to the rape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also revealed a \"series of phone calls and text messages that were received\" during the period between their departure from the party and the rape. Following an evidentiary hearing, the court determined that the cell phone evidence was neither material nor exculpatory, because the jury could have interpreted it to mean that Victim had \"no bias\" against Newton prior to the rape, and because the \"information found on the phone also corroborated the testimony that friends were trying to reach [Victim] for hours without success.\" The court concluded that the \"evidence found on [Victim's] phone post-trial was unlikely to have affected the verdict\" given that \"the evidence against [Newton] was substantial\" and that the forensic examination of the cell phone corroborated Victim's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 The court therefore denied the Motion for New Trial. Newton appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 Newton contends the \"jury was improperly instructed regarding the mens rea element of rape\" and asks this court to review this issue for plain error, manifest injustice, and ineffective assistance of counsel. Newton raised this issue before the district court in the Motion for New Trial, based on the ineffective assistance of counsel. We therefore review Newton's argument only to the extent he challenges the district court's ruling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The court held evidentiary hearings on these allegations and issued an order denying Newton's motion, supported with findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 On appeal, Newton makes the same three arguments, without challenging the court's findings of fact or conclusions of law. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But Newton does not raise these issues for the first time on appeal. Instead, he asserts the same arguments that the district court ruled on.

He argues that the court erred in determining the rape instruction was correct because the instruction was one sentence that did not separate the mens rea from the acts required to commit rape. The instruction read: \" 'Rape' as defined in the law means the actor knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly has sexual intercourse with another without that person's consent.\" He asserts that the instruction did not provide that \"knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly\" applied\n   to \"the element of non-consent\" and counsel should therefore have objected to it.

The application of the required culpable mental state of \"intent, knowledge, or recklessness\" to section 76-5-402's definition of rape results in the rape instruction provided to the jury. We are therefore unpersuaded by Newton's argument that, because \"the jury was not law-trained,\" \"it [was] unrealistic for counsel, or the court, to assume that the jury would know based on the one sentence instruction, that mens rea was also required for the element of non-consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b627 To further support our conclusion that the jury instruction properly informed the\n   jury of the necessary elements of rape, we refer to the jury instruction for rape given in\n   <em>\n    State v.

It further explained that, under the Utah Code, the defendant could not be convicted of rape unless he acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The rape instruction therefore \"accurately identified each element of the crime of rape and correctly stated the applicable mental state\" because the jury was instructed that to convict the defendant of rape it \"must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly had nonconsensual sexual intercourse with [the victim].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b628 The jury instruction in Newton's case is more similar to the instruction provided in\n   <em>\n    Marchet\n   </em>\n   than to the one provided in\n   <em>\n    Barela\n   </em>\n   . In addition, it is even less likely that the jury in Newton's case misinterpreted the elements necessary to find that he raped Victim than the jury in\n   <em>\n    Marchet\n   </em>\n   . Rather than providing the culpable mental state as a catch-all at the end of the instruction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21, Newton's instruction seamlessly provided that the applicable mens rea applied to both the act of sexual intercourse and Victim's non-consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b629 We agree with the district court that there was no error in the jury instruction and therefore there was \"no room for the jury to imply a difference between the act of intercourse and the non-consent of [Victim].\" As a result, any objection on trial counsel's part would have been futile and Newton's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the jury instruction fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   II.

Crim. P. 16(a)(4).) The State further argued that Newton did not show \"good cause\" to authorize the search of Victim's cell phone because the motion was based on Newton's \"naked belief that the phone may have exculpatory evidence contained within it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Crim. P. 16(a)(5). And at a post-trial evidentiary hearing, the prosecutor testified that he \"had no idea of anything that was on the phone,\" either inculpatory or exculpatory, and that he never directed anyone to \"look into what was on the phone.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b634 The prosecutor therefore did not have knowledge of the forensic evidence of the cell phone, and the record does not reflect that Newton elicited evidence that the prosecutor or any other individual working for the State should have known there was exculpatory evidence on the cell phone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kyles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p433\">\n    514 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339057\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/419/#p433\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that prosecutors have \"a duty to learn of any favorable evidence\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police\" (emphasis added) ). And none of the cases Newton cites require the prosecution to \"seek out\" exculpatory information unknown to it or any others acting on its behalf. We therefore reject Newton's argument that, \"once the police were in possession of [Victim's] cell phone, ... the State had a constitutional obligation to seek out any evidence that was on the phone, regardless of whether it thought that the phone would contain anything of value.\" We conclude that the State did not commit a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation when it did not independently conduct a forensic examination of Victim's cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b635 Second, Newton argues that the district court erred when it determined that the evidence collected from Victim's cell phone was not material and exculpatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b636 The district court determined that the evidence on Victim's cell phone was relevant to Newton's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. It therefore granted Newton's post-trial motion to discover Victim's cell phone and ordered a forensic examination to determine whether it contained exculpatory evidence. The examination revealed that Victim entered Newton's name and cell phone number into her phone after leaving the party, but prior to the rape, and that her phone received a series of unanswered phone calls and text messages. The court concluded this evidence was the information was not material and exculpatory and was \"unlikely to have affected the verdict,\" because it could show only that Victim had \"no bias\" against Newton prior to the rape, and it corroborated Victim's account that her friends unsuccessfully attempted to contact her during the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b637 Newton challenges this conclusion. He relies on the assertion that the evidence that Victim entered his phone number into her cell phone just before the rape undermined her credibility because she testified that he was \"weird and creepy.\" But Victim also testified on direct and cross-examination that after telling Newton that she thought he was \"weird and creepy,\" \"he was nice after that.\" In addition, Newton fails to explain how entering his phone number before the rape\n   would have \"provided circumstantial evidence of consent.\" We therefore conclude the district court did not err in denying the Motion for New Trial after determining that the evidence on Victim's cell phone was not material and exculpatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b638 We conclude that because the jury instruction defining rape accurately articulated the elements of the crime, any objection to the instruction would have been futile and Newton therefore cannot show ineffective assistance of counsel. We further conclude the State did not commit a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation, because it did not have knowledge that the cell phone may have contained exculpatory evidence.
