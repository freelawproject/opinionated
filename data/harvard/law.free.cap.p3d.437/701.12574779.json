PDA assigned her to represent \"Mr. Smith\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on a charge of felony stalking. During the representation, Smith began making frequent, unwanted, and inappropriate phone calls to LaRose at work. LaRose notified her supervisors, but she decided to continue to represent Smith and her supervisors did not remove her from the case. After the representation ended, Smith's harassing and stalking behavior escalated until he was arrested and charged for his conduct. LaRose subsequently was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was placed on disability, and ultimately was discharged from employment because she was unable to work as a public defender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 LaRose filed a lawsuit against PDA and the County, alleging among other claims that her supervisors' handling of the situation with Smith had created a hostile work environment in violation of the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), chapter 49.60 RCW, that PDA and the County were negligent in failing to protect her from Smith's harassment, that PDA and the County deliberately\n   injured her, and that the County discriminated against her based on her disability. The trial court dismissed the hostile work environment claim under CR 12(b)(6) and granted summary judgment in favor of PDA and the County on LaRose's remaining claims. LaRose appeals those rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Before dismissing LaRose's claims, the trial court ruled on summary judgment that the County was vicariously liable for PDA's conduct. The County cross-appeals that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 We hold that (1) the trial court erred in dismissing LaRose's WLAD claim because under certain circumstances, an employer may be subject to liability for a hostile work environment claim based on a nonemployee's harassment of an employee in the workplace; (2) the trial court erred in ruling that the Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), title 51 RCW, bars LaRose's negligence claims because a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether her PTSD and related injuries constituted a compensable \"injury\" under the IIA; (3) LaRose did not present evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact that the IIA bar is inapplicable under RCW 51.24.020 based on her allegation that PDA and the County deliberately injured her; and (4) LaRose's disability discrimination claim fails because she did not present evidence that created a genuine issue of material fact regarding that claim. In addition, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling that the County is vicariously liable for PDA's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order dismissing LaRose's hostile work environment claims and negligence claims, but we affirm the trial court's order dismissing LaRose's disability discrimination claim. And we reverse the trial court's ruling that the County is vicariously liable for PDA's conduct. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 PDA operated as The Defender Association (TDA) and served as a contracted non-profit public defense law firm for the County from 1969 to June 30, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July 2013, the County ended its contract with PDA and began directly administering the public defense program. Most PDA employees, including LaRose, became County employees effective July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 LaRose was employed by PDA as an attorney public defender beginning in 2009. She began her first rotation in the felony division in July 2012. While at PDA, LaRose did not receive any training, policies, or procedures\n   for responding to sexual harassment or threats of violence from clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Prior Smith Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 In June 2012, PDA public defender Rebecca Lederer was representing Smith on a felony stalking charge. Smith left Lederer a voicemail in which he repeatedly said that he loved her. Lederer asked her supervisor, Daron Morris, for permission to withdraw from Smith's case and for the case to be reassigned because she felt uncomfortable representing Smith. Morris recommended that the case be reassigned to another attorney because there was a good reason to believe that Smith would have trouble maintaining the proper professional boundary with his attorney if Lederer continued to represent him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Lederer chose to withdraw and suggested that Smith be reassigned to a male attorney. Morris transferred the case to a male attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Smith's Harassment of LaRose\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 On October 31, 2012, LaRose was assigned to represent Smith on a new charge of felony stalking. LaRose was\n   not given any information about Smith's history of stalking professional women or his interaction with Lederer and was not warned of any potential danger in representing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 In late March 2013, during LaRose's representation, Smith began to make repeated sexually motivated, harassing phone calls to LaRose at work. Smith told LaRose that he loved her, wanted to marry her, and wanted to be with her. By April, Smith was calling LaRose 10 to 20 times a day and making more disturbing sexual and offensive comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 In April, LaRose met with her supervisor, Ben Goldsmith, and described Smith's harassing calls. She expressed her concerns about the calls and the fact that Smith would not stop calling despite her demand that he do so. LaRose stated that she thought she needed to get off the case. Goldsmith \"said 'Okay,' in an irritated, dismissive, angry, impatient tone.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 177. A few days later after giving the matter some thought, LaRose told Goldsmith that she would try to finish the case because she was almost done with the representation. Goldsmith again said \"Okay.\" CP at 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 After that initial conversation, LaRose repeatedly went to Goldsmith and told him that the calls were continuing and getting worse and that she was concerned and worried about them. But she did not request that she should be taken off the case. And neither Goldsmith nor anyone else offered to reassign the case to another attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 In May, Smith's calls were continuing at the same rate. LaRose also received a handwritten letter from Smith with intrusive and sexually motivated content that frightened her. On May 24, LaRose met with Goldsmith and Leo Hamaji, another supervisor, to discuss the letter and Smith's obsessive and offensive communications with her. Goldsmith and Hamaji did not remove LaRose from the case, relieve her from the obligation to be in frequent contact with Smith, or take steps to stop Smith from\n   contacting her. LaRose also did not ask to be removed from the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 On June 4, LaRose met again with Hamaji about the unwanted harassing phone calls. She described the nature of the calls, told him that they were becoming more inappropriate, and stated that she was having trouble sleeping. Hamaji told LaRose to ignore the calls. The constant offensive calls continued through June.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 In July 2013, LaRose sought permission from the superior court to withdraw from representation of Smith pursuant to PDA policy when Smith requested a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. LaRose was allowed to withdraw on July 26. By the end of July, Smith's calls were continuing and escalating. LaRose went to Goldsmith at least three times and informed him that the calls were continuing. Twice he said nothing, and the third time he said, \"I don't know - call the cops.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Smith continued to make offensive calls and comments after LaRose's representation ended. He pursued contact with LaRose inside and outside the office. Smith was released from custody in November 2013 and\n   began following and making contact with LaRose in public. And the incessant calls continued. LaRose let Hamaji know that the unwanted sexual calls at work had not stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 LaRose estimated that she received over 1,000 calls from Smith between March 2013 and February 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 In February 2014, Smith jumped out at LaRose in the parking garage, left lingerie on her car, left literature in her mailbox, and came repeatedly to her house. He hid in her backyard, appeared at her bedroom window in the middle of the night, and broke a bedroom window. He sent messages about seeing LaRose, her daughter, and a man who came to her home. LaRose sent emails to her County supervisors detailing these contacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Smith finally was arrested on February 21 and was charged with felony stalking. LaRose testified as the complaining\n   witness at his trial. Smith was tried and convicted in January 2015 and was sentenced to seven years in confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 LaRose experienced a high level of stress and anxiety due to Smith's stalking behavior. She ultimately was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD. She was first diagnosed with PTSD in March 2015. LaRose requested medical leave in 2015 because her work continued to provoke stress and anxiety. The County granted her request. The County eventually terminated LaRose in 2017 when she was unable to continue working as a public defender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    LaRose Lawsuit and Dismissal of Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 LaRose filed a lawsuit against PDA and the County, claiming that they had violated the WLAD by failing to provide a non-hostile work environment free of harassment and engaging in other discriminatory conduct. The County and PDA both filed motions to dismiss under CR 12(b)(6), arguing that they could not be liable as a matter of law for Smith's harassing conduct. The trial court granted the motions and dismissed LaRose's claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 LaRose subsequently filed an amended complaint, asserting claims for a violation of the special relationship duty to provide a safe workplace for employees, negligent infliction of emotional distress, disability discrimination, and a number of other claims in addition to a hostile work environment claim. PDA filed a motion to dismiss, arguing among other things that the WLAD claims already had been dismissed, the negligence claims were barred by the IIA, and there could be no disability discrimination claim against PDA because LaRose had no disability while she was employed by PDA. The trial court dismissed the hostile work environment and disability discrimination claims against PDA, but it denied the motion with regard to the negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 The County and PDA later filed summary judgment motions with regard to LaRose's remaining claims, arguing\n   that the IIA barred the negligence claims. They claimed that the IIA bar applied because LaRose's PTSD and other mental conditions were caused by individual traumatic events and therefore constituted an industrial injury that was compensable under the IIA. They submitted the deposition testimony of Dr. Stanley Shyn, LaRose's treating psychologist, who testified that certain conduct of Smith constituted traumatic events that were sufficient to support her PTSD diagnosis. The County also argued that summary judgment was appropriate on LaRose's disability discrimination claim against the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 In opposition, LaRose argued that her injury was not an occupational injury compensable under the IIA. She presented declarations from Dr. Shyn, and a physician, Dr. Lawrence Wilson, who stated that her PTSD was caused by the cumulative effect of being stalked by Smith rather than any single event. LaRose also argued that the IIA did not bar her claims under RCW 51.24.020 because PDA and the County knew that her injury was certain to occur. Finally, LaRose argued that sufficient evidence supported her disability discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 The trial court granted the summary judgment motions and dismissed LaRose's remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 The County also filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of\n   vicarious liability. The trial court denied the County's motion and ruled as a matter of law that the County was vicariously liable for the actions of PDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b629 LaRose appeals the trial court's orders dismissing her hostile work environment, negligence, and disability discrimination claims. The County cross-appeals the trial court's ruling that the County is vicariously liable for PDA's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A.

HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b634 LaRose argues that the trial court erred by ruling as a matter of law that PDA and the County could not be liable under the WLAD for the harassing behavior of a nonemployee. She argues that the County and PDA were directly liable for the hostile work environment because PDA and the County knew about the harassment and failed to take adequate corrective action. We agree that under the circumstances here, PDA and the County may be subject to liability on a hostile work environment claim based on harassment of their employee LaRose by a nonemployee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1. Legal Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b635 The WLAD states that \"practices of discrimination against any [Washington] inhabitants ... are a matter of state concern\" and that \"such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of [Washington] inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state.\" RCW 49.60.010. In addition, RCW 49.60.030 states that the right to be free from discrimination is a \"civil right,\" which includes the right to hold employment without discrimination. And RCW 49.60.020 states, \"The provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b636 RCW 49.60.180(3) establishes that it is an unfair practice for an employer \"[t]o discriminate against any person in compensation or in other terms or conditions of employment\n   because of ... sex.\" Under RCW 49.60.030(2), a person discriminated against in violation of the WLAD may bring a civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b637 One form of a sex discrimination claim is a hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Antonius v.

Liberally construed, these broad provisions of the WLAD support a rule that employers may be subject to liability for harassment of their employees in the workplace, even harassment by nonemployees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b659 We adopt the federal rule and conclude that a nonemployee's harassment of an employee in the workplace will be imputed to an employer if the employer \"(a) authorized, knew, or should have known of the harassment and (b) failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate corrective action.\"\n   <em>\n    Glasgow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1134123\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/103/401/#p406\">\n    103 Wash.2d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=693%20P.2d%20708\">\n    693 P.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we reverse the trial court's ruling that as a matter of law PDA and the County could not be liable under the WLAD for the harassing behavior of Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   3. PDA Liability on\n   <em>\n    Glasgow\n   </em>\n   Elements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b660 PDA argues that even if LaRose can assert a hostile work environment claim based on Smith's harassment, the trial court properly dismissed that claim against PDA under the facts of this case. PDA contends that during the time it employed LaRose (until June 30, 2013), there was no evidence that would create a genuine issue of fact regarding element three or element four of a\n   <em>\n    Glasgow\n   </em>\n   hostile work environment claim. We disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b661 First, PDA argues that LaRose did not present sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment regarding the third element of the\n   <em>\n    Glasgow\n   </em>\n   test, that the harassment was sufficiently pervasive to affect the conditions of her employment before June 30, 2013. Factors for the court to consider in determining if a hostile work environment claim affects the terms and conditions of employment are the frequency and severity of the discriminatory conduct, whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating or a mere offensive utterance, and whether the conduct\n   unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\n   <em>\n    Alonso v.

The calls continued with the same frequency in May and June and were becoming more inappropriate. And in May, Smith sent LaRose a letter with sexual content that frightened her. We conclude that this evidence creates a genuine issue of fact that the harassment affected the conditions of LaRose's employment before June 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b663 Second, PDA argues that LaRose did not present sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment regarding the fourth element of the\n   <em>\n    Glasgow\n   </em>\n   test - imputation of harassment to PDA - because LaRose did not present evidence showing that PDA failed to take adequate corrective action after learning of the harassment. PDA relies on the fact that Goldsmith said, \"Okay\" when LaRose asked to be removed from Smith's case and that LaRose later decided to remain on the case. However, PDA made no affirmative efforts to do anything about the harassment once they became aware of it. We conclude that the evidence creates a genuine issue of fact whether PDA failed to take adequate corrective action after learning of the harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   4. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b664 We hold that LaRose can assert a hostile work environment claim against PDA and the County based on Smith's harassment of her. Smith's harassment of LaRose will be imputed to PDA and the County and they will be liable if they \"(a) authorized, knew, or should have known of the harassment and (b) failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate corrective action.\"\n   <em>\n    Glasgow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1134123\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/103/401/#p406\">\n    103 Wash.2d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=693%20P.2d%20708\">\n    693 P.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b665 Here, LaRose has presented evidence that creates genuine issues of fact on these imputation requirements regarding both PDA and the County. There is evidence that both had notice of the harassment while they employed LaRose and whether they took\n   adequate corrective action will be a question of fact for the trier of fact. In addition, LaRose presented evidence that creates genuine issues of fact on the other contested element of a hostile work environment claim regarding PDA, and the County does not argue that there are no genuine issues of fact regarding those elements. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's dismissal of LaRose's hostile work environment claim against PDA and the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   C. NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS - IIA BAR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b666 LaRose argues that the trial court erred by ruling that the IIA barred her negligence claims - breach of a special relationship duty of care and negligent infliction of emotional distress - because a genuine issue of fact exists whether her PTSD and related injuries constituted a compensable \"injury\" under the IIA. She also argues that the IIA bar is inapplicable to her negligence claims under the intentional injury provision of RCW 51.24.020.

First, RCW 51.08.100 states that the traumatic happening must produce an \"immediate or prompt result.\" Here, LaRose certainly was upset immediately by Smith's harassment. But she was not diagnosed with PTSD until March 2015. Even if certain singular traumatic events in 2013 and 2014 could be identified, there is a question of fact whether they produced an immediate result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b683 Second, both Dr. Shyn and Dr. Wilson opined that no one harassing event could be singled out from the others as the cause of LaRose's PTSD. These opinions arguably are inconsistent with Dr. Shyn's deposition testimony that certain conduct of Smith constituted traumatic events that were sufficient to support her PTSD diagnosis. But they create a question of fact whether one or more single traumatic events as defined in WAC 296-14-300(2) caused LaRose's PTSD and other mental conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b684 Because genuine questions of fact exist, we hold that the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that LaRose suffered an industrial injury under RCW 51.08.100. Accordingly, we remand for the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   c. Effect of LaRose's IIA Claims - Collateral Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b685 LaRose filed a workers' compensation claim for psychological injury in April 2016. She had been diagnosed with PTSD in March 2015. Under the IIA, an injury claim must be filed within one year and an occupational disease claim must be filed within two\n   years after the injury occurred. RCW 51.28.050 (injury); RCW 51.28.055 (disease).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b686 DLI denied LaRose's injury claim because it was not filed within a year after the injury occurred and denied an occupational disease claim because LaRose's condition was not an occupational disease under RCW 51.08.142 and WAC 296-14-300. LaRose appealed DLI's decision to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (BIIA). On appeal, LaRose stipulated that \"this claim is brought exclusively as an occupational disease, and not as an 'injury' within the meaning of RCW 51.08.100.\" CP at 2884.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b687 The BIIA affirmed DLI's decision.

Further, LaRose appealed the BIIA's determination to superior court, which apparently ruled that she is entitled to a hearing on her IIA claim.

PDA Liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6101 LaRose claims that PDA was negligent in assigning her to represent Smith given his history of stalking. PDA argues that it had no reason to foresee that Smith would harass or stalk LaRose. However, the evidence LaRose presented that Smith had a\n   history of stalking women and that he made inappropriate comments to another public defender that caused PDA to assign a prior case to a male is sufficient to create a question of fact on this issue. And PDA does not argue that there is no question of fact regarding proximate cause on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6102 In addition, LaRose also claims that PDA was negligent in not removing her from Smith's cases once it\n   learned of the harassment. PDA argues that it agreed to reassign the case after receiving notice of the harassment, but LaRose opted to continue representing Smith. However, given PDA's duty to protect LaRose, a genuine issue of fact exists whether PDA should have removed LaRose from the case regardless of LaRose's wishes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6103 PDA also argues that LaRose cannot establish that its failure to remove LaRose from the case proximately caused her harm. PDA claims that there is no way to determine whether removing LaRose from the case would have prevented Smith from stalking her. However, the harassment only started in March 2013. The evidence showed that Smith's harassment continued to escalate and become more inappropriate over the next four months while LaRose continued to represent him. On the other hand, Smith did not continue to harass the prior public defender when she was removed from the case immediately after Smith made inappropriate comments to her. It is reasonable to infer for purposes of summary judgment that Smith's harassment would have stopped if PDA also had immediately removed LaRose from Smith's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6104 We hold that PDA is not entitled to summary judgment on the merits of LaRose's negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   c. County Liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6105 LaRose claims that the County was negligent in failing to remove her from the case after the County became her employer on July 1, 2013. The County argues that LaRose cannot establish any breach of the duty of care because the testimony of her liability expert should be excluded and without that testimony LaRose presented no evidence of breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the County knew when it became LaRose's employer that Smith had been harassing her for three months. Given the County's duty to protect\n   LaRose, a genuine issue of fact exists whether it should have removed LaRose from the case in July 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \u00b6106 There also may be a question of fact regarding whether the County should have done more to protect LaRose once Smith was released from incarceration in November 2013 and his stalking escalated. During that time, LaRose let Hamaji know that the unwanted sexual calls at work had not stopped. And LaRose sent emails to County management detailing Smith's stalking of her home. However, the record does not show what steps, if any, the County took to protect LaRose from this conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6107 We hold that the County is not entitled to summary judgment on the merits of LaRose's negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   D. DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \u00b6108 LaRose argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her disability discrimination claim.

However, LaRose's work-related stress does not qualify as an impairment under former RCW 49.60.040(25)(c)(ii) (2009).

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   a. Applicability of\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b6125 LaRose argues that the County is vicariously liable for the conduct of PDA because the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   that PDA employees were employees of the County. But\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   is not directly applicable here. The court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   was limited to the context of retirement benefits eligibility. The court expressly stated that whether a public defender was a County employee for PERS purposes was different than whether the County was vicariously liable for employment discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4018259\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/172/299/\">\n    172 Wash.2d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=258%20P.3d%2020\">\n    258 P.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b6126 The Supreme Court has stated that a test to determine the nature of the relationship between a principal\n   and a subordinate party, such as the right of control test, may reach two different results under the same facts depending on the purpose of deploying\n   the test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher v. City of Seattle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1036844\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/62/800/#p803\">\n    62 Wash.2d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803-05,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20P.2d%20852\">\n    384 P.2d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). That is the situation here. Although the inquiries into whether a public defender is entitled to PERS benefits and whether the County is liable for the PDA's conduct may both employ the right-of-control test, the two inquiries are distinct. Therefore, a conclusion in one context that the County exerted a right of control over PDA does not compel a conclusion that the County had a right of control here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b6127 We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   does not control the vicarious liability determination. Therefore, we apply the right of control test to the facts here independent of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   b. Control Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   \u00b6128 Here, the County presented evidence that before July 2013, the supervision of attorneys, case assignments, and issues of case management were directed by PDA employees operating under PDA policies, without the County's involvement. LaRose does not dispute these facts. And LaRose presents no argument on this issue other than that\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   controls. Even taken in the light most favorable to LaRose, these facts support the conclusion that the County did not control the manner of performance of PDA employees prior to July 2013. And there is no indication that the County had the\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to control PDA's performance of its day-to-day duties. For vicariously liability purposes in the context of employment-based claims, we hold that PDA must be treated as an independent contractor rather than as an agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   \u00b6129 We conclude that the County is not vicariously liable for the conduct of PDA prior to July 2013. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in denying the County's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   F. ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6130 LaRose requests attorney fees on appeal under RCW 49.60.030. We may grant an award of reasonable attorney fees under RAP 18.1(a) if allowed under the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \u00b6131 A prevailing party may recover reasonable attorney fees on appeal under RCW 49.60.030(2).\n   <em>\n    Bright v.

However, although LaRose substantially prevails on appeal, the prevailing party in the case ultimately will be determined on remand.
